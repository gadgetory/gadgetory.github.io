Apple earpods they came back into my
life I've been using the air pods and
kind of enjoying it they're wildly
successful you see them out in the world
other manufacturers you know they're
entering the space this is the latest
incarnation of the fully wireless
Samsung earbud product has a couple of
features that haven't been seen before
prime my favorite one is the fact that
this entire setup can charge from any
phone that supports wireless charge
sharing because this is a Samsung
product and this is a Samsung phone
there's also some interplay there that's
a bit smoother than it might otherwise
be with a third-party pair of earbuds or
puds
but once you're into the app this is
where I think they have a bit of an
advantage over the air pods they're
super configurable here we can see the
battery life of each individual units
you can use one independently of the
other
you can keep one of these guys charging
in the case while listening to the other
one there's some different equalizer
settings here for a bass boost soft
dynamic clear and so on you can manage
how these things deal with notifications
they do have touch pads on the side
unlike the air pods these have
interchangeable ear tips and ear hooks
as well look at all those options the
air pod you've seen it before doesn't
fit that far into the ear canal for some
people this fits really well others it
won't stay in their ears these on the
other hand are gonna be a bit more
predictable because they sit further in
the ear canal and they have that
secondary rubber plasticky component
they should just be a bit more secure in
there considering the way that they're
designed air pod is a bit taller but
also slightly less chunky than the
galaxy bud so people want to know hey
which one should I get considering that
you can use either on multiple platforms
they do work as Bluetooth headsets you
can use the air pods on Android you
could use the Galaxy buds on iOS within
the app there's also a find my earbuds
button so that'll track these down these
things could be pretty easy to lose I
mean they are tiny also there's a pretty
cool ambient sound option I can actually
elevate the volume of
ambient sound a sound around me so it'll
be amplified into my ear so I can hear
my surroundings while I'm listening to
music podcast audiobook and so on now
you can toggle that all the way down so
that it's muted you know what's going on
around me is muted you have ambient if
you're on the bike you're cycling you
need to hear if if a car honks its horn
or something
this can really amplify your
surroundings of course it's not on the
air pods there's also a voice focus
feature in there so this looks for
voices specifically and allows them to
cut through that particular frequency
range I find this to be useful from time
to time now the way that the touchpad
works you can tap to play or pause a
track double tap to play the next track
answer or end a phone call triple tap to
play the previous track and touch and
hold to use a user configurable users
choice you could have that launched
something specifically do something
specifically and that's user
configurable that's nice now that I have
it for quick ambient sound I'm gonna
touch and hold and see if I can lighten
up the surroundings here we go oh wow
that's cool it toggles ambient mode
while you're holding your finger on the
touch pad I'm in ambient right now I can
totally hear my conversation hear my own
voice now do I look a little strange
doing this quite possibly but the
question you all have is like how do
they stack up against the air pods now
as you guys know I'm an s10 user this is
the device that's currently in my pocket
so the effectiveness of either of these
earbuds it has to be in correlation to
this particular device we talked about
some advantages within the app who knows
I might be willing to give up those
extra features in exchange for
potentially better sound I'm not really
sure we'll start with the galaxy buds I
want to make sure I've got maximum
volume okay so now I know I've got max
volume a little sample mm-hmm okay now
we're in soft right now dynamic clear
bass hmm
okay I'm wondering right now if the
people that have tested these already
had them in full volume or not cuz I
read some of those things that you read
and that was the experience I was having
until I made sure the buds themselves
were max volume and the phone was max
volume now there's a lot more thump way
more bass our people doing it wrong
it's a headphone I'm hearing instruments
I was gone for a minute did you trick
sort of I've heard better kind of feel
like I got to do this exact same track
right now on the air pods like right now
without further ado hurry up hurry up
hurry up way less isolation
I hear the the fan on the camera here we
go beginning you know neither are
blowing my brains out you know obviously
I've tried some very expensive
headphones in this spot in this seat
right here we've done it together you
and I Jack Kirk and whoever else happens
to be behind me on any given day these
are tiny dental floss situations look at
them in terms of sound I think I can say
based on that quick little test right
there the buds there's a bit more thump
to it maybe my expectations were too
high either probably closer to this
performance then they are to like a
full-on pair of headphone performance
that said the most striking difference
for me between the two is the fit and
the feel right in the sound seal when
you put these on you feel isolated but
there's a drawback to that I noticed
they're in my ears a little bit more
this I don't even feel it this is a kind
of a tighter feel if I had to choose
this is a bit more comfortable for my
particular ear canal and that's part of
the reason I think I keep reaching for
the air pods in the first place not
because they sound the best but because
you just don't even notice you're
wearing them that could be a good thing
or a bad thing
neither are going to be an amazing audio
experience but really these products are
about convenience so evaluating them on
convenience you have to give certain
points to the new Samsung product
because of the fact that it can charge
wirelessly and off of the phone itself
also the app gives you more
configurability also another thing worth
noting the galaxy buds are a bit cheaper
than the air pods though that's not much
of a surprise that is a hard pick I
really don't know I mean it might be so
simple as if you're on on samsung or on
Android you might go for these and if
you're on iOS you'll probably go for
these just for the easier pairing across
devices oh it's a hard decision I'd say
if I'm about to do some kind of physical
activity if I'm going for a jog or
something I don't jog but like let's say
I did I will probably reach for these
ones it's just a bit more confidence in
the fit but if it's just if it's in an
environment like around the house I
she really liked the idea of not feeling
the thing in your ear as stupid as that
looks you forget that it's there I
already have so many great sounding
headphones if I want to get down to
business with music I think I'll
probably still reach for these more
because of that factor and then also
keep by Sony headphones the dedicated
over ear headphones with the noise
cancellation everything else keep those
for the discerning listening but if I
didn't have those other headphones and I
needed something that could isolate
better than the air pods and I can only
have one pair I only had 130 bucks for
one pair I probably go for these it's
only a one pair of headphones I probably
would choose these over these but in
conjunction with a really nice pair that
you use sometimes this is the I don't
even notice I'm wearing them headset
that's the bottom line</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
