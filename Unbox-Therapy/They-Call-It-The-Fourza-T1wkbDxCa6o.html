another video but before we get into
today's episode I want to give a shout
out to a cool show I got to take part in
it's called uploaded it's on the
Starbucks double-shot channel they came
into the studio went behind the scenes
asked me the hard-hitting questions and
came out with something cool so I'll
drop a link in the description so you
can go check out that video after you're
done watching this one charging stop
it's a part of your life you do it every
day you plug you unplug yury plug your D
plug it's a lot of plugin and to be
honest with you I'm not happy with the
way that most of the world is doing it
it includes you now granted there's this
magical thing called wireless charging
but you know and I know we're not there
yet so until that day we need some cool
contraptions to make are charging
lifestyle just a little bit better a
little bit more refined this thing came
in they've got a little mini system for
charging up multiple devices now if
you're like me you've got a spot in your
house where you've got a bunch of things
lined up maybe iPads and so on this
thing aims to be your charging hub so
you can plug and unplug in one place 2.4
amps per port a total of a 48 watt
outputs you can charge a bunch of stuff
at once apparently can do some kind of
standby mode when it has fully charged
device it's also called Forza which is
kind of like Forza the racing game it
might not be as cool as a race car but
let's try to fool people into thinking
it's just as fast you know any time they
do italic letters it's for speed it's so
fast at the left the letters are leaning
over can we get inside the box please
thank you Jeff whoa I like the you know
what it does look fast that is
cool-looking
this is gonna be useful in the office
that's what it looks like on the side
here you have one two three four
different USB ports so no external brick
this just goes in here ooh nice little
short flat cables
I love the right cable for the right job
so these are micro USB and as you can
see they kind of just go into the port's
here and then up into whatever gadget it
is that you
want to have charging on here if you did
want to charge up some other device like
an iPhone or something that uses
lightning USBC and so on you would just
swap this out also inside the package
here are some 3m strips place those in
here that makes sense so the device is
kind of have a soft footing in there let
me go ahead and install one real quick
lay it down there you go Wow if you take
a phone or something yeah it's gonna be
a little bit more gonna stick a little
bit better did you ever watch a movie
back in the day called The Commitments
mom then darling my baby oh you wanna go
and now OOP moment of truth here let's
get some juice for these thirsty gadgets
no silica gel for Jack today
unfortunately the man's gonna starve
instead I'll give him a twist tie
equally appetizing oh you wanna do so
what did i do I used three of the
included micro flat cables and then I
also got a short lightning cable as well
for an iOS device action I'm gonna put
this one at the back for the iPad Mini
and we are going to juice up what is
this an s6 we can do the dance as six on
the front what we have here s7 edge even
nicer that's going to go second follow
it up with the LG v10 we got two
lightning bolts now and then lastly the
biggest one of the bunch and iPad Mini
look at that you could be proud of that
all your gadgets with a nice little home
I need my iPad right now boom today it's
all about the s7 edge boom to be quite
honest with you guys in an environment
like this where we have gadgets galore
it is so hard to keep them all charged
so we need an abundance of places that
they go and even in your life if you're
the kind of person who has a lot of
gadgets or maybe a family with a bunch
of different gadgets in the household
this could be a place where everybody
could drink some juice when they're
thirsty if you know what I'm saying
right
