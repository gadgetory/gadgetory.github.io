that battery life sports LeBron James
are you gonna recommend these over air
pods are these better than air pods yes
or no what yeah all right it's been a
long time actually since I looked at a
pair of beats this is the latest from
the beats brand of course now in the
Apple family and because it had some
benefits to this particular product it
actually behaves a lot like ear pods I
do have some air pods here these are the
black ones from a recent video these are
done up by color where no you can't get
them in black but it kind of makes sense
for this comparison since the power
beats Pro are in black these are gonna
be a little bit more expensive than
Apple's air pods and they have a
slightly different design I think this
will be popular for athletes people who
want to have the ear hook on there have
a bit more of a secure fit battery up to
nine hours of Wireless play 24 hours
with the charging case sweat and
water-resistant adjustable secure fit
and on ear controls one thing I like
before I even pop this open they put the
controls on both earbuds so you can
trigger play pause from either side
whichever is right for you so you don't
need to remember was that button on the
left or on the right now of course with
the Beats products pretty much all of
them the expectation is kind of premium
price point like it's 250 bucks so keep
that in mind the case is bigger it's
quite a bit bigger than air pods it's
way bigger it's like six of these air
pots five maybe you pull out the earbud
it fits over the ear like this and you
have interchangeable ear tips as well
this has become the standard for
athletic style earphones and for good
reason you want something lightweight
you want something secure and you don't
want something huge and you want
something sweat resistant well this has
all those components and attributes so I
think eventually you're gonna see a lot
of these things at the gym you're gonna
see a lot of these things on the
basketball court this is the wireless
charge case there's two contact points
on the inside there's also a button on
the inside yes it's a pairing button of
course if
you have an iPhone when you pop this
open it's gonna it's gonna register to
pair immediately or at least is gonna
ask you to register to pair because this
product is using the h1 chip so to pair
it you're just gonna pop this open don't
remove the earbuds and then it'll prompt
you on your device if you do have an
Android device these will work as well
you're just gonna need to press and hold
the pairing button and then pair it like
you would any other Bluetooth device so
yes even though beads is part of the
Apple brand this will work with Android
devices and various other Bluetooth
devices now the port on the back it's
not USB type-c so staying true to the
Apple branding like the air pods this is
actually a lightning connector a black
USB cable to charge it up a lightning
connector there so kind of unfortunate
if you have a lot of USB type-c
components this has I phone users first
their front of mine and it makes sense
because these power beats Pro they're
gonna be sold in Apple stores are gonna
be they're gonna move a lot of Units on
Apple's website so they're gonna take
care of iPhone users first five minute
charge equals 1.5 hours of play here's a
different ear tip options this is
important especially for $250 pair of
headphones you kind of have to have this
you should have this it's gonna be in
the ear canal it's gonna fit a bit
deeper than the then the air pod does
usually what that means is you you're
gonna have better bass reproduction
because you get a better seal in the ear
canal that you just can't achieve with
the air pod but it will also mean that
you know putting this thing on and
taking it off it's a bit more of a
headache it's not quite as smooth so
just keep that in mind as well but that
looks like the standard medium connector
they've also included this two-stage
adapter if you look at that just before
I try these things out I think it's kind
of important to address the size I think
some people are gonna think that's a big
container so air pods
tiny little dental floss situation that
is obviously it's nothing you don't even
notice it it's got a barely there kind
of situation if you try to do that with
the power beats the latest power beats
Pro what's gonna happen I mean you're
gonna see it but it's doable it's not
terrible actually it's heavier you're
not gonna want it there all day
headphones over here phone ready to go
it open and look at this this is really
the benefit of this cohesiveness if
you're an iPhone user you're really
gonna appreciate this and how's the
install let's go ahead and try oh I got
a little audio tone played in the ear
that's the install I mean obviously it
feels super secure so in this case play
pause is the beats logo button right
here it's a physical button it's not a
tap it's not capacitive I like the idea
of a physical button saying goes for
volume which is on the top here
hopefully Kirk can see that this is
volume up and down I can tell already
though before I even play music that the
seal here is far more substantial in the
ear canal
I'm sealed off a little bit from the
rest of the world so therefore that the
experience is more isolating that might
be what you want you want to drown out
all the coffee-shop noise and/or the
noise at the gym and things like this
you can understand why you would want
that but then there's the argument for
the convenience factor of not
necessarily fully closing off the whole
world which is what happens with air
pods that said I'm going one layer
deeper here a lot of people make the
argument not with those you end up
having to crank them up even louder
which is ends up being worse for your
hearing because you're trying to drown
out ambience with more volume instead of
by sealing off your your ear canals and
then you can feed it less volume protect
your hearing a little bit better you
hear me Kirk I'm gonna put hit play and
then get lost for a minute here
these are hip-hop headphones like that's
the thing you know they really shine
when you feed when you feed them some
bass they want to eat some bass you hit
it with some hip-hop and he's it's
thumping I mean he's doing something
that the air pods can't do I'd say I see
less of a significant improvement with
kind of classic songs where I was kind
of thinking I was hoping for maybe a
little bit more like where maybe there
wasn't quite as much oomph
but that stuff was mixed differently
back then that wasn't they weren't they
weren't too mixing for a subwoofer and
and these things they really replicate
the feeling of an actual subwoofer in
like a car stereo like it thumps in your
head when you feed it some hip-hop I'm
sure it'd be the same for a lot of pop
music modern music I think these things
are really tuned for modern music based
on this experience here but there's more
to this package I suppose like when you
think about what this thing is and who
it's for like my feeling has become just
just in this this short exposure to this
particular earbud is it's like a package
deal type of thing I get it the way that
people think about beats the brand
specifically it's like oh I'm gonna pay
a lot of money there for that logo and
yes there is definitely that you get
this logo right here look at that you
get to wear that around boom you're
gonna pay a few dollars period that's
kind of the origin story of the brand
you won't put dr. Dre's name on
something prior to being acquired by
Apple it's gonna cost you a few bucks
and that's just been the case for a
while so it's never really been about
the value proposition it's never really
been about the best value for money it's
been about a package deal of style sound
primarily in the bass department and a
convenience factor which in this case is
obviously a step better if you happen to
be on iOS and you can utilize that H
chip just like you can with the air pods
this is gonna be a popular headphone
period I'm confident in saying it's
gonna be a popular headphone there's
just there's just such a huge percentage
of the market that wants something just
as convenient as I mean I'm just
speculating right now like listen to me
talking here I'm just guessing
but I assumed there's a percentage of
the market that wants an air pod-like
experience with something that will
actually stay in their ears with
something that has more durability to it
with something they feel like they can
run around jog around bike around be
more active with because there is a
slight lack of confidence with the air
pod even if it fits in your ear keep in
mind once again I got the black air pod
here color where custom air pod it just
it's in there I don't feel like I'm
gonna lose it but if I got bumped or you
know took a I don't know if I was
playing basketball I would not want to
have this headphone in this on the other
hand that would be I feel like I could
wear this on the ice playing hockey and
that would stay in not that I would do
that that would be a crazy I did to try
to play hockey with this on but like
that's why I'm trying to get it so it's
gonna have the distribution it's going
to be in the Apple stores it's gonna
have the advantage of the enhanced
performance on the iOS side they're
gonna sell a lot of them it's
unfortunate it's got to be $250 but with
the air pods already being as expensive
as they are it's kind of like these have
to be more money than that it's
imperative and I guess maybe they could
have been 200 but they're 250 cuz their
beats let's just be honest but they're
still gonna sell a bunch of them because
they're gonna deliver a sound that a lot
of people are looking for that they're
looking for that extended low end that
enhancement on the bass side and they're
doing it in an overall package deal
that's quite you know I'm gonna be
honest that's attractive to me there's
nothing weird going on even the logo
itself is somewhat subdued at least on
this black model you don't see it unless
it hits the reflection otherwise it's a
matte finish it's pretty subdued you got
the different ear tips they're gonna
sell a boatload of them for the average
person should you spend 250 you could
find a better value out there but I know
based on the experience I've had with
the with the air pods themselves there
is something to be said there is a value
associated with the ease of use and
integration on the iOS side like that
there's an extended benefit there that's
hard to put a price on specifically so
from that standpoint it's like where
else are you going to get this pack
where else are you going to get in h1
chip experience with this kind of
battery life with this kind of profile
in something that isn't the air pods
that's a step better than the air pods
like no offense to the air pods but they
leave you wishing for a little bit more
in a sound Department
what would I mean no offense to the air
bus do the air pods have feelings no
they don't have feelings I said in a
previous video when I did the video on
the air pods I'm a guy I'm into
headphones I got very expensive
headphones they're all over the place
but I just don't find myself reaching
for them as much because they're less
convenient in some way whether they're
huge or there's a cable associated they
just don't go in the pocket they there's
various ones that are less likely to be
charged this package deal here proved to
be so convenient
they even though I had way better
sounding headphones I found myself
reaching for these and this is an
extension of that this is the next step
the convenience factor here it goes down
a bit you get the bigger package they
don't pop in on in and out of your ears
quite as easily but they still have some
of that origin story some of those
convenient elements that come with this
and for the time being that remains an
exclusive item for Apple branded and of
course beats branded via Apple products
so that's something to keep in mind I
think they're gonna sell a bunch of them
if you want a slick package if you're
happy with the branding if you want to
rep the B on the side if you like a lot
of bass you can be happy you got to pay
to play in this department
no jokes they don't let you in the front
door without 250 to be clear you hear me
Kirk 250 that's the ticket to get in the
door alright front row seats Raptors in
the playoffs game 6 coming soon let's go
