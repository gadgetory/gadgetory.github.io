version of a monster a battery monster
this is the largest battery smartphone
que 10,000 pro and the 10,000 in the
model name stands for a 10,000 milliamp
battery that's inside of here they're
claiming that's like a week's worth of
battery that of course depends on how
you use your device so the display is
5.5 inches it's got Android 7 on it dual
SIM card tray expandable storage through
micro sd though the version in front of
me already has 32 gigabytes of storage
pre-installed the second version of this
particular phone without the pro was the
initial version now this one a little
bit more slender oh look at that they
think they've included the little pouch
will they do there you go the pouch is
all yours now you need a pouch like that
for a device of this stature that is a
beast oh my goodness is hefty now it has
a case pre-installed free case why not a
fingerprint sensor on the back of the
device cameras in that location there
this is all metal it's cool to the touch
its plastic that plate but it feels kind
of like leather capacitive buttons here
at the bottom front-facing camera
sim card tray on this side a 3.5
millimeter jack only micro USB on the
bottom wish it was Type C especially
with the battery of this capacity but
anyhow it's not a super expensive phone
priced around 170 bucks depending on
where you look a glass screen protector
and then another soft screen protector
as well so I don't know they're just
giving you options here micro USB 2
female USB port for connecting other
devices to this device share media or to
take advantage of that giant battery the
giant power brick they say fast charge
on it but I assume you're still looking
at a couple hours to charge this thing
up it's just a giant battery this thing
does not move around at all when you
type on it got so much starting this to
it it's like a tank okay let's go ahead
and add the fingerprint here we go
gives you a little vibration says it's
got it okay cool so this display it's
nothing fancy it's not all that or
anything like that not like you would
expect it to be at this particular price
it just looks like Android 7 there
by that yes it is pre-installed there's
not a ton of bloatware if any now the
camera on this pro version is supposed
to be better than the previous k 10000
so let's go ahead and check that out the
green plan that is not real the shutter
is not instantaneous but it's better
than some other inexpensive phones I've
looked at not terrible for a falling
that's a hundred and seventy bucks so
device locked ah actually not bad not
the fastest that I've tried ever but
reasonable now there's also video mode
to which I believe is capable of 1080p
1080p video using the K 10000 Pro you
could probably shoot video for days on
this thing maybe not days and as usual
the selfie test beauty or no beauty what
do you say not the best we've seen
selfie enthusiasts want something a
little more detailed but it's getting
the job done beyond the fact that it's
capable of becoming an object of self
defense it's also got this giant battery
in it you might use it for multimedia or
you might use this cable here to kind of
extend the life span of your other
devices I'll show you how that works
I can go ahead and plug any other USB
device into the K 10000 Pro and here is
a pixel and kaboom
10,000 extra milliamp hours for my
smartphone it's a cool feature okay
you're gonna be so popular you're the
guy with all the juice like you've
always wanted to be it's somebody who's
gonna be away from the wall or maybe
even any other person for a while if
it's a person who's an outdoors type
they go hunting or camping I'm kind of
curious about multimedia because maybe
you're on an airplane maybe you're going
to Tokyo alright if you're not plugging
in your smartphone and you try to watch
video on it the whole way you're done
you're dead and you're done now one
thing to mention here the straight-up
display that isn't OLED starts to feel
dated you know you can see how the glass
sits above it it just it feels a little
less vibrant less contrasty so that's
something to keep in mind so how does
video even look well let's find out
bring up some unbox therapy real quick a
recent video
oh the speakers a little bit mashed
potatos
let me turn up the clock 144p oh I died
a little inside a piece of me is now
gone forever if you are forced to watch
my videos in 144p i owe you something i
want to buy you lunch ok here alright
144p
squad i feel your pain let's boost this
up here 1080p the speaker is still
mashed potatoes and for those of you
that don't understand the terminology of
mashed potatoes scrambled eggs and so on
any type of food that is crunched up a
little bit you know good video actually
looks better than I expected to be
honest oh yeah go watch that video by
the way holy smokes
dual screen smartphones what year are we
living in back to the future Blade
Runner is it finally happening flying
cars Oh screams OH
kind of sucks if for a phone that is
this size they wouldn't put a better
speaker in it use the headphone jack who
is this phone for that is your question
of course it isn't so unusual and so
unique I think if it's for you you
probably know it in other words you're
the type of person where battery comes
first they wanted to knock your socks
off they wanted to take what you thought
was possible in a smart phone and just
go to another level which I kind of
respect so if you're the type of person
is away from an outlet for a while if
you're the type of person that wants to
use this thing to also charge up a bunch
of other devices because you just like
to share like that if you're on an
expedition might be for you as well
you had 10,000 milliamp hours at your
disposal how would you use it let me
