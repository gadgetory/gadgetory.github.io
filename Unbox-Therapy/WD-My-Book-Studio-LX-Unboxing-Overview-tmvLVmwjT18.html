product for you all
it's the my book studio LX from Western
Digital it's obviously an external hard
drive but it's got some unique features
that some other drives might not have of
course you pay for those features but
I'll go over them anyways the first and
maybe most important is it's got a
couple of different interfaces first
it's got USB 2.0 which you'd expect and
second of all it's got firewire 800
which makes it a little bit more unique
anybody who owns a Mac particularly a
newer model iMac or MacBook Pro will be
able to take advantage of this firewire
800 interface which is going to give you
significantly better transfer speed then
you'll get over USB 2.0 the other
feature that this Drive has that
differentiates it from what else is on
the market is a display now you might be
saying what the hell do I need to
display on my external hard drive for
and my answer to that would be you don't
know but seriously it could be
beneficial if your use case is similar
to mine where I've got a number of
different external hard drives and I'm
always wondering what I can fit where
then in this case I could just quickly
glance at this external and know right
away
how much capacity remains available
getting back to the unboxing the first
thing we pulled out was a mini USB to
USB cable second we've got a little bit
of paperwork from Western Digital and
we've got a couple more cables here
they're similar but slightly different
the first cable is firewire 800 to 400
and the next one is firewire 800 - 800
now the reason you might need to use the
800 to 400 is if you're using an older
Mac or any machine for that matter that
supports the 400 protocol but not the
800 keep in mind if you use that adapter
cable you're going to be clocked back to
400 speeds so there is a bit of a
trade-off although I would still
recommend using it as opposed to USB 2.0
if available to you
next we've got the power adapter which I
can't say much about other than it
powers it to fine that's right
major excitement there lastly we've got
the drive itself and something to
mention is I notice right away that
there is an image being displayed on the
display and I can't tell right now if
it's a dummy sticker or if it's actually
there I guess I'll find out one once I
get inside this plastic package here the
other thing to note is that the
construction on the drive is aluminum
and that's always a good thing
especially when you're dealing with hard
drives because they get hot so the
aluminum is gonna help to dissipate the
heat a lot better than plastic would
it's also gonna mean the drive is gonna
run quieter because the fans don't have
to constantly be revving so the first
thing I notice is that it's got some
vents around all sides with the
exception of the front side and I was
right it is actually displaying
something right now which tells me
there's probably some form of battery
backup inside the device so in the event
you power it down you're still gonna
have that display functioning so that's
pretty cool I wonder how long it lasts I
mean if they shipped it with it and it's
probably gonna last pretty long so I'm
assuming if you travel with your drives
or unplug them and put them on a shelf
it's still gonna display what's on there
and how much capacity remains here's a
look at the back of the device we've got
our power button two firewire 800 s USB
our DC in and a Kensington lock be sure
