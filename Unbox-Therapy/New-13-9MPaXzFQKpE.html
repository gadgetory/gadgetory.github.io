therapy and today we're taking a look at
the newly released 13-inch retina model
macbook pro if you guys love these
unboxing videos make sure to smash that
like button down below we are about to
hit 200,000 subscribers an incredible
figure but let's talk about this
unboxing first here we've got the new
thinner lighter more pixel packed
13-inch MacBook Pro the other older
model is still going to stick around you
can purchase it this one's a little bit
more expensive but you are getting all
those extra features that I just
mentioned in fact if you're interested
in pricing availability and even
detailed specifications I'm going to
drop a link in the description to the
product page for this model so the first
thing you're going to notice in the
unboxing besides the actual laptop is an
extension cable for your power adapter
here is the MagSafe power adapter which
does have a quick little change on the
tip it's now a little thinner and a
little bit wider this is the exact same
tip that the 15-inch retina model
MacBook Pro has I suppose the fact that
the laptop itself got thinner you're
going to get a slightly thinner MagSafe
no big deal
now you're also going to get apple's
usual paperwork here the first thing
you'll notice is there hello guide which
is basically just a quick start guide
it'll tell you how to get up and running
with your system it also outlines some
of the multi-touch gestures available to
you on apple's famous multi-touch
trackpad the next thing you'll notice
are the Apple stickers which are always
included followed by a cleaning cloth to
keep that new Retina display spic and
span free from dust fingerprints you
know the drill
so here's the actual unit the actual
laptop and as I said earlier the main
thing here or one of the big things is
the fact that it's so much thinner from
the previous generation 13-inch MacBook
Pro it's actually very close now both in
size and weight to the 13-inch MacBook
Air now it's going to really confuse
people who were interested in purchasing
the air now they've got a bit of a
dilemma whether or not to go for the pro
and add just a little bit of weight and
a lot more power
you've got apples beautiful big trackpad
as I said earlier followed by the usual
chiclet style keyboard that pretty much
every Apple MacBook has now MacBook Airs
you name it
you can see how the keys travel followed
by the fact that this one is backlit
similar to the 15-inch retina model you
can adjust the backlighting with those
two keys over there
you have your power button which is
actually a key it's right on the
keyboard no longer dedicated on the side
of the unit you'll find your Meg safe
port to thunderbolts a USB your
headphone jack and two microphones on
the other side of the unit is where
you'll find your SD card slot in HDMI
port very useful and another USB so very
simple there is no more optical drive
now the main story here is just how thin
this is here you can see it up against
an SD card and speaking of SD cards I
found some great deals on some SanDisk
Extreme cards I dropped the link in the
description if you guys want to check
those out the venting is similar to the
15-inch retina model it vents to the
bottom very small vents and it's
actually very quiet in terms of
operation though I haven't really
stressed it out yet this is just the
unboxing video of course here you can
see the setup I'm not going to make you
guys sit through the entire setup
process I'll be doing more videos about
this macbook pro 13 inch retina actually
if you guys have any suggestions things
you want to see me test on this
particular system let me know down in
the comments section I'll definitely
take those things into consideration as
you can see here the screen is
absolutely beautiful you've got the full
retina pixel density that the 15-inch
has but on a 13 inch form factor anyway
guys if you enjoyed this unboxing please

down below as it does help out a bunch
and as I said earlier if there's any
videos you want to see specifically
