watched the Apple Keynote the iPhone 10
the iPhone 8 and so on very exciting
everyone was pumped it was your usual
Apple lovefest
now there were a couple of developments
during this keynote
regarding the release date of the iPhone
10 which looks to be delayed from the
iPhone 8 but I think some of that has to
do with software and more specifically
this face unlock feature
I missed this moment the face unlock
demo went wrong course afterwards on my
Twitter everyone was hitting me up blue
did you see the demo the stock price of
Apple it dropped because the demo failed
it was it was a failure I've been
skeptical of the face unlock in general
for a while apple claims to be going a
different route so let's go ahead let's
see how they're describing their face
unlock and then well then we'll see the
failure your iPhone is locked until you
look at it and it recognizes you nothing
has ever been simpler more natural and
effortless okay here's my first issue
right here it's like simple and natural
and effortless
here's I've been talking to the guys
here in the studio after watching this
keynote it's actually not all that
natural because it often doesn't get the
face unlock from this range or this
angle instead you're kind of like this
you're blocking your view it to me it's
not that natural so they've got way more
sensors up here in the section the only
cut out along the bezel of the iPhone 10
including an infrared camera a flood
illuminator a front camera and a dot
projector now they're saying this flood
illuminator allows for this function to
work even in the dark projecting light
onto your face illuminating it enough so
so the recognition can take place it
projects the dots onto the face and then
the infrared camera picks those dots up
a software analysis using neural
networks to detect if that's the face
that was originally registered it's
being measured in a three-dimensional
sense and cannot be fooled by a picture
or something like this this information
will not be transmitted to the cloud
instead apparently everything will
happen locally in your device and our
phones is an 11 Bionic chip with a
built-in neural engine to process face
recognition okay so this is where that
Bionic term comes from with the a 11
chip this neural processing is neural
network they're talking about is
embedded into your device they playing
touch ID is one in 50,000 the face ID is
one in a million because of these
various dots that are being projected
onto an individual's face he does say
that if you have an evil identical twin
that they might be able to get in or
probably could get in I don't know how
identical identical twins are after
saying all that invites the next guy
onto the stage Craig federighi and he
proceeds to attempt this unlock that has
just been talking about now this is
probably not a finished product there's
all kinds of fails that happen during
presentations for various reasons but in
this particular case I was already
skeptical Apple they're not famous for
fails on stage but of course the
internet reacted the stock market
reacted so let's check out this moment
so let's take a look now unlocking it is
as easy as looking at it and swiping up
and you know let's try that again
oh-ho-ho let's uh go to back up here and
get right in okay so there's this
two-stage system where you look at the
device and then you also swipe up in
order to unlock it it's not like on the
galaxy s 8 where you hold it up and
that's it it unlocks one stage it has
two elements and what happens on the
first device that he holds up here
he doesn't function he does the swipe
portion and it asks him for a passcode
this is going to be a fear of many
people adopting this new technology it
might not have been apparent to you
immediately but after the initial face
unlock fail Craig he reaches up and he
kind of wipes his face like this now
first I thought it was just some kind of
nervous reaction but I gave it a little
more thought and I realized he obviously
knows more than we do he's been involved
in the development of this feature in
this device so is it possible that
this feature is being broken in some
cases by substance on the skin if it's a
little bit oily or maybe there's some
sweat on there maybe if somebody uses a
lotion who knows a reflective aspect to
having some shine on the skin which
might mess up the face ID feature and it
seemed like he was aware of it you might
build in the habit of just using the
pass code all over again like you have
on previous devices this thing needs to
be bang on if it's going to have
widespread adoption oh ho ho I don't
think it requires a major overreaction
and I definitely don't think that the
product is a failure because of it but
you know that is not ideal for Apple
they would have loved for that first
demonstration to go the way that they
expected which was to unlock the device
immediately oh ho but judging from the
feedback I've gotten a number of tweets
comments people talking in the live
stream about it it's obviously important
to people so I felt the need to just do
a quick breakdown to show you that face
ID fail and you can make of it what you
will let me know down in the comments
will this stop you from investing in the
iPhone 10 are you a little bit nervous
about this face system are you okay with
going back to a traditional passcode or
its touch ID just too important to you
or a fingerprint unlock in general
thanks for watching guys and if you're
interested in more iPhone 8 or iPhone 10
content I will have those devices here
on the channel as soon as possible so
