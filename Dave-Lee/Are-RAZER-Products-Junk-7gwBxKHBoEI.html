Whether it's their phones, laptops, keyboards, mice, speakers;
If Razer brings out a product that is interesting to me,
I will usually cover it.
Now, in those videos, in the comment sections, a lot of you guys
are writing in the comments like Razer products suck.
They break, they're expensive, they're ugly, etc.
And I don't feel like
that commentary, that discussion is without merit, because if you
look online, if you go onto like reddit, or notebook forums or whatever,
there are a large number of people, a surprisingly large number of people
that seem to be dissatisfied with their Razer products.
And I wanted to look into this, I wanted to see, is there
a real deficiency in their products?
Is there stuff that, we should be kind of be aware of?
I wanted to know.
So, the first thing I kind of looked at was their warranty.
If you look at Razer's warranties,
they have, well they have different kind of like warranty  periods
depending on the type of products. So their mice,
2 year warranties, keyboards, if their mechanical
2 year warranties and their audio products like their headphones and stuff
have one year warranties and now the industry
standard kind of changes at some company one year
and some company are two years but the big names like Logitech,
Corsair, like the brands that a lot of people really like
are all having 2 years warranty across the board. So as an example,
this is a Razer Man O' War
this thing is mangled, it's destroyed, it's out of warranty at this point.
But this is a product that I think costs $180 retail
and it broke for me,
I think at the year and a half mark out of warranty
and it's an experience like this that if you are a consumer
that has spent 180$ on a pair of headphones and
it broke and you couldn't get it replaced or repaired or whatever
that leaves a sour taste in your mouth and you have something like
a like a Logitech headset, I don't have one here.
But if you had a Logitech headset and that broke at the year and half mark
you're able to get a new one for free from Logitech
and that experience, that difference in warranty timing
is massive when it comes to perception of
quality of a product because all it takes is just a product
to dive just out of the warranty period and now you have a dissatisfied customer
who is little bit upset and they can go into the Internet to vent about it and
now we have, you know a situation about Razer products not being great.
I think the warranty issue,
is something that I feel like Razer doesn't do particularly well, with like slightly shorter periods,
and a more difficult process to get it warrantied, but
I don't think that the whole story here.
The other thing I looked at was price, if you look at Razer's products
they definitely have some kind of price premium going on
