devices that I've always wanted like the
idea of it is really cool to have a
laptop that can turn into a tablet just
by folding the screen back but there's
always been issues with usability it's
just something that comes with the
nature of a screen that folds back and
then you're now holding a keyboard
that's at the bottom of a laptop it's a
lot of companies attempt to do it but a
lot of companies don't do a good job at
it and that's why I don't cover them
very often in this channel because I
feel like a lot of companies produce
them just they're not really noteworthy
this one is the HP spectre x360 and of
all the two long devices that I've been
able to use I think this is the best one
in terms of usability for the average
person so there's a 13 inch and a 15
inch version to this this is the 13 inch
and my honest opinion if you're kind of
deciding between a screen size for 13 or
15 inch for two and ones there's very
few people that would be able to
comfortably use a 15 inch tuned one as a
tablet as at laptop that's great but if
you're looking for a tuned one and you
plan on using it as a tablet relatively
frequently I would go for the 13 inch
okay let's start with the keyboard it's
a good keyboard can't complain it's
backlit very good layout good spacing
it's a little bit slick because the keys
don't have any textures just took a
smooth plastic but it's a very
comfortable typing experience and the
trackpad is also good it uses a synaptic
driver I would have loved to have seen a
winner's precision driver but it's
actually a very good touchpad it's got
good tracking and good button mechanics
there is pen support and it's included
in the box but the pen itself isn't
amazing or anything and it works it does
everything that a kind of average stylus
would do but it feels like an older
generation surface pen to me ports on
this thing are pretty standard for an
ultrabook there's two USB sees one use
PA a micro SD slot and a fingerprint
sensor the u.s. PC support Thun well
three and it's four-lane PCIe for the
people that want to plug this thing up
to an external GPU inside the RAM and
the Wi-Fi are soldered on the SSD is
replaceable if you need but that's
basically it everything else is soldered
on the battery down here is a nice size
sixty watt hour slab and the battery
life is very good it's pulling up
comfortable on nine and a half hours
with the screen at around 215 it's it's
relatively long for a to mon device i
mean there are devices that have longer
battery life than this but it's very
the performance on the 13-inch x360 is
actually quite good a lot of tune one
devices are using y processors which I
don't love this is using the regular u
processor quad-core 8th gen cable a car
and it's awesome for multi-core stuff
you do need the right type of
application for the CPU to really flex
but these are really fast processors
gaming performance is pretty limited
light games will play at reasonable
frame rates but nothing amazing the
Intel UHD 620 is not a gaming GPU so you
kind of expect that now one of the more
interesting things about this laptop are
the fan noise and the thermal
performance so this thing has two fans
which at first I thought would give it
some amazing thermal performance and it
does but not in the way that expected so
this laptop is quiet one of the quietest
laptops that have ever used even onload
it can get a little warm nothing too bad
though because you can comfortably use
this laptop on your lap now because this
thing had two fans I was under the
assumption that this would have the
ability to increase the wattage in XTU
to sustain boost clock but I wasn't able
to I was getting throttling even with
under volting and it's not a weak AC
adapter it's a very comfortable 65 watt
one but it's just that this laptop was
not designed to run above the original
thermal specifications so the fans on
this laptop are great if you just want
to keep things adequately cooled while
being quiet but you can't push out crazy
performance with them the usability as a
tablet is where this device excels and I
think this is where a lot of
manufacturers just kind of fail so
here's the thing if you're gonna buy
tune one device if you're gonna spend
the money and pay a little bit of a
premium to get a tune one device you
have to be someone who's actually gonna
use it as a two-in-one device like I
know it sounds really obvious but a lot
of people will buy something like this
and just use it as a laptop and rarely
use it as a two and one and it just
doesn't make sense if you're going to
use it as a laptop just purchase a
dedicated laptop but if you're going to
pick up something like this you got to
be damn sure you're gonna using it as
tent mode presentation mode tablet mode
and this thing is very comfortable to
use in all of those positions it's weird
because visually there's a lot of angles
and edges on the specter but it's
actually really comfortable to hold
now there's four speakers on this device
there's two on the top and then two on
the bottom and they've positioned them
in a way so you get clean audio in
laptop mode tablet mode presentation
mode
doesn't even matter the audio itself is
not amazing I'm not gonna say that this
is the best speakers ever it's an
ultrabook
but they sound good but most importantly
you have access to clean audio
regardless of the position you have this
thing set up in alright lastly I want to
talk about the screen this panel is a
1080p panel it's bright it's got a good
color gamut and the viewing angles are
good now the side bezels are thin they
looked nice but the top and bottom
panels are thick right well they look a
lot thicker than you would want them to
but I think they do this on purpose
a lot of tuned one devices have thinner
bezels and it looks nice but in terms of
usability these thicker bezels on the
top and bottom are really nice int Alamo
there's just way fewer accidental clicks
and taps when you're handling the device
which is something that I think a lot of
Windows 10 tablets have an issue with
but you just don't get that with this
thing and I really like that the webcam
looks pretty clean and it's located in
the normal position up top so it doesn't
look up your nose or anything like that
the overall device is very comfortable
to use and this is something that a lot
of manufacturers overlook or just
straight up don't care about to learn
devices should be comfortable as a
laptop and as a tablet and this guy does
both well ok hope you guys enjoyed this
video thumbs we liked it something you
loved it see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
