and this is a video on the 2016 HP omen
so instead of an internal spec bump like
a lot of companies did this year HP did
a full redesign in the omen now right
off the bat it's a more traditional
design instead of that edgy trapezoid
shape from last year it's a more
standard rounded rectangle the top
surface has the soft touch rubber
coating on it I like soft touch
materials when they're new and this one
looks pretty nice it has this diagonal
weave pattern on it but if you bang it
up or you scratch it the finish doesn't
look very good so keep it protected with
a case or a sleeve the build quality is
okay it's a plastic build last year's
omen had a nicer overall finish because
I had more metal but this year's version
is still decent it just doesn't feel as
premium the bottom panel is plastic with
some venting grates but there's no soft
touch finish on this the screen and the
chassis have a bit of flex but it's
nothing too bad the hinges are a little
tight it's not easily opened with one
hand and I think the overall build
quality is a step down from last year
because it's just not as much metal used
in the construction process the good
thing is that when you don't use as much
metal the overall price comes down so
this year's omen starts at $900 opening
it up the screen on this model is a 4k
IPS panel it's not a touchscreen but
it's bright at around 313 it's it has
pretty good color accuracy good viewing
angles contrast could be better but
overall I would consider this to be a
pretty good screen now this is the
upgraded panel it's an extra $90 I've
seen the 1080p screen on the base model
and it's so much worse it's really dim
it's around 200 nits at max brightness
and the color accuracy was surprisingly
bad I highly recommend spending the
money to upgrade to the 4k panel the
webcam is a standard HD webcam it looks
okay there is an option to get a real
sense 3d camera if you want to use
Windows hello the keyboard area has the
same diagonal pattern as the lid but
instead of that soft touch finish it's
just a smooth surface at the top of this
are the speakers they have Bang &amp;amp;
Olufsen branding again but like most
laptop speakers in this price range they
don't sound particularly good it's loud
and it's
nicely but it's not a balanced sound
there's a very obvious deficiency in
bass even if you use the software
adjustments the keyboard and the
trackpad are the same ones as the HP
Pavilion or at least I think they are
they feel very similar the keyboard has
red backlighting now it's a decent
keyboard relatively short stroke but
there's nothing I really dislike about
it the keyboard is shifted over to the
left again because of the number pad and
the up and down arrow keys could be
bigger or positioned better but overall
the typing experience is enjoyable the
trackpad feels small it's wide but it's
not roomy from front to back so doing
gestures feels a little cramped tracking
works fine I didn't notice any skipping
or anything the buttons need a bit more
force to trigger than I'm used to but
yeah nothing I really dislike about the
trackpad either when it's closed up it's
less than an inch thick so it's a little
thinner than your average 15-inch gaming
laptop as for ports on this side there's
an Ethernet HDMI an SD card slot and one
of the two USB 3.0 s the other side has
a second USB 3.0 and a USB 2.0 there's
also your standard audio jack but
there's no Thunderbolt 3 so there's no
external GPU option The Omen comes in
several graphics card configurations the
$900 base model has a gtx 950 M and you
can upgrade that for $30 to a gtx 960m
the one I have here is the top spec gtx
960 5 M I wouldn't get the 950 M it's an
okay card but for an extra $30 that
upgrade to the 960 M is so worth it the
960 m will do 60 frames per second for
light games even on Ultra settings
pretty easily and moderately demanding
games will still hit 60 frames per
second at medium or high graphics
settings I've reviewed a lot of laptops
with that card so you can check those
out for more details
the 965 M is actually a noticeable
step-up in performance depending on the
game and screen resolution it's rounded
20% improvement in frame rates over the
960 m again this is highly dependent on
the game and the graphics setting but it
is noticeable boost thermally the 2016
omen runs relatively cool the fans do a
good job in keeping the system cool but
in terms of fan noise The Omen is
slightly louder than the average laptop
just by a few decibels but it's more of
a reason to put on headphones
you're playing games the 7200 rpm hard
drive has a pretty average performance
you can configure some models to include
an SSD and the performance on the
factory SSD isn't very good either
fortunately it's easy to open up and
upgrade them you just remove the screws
on the bottom pop off the keyboard and
you can see that the RAM is upgradable
there's two slots to work with the two
storage bays are also upgradable there's
two and a half inch SATA Drive and also
room for an m2 PCIe stick the battery
down here 61.5 watt hour battery takes
around two and a half hours to charge up
and I'm getting around four hours of
battery life with screen at around
eighty percent brightness my guess is
that the 1080p panel would be closer to
five and a half six hours all right
the 2016 HP omen soft touch finish build
quality is respectable for a plastic
build the 4k screen is brights
reasonably color accurate and a highly
recommended upgrade over the Tandy P
option the keyboard is decent
backlighting is red and overall an
enjoyable typing experience the trackpad
could be a little taller and the buttons
are harder to press but it's a very
usable trackpad inside the sky like i7
and the gtx 960 5m are great performers
and they're very well cooled by fans
that are a little bit louder than I'd
like the RAM and the storage are easily
accessible and upgradable and the
battery will give you around 4 hours of
regular use if you're using the 4k
screen now last year's omen was a more
premium product it was more expensive it
had better build quality and it looked
very unique this year's omen it's a
little more generic looking the build
quality has come down and the price has
come down with it which is cool now
there's nothing about the omen that it
excels at it's kind of very good across
the board if you get the 4k screen I
think you're getting a little bit better
value than the average laptop in this
space but yeah if you like the brand or
if you like the way that the laptop
looks I think it's a good pick up that's
the end of this video hope you guys
liked it thumbs if you liked it subs if
you loved it it's been nice I'll see you
guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
