so this is the ACS c30 - it's their
Chromebook their top-of-the-line
Chromebook and I don't do much coverage
of Chromebooks on this channel least I
haven't in the past because I feel like
this type of hardware Chromebooks their
value is highly dependent on their
software like without a good software
experience this whole ecosystem doesn't
work very well and in the past that has
been great but recently actually in the
very near future these will become
awesome so before I get into the whole
like review of this particular unit I
need to talk about the state of
Chromebooks in early 2017 so Chromebooks
have traditionally been just like okay
if you don't know what a Chromebook is
if a inexpensive laptop like device well
it's basically a laptop and it runs
Chrome OS which is a software made by
Google now in order to put applications
on these things
traditionally you go to something called
the Chrome Web Store which is kind of
like their App Store so iPhones have the
App Store Android phones have the Google
Play Store Chromebooks have something
called well they used to have something
called the Chrome Web Store which is
their application kind of library the
problem with that developers just didn't
develop much for the Chrome Web Store
like most of the popular applications
weren't available on the Chrome Web
Store so Google did this thing last year
where they're like hey we're going to
allow Android applications the ones that
you would see on your Android phone
we're going to put those onto
Chromebooks in the near future and that
is right now in the next week or two
they're going to be rolling out across
most Chromebooks at least all the
current generation ones and future
generation Chromebooks they're going to
be able to run Android applications so
at first glance it's not like a huge
thing yeah it's like a bunch of apps are
coming into the system but this really
is a game changer so not only do you
have just a gigantic library of apps now
you're now able to do stuff offline so
if you want to do editing of documents
offline if you want to play games
offline if you want to download videos
and watch stuff off Netflix offline you
can now do this on a Chromebook these
are basically full-fledged computers so
the addition of these Android apps into
this Chromebook ecosystem I think it's
going to heavily affect the sales and
the livelihood of Android tablet this is
a Galaxy Tab as 3 came out week maybe
two weeks ago and I feel like these
products are dead on arrival I just why
would you purchase that when you could
buy these for half the price and they're
just as if not more capable than those
some apps don't work it like this
cocaine this is a really popular photo
editing app and when I try to install it
it says it's incompatible but chances
are if your favorite app isn't available
right now there's going to be an
alternative or two or ten that are
available and able to run on Chromebooks
already so in general I think if you are
an average user I mean I know a lot of
my audience are like they're heavy
gamers or just photo or video editors if
you're one of those people then you
probably won't be able to use this as
like your only machine maybe it's like a
secondary device but for most people you
can get by with a Chromebook the app
store selection is huge so yeah I think
that's just the state of Chromebooks
right now
so I want to talk about the device in
specific now so this is the Asus c30 2
and personally I think this is the best
Chromebook right now it's expensive it's
$500 and I guess let's talk about the
things that I do like about it first so
it's got great build quality full
aluminum build everything is solid
there's no plastic on the device
everything from the hinge to the finish
feels good top to your device there is
like you can see over here that it
wasn't milled from a single block of
aluminum there's like two pieces that
they put together but the build quality
on this thing is quite good there's to
use BC ports and there's no use ba ports
obviously not a huge selection of ports
but it's a Chromebook and you probably
won't be connecting to many devices to
this thing you also have your micro SD
slot and then on the other side you have
your volume rocker power button and
audio jack the screen is 24 hundred by
13 40 it's reasonably bright and color
accurate I'd say it's about average for
a higher end laptop or Chromebook there
are better screens out there but I like
this one a lot performance is pretty
strong strong enough I mean for what we
would do on a Chromebook I can easily
have 10 chrome tabs open with Spotify
Netflix or twitch running in the
background and it'll handle it with ease
the 64 gigs of storage gills a little
light especially if you're coming from
laptop but you can easily add microSD
cards if you want I will say though if
you're interested in purchasing
I would highly recommend getting the
upgraded one like the one with the core
M processor I've used the Pentium
processor and it feels noticeably slower
it's not that much cheaper so I highly
recommend getting the upgraded version
with more storage and a faster processor
ok let's talk about the keyword this is
why I've crowned this Asus as the best
Chromebook it's backlit 1.4 millimeters
travel perfect layout there's really
nothing I would change about this
keyboard maybe like the springs could be
a little bit stiffer but really it's a
great keyboard it feels a lot like the
MacBook Air and for what I use a
Chromebook for and what I think is a lot
of people will be using Chromebooks for
the typing experience has to be awesome
and this really nails it very few
Chromebooks do and so there's another
competitor to this that I would consider
to be like the second-best Chromebook
out there which is the Samsung
Chromebook plus that the keyboard and
that is significantly worse than this
that's why I prefer this the other thing
that I really liked about this like
device as to why I think it's the best
it's the flip so a lot of devices when
you flip it into tablet mode it's just
not a comfortable device this thing is
relatively light 2.6 pounds but it's
also the ergonomics like when you hold
this thing it feels like an actual
tablet and I think if you're going to
have a two-in-one device if your tablet
mode your tent mode and your laptop mode
are all really comfortable to use you've
done a good job the trackpad is less
awesome surface feels good but it lacks
perfect precision you'll get the
occasional jitter it is a decent
trackpad though the battery life is
great
it's a 39 watt hour battery you'll
comfortably hit eight or more hours on
this thing so I've been able to hit
eight hours with screen at 215 it's
keyboard backlighting on
I mean it's a Chromebook not pulling too
much juice so it's going to last it also
uses USB C charging if you have other
USB C devices that's a nice bonus the
speakers are also decent they're
positioned nicely you get a good stereo
effect and they're clear enough there's
no fan noise on this thing so audio
comes out pretty clean but it's a small
speaker on a Chromebook so it's not
going to be amazing there's a few things
I don't love about this Chromebook
I wish the screen was brighter 300 nits
is fine for indoor use but if you bring
it outdoors it's not ideal the other
thing are the bezels so these bezels are
I mean they're not cute or anything but
when you have it
adlet mode especially because you have
that Asus logo on the side it doesn't
look like a particularly elegant screen
I wish these dazzles are smaller but
that's about it there's really not much
a dislike about this Chromebook now it's
not cheap it's $500 which is actually
quite expensive for a Chromebook but in
2017 you're not going to get this kind
of build quality unless you're paying
this kind of money so is it worth it I
think it is especially consider the
Android apps that are coming in if you
can make this fit into your workflow I
think this is a really good device hope
you guys enjoy this video thumbs be
liked it subs if you loved it see you
guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
