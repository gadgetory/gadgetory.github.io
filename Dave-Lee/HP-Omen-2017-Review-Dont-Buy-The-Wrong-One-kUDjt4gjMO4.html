is a review on the mid 2017 HP omen so
this thing has been redesigned for this
year the old model the 2016 model that
kind of carried over to early 2017 that
was a very generic looking laptop this
one it looks less generic but I feel
like a lot of the design language has
been inspired from companies like Acer
or Lenovo this doesn't look super HP to
me but it's a well-built laptop v
paneling is solid most of this plastic
the hinge also seems really good despite
the location I mean I don't really don't
like seeing hinges close together like
this they tend to wear out a little bit
faster but this one feels good and you
can open it with one hand there's a lot
of read on this laptop it's your classic
black and red gaming laptop the color
schemes not my jam but for some people
that do like this color scheme I think
it looks alright the port selection is
pretty solid here there's an SD card
slot USB threes and you also have two
display outputs Ethernet and a USB C but
despite this Thunderbolt 3 looking
symbol there's no Thunderbolt 3 action
to be had unless you pay for that $20
upgrade the keyboard is pretty good the
keys are a little softer than I'd like
but layout is good backlighting is red
for most of the keyboard but just a
handful of white LEDs under the WASD
Keys the trackpad uses of synaptic
drivers I really wish they'd gone with
Windows precision drivers here the
tracking is ok like there's the
occasional hiccup but I didn't have
issues with gestures or tapping it also
has dedicated buttons for clicking so
you might or might not like that ok
let's talk about the display if you're
actually interested in purchasing this
thing you should probably pay attention
here so the base model is dim it has
poor color accuracy and quite frankly it
sucks it's one of the worst screens I've
seen on a 15-inch gaming laptop the 4k
panel is good
but unless you're using this laptop
exclusively for concentration I'd skip
the screen it's also not cheap the only
display that I really like is 120 Hertz
1080p panel it's a $60 upgrade but it's
just so much better than the base panel
and games look a lot better when they're
being played in 120 Hertz the default
webcam looks ok you can upgrade for 20
bucks but even the base model supports
Windows hello for speedy logins
the internals of the laptop are pretty
easy to access there's a handful of
screws this configuration has a two and
a half inch SATA drive and an m2 SSD the
SSD is a PM nine six one so it'll have
pretty quick speeds and this
configuration has eight gigs of RAM you
can install up to 32 gigs the battery
down here is 70 watt hours which is a
relatively large battery for a gaming
laptop but battery life isn't great I'm
getting around five hours of use with my
regular test which is kind of weird
because this is a bigger battery than
the previous generation but I'm getting
very similar numbers in terms of
performance this is running a gtx 1050
TI and it's getting great performance as
expected the 1050 Ti is basically the
sweet spot for price to performance on
gaming laptops you can play most
triple-a titles at 60 frames per second
with great image quality it's only the
heavier titles that struggle a little
bit now if you want to see more
benchmarks for this GPU there's a link
in the video description
there's another configuration of the
omen with the gtx 1060 max-q and i guess
would be their top-of-the-line model
I've mentioned this in previous videos
but if you're going to do max Q you got
to do it right you got to build the
entire laptop from the ground up with
max Q design in mind if you take a
pre-existing chassis and you just stick
a max cube chip in there you're not
getting the benefits of what max Q can
do you're still getting a sick laptop
you're still getting a pretty loud
laptop there's no point now in terms of
fan noise on the TI version it's
actually pretty good
unload it doesn't get too loud but for
whatever reason when it's idling the
fans kick in more often than I'd expect
even with cool sense of there's also no
fan control in their software but
thermal performances otherwise really
good it handles stress tests well and
overall the thermal design on the new
omen is quite a bit better than the
previous generation the speakers fire
from underneath the laptop and they
actually sound pretty good they also get
really loud obviously sound quality goes
to hell when you crank it but if you
need that volume this thing can do it so
with the new mid 2017 HP omen we're
looking at a laptop with a metal
keyboard deck but plastic everywhere
else it has good detailing and build
quality it has several screen options
but I highly recommend getting 120 Hertz
panel the backlit keyboard is also well
laid out and comfortable to type on the
trackpad has dedicated buttons and
synaptic drivers which are just okay
there's occasional tracking lag inside
the i7 and the gtx 750ti have strong
gaming performance temperatures are good
but the fan control is a little
aggressive and comes on more than I'd
like the two RAM slots and the two drive
bays are easy to access for upgrades and
the 70 watt hour battery although big
doesn't give the best battery life now
if I only focus on the merits of the HP
omen I would say that this is a good
laptop right it's got good performance
really good build quality and if you
choose the right screen games look good
on it the thing is the pricing is not
very good the base model with a gtx 1050
I mean that's to me the minimum card
that you should get on this it's $1,100
with a pretty poor screen the model with
a 1050 Ti and the 120 Hertz panel you're
going to break $1200 so in general this
is not a good value for a laptop I would
consider this kind of in the middle of a
bunch the thing is HP laptops have
usually been really well priced
but not right now competition is too
fierce if you're looking to get this
definitely get the 120 Hertz panel I
think you're still getting okay value at
that point but any of the other options
I wouldn't do it okay some to be like
this video subs if you loved it
see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
