and this is a video on the msi GS
so this is our thin and light gaming
laptop that's equipped with the gtx 1060
but before i begin after mention the
fact that this video was made possible
by nvidia they partnered with me and
send me the laptop for review so first a
quick unboxing here when you open it up
you get the laptop itself the AC adapter
and some paperwork aesthetically it's
not too different from the GS 6c from
last year it's thinner and lighter but
the top surface is still aluminum the
bottom panel is also aluminum but it has
this micro suede type material the idea
is that allows you to use the device on
your lap without a metal panel getting
super hot you can access the internals
by removing some screws but the only
thing you can easily swap out is the two
and a half inch hard drive the RAM slots
and the MT Drive Bay are upgradable but
they're on the other side of the
motherboard you'll need to disassemble
it a bit more to get access the chassis
is a magnesium lithium alloy the
exterior paneling though is aluminum
there's a bit of flex on these panels
and the same thing goes with the
keyboard area but for a laptop this thin
at 17 point seven millimeters it's
pretty solid the hinge also feels pretty
well made with proper tension the GS 63
is packed with ports on the Left we have
Ethernet and SD slot 3 USB 3s and
separate audio jacks on the right we
have a USB 2 Thunderbolt 3 and some
display outputs the power button is up
near the front and I was actually
worried I would accidentally turn it on
or off all the time but it's never
happened not even once so I don't think
it's an issue the keyboard has
SteelSeries lighting they aren't
individually lit keys you adjust the
lighting in zones
it's very configurable there's tons of
colors to choose from the keyboard
itself feels really nice it has a 10 key
number pad so it has that leftward shift
but it has good key travel and it's very
nice to type on despite being such a
thin chassis the touchpad is less
awesome it's a textured plastic surface
I don't find the tracking to be as
smooth as I'd like it to be and the
button clicks feel pretty shallow it is
a gaming laptop though so he'll probably
a mouse connected there's a 4k panel
option but the display on this unit is a
Tandy P IPS panel it's a matte finish
with good viewing angles contrast and
brightness color accuracy out of the box
is good and it can be tuned with the
included software there's also no
noticeable light bleed on the panel they
did a really good job this year the
1080p webcam up top looks like this the
speakers are not located above the
keyboard despite the grill being there
they're actually underneath the laptop
they sound pretty standard for a laptop
this thin they get loud but they have
pretty weak base the drive speeds are
also pretty standard it has a SATA stick
in the empty slot and a SATA hard drive
but you can upgrade both of them the m2
slot can take a much faster a PCIe stick
okay let's talk about gaming performance
it uses a sky like 6700 HQ chip and the
new Pascal based GeForce GTX 1060 chip
in moderately demanding games like
overwatch
I'm comfortably hitting 95 frames per
second on epic settings at 1080p
something a little heavier like doom
we're looking at 75 frames per second on
Ultra settings at 1080p I never saw it
dip below 60 frames per second once
something even more demanding like
fallout 4 on Ultra settings I'm hovering
around 60 frames per second something
like GTA 5 on Ultra settings we're
looking at mid to high 40s you'll need
to lower the graphics to medium high to
hit the 50 60 frames per second the
bottom line is this if you want to play
games at 1080p the GTX 1060 is going to
give you amazing performance it's going
to run at high frame rates with
beautiful visuals a virtual reality also
runs nicely on this laptop
Pascal runs VR at three times the speed
of the previous generation so the GTX
1060 handles VR comfortably I played
around with VR Fon house and subnautica
both of them had a very smooth
experience it's crazy that I'm getting
this kind of performance on a laptop
this thin and this Lite video edits are
all so fast
this entire 4k video was edited and
rendered on this laptop and it's
actually the fastest laptop I've used to
edit a video it's faster than 960 m 970
m faster than 980 m this thing pushes a
crazy performance the GS 63 has three
fans and five heat pipes fan noise on
idle is quiet and even under load it's
not crazy loud but thermally it's
surprisingly well cooled and comfort
to use because the micro suede material
and the location of the three fans keep
the contact areas cool if you want you
can use the MSI software to crank the
fans to max and the temperatures will be
lower it uses a hundred eighty watt
adapter to charge a 65 watt our battery
takes around two hours to charge up from
empty and with regular use I'm getting
around three and a half four hours of
battery life playing games it's closer
to an hour ok recap of the msi gs70
dollars us it's an aluminum build with
pretty good build quality it has a
bright 1080p screen with good color
accuracy it has a great keyboard but a
not-so-great trackpad inside the skylake
i7 and the gtx 1060 deliver amazing
performance with comfortable
temperatures and fan noise the 16 gigs
of ram and the two drives are upgradable
but only the two and a half inch drive
is easy to access and then there's a 65
watt hour battery that gets you around
three and a half hours of regular use
so the msi gs70 powerful laptop for its
size mostly because of the gtx 1060
Pascal delivers such a big jump in
performance from the previous generation
it's kind of crazy you're getting
desktop gaming performance in a laptop
never been done before but it's finally

Pascal or about the GTX lineup check the

guys like this video thumbs have you
liked it subs if you loved it it's been
nice see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
