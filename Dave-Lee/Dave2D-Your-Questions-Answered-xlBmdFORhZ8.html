here a couple days ago I wanted to
Twitter to ask people to ask me some
questions for this QA video and I did it
because truthfully super busy at work
don't have time for a regular text video
hence the filler QA video I apologize if
you're expecting a tech video this week
okay
first what do you do for a living beside
YouTube it's a little bit complicated
but the simpler answer is that I work at
a company that does the engineering the
architecture the development -
construction of medical buildings so
imagine a medical clinic those things
are built from like step 0 through step
10,000 we do all of them and one of
those steps happens to be equipping them
with tech and that's kind of how I got
into this besides tech is there any
other stuff that you'd like to make
videos about and I would do the answer
that'd know mostly because I think I'd
be pretty terrible at making every other
type of video you do 2d game development
- what have you made
I'm a little hesitant to tell you
because it's terrible okay
I worked on several teams for game
development but the one game that I made
that is like most personal to me because
everything about it was like it was my
game mechanic my game design it's a game
called inject it's available in the App
Store it's only for iOS it's a terrible
game don't purchase it please but it
exists if you want to see how terrible
it was you can take a look at it I might
put a link to like the trailer down in
the comments section or in the video
description what do you use to make the
animations in your videos I use After
Effects there's no like easy way to do
it it's time-consuming I enjoy doing it
it's kind of like a cathartic like
relaxing thing for me to just like draw
the lines and stuff like that
but it's not a quick process by any
means to use a laptop or desktop
primarily I use almost exclusively
laptops mostly because my work requires
me to be pretty mobile and laptops while
you do that how do you balance a YouTube
channel work and personal life I don't I
think I'm pretty bad at it I sleep very
little and that's probably like the
easiest way to do it how do you spin
laptops on the finger how do you develop
the skill it's essentially like spinning
a textbook it's unlike spinning a
basketball but the basketball you kind
of use your other hand to keep the ball
going with speed with a laptop or a
textbook you have to keep the speed with
the same spinning finger are you related
to marques Brown you guys have the same
last name okay we're both last names
wait why do you use a Mac slash
hackintosh instead of Windows the simple
answer
okay the true answer is that I am much
more productive on a Mac simply because
I can't predict around I can't play
games on a Mac as readily as I can on a
good PC like I have very poor self
control when it comes to playing game I
will just sink hours into the game if I
have access to a good computer when you
have a good Mac you can't play the games
that I like to play hence I use a Mac to
force myself to curb my gaming habits
whatever do a behind the scenes laptop
review no those are really they would be
super boring to watch
I assure you have you ever been to
Malaysia yes I have part of my family's
from there and I often go there for work
but yeah I go there once in a while what
are three important tips you could give
to a new tech channel okay I mentioned
this in my first Q&amp;amp;A I don't remember
exactly the points I gave them but the
one that comes to mind is making content
that you personally enjoy that you enjoy
like creating and you enjoy watching
because if you don't if you're just
doing content because you think it's the
right thing to do or you think it's
popular it's going to come across people
can smell that a mile away it's just bad
content enjoy the process because
seriously that's probably the most
important thing about YouTube other like
tips clattering oh man I'm not good with
that stuff
maybe something another thing that comes
to mind don't like try not to watch
other people's content and try to
replicate what they're doing that's
something that I think a lot of people
are tempted to do because they see a
successful challenge like hey I'll do
what that guy is doing but I'll do it my
own way
do my spin on it it's a terrible way to
do things you call yourself a content
creator because you're a content creator
you should be creating things
and replicating I really think that I
mean the more that you practice at
making your own style the better you'll
get at it so make your own thing try not
to bite what's your favorite watch
character over watch character Road hogs
probably because he doesn't have he
doesn't require like good twitching he's
just yeah because I have that aim non
check item favorite non tech item that
you own I don't know maybe my backpack
that's really lame answer I apologize
how do you keep things so clean did you
place a lot of storage or deal with
mentally minimally I throw out
everything that I can't like the moment
I open something like a box immediately
gets thrown out all the cables that I
don't absolutely need get thrown out
it's just I mean I'm terrible with
keeping things I sometimes regret having
thrown certain things out but it just
lets you have a cleaner space XPS 15 or
the x360 15 XPS 15 for sure do I think
each EPS will take off this year no
mostly because external GPUs the when
they were announced the 10 series Pascal
and video cards had not come out and it
kind of made a lot of sense at the time
the 10th used cards are such a big jump
up from the previous generation and
they're so similar to be like the laptop
versions are so similar to the desktop
versions it's not really a compelling
purchase it's such an expensive like
everything about it just doesn't work
right now maybe in the future but right
now eg GPUs are too expensive and the
performance isn't good enough to really
warrant it for most people what's your
daily schedule look like I work a lot
like 6070 sometimes more 6070 hours for
my regular work so I try to devote maybe
four to five hours of like shooting with
YouTube videos per week like so 2 hours
1 day 2 hours a second day I never give
myself more than 2 days to shoot YouTube
videos and I shoot during my lunch break
and stuff like that I'll edit videos at
home at night but I just don't have more
time than that to shoot video
the rest of my time is spent doing work
and spending time with my family
daily driver is currently using Nexus
not the Nexus the pixel phone that shows
how much I often use I actually use it
the pixel and the iPhone and I use the
MacBook Pro and the XPS 15 occasionally
the razor blade if it had 32 gigs of ram
I would use a razor blade more but XPS
15 more often than not what's your
education I went to University of
Toronto I studied a human bio like a
life science kind of thing completely
unrelated to what I do for work
completely unrelated to the YouTube
stuff but that's what I did
what's the best beginner camera your
smartphone camera you can make some
amazing stuff with a smartphone camera
you completely don't need anything else
more than that to start a YouTube
channel did you get a gh4 specifically
for youtube or something else okay I
actually yea the gh4 was my first camera
I actually borrowed that thing from my
friend and I used it for a very long
time like a year and a half and then I
broke it because I'm a terrible friend
and I actually pre-ordered the red the
scarlet W before I broke it it just took
so long for it to come i had to purchase
a like intermediary camera in between a
panasonic g7 that i used for a couple
months in between and then after that i
went to the scrub w so it's kind of
weird the scarlet debbie is actually my
very first camera that i purchased just
kind of pick idiotic what do I eat for
breakfast I've not much of a breakfast
person I'm a coffee person where are you
from I am obviously Asian I'm like my
dad is half chinese half Malaysian my
mom is half chinese half Burmese so that
yeah you can Asian I was born and raised
in Canada though so I was born in
Toronto raised in Toronto Canada
what was I doing before being a
full-time youtuber I would not consider
myself a full-time youtuber at all
before I made youtube videos on the side
I made 2d games on the side pancakes or
waffles waffles for sure like for sure
mostly because waffles are more like
anyone can make a pancake you make
pancake mix and just make a pancake on
any day but with a waffle you need like
a waffle iron you need like stuff to
make it more awesome it's just like a
fancier wall it's basically a fancy
pancake favorite new game overwatch
I played that a lot classic game
probably Zelda a Link to the Past on the
Super Nintendo good memories there specs
of your hackintosh so it's bad things
there
it's a 6700 K skylake GTX 980 I don't
love the reliability of it it's fine for
regular use but I can't edit videos
reliably on it so I just tend not to use
it as much as I would like to Tim
Hortons orders the Tim Hortons is like a
coffee chain in Canada to milk one
sweetener that's like my go-to what's
the story behind the 2d in the channel
name so 2d is I guess my username on
forums when I went on to forums like
looking for how to do things for game
development it was Dave 2d what's the
best way to learn video editing just do
it man you just got a giver and you'll
get better over time
what would be your perfect laptop so a
laptop that was like thin and light that
was somehow able to run a 6 or even 8
core CPU like Intel CPU would be awesome
it's not going to exist anytime soon at
least I don't think it will but that
would be pretty perfect favorite
youtubers that I watch that aren't in
tech I don't watch that much YouTube but
the one guy that I watch relatively
frequently is h3h3 his stuff is slap for
everyone I find it pretty funny do you
have a girlfriend
I am married I have a wife does that
count and have a kid I don't know if
that counts as a girlfriend how's the
switch to red going for you was it the
best decision you've made also did you
color the red symbol teal yourself okay
debrand actually made that teal or blue
logo thing and stuck it on for me which
is awesome in terms of the workflow it's
definitely slower than before it's
probably five maybe 10%
than my previous camera which was the
gh4 but it's so much more enjoyable to
work with and the learning curve is just
it's steep but it's very satisfying when
you kind of figure stuff out as you go
hope you guys enjoyed this video I gotta
get back to work some to be liked it
subs we loved it I'll see you guys next
