Dee and this is a review of the Asus
Zenbook 3 now I feel like this laptop is
kind of in a class of its own it's
similar in size to something like the
12-inch MacBook but it's got a much more
powerful processor than the MacBook does
and then if you take something that has
a similar processor like the Razer Blade
stealth these n book 3 is just so much
more compact in comparison it's similar
but quite different from both of these
but throughout this video I'm going to
be referencing the MacBook just because
it has the most similarities in terms of
ergonomics and design to the Zenbook 3
now it starts at $1,100 for the base
model but the unit have here is $1600
spec wise you're getting a lot more
power under the hood than the MacBook so
it has a full aluminum build with that
brushed radial pattern up top it's got
three colors this dark blue a silver and
a pink they all have this gold trim I
don't mind the trim actually like it and
personally I also like the blue but I
think there's a lot of people that would
want something more subtle like a black
or a great and there isn't that option
but dbrand has skins that you can use to
give us a more stealthier look the
bottom panel comes off easily but when
you're in there the only thing you can
upgrade is the drive the 512 gig stock
drive in this model is a PCIe stick from
Toshiba and has great performance the
battery down here is 40 watt hours now
Asus claims up to nine hours I was
getting just short of six hours with
normal use screen at 215 it's it
supports fast charging so you can juice
it up to 60% battery life in 50 minutes
in terms of the build quality it feels
very rigid the screen is rock-solid the
chassis is also very good the hinge is
great one-hand openal and it doesn't
flop open or close I think Asus nailed
the build it's still not as good as a
12-inch MacBook I still like this is
like the gold standard of build quality
but the Zenbook 3 is pretty darn close
it's very limited on ports it has an
audio jack on one side and a USB 3.1
type-c on the other side there's no
Thunderbolt 3 support but the good news
is that Asus includes an adapter the
display is a 12.5 inch 1080p panel
covered in Gorilla Glass 4 it's glossy
but it's not a touchscreen it measures
in with really good color accuracy and
con
but it could be a little brighter
compared to the 12-inch MacBook yes this
is a lower resolution screen but at
regular viewing distances you can't
really tell the difference that easily
it is a better screen on the MacBook but
not by that much
now the webcam on this thing is pretty
terrible it's just as bad as a potato on
the MacBook I don't why they did this
the keyboard is backlit and typing feels
okay it has 0.8 millimeters of travel so
it's not as tactile as I'd like it but
it's spacious and for the most part I
think it's a decent keyboard and most
people will get used to it quickly the
spacebar feels a little spongy than the
rest of the keys but it's not a big deal
the trackpad is pretty good it has a
smooth glass surface even though it
feels a little plasticky tracking is
smooth and pretty accurate the buttons
however don't feel great it feels kind
of dainty and there's not much travel
when you click so it's not a very
satisfying action there's a fingerprint
sensor up here and it works with Windows
hello so you can log into Windows using
just your fingerprint pretty quickly
the Zenbook three has four speakers
there's two up here and then there's two
on the bottom they have Harman Kardon
branding and they sound better than
expected now I think the king of
Ultrabook speakers is the 12-inch
MacBook if you've seen my review of it
or you've heard it in real life it just
sounds so much better than you think it
would considering how small the laptop
is the Zenbook doesn't sound as good
it's not as clean and this distortion at
higher volumes but they're still really
solid this unit here is running on i7 KB
Lake 6700 U and three big benefits of Kb
Lake over skylake first it's more energy
efficient second it's got Hardware
encoding and decoding of certain video
codecs and the third thing it's got a
slightly faster clock speed and in terms
of lightweight gaming the HD 620 will
let you play stuff like csgo
at low settings with good frame rates
but even moderately demanding games run
pretty poorly so overwatch will run at
around 45 frames per second at the
lowest possible settings and resolution
it only has a single fan and fan noise
isn't loud but it's audible when it
comes on and it's on pretty regularly
even when you're doing light tasks under
load the fan noise is also relatively
quiet for a core i7 but because it only
has one fan it gets pretty hot on the
inside and because of those high
temperatures there is significant CPU
throttling the average user won't care
about this at all they won't even notice
it like if you just do regular tasks on
your
laptop you literally won't notice it but
if you want to render videos or play
heavy games this isn't the machine for
you but that's the problem of having an
i5 or an i7 in something this thin it's
hard to cool it properly unless you
throttle down the CPU okay so with the
Zenbook three you're getting excellent
build quality this is one of the best
made asus devices i've used to date the
1080p display is not a touchscreen but
it's color accurate and it looks pretty
nice the backlit keyboard is comfortable
to use for its size the trackpad has a
fingerprint sensor and has great
tracking but the clicks feel shallow the
speaker system is surprisingly good for
the size of the laptop inside the cable
a core i7 and the integrated graphics
have good energy efficiency but there is
noticeable throttling when you push it
hard the 16 gigs of ram is soldered on
but the solid-state drive is upgradable
and then there's a 40 watt hour battery
that will last you around six hours of
battery life as for who this laptop is
for you want to make sure that you're
buying it for the right reasons because
this is not a cheap device if you're
university student or you want to use it
for work and you want some of the thin
enlightens just a Productivity Beast
this is a really good option it's well
it is what it is but if you're looking
for something that you can just run the
CPU full-tilt all the time like you want
to play games on it for whatever reason
no this is not that device get someone
that's a little more appropriate but if
you're looking for well a Productivity
machine this is a good one
thumbs if you like this video subs if
you loved it it's been nice I'll see you
guys next time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
