the XPS 15 two and one it's not designed
to replace the original XPS 15 they're
still making those it's more of like a
supplementary device for people that
want something that's a little more
versatile that can do like different
modes and stuff like this so it's a thin
and light - and one device that's using
the new cable 8g processors so those
have the AMD GPUs with the Intel CPUs
it's a very powerful system in a small
package so when you use this thing in
tablet mode it's not exactly the most
comfortable thing if you're gonna hand
hold it if you have just placed down for
taking notes or just doing things as a
like rested tablet perfect but if you're
gonna hold this thing it's a little big
it's comfortable it's usable but it is
big it's just a 15-inch screen is never
great for a handheld tablet device but
you can use it in tent mode or
presentation mode you can pop it up to
watch a movie you can play games you can
connect up a controller or a mouse and a
keyboard it's a really nice experience
to be up and close to your screen doing
stuff now the speakers are located in
the back here it's not the best location
the speaker sound okay I mean if there's
a difference between the regular XPS 15
speakers and these it's not a
substantial difference they sound okay
but the location isn't great and
especially you have an in tablet mode or
something it does muffle the sound the
ports on this device are all USBC so
there's four of them there's two on each
side and there's four lane PCIe support
if you're curious about external GPUs
there's no u s-- PA and there's only a
microSD slot which is a little weird to
me because I feel like this is a device
that's really great for creatives and
those are the type of people that would
use an SD slot but yeah you're stuck
with micro sd the charging is used PC
and we also have a battery indicator
which we see on XPS products I like
seeing that okay the display this is on
the 4k panel because that's the one that
I have here is an excellent display it's
very bright very color accurate you're
gonna like it
the original XPS 15 screen was already
good so expected good it's even better
than I thought it would be it's not as
bright as a macbook pro screen but I
mean I prefer the screen over the
MacBook Pros it's just more color
accurate it's just a nicer looking image
to me there's also a dedicated pen for
the two and one device low latency
really useful for creatives and students
the nib feels good to me it reminds me
of a surface product it's got a little
bit
extra to it when you're writing on the
glass the webcam still located on the
bottom it's got that standard like up
nose angle from the sps products but
because it's a two and one you can flip
it into ten mode and now we have a
normal looking image
you also have Windows hello for facial
recognition and there's also a
fingerprint sensor at the top of the
keyboard so this keyboard is a Maglev
keyboard it uses magnets to raise each
key so instead of a spring or switch it
uses magnets to basically give each key
resistance and it's actually one of
those more interesting features the
purpose of this tech is to reduce the
thickness of this laptop so you don't
have a switch you don't have a dome you
basically shave a couple millimeters off
of the base now how does it feel
honestly when you first use it it's
gonna be a little bit different but you
get used to it quickly it feels not like
a butterfly switch from the Apple
keyboards but it just it feels different
the way that a butterfly switch felt
different from a regular chiclet
keyboard this also feels different in
its own kind of way it's really hard to
describe this but you'll get used to it
that's the only thing that really
matters you get used to this thing very
quickly after like 24 hours 48 hours of
using it I'm very comfortable on it the
keys feel if they snap back to the
resting state a little faster than
normal but yeah I feel like most people
like it the trackpad is great it's your
standard xks trackpad glass surface with
great tracking and good button mechanics
now there is a glitch that I noticed and
I think it's a software thing if you
have three keys pressed down at the same
time like they have to be together at
the same time which probably won't
happen very often but if you do you
sometimes get other keys registering
that you didn't even press it all it's
infrequent and the reality is you're
probably not spamming three keys at once
together very often but it is a thing
right now hopefully they patch it soon
now if you want to get inside here it's
really easy to kind of like enter the
XPS products bunch of screws on the
bottom pops right off and inside you
have a removable drive which is great
the rain has started on though don't
love that and they've also gone with the
killer Wi-Fi card again which I also
don't love the battery life is not what
I expected it's actually pretty big
battery 75 watt hours but the battery
life was short and I'm not sure if this
is a software thing or a driver thing or
something that can be improved over time
but right now I'm getting around five
hours of battery life at 215 it's on a
75 watt hour battery which is a little
weird to me right I feel like on a
device like this I would have expected
like seven maybe eight pretty
comfortably I'm getting five
it's a solid performer it's running the
I 787 zero 5g so the GPU pushes a really
similar performance to a GTX 1050 maybe
a little bit faster on some titles but
most modern games can run your 60 frames
per second if you lower the graphics
quality bit it's good not mind-blowing
though but keep in mind it's a thin and
light 2 in 1 laptop see what the
thermals there fair if you're expecting
some crazy performance you're gonna be
disappointed in benchmarks I'm not
seeing any issues but if you play
heavier games for long enough it can
throttle they're using Gore material
like the XPS 13 to help channel the heat
away from the keyboard and away from the
bottom panel so it's comfortable to use
but if you wanted to pick up a machine
for heavy gaming this is probably not
the right one the video editing
performance is also good it's not as
good as like the new 6 core coffee like
CPUs but it's pretty solid render times
a little bit slower than a 6 core but
the actual video editing experience is
very similar it's a good device for that
the fans come on more often than I'd
like
they're quiet under load but when you
stress the system hard it does get loud
okay I feel like Dell put a lot of
effort and time into making this thing
this isn't some kind of like half-ass or
half-baked attempt that we see from
other companies when it comes to two and
one devices this is legit this is well
engineered it's well thought out I don't
love the battery life I hope it improves
I feel like it will improve but aside
from that this is a kick-ass device bear
in mind though this is not for everyone
if you're looking for like a traditional
clamshell laptop the XPS 15 like the og
one is gonna be a better option than
this but if you're creative if your
student if you're someone that wants the
portability of something that's really
diverse and can do a lot of different
things and you travel frequently and you
watch a lot of like media and watch a
lot of movies while you're traveling
this is really cool it's it's better for
a lot of things that the XPS 15 can't do
but if you're just looking for a
clamshell device that just does your
basic stuff XPS 15 oh gee version is a
better choice okay hope you guys enjoyed
this video thumbs we liked it subs if
you loved it see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
