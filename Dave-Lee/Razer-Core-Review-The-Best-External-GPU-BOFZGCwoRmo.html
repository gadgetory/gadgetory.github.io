and this is my review of the razor core
so when this thing first came in I was
super excited to play with it and so I
did but a couple weeks later I've
decided that I should do the responsible
thing I ran some benchmarks did some
tests finally made a review here it is
so the core itself is extremely well
made I was hoping would have good build
quality for the four or five hundred
dollars that it costs and it really does
full metal construction and very heavy
the build quality is super solid there's
some rubber feet for some grip side top
and bottom ventilation but there's no
air flow through the front it's super
easy to open a handle that flips out to
unlatch the mechanism and the tray
slides out there's a thumb screw for
mounting the card and they've oriented
the PCB so that when the card is
installed the release latches on the
bottom so it's easy to remove again the
power supply is from enhanced it's 500
watts but as you can see from its shape
it's not a regular ATX supply
there's several intake fans on the
bottom one of them feeds the power
supply one bigger one feeds the main
area and then the last one blows into
the PCB area and there's one exhaust fan
underneath the shroud for the power
supply the rest of the airflow has to
come from your video card the software
setup on the stealth is pretty easy you
install some drivers reboot and you're
good to go
the blade needs one more step you need
to install some software to turn off the
970m inside when it's connected to the
core the self doesn't need its charger
the Thunderbolt 3 connection will charge
the laptop while you're connected but
the 14 inch blade will still need the
charger they both connect using the
Thunderbolt 3 port and the cable is very
short it's around 20 inches it's an
active Thunderbolt 3 cable and they keep
it short because longer lengths can have
signal degradation but I've tried a lot
of third party cables none of them
worked
now the stealth has the connection on
the left side of the laptop the 14 inch
blade has it on the right so in terms of
setting it up you're gonna have to
fiddle around with positioning and stuff
but if you plan on having the core on
one side of the monitor and your laptop
on the other side it's not going to work
the cables too short the core also
lights up with Razer chroma you can
adjust colors and timing with
or again overall I think they nailed the
design and the build quality now both of
these laptops are skinned with d-brane
skins the stealth has the black titanium
the blade has the black carbon fiber I
highly recommend putting a skin on these
devices to protect the anodized finish
there's a link for them in the
description below now in terms of
performance I actually tested out quite
a few video cards but I'm only going to
go into detail about the 980ti
and the 1080 now in general I don't love
using benchmarks for videos but
sometimes you just got to do them so
just one other thing to keep in mind the
cards that I use in this video are
reference cards they weren't overclocked
at all there's going to be other
third-party cards that you can get
better frame rates and stuff with but
these are the reference cards just for
the video so right off the bat these are
the base scores of the razor blade
stealth and the 2016 razor blade 14 we
also have a current generation desktop
running 980ti
next up these are the scores when the
980ti is put into the razor core and I'm
only using the external display for
output the laptop display is turned off
and you'll also notice an alienware
score that's the same 980ti running in
the external alien or graphics amp for
an alienware 15 with the same specs as a
razor blade 14
so the 980ti gives a nice boost to both
of the razor laptops particularly with
the stealth it's not as fast as a
desktop and it's actually a little bit
slower than the Alienware graphics amp
but it's a very nice boost overall and
then I also ran the same test but this
time I did it with the built-in display
of the laptop so as I mentioned in my
previous Razer core video you're using a
bandwidth to send the rendered data back
to the laptop so the Thunderbolt 3
pipeline gets a little packed and you
get a bit of a performance drop it's not
too much but it is measurable
now the Alienware graphics amp also has
a drop in performance when you're
sending it back to the display now I did
the same test but this time with the new
GT X 1080 and everything runs a little
bit faster but yeah it's the same idea
so here's the deal the video card that
you put into the core will perform at
around 85 or 90 percent of the
efficiency of a desktop setup the exact
card you want to put in obviously
depends on your budget but if you're
looking to buy new the gtx 1070 looks
pretty awesome right now
and with a 980ti or better card in there
you'll be able to run essentially any
game you want at 1080p ultra graphics
settings at 60 frames per second now if
there's a specific game you want to run
at a specific resolution or graphics
setting or frame rate you'll have to
look up your video card but the bottom
line is that you'll get around 85 to 90%
of the efficiency of a desktop system
now many games are GPU dependent and
those will run nicely on the stealth if
you have a good video card in there but
some games are more CPU dependent for
example which are three and the new doom
frame rates on the quad-core blade are
noticeably better than the dual-core
stealth to determine which games are
more CPU dependent there's really no
sure fast way to tell but something that
can help if you look at the required
specs if the minimum requirement of a
game is a four core CPU even if it's a
super old CPU there's a good chance it's
a CPU hungry game but it's not going to
work like this every time to maximize
performance notice two things first
connect an external monitor up to your
video card don't use the internal
display if you can avoid it secondly
leave all the USB and Ethernet ports on
the core empty so when I tried recording
gameplay footage to a drive that was
connected to the core it would
occasionally hiccup I also tried video
editing in premiere with multiple drives
attached to the core it works but the
performance gains aren't really worth
the cost in my opinion I want to talk a
little bit about thermals and noise so
when the running of the core both
laptops run quieter particularly the 14
inch blade the 970m isn't being used
anymore so the whole system just runs
cooler and the fans don't have to spin
as fast the core itself has a bit of fan
noise it's very quiet and tolerable
especially at idle when it's under load
the fan noise really depends on the card
that you have inside the core the 1080
was quieter than the 980ti
but in general unless you have a really
loud video card the noise isn't too bad
I actually spent quite a lot of time
trying to connect the Razer core to
other laptops with Thunderbolt 3 ports
now at launch the core only officially
supports the two Razer laptops as well
as the Intel Skull Canyon Nook but I was
able to get some of these connected so
the XPS 13 and 15 they can connect I was
able to play some games but it would
lose connection and hang really
frequently
the new HP Spectre couldn't connect at
all the Alienware 15 actually had the
best connection maybe because it's
already capable of some external graphic
stuff but it would freeze and then lose
connection pretty often
the MacBook obviously won't work that's
not Thunderbolt 3 the Acer predator also
had a connection but it was super flaky
so basically none of them work properly
right now but my gut feeling is that at
least some of them will work sometime
soon it's just a matter of drivers and
BIOS is being updated I think companies
will get on that relatively soon and
once they do I'll probably be doing an
update to this series hopefully when the
new AMD cards are right a couple other
things if you want to close the lid of
the laptop you can just turn off the
sleep setting and it works
there weren't any thermal issues that I
noticed when I had either of them
running with the lid closed if you
unplug it in the middle of a game it'll
blue screen but if you unplug it when
it's idling it'll automatically switch
over to the internal video card both
laptops pass the steamvr test even with
the 980ti but the software needs to
mature i'm going to save that for a
future video
the last thing don't feel pressured into
getting a razor set up just have an
external GPU there are other Thunderbolt
3 external GPUs coming out shortly and
the Alienware graphics amp is always an
option that actually has slightly better
performance right now and you can always
build yourself an ITX system if you want
but I have to say the razor core is
awesome it's priced a little high and I
wish the software was a little bit more
mature which it will be over time but
razors seriously delivered on a really
big promise that they made with the core
and at this point it actually does what
they said it would do now whether or not
it's worth of four or five hundred
dollars here's the thing razor was the
first company to drop the external
Thunderbolt 3 graphics unit so they can
charge whatever they want I think it's
priced a little bit higher than it
should be or could be but if this is
something that you've always wanted I
think it's worth it at least at the $400
price point that's the end of this video
hope you guys liked it thumbs if you
liked it
subs if you loved it it's been nice see
you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
