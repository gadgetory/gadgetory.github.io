something very special from Acer
it's the predator 21 X so this box has a
laptop in it it's huge it's the biggest
it's the heaviest it's the most
expensive laptop in the world and I
normally don't want blocks things but
because this one's kind of special I
thought I'd share the experience with
you
this is so big you know why they needed
such a large box Wow okay why so happy
oh okay I got to see this I gotta see
what it looks like okay this is
surprisingly heavy I knew would be heavy
but doesn't heavier than I thought it
would be okay oh now I'm going to put
this aside for two seconds while I look
at the inside to see what else is in
here
this looks like a weapon Kasich if I
like went to a weapons dealer and you
showed me what I'm going to buy this
quick lesson this cool we have a
trackpad oh it's got a number pad on the
bottom but it's like a trackpad slash
number pad okay you must have to switch
that in now you get pamphlets
oh no it's key oh this is so cool okay
I'm assuming this has like removable
WASD keys and removable spacebar or
maybe for like I don't we'll see that's
pretty cool I should take this stuff out
cause I'm going to plug it up in a
minute we get to very large AC adapters
to power this thing I want to see what
this looks like on the inside
because this is special holy smokes you
could get a serious workout just lifting
this thing all the time
oh okay I love the blue keys this
keyboard it's so weird seeing this type
of keyboard in a laptop but this is like
like your regular desktop people and
it's a mechanical I think it's
mechanical feels it could be like a
cherry brown or like a brown switch this
feels like a really nice keyboard and
it's weird to have this kind of key
travel and this type of tactility in a
laptop are you kidding me
okay this is cool I thought this would
be a sticker but it's not this looks
like it's like painted right in okay
look at this limited edition 17 out of
300 that's pretty cool okay this shows
you how you can use this thing so you
can okay I get it so you just plug it up
oh it's magnetic
oh that's satisfying click does it come
out okay and you just flip it when you
want number pad and when you want
trackpad
okay I need to boot this up now I didn't
go through the exterior features while I
open this because quite frankly I was
like super excited to just boot it up
and see it but now that I've looked at
this for a second the build quality is
so good there's no play or flex on any
parts of this laptop the screen is
probably one of the most unique features
on this thing it's a curved screen and
I've never actually used a gaming laptop
that had a curved screen this might be
the first one of its existence the whole
reason why you have curved screens is to
give you that extra level of immersion
and games but the color accuracy and
brightness on this thing are fantastic
the other thing that's really cool is
that is a refresh rate of a hundred and
twenty Hertz this games are going to
look really good on this thing my only
suggestion if you happen to be one of
the 300 people to get one of these is to
do this you're to use it's perfect now
it's like customized to the way that
your hands naturally rest there's an eye
tracking thing down here I've never been
a user of Tobii eye tracking I've seen
people like play games directly off of
this but I've never tried it myself so
it says caution over here but I'm going
to crack it open
I should power this down okay we're
going in I'm curious to see what's
inside this thing ah might give him this
too much pressure that means only $9,000
oh it's coming apart yes we're in hard
drive to RAM sticks I'm going to see the
underside now four empty slots two more
sticks of RAM Wi-Fi card so the inside
is pretty simple to access if you need
to get in there so you're able to run a
lot of storage on this thing five drive
bays you probably won't need any kind of
external storage the predator 21x uses
two AC adapters each one of these is 330
watts it's a lot of juice going through
here and they both connect into this
rubber housing which kind of keeps it in
one package I'm going to post some specs
I'm not going to go into too much detail
but this is as low as a laptop guess
it's beyond impressive in terms of the
speakers they don't sound bad but I
think for a laptop this size
I had unrealistic expectations I kind of
thought it would sound amazing they do
get louder than your average laptop
though the SLI GTX 1080s are incredibly
powerful this is the stuff that dream
desktops are made of and then when you
put it into a laptop form it becomes
even crazier I ran some benchmarks just
to see how it would compare it performs
like a crazy powerful desktop it's
insane how much horsepower of this thing
has alright I want to play some games
let's put this thing to the test the
framerate on this thing is friggin
amazing
my ultimate is charging one thing I just
noticed the fan noise when you're idling
is surprisingly quiet I thought this
thing would be significantly louder
because it's a pretty powerful processor
but even when you're playing games if
you're on the default mode it's pretty
quiet
ah
the external temperatures are very
comfortable even when you're playing
games when I'm running benchmarks there
is some thermal throttling on the
default mode but if you crank up the fan
the throttling disappears and you can
overclock it pretty generously I don't
know if the mic will pick it up but the
fans are on full tilt right now and it's
loud obviously this is a very powerful
laptop but whether or not it's worth it
chances are if you're watching this
video and you're kind of wondering
whether or not you should buy it this is
not for you but if you want to live the
dream and you have the money for those
things this thing is incredible amazing
performance amazing device limited
editions pretty cool hope you guys enjoy
this video thumbs be likes it substitute
it see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
