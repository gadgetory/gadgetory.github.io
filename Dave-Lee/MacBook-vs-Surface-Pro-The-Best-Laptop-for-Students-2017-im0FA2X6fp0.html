you're looking for a laptop for school
or college there's a lot of really good
inexpensive options and I'll probably do
a video on those shortly but if you have
a larger budget like twelve thirteen
hundred dollars you can get something
that's really really premium that'll
last you many years and with the new
surface products out right now I thought
I would do video talking about what I
think are the best laptops for students
so we have the surface laptop the fifth
generation surface pro the 13-inch
MacBook Pro the 12 inch macbook the XPS
13 and I'll throw in a razor blade
stealth now this isn't an exhaustive
list but in terms of popularity general
availability and pricing those are my
picks now when you choose the laptop for
school there's a few things that kind of
come to my mind as being really
important and in just no particular
order build quality and portability are
some of the more important things you
want your laptop to be light but also to
last a long time and these all have
excellent build quality they're durable
enough to toss in and out of your bag
without too much worry and you can get
some inexpensive skins to cover them up
so you don't scratch the surface these
are from D brand another important thing
is the keyboard you want something that
you actually enjoy using and you feel
comfortable typing on now all of these
have great keyboards it's more about
preference some people will and some
people won't like the macbook butterfly
switches but in general you'll get
comfortable on any of these keyboards
the surface probe is a two and one
device with a removable keyboard so if
you're in a classroom that doesn't have
a lot of table space and you're often
typing your lap I probably skip this one
and just get a regular clamshell laptop
the other thing is that most of these
don't have dedicated page up or page
down keys you can do the same kind of
thing with function up and down but if
you deal with a lot of code or large
documents and you want dedicated keys
the surface products have them another
thing that I think is important for
college students is battery life your
laptop just has to have good battery
life at least for a lot of students
because there is a lot of really good
devices out there that have great
performance and good value but they just
don't have good battery life and for
those devices I didn't include them in
the list because I don't feel
comfortable recommending a device with a
5 hour battery life the ones here all
have full day batteries so you don't
need to bring the charges with you some
of these laptops use use BC to charge so
you can share some chargers and there's
even battery packs that can charge
laptops over USB see now
I'm not going to talk about performance
too much because truthfully you're not
buying these laptops for like blistering
gaming performance they do all feel
pretty similar in terms of how quick the
overall system is and gaming performance
is also going to be pretty mediocre but
anything with the sunwell 3 port like
the Razer Blade stealth can connect to
an external GPU for playing games in
terms of pen input depending on the
person you are and type of courses
you're taking you may or may not find it
useful personally I think they're
amazing you can use it for note-taking
annotating course materials drawing
whatever you want
iPad pros also have the Apple pencil but
like I mentioned in an earlier video the
overall usability of an iPad pro as your
one and only computer isn't great even
in iOS 11 so I don't recommend it as
your only device without a doubt the
surface pros the King 4 pen input the
surface laptop can do it as well but
it's not as good because it's got a
wobbly screen you kinda have to hold the
screen while you write I mean it's
usable but the surface pro would kind of
built around the whole idea of pen input
now I've done individual reviews for all
of these and I'll link them below if you
want some more information but just some
quick notes about them first the two Mac
books they're both expensive both have
awesome screens with great speakers my
only real issues with them are the u s--
PC ports now my stance on you PC has
always been pretty positive especially
in 2017 I don't mind Apple being as
aggressive as they have been in terms of
pushing the whole you specie thing but I
don't think it's the right choice for
students because all it takes just one
time one time when you need a USB a port
on your device and you just don't have
an adapter that's going to suck but if
you can afford a MacBook can you think
you can handle the dongle Student Life
then go for it the new Razer Blade
stealth with a 13 inch screen is
actually one of my favorite ultra books
on the market right now it's really
expensive though at $1,400 the older
model with the 12 and a half inch screen
is $900 you're definitely getting better
value there but overall it's a really
good device and there's actually nothing
I'd really dislike about the razor blade
elf really thick bezels and the trackpad
isn't great on a 12 and 1/2 inch version
but it's solid device the Dell XPS 13 is
also really good the design is been
around for a few years now so it's a
little stale for me but that's about it
I mean I wish it had pen input there's
an XPS 13 - and one that does have pen
input but I don't really like that
device the regular XPS 13 is boss and if
you're on a tighter budget you can
always give the older versions like the
93 54
deep discount and those fill kick-ass
alright the surface laptop was supposed
to be built for students and visually
it's appealing with the cool colors and
stuff I do like the keyboard
I like the fantastic screen I don't look
at the screen wobbles when using the pen
the other thing I don't like is the
Alcantara material first students you're
often eating and drinking when you're
using your computer so it's going to get
gross and lastly we have the surface pro
and I still think this is the best
all-round device for students it's
expensive especially once you add I like
the pens and this keyboard and stuff
like that
and it's not the prettiest device it
looks okay but it's not like super
gorgeous like the surface laptop but
it's very versatile and a lot of the
features set is geared towards students
and productivity now I wish it was
cheaper there's always the option of
getting the surface pro for the previous
generation that's a little bit cheaper
than this with really similar qualities
but yeah I mean any one of these devices
are good this is still my favorite</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
