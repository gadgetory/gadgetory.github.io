and brands are making them brands are pushing them out
but before you buy one, before you consider purchasing one of these RTX devices for 2019
there are some things that I feel like people should be aware of
before we go into it
I feel like we need to look at some performance matrix
these are fire strike scores
I'll talk about frame rates later
this is kind of a relative performance between some of the GPU's for 1080p gaming
okay, so a lot of the conversation here revolves around price
it's not the only thing here but it is an important thing
RTX laptops are very expensive
the RTX 2060 laptops are starting around $1500
and it's not just the price point
it's the fact that the features that you're getting
the benefits that you're getting with these new RTX devices
are not well showcased on laptop hardware
so let me explain
the screens on gaming laptops are usually 1080p screens
you have like 60 Hz screens, you have 144 Hz screens
some of them this year are 240 Hz screens, which is crazy fast
but they're still 1080p screens
the whole gaming laptop industry is just filled with 1080p screens
which is perfectly fine for gaming
but the problem is that RTX laptops showcase their stuff best at the higher resolution
10 series GPU's were already awesome for 1080p gaming
like look at the GTX 1060 laptop
playing Fortnite, PUBG, Call of Duty Black Ops 4
all of these are over 60 fps on high graphic setting at 1080p
and you can easily get higher frame rates if you want to drop it to medium or low graphic settings
and remember this is with the $800 or $900 gaming laptop
like you can buy a GTX 1060 gaming laptop for 800 bucks right now in 2019
and you compare it to these new 20 series laptop
these are a lot more money
but the performance increase doesn't line up very nicely with the price increase
so let's take an RTX 2060 laptop as an example
so we take last year GS65 for $1800 or the new GS65 for $2100
the performance for 1080p gaming is very similar between the two
and if you go ham you get like the top of the line 2080 Max Q
you're still stuck on a 144 Hz 1080p screens
so you literally can't see the extra performance in most games
so these RTX laptops support ray tracing and DLSS
and I was able to play Battlefield V on ray trace graphics
and the frame rates on the 2080 Max Q are not bad
but I still think it's way too early to pick up an RTX GPU just for ray trace graphics
I just feel like more developers need to pick up on ray trace capabilities
I feel like some of the RTX 2060 laptops are reasonably priced
I mean they're not cheap by any means
but you're getting decent value for 1080p gaming
anything more powerful than that like the 2070 Max Q and higher
those configurations feel really expensive
and until we get higher res screens
or just way more ray trace games
I just don't think that RTX laptops are a good value for most people
and that's really would RTX is for
like higher resolution gaming and ray trace gaming
without that
and that's like not really available right now in the gaming ecosystem that we have
without it
it just doesn't feel like a good fit
last year in 2018 it kind of feel like the golden age for gaming laptops
we had 10 series GPU's
we had 6 cores CPU's
we had really fast 144 Hz panels
like a lot of new technologies combined together
to make this like crive factor or just really good gaming laptops
and companies were competing each other with price
that was a good time
in 2019, companies still have to make new things
they still have to sell a new things
but it doesn't mean you have to buy it right
like the 2018 devices are so good
and I'm not saying that RTX laptops are bad
they're really good
but last year GTX 10 series laptops were already really good
almost to the point of being too good
because right now in 2019 there is nothing really compelling
to make me say like
hey people should be buying the RTX 20 series laptops over the 10 series laptops
especially their current pricing
again, not that RTX laptops are bad
but it's just
unless you have a ton of cash
and you really want to be like the early adopters for ray trace games
I feel like 10 series gaming laptops are just such a better value
