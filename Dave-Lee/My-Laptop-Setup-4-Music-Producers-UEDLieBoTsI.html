Dee and welcome to episode 4 of my
laptop setup a series where I feature
the laptop setup so you guys submit and
also showcase whatever it is that you do
with your gear and so this week's
episode is on music production and this
is something that I didn't realize was
as popular as it is with laptop users
but here we are there's some really cool
submissions I'm really happy to share
them with you first up we have the
submission from our wick so he goes to a
music school in India for audio
production and the heart of his setup is
the 17-inch Alienware laptop this thing
was really decked out sky like i7 32
gigs of ram and gtx 980m he uses a razer
deathadder mouse and for storage he's
using a western digital my passport
drive he also has some other accessories
like a Sony SmartWatch 3 and an iPad a
game controller and he stores all of
this in a razor utility backpack for
music production he uses a scarlett 2i2
some condenser mics a MIDI pad
controller a pair of em 50 X's and these
have the brainwaves padding upgrade he
also uses a file a three headphone amp
and if you're wondering what those do
they basically take an audio signal and
then they produce a clean more powerful
version of that signal for your earphone
so I've actually been experimenting with
a tube amp from Wu audio it's called the
wa7 you can kind of see it back there
they're pretty cool so Eric submitted
some links to his music on SoundCloud
and he also included a video of his
music on YouTube
you
there's links to his soundcloud and the
music video in the video description
below thank you very much for your
submission Eric the second laptop setup
today is from GC he's also a student in
a music school and he's part of a music
duo called sundial he's had some of his
tracks released by some bigger names
like trap nation and mr. suicide sheep
on YouTube for gear he's using a 15-inch
MacBook Pro a 12-point 9 inch iPad pro
with an ESR sleeve he's using a 1
terabyte CGI drive and an Apple Magic
Mouse now if I could make one suggestion
g-suit I know the magic mass looks
really clean and it looks cool but there
are so many better wireless mouse out
there for example the Logitech MX
anywhere 2 I highly recommend taking a
look at other mice for music gear he's
using a mic from sure and Emma do M
track and uses 2 headphones the AKG Q
701 and a pair of white m50 X's from
audio technica he's also a speed cuber
and uses the mo u al long version too so
he also submitted some music on
soundcloud and his music is pretty cool
please get up agree if you're interested
links to his music stuff is down below
thank you for your submission GC last up
we have a laptop setup from Jason and he
does covers of movie soundtracks so his
gear includes the msi gs70 4 and when
he's in a studio he plugs up to a Dell
monitor and uses a pair of Yamaha HS 7
speakers for audio gear he has a couple
audio interfaces the Steinberg you are
12 and a focusrite scarlett 18 I ate the
headphones he uses are the audio
technica m50x --is everyone's got a pair
of those in this episode and then he
uses a couple of rode mics and a zoom
recorder he also has some nice video
gear and you'll see why in a little bit
he's got the a 6300 a Panasonic g7 and
some Sigma lenses so Jason does this
stuff where he records himself
one line of a song and he'll do it
multiple times and then he'll compile it
all together to create this
if you guys are interested in seeing
more of Jason stuff check the video
description below there's links down
there also down there are instructions
on how to submit your own content if you
are interested now if you've seen some
of my videos or some of these episodes
and thought people do some really cool
stuff I have like a more normal life I'm
not a music producer I don't do crazy
stuff don't be intimidated by that I
just as long as you're submitting
whatever it is that you do and you
showcase your stuff nicely that's the
most important thing you showcase and
you take good photos and you kind of
tell me what it is that you do there's a
very good chance that I'll use you in a
future episode I'll just theme it to
whatever it is that you do hope you guys
