Dee so I've been using the iPhone 7 for
about a month now and some of the
original opinions I had about the phone
kind of shifted over time but one of
them was the size like I really wanted
to use the 7 plus because had a better
camera had a bigger battery but I
couldn't make a work a little bit too
big for my hands I do want to share some
other thoughts with you though
everything is fast on the iPhone 7 from
the fingerprint sensor to general usage
to launching the camera everybody just
feels really snappy but true
multitasking still doesn't exist and
that's probably my biggest bottleneck
like if I'm in an email app and I'm
trying to reference another application
and going back and forth between the
email app and the other app that process
sucks it's just super slow the iPhone 7s
have a really good camera but most of my
shots are taken in well-lit environments
and truthfully unless you zoom in and
pixel peep the well-lit photos don't
look that different from the iPhone 6s
or even the iPhone 6
now the low-light capabilities are
noticeably improved you can get some
surprisingly good shots at night the
video stabilization is really nice on
previous generation phones you needed
the bigger plus model to get OAS but
they pack that into the smaller phone
now and that's actually my favorite
camera upgrade on the iPhone 7
comparatively this screen is low
resolution at 720p I know that it's low
res my brain is well attuned to the fact
that this is probably the lowest
resolution phone that I will use in 2016
but it still looks really good so I
don't mind the resolution the iPhone 7
screens also have a wider color gamut
they can display more of the colors so
if the source picture or the video
you're looking at has the extra color
data in the file it will look more color
accurate now the photo is taken on the
iPhone 7 can showcase this extended
color range but most of the time I'm
staying at emails or basically other
screens of text on a white background
and almost all the content I consume
hasn't adopted this water color gamut
yet so the screen is great it just
doesn't have the contents to really flex
how cool it looks the solid state home
button I disliked it at first I mean it
felt weird and it doesn't have a
particularly satisfying click but now I
legitimately prefer I use setting 3 and
it still feels different from a regular
button but I like the reliability and if
the rumors are true and they plan on
replacing the home button with a tap
tick on-screen button for the next
iPhone I'd welcome that change
I didn't think I'd care that much about
the headphone jack removal it's kind of
a bummer but I felt like there were
enough alternatives like the wireless
headphones and the dongle that you kind
of get by but the one thing that really
sucks for me is charging it at night I
often fall asleep with headphones on and
I'll end up having to charge it before
work the next morning and it doesn't
support like the super fast quick charge
so yeah I don't love that battery life
is still short Apple claimed it would
last a couple hours longer but I can't
last a full day of heavy use basically
if you put in a lot of screen time on
your phone you're gonna have to charge
up in the evening when you get home now
granted this is with the iPhone 7 the
iPhone 7 plus obviously lasts much
longer
water resistance is cool it's nothing
really new for flagship phones but the
iPhone 7 sounds the best amongst that
group that's actually one of very few
phones that has two speakers and is also
water-resistant they sound good on their
own but I also connect it wirelessly
when I'm doing dishes and I never have
to worry about the phone getting wet I
would actually go as far as to say that
this combination of the upgraded
speakers and the water resistance are my
favorite features of the phone but I'm
curious for the people that have been
using the iPhone for a while what if
your favorite features been let me know
down in the comments so overall I really
liked the iPhone 7 a lot more than I
thought I would considering how the
upgrade seemed kind of incremental on
paper but in real world views they're
actually quite welcome as for whether or
not it's going to be the phone that I
use for the rest of 2016 it really
depends on how good the Google pixel is
I'm going to be using that for about a
month before I do my video on it but
it's going to be one of the two either
the iPhone 7 or the pixel because I'm
all about that stock OS experience hope
you guys enjoyed this video thumbs if
you liked it subs youview loved it it's
been nice I'll see you guys next time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
