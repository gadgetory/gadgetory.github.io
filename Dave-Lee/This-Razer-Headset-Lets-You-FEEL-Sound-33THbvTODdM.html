Dave 2d here so razor just launched a
new line of headphones the nari
headphones and this one here is the nari
ultimate it's their top the line one and
this is a product that does stuff I've
never seen headphones do before so a
while ago they hit me up they're like
hey we got some headphones we can
actually feel the game that you're
playing you can feel the music that
you're listening to you can feel the
movies you're watching and I was like
show me show me how this works because
this actually sounds pretty cool so I've
had these for about a week and it does
some of the stuff that razer claims it
will do but at the same time it's a bit
of a miss in some other areas now first
things first this is a pre-production or
kind of like an engineering sample so
some of the experience that I had with
this particular product may not be the
same in the retail version I feel like
the retail version would probably a more
refined version of this but I feel like
I got a pretty good sample of what this
product will be like it's pretty well
built metal headband but the yokes are
plastic and I would have liked to have
seen metal yokes on a product like this
just like a flagship headset from Razer
I understand they might have used
plastic to keep the weight down and it's
not a poorly made plastic or anything
but metal would have been nice the ear
cups are plastic as well and then the
ear cushions are really comfortable
there's foam on the inside gel padded to
keep things cooler and it looks like
there's a cut out for people who are
glasses so if you have any kind of
eyewear the arm of your frame will kind
of sit through that slot to make things
a little bit more comfortable the fit of
this thing is very razor like to me like
these actually feel very similar on my
head compared to the older Kraken but it
doesn't have a user adjustable headband
it just automatically adjusts your head
depending on the size okay so it's
Wireless it has a dongle it has RGB
lighting but the main feature of the
nari ultimate is the haptic feedback now
Razer is calling it hyper sense and the
difference between this kind of haptic
feedback compared to the older stuff is
that supposedly it activates on a wider
spectrum of frequencies you don't have
to program anything it just
automatically detects the sound going
through the drivers and it'll activate
the haptic response and this will work
wirelessly or through the analog cable
that's connected with the 3.5 millimeter
jack so this is a product that should
theoretically work with any kind of
device out there and well from what I've
tested it does now here's the real
know how good is it right like how good
is this especially for gaming and well
for some games it's awesome and for
other games it's less awesome so let me
explain when you have a multiplayer game
with a ton of sound effects and a ton of
players I've just actively going ham at
the same spot at the same time it can
get a little overwhelming so something
like overwatch there's just a lot of
stuff happening at once 5v5 like 10
players in a match and when there's a
teamfight there's a ton of sound effects
going on there's guns there's explosions
there's voice lines from the different
characters there's just a lot of sound
and the vibrations from the headphones
can get a little bit distracting and you
have music on top of that it's like
sensory overload but there are other
games even multiplayer games where it's
not as crazy like 4th night or csgo or
Rainbow six siege where there aren't
like tons of sound effects happening at
the same time in games like that this is
an awesome experience I got a little
sound cues you just feel like you feel
the vibration you feel the feedback you
have better positional audio of where
the players are and what things are
happening it's really cool now it's hard
to describe because it's not just
vibrations in your ear like the strength
or the intensity of the vibration will
kind of change depending on the sound or
the type of sound I'm not sure exactly
how the software does it but it doesn't
just feel like some cheesy vibration the
haptic kind of like amplifies the sound
and just makes it feel more visceral
while you're playing and then there's
other games that are more
environmentally based like subnautica or
tomb raider we're just in these massive
environments and the sound effects in
those games are very deliberate right
like you may hear a groan from a monster
or your steps or your weapons all very
deliberate and clean sounds and in games
like these the hyper sense really adds
that whole immersion effect so what else
is a good at for certain movies he's
hurt awesome it's like your own personal
sub like action moves in particular
there's usually big sound effects that
accompany strong visuals and it's just a
really cool experience on these
headphones and the same thing with music
like certain kinds of music especially
bass heavy stuff just feels and sounds
awesome on these it's a really cool
experience now there are certain types
of music and certain movies and kind of
shows that don't work that well with
this like classical music sounds and
feels really weird with these it's just
not a good fit and same with certain
videos like if you're just watching a
YouTube video and
person on the screen is just talking
really loud like if you're watching Lou
from unbox therapy and his volume just
goes up a little bit these things will
start to vibrate it's just a little bit
strange but you can turn it off in the
software right you have pretty decent
control of the haptics in their software
so you have that option here's my take
on these they are not cheap
these are $200 which is a lot of money
for any kind of headphones but if you
consider what these do if you compared
to just other products on the market
they may not be the best sounding
headphones out there but they delivered
an experience that is completely unique
like I've never experienced haptics like
this on any headphones they bring a
certain element of just immersion to the
game's immersion to movies and that's
cool that's unique I think that if I was
on the market for sound of high-end
gaming headphones I would strongly
consider these I wouldn't get these if
you just want like the absolute best in
sound quality you're probably gonna find
something else for this kind of price
that has like better sound quality but
the experience is unique and I think
it's definitely worth checking out one
thing I don't love about them is the
battery life so these are rated for
eight hours which is okay but the thing
is if you play a lot of games where you
watch stuff a lot and you use the
haptics frequently that's the eight
hours is for if you're using RGB
lighting with the haptic feedback and I
was actually getting around a little bit
over eight hours actually for my testing
but that means you have to charge this
thing really frequently if you don't
like if you kind of forget to charge one
night you want to play you lose out on
the haptic switch is a bit of a bummer
eight hours it's kind of on the edge of
what I would consider a long battery
life it's kind of I'd say it's short
actually for headphones okay hope you
guys enjoyed this video thumbs if you
liked it something you loved it see you
guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
