need to preface this video with a pretty
big disclaimer everything I talk about
in this video
you kind of do it at your own discretion
because opening up your computer
fiddling with stuff playing with
software that affects like under volting
and bios and stuff like that you kind of
do that your own risk because there's
always an element of risk to err right I
think it's safe I created this video I
have experimented with it extensively
but it is at your own risk okay
this video is about two powerful tweaks
that can greatly improve the performance
of your laptop and there's two parts to
it first is a software it's a relatively
easy tweak super safe and then the
second part involves opening up your
laptop to apply thermal compounds it's
something a little more dicey but it
should keep your warranty intact as long
as you don't tell anyone about it okay
the first thing we're going to look at
is the software and this officer will
give you tremendous control over your
CPU and if you just start clicking
things randomly yeah you can mess things
up but we're going to be dealing with
one thing which is under bolting and
it's super safe under bolting is a
process where you reduce the voltage
that's going to the CPU but it doesn't
affect performance at all and the reason
why you can do this safely it's because
CPUs are fed more voltage than they
actually need it's just a matter of
finding that sweet spot the two more
popular apps that people use for this
are XTU by Intel and throttle swap both
are free both are good but for beginners
I would recommend X to you because it
has all the basic components you need to
properly under volt this is XTU
when you first load it up I know it
looks crazy complex lots of numbers but
we can ignore most of it first
let's adjust the graphing monitor to
show 30 minutes of data we're going to
stress test your CPU at its baseline
without any adjustments just to see what
numbers were getting so this is the XPS
15 95/60 it's running a KB Lake 7700 HQ
the during the stress test the CPU is
running pretty much Full Tilt occasional
dip and the temperatures are going up
and down as a fan turn on and off at its
hottest it's 88 degrees and at the
coolest around 75 76 degrees now the way
to undervolt properly is to throw out
the voltage run a stress test and if it
checks out drop the voltage again and
repeat you're basically starving the CPU
more and more and so to do that in XP
you you go to advanced tuning and on the
score tab you click on the core voltage
offset and you want to scroll upwards
from 0 to see negative numbers remember
we're under vaulting here so you want to
choose a negative number so we're going
to start with an under volt of 50
millivolts so I'm going to reduce it by
0.05 zero volts and when I run the
stress test now we're getting a max of
83 84 degrees for a couple of clicks not
bad right system is still completely
stable we're getting full clock speeds
and to step in the right direction ok
then we're going to kick it up a notch
and I'm going to reduce it by a hundred
and twenty millivolts which is negative
zero point one two zero volt and I'm
cheating here because I know this is
near the limit for this particular CPU
you should reduce it one increment at a
time and test a bit but for the sake of
speed I'm cranking that knob to ten so
at this under volts when we stress test
and activate the graph we're getting
even lower temperatures maxing at around
77 degrees so a good 10 or 11 degree
drops from the original unaltered
voltage so just to demonstrate I'm going
to drop my voltage to negative 130
millivolts I know it's going to freeze
because I've done this before my even
blue screen and when it does that's when
we know you hit the under volt limit and
when you're there reboot go back into
XTU and go back to the last voltage that
worked and for me that was negative 120
and that's your limit to really test the
stability you want to run something like
prime95 overnight just to make sure it's
all good if it doesn't last overnight
bump up the voltage now every CPU is
different so it's tough for me to tell
you exactly where to start but I would
recommend looking up your CPU or your
particular laptop and seeing what other
users with that hardware have been able
to unravel to and just kind of use it as
a starting guide for the KB Lake 7700 HQ
I would start around 100 millivolts so
that's negative zero point one zero zero
volts for the skylake 6700 hqi under
volts at around 150 millivolts so that's
negative zero point one five zero volt
and when you're done you can close X Q
down the settings apply even on reboot
you don't have to keep the front end
application
open so under bolting laptops can give
you better thermals but in my experience
the best results come from something
called repay Seng okay when a laptop
manufacturer makes a lot op there comes
a point in the manufacturing process
when someone or something usually person
has to apply a thermal paste onto the
CPU and the GPU and usually they don't
do an amazing job usually in a rush it's
like a person who's doing like hundreds
of laptops I just made that number up
but they're doing a lot of laptops every
day and they're just squirting pay so
they don't really give that much
attention to each CPU what ends up
happening is the application is
imperfect usually there's too much and
there's a good chance they're not using
the best quality thermal paste there's
nothing super terrible about this the
laptop will perform to spec but it'll
run hot to resolve this we're going to
reapply that thermal paste and we're
going to use better quality stuff which
results in lower temperatures so for the
uninitiated thermal paces of goopy stuff
that you apply on to CPUs or GPUs to
help transfer heat away from it and the
better quality paste that you use and
the better the application process the
better of a job that it does
again every laptop is different so
you'll have to search around to see if
people have done it on yours but the
more popular laptops tend to have some
kind of guide or tutorial as to how to
do it for the XPS 15 once you're inside
carefully unplug the battery loosen up
the screws here carefully remove the
heat pipe assembly and then clean off
the original paste using alcohol or
arctic cleaner or whatever you want and
then apply some good thermal paste so I
tend to do a small blog for the GPU and
then a small line for the CPU just use
good quality paste
I like arctic filter 5 you don't need a
lot but you're better off using too much
then way too little on some laptops
you'll see thermal pads you can swap
those out for better quality ones or
potentially dictor ones basically you
want the thermal pad to eliminate any
kind of air gap and then when you're
done place the heatsink back on but
don't lift up to check how you did just
trust because if you lift it up you can
put air bubbles into the paste and
that's no good one other thing was kind
of unique the XPS 15 this area here has
voltage regulator modules that get
pretty warm I've always put throne pads
over this area just to help transfer the
heat to the aluminium paneling and in
the end the reap Aysen gives you a
further drop in temperature better
battery life fans that come on less and
most importantly no more CPU throttling
your laptop will be able to run at
maximum clock speed for as long as it
wants and if you play games render
videos or just do anything that pushes
your laptop hard you're going to get
some nice performance gains from this
the thing is some people going to watch
this video and they're just going to
jump to conclusion that this is the best
thing ever
it's cool it's awesome but it's not for
everyone if you've never opened your
computer before if you don't know what
thermal paste is you've never used it
before you can still learn and figure
out how to do this stuff and it's great
once you do but take your time do the
research understand what you're doing
before you do it because there is an
element of risk to this I really don't
want you breaking your laptop's just
because you were a little overzealous
take your time do properly hope you guys
enjoyed this video thumbs of you liked
it sub CB loved it see you guys next
