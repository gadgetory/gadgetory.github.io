Dave 2D here. So Google's Pixel Event just went down
And the notch is REAL. There was a part of me that just wanted to believe
that was somehow big troll from Google
but it really looks like the notch is the thing
I found it strange or almost humorous that during the event they did a lot of like camera techniques for the renders
and they use wallpapers that kind of disguise or kind of mask that notch
but it's there. I also think that in the software you can't
HIDE that notch like you can on other android phones
like a lot of times you can pull a black bar down but I think the notch is so BIG
that a black bar in that region would just look really weird
so I don't think you can actually should hide that notch in software (as of) right now
The notch on the Pixel 3XL
is housing 2 selfie cameras
one of them being a wide angle selfie
it's a 97 degree camera angle which is actually wider than the
wide angle selfie on the LG V40
and its housing
one of the front facing stereo speakers so there is a reason for that
notch to exist as for whether or not it kind of makes the whole notch worth it
really depends on the user
personally, I am not a big fan of notches
but, this notch despite it being so prominent
is somehow tolerable to me
just because how many other good things are going on about this phone
so the big thing I love about this year's Pixel 3
is the design
both the 3 and the 3 XL have a much more premium look to the phone
than last year's Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL
I really like the colours this year
the white with the teal power button looks awesome
and the glass in the front and back make the device look a little more luxurious
that glass back allows it to have wireless charging which we haven't seen on a Pixel device before
the most iconic feature of the Pixel and the Pixel 2 XL from last year
was probably the camera
it's a camera that just held up really well over time
even a year after this thing came out
it's still one of the best smartphone cameras on the market
