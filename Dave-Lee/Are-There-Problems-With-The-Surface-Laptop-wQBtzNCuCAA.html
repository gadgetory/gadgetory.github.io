Microsoft launched their surface laptop
the other day and I think it's a really
cool product I'm personally very
interested in it I think it looks
awesome
I think they're going to sell lots of
them but I think there's some potential
problems with this product and I wanted
to go through them with you
in case you're interested in purchasing
one so the first thing is the design I
really like the design I think a lot of
the interest about this product comes
from the fact that it looks as good as
it does because let's be honest if this
thing was super ugly it would be a much
less exciting product but it's really
good-looking so here we are it's one
hand OpenAL the keyboard and trackpad
look really promising but the most
interesting thing about this product is
the fact that they're using this
Alcantara material on the keyboard deck
and if you're unfamiliar with it it's
this fabric type material it's a
synthetic fabric that Microsoft uses on
their signature keyboard on the surface
pro product and it feels and looks
really inviting to use it's much more
durable than what you would imagine a
cloth type of material to be but that
being said it's not metal it's not
plastic so there's going to be somewhere
over time now I've seen Alcantara
keyboards that looked really good after
six months and I've also seen some that
looked really worn down after six months
so I don't know it's going to vary from
person to person
but one thing's for sure you can't just
replace the keyboard the way that you
could on the surface pro because if you
really wanted to and yet a gunky surface
pro type cover you could just buy a new
one for a couple hundred bucks this is
built into the laptop it's kind of like
fused onto the keyboard deck I don't
think it'll be as easy to just replace
that okay let's talk about the operating
system these come with Windows 10 s and
if you want to the first year you can
upgrade it for free to Windows 10 Pro
after that first year or after 2017 it's
going to become a $50 upgrade so the
biggest difference between Windows 10
and whizz 10s is that 10s can't run any
kind of executable program so any kind
of like dot exe file you can't run it
there's not even a command prompt this
is crippling to a lot of users there's
no steam there's no Chrome you're going
to be stuck with Microsoft edge and
you're going to be running Bing for the
search engine it's streamlined and it
focuses on the core of Windows and I
think for system administrators it's a
lot easier to get something like this
deployed and for the user you're getting
a better battery life you're getting a
faster experience like a more optimized
experience but it's a very limited
experience so if you're using just
regular applications that you're used to
you're gonna have to upgrade to Windows
10 Pro ok looking at the hardware the
base model comes with four gigs of ram
and that is tight I really feel like
they should put in eight gigs and the
argument is that for most people that
are interested in this base model select
the university student that doesn't have
a lot of heavy computer tasks for gigs
should be enough especially you're not
using Chrome so if you're just web
browsing editing PDF documents typing up
Word documents just doing very
productivity focused tasks then yes four
gigs should be enough but the thing is
if you ever want to do some of this a
little bit more RAM intensive you can't
upgrade that now I understand they had
to do this to create the price structure
that they wanted but I'm just not a fan
of that base configuration in terms of
USB ports we're looking at a single-use
PA and no use PC ports and the thought
process behind that is that right now
their target demographic of students is
a predominantly use ba market so thumb
drive external hard drives mice they're
just all type-a and I understand that
but this is a device that's supposed to
last multiple years so you won't be
upgrading this thing or you won't even
think about upgrading the same for like
two three maybe five years and in that
amount of time you specie will be
everywhere why not give it to them now
so that people have access to universal
charging to universal display output
it's so weird that they're using USB a
and they even had UCC ports on
prototypes we were so close okay next up
is pricing even the base surface laptop
isn't meant for high school or grade
school kids it's meant for university
students and up and when I'm looking at
pricing that base model feels a little
expensive and I understand there's a
premium with the awesome build quality
the design the amazing screen the
material choices and very nice-looking
but in 2017 you're just not getting good
long-term value with four gigs of RAM
the mid and top-tier models seem to be
priced well or at least in line with the
competitors it's just the base model
that I'm concerned about but one thing
to note if you are students you're able
to apply your student discount to these
you're going to get about ten percent
off so the base models at nine hundred
dollars us the display panels are
awesome with basically 100% srgb gama
and they're all individually calibrate
at the factory for color accuracy the
3x2 aspect ratio I mean this is great
for tablets because you get a little bit
more usable space vertically but on a
laptop only device I would prefer to 16
by 9 screen just for consistency for
other devices more importantly though
even though the screen supports the
surface pen writing or drawing on a
vertical surface like a laptop screen is
not an enjoyable experience during the
presentation
Pano's had to hold the screen to
annotate on it but I feel like this
product wasn't designed around using it
with a surface pen if you want to write
or draw frequently I would get a surface
book or a surface pro instead so I want
to talk about some things that I think
Microsoft did right just kind of close
this off they're running PCIe drives for
storage so those are going to be really
fast way faster than the ones on the
surface 3 the CPU selection is good that
top end I 7 actually has an iris +
graphics chip I'm really glad they went
with that instead of the more common
7500 you the battery looks promising
they're claiming 14 and a half hours
running Windows 10s I'm assuming but the
way that I use my computer is probably
10 11 hours which is still really long
overall I think this is a great product
despite having a couple concerns I think
Microsoft did a really good job on this
thing so I will be doing a full review
when I get the unit in if there's stuff
that you guys want me to kind of take a
look at in particular let me know I'm
going to be spending more time in a
comment section of this video just
because I know a lot of you guys are
students and you might have an opinion
I'd love to talk to you guys about it
let me know questions comments I'm going
to be down there for quite a bit in this
video hope you guys enjoyed this thumbs
to be like that something we loved it
I'll see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
