so if you follow my channel in the seven
or eight months that have been doing
this I've never made a smartphone review
but I picked up a moto G last week I
thought it was a very interesting device
and I made a video and it's an
inexpensive phone it's priced at $180
for the base model packaging is pretty
simple the box opens up phone is sitting
there underneath the phone are some
pamphlets and a pretty simple USB
charger it's just the basics the front
of the Moto G is covered in Gorilla
Glass 3 it's rockin the same 5-inch
display as last year I'm glad they
didn't make it bigger than last year's
Moto G because a 5 inch screen is
nearing the limit for one-handed use for
a lot of people it has a single speaker
at the bottom here and despite it
looking like it could have a second
speaker for stereo it's just an earpiece
on the top the front also has a
proximity sensor and a 5 megapixel
camera which we'll get into later the
back of the device has a grippy texture
that is new for this year's moto devices
it's really nice to hold and it's not
too soft it actually feels like it'll be
durable and it won't just start peeling
in a couple months at the bottom we have
a micro USB charging socket and on the
top we have a headphone jack with a mic
on the left side of the device we have
no buttons and on the right side it has
a volume rocker with the power button
it's got that textured power button that
a lot of Motorola phones have so you can
feel for it without looking I've always
liked this little detail with the
Motorola phones the one thing that bugs
me about the exterior of the Moto G are
the two recessed slots that the earpiece
on the speakers sit in these slots
collects dust and grime really easily I
mean they're simple to clean out I blew
it out just before I shot this but you
will see dust and stuff build up in here
pretty quickly the whole device has an
IP X 7 ingress rating so it can
supposedly get a little wet the official
statement is that can be submerged in a
meter of water for half an hour just
make sure you snap the back cover on
really tight because it has rubber seals
to keep water out but here's the thing
even though it's fun to watch mkbhd
underwater motorola doesn't cover water
damage on
their warranty so it's really not to be
used underwater like this I just did it
for you guys because I'm an idiot but if
you do bring it underwater when you're
done make sure to remove the back cover
and dry it off because there's gonna be
water underneath there
the back cover comes off pretty easily
and inside you'll see that there's a
microSD slot so you can add lots of
stars to the phone it's always a nice
touch you can replace the back cover
with a handful of other colors or even a
flip case from Motorola
they both have black rubber seals to
help with water resistance the flip
cover has the same diagonal pattern as
the regular back cover but it's made of
a softer rubber and it feels more
premium the front of it has a nice suede
material which helps you keep the screen
free of smudges but in case you care
using the flip cover does make the phone
a little bit thicker than normal so
smartphones have become pretty slippery
over the years smooth phones are pretty
and all but they don't have much grip
the Moto G is grippy and it looks good
doing it I mean look at that traction
right I really like this material in
terms of its size it's bigger than an
iPhone 6 but it's smaller than a g4 I'd
say it's most similar in size to the
2014 Moto X it's quite a bit bigger than
the first generation Moto G but it's
still comfortable to use in one hand and
comparison to more premium smartphones
the bezel on this screen is a little
wide but seriously for 200 bucks I'm
really happy with it the screen itself
is a 5 inch IPS screen 1280 by 720 it's
nicely sized but I actually think it's
the weakest feature on the phone viewing
angles are okay resolution is okay at
294 ppi brightness is again okay it's
just a little on the dim side but the
colors are noticeably muted and I get it
it's a $200 phone they had to cut some
corners somewhere right I'm just telling
you for the sake of the review this is
one of the corners they cut the screen
it's not a bad screen but for the
average user this will probably be the
weakest link on the phone just so you
know the mono speaker at the front gets
loud but it does clip pretty hard at
higher volumes here's what it sounds
like
the main camera on the back is the same
camera as the one on the Nexus 6 from
last year and that was a pretty solid
camera it also has a two-tone flash
which helps to keep colors balanced when
using a flash there are some advanced
camera controls available like manual
exposure and timers and stuff but it's
still a pretty simple menu which i think
is a good thing for this kind of phone
the pictures come out pretty good when
you have lots of light and the colors
seem pretty accurate and it's still
pretty decent in lower light settings
videos record at 1080p with 30 frames
per second and the dynamic range is
actually pretty good I'm surprised and
really pleased that they put such a
respectable camera in $180.00 phone
camera up front is 5 megapixels it isn't
amazing but it works it's running
Android lollipop 5.1.1 now motorola runs
a really light skin over the UI
I've always liked their gesture controls
so things like double twists for
launching cameras double chops for
turning the flashlight on they all work
well and somehow it doesn't accidentally
trigger very often games running okay on
the Moto G hearthstone had an error
message about insufficient specs it's
still playable but it's not particularly
smooth there's also a bit of input lag
when it comes to endless runners like
Sonic if you're a hardcore gamer you're
not gonna love the performance on this
device now I don't like synthetic
benchmarks especially for phones but I
ran some just for kicks the phone is
sufficient for most basic smartphone
stuff but if you're after like blazing
performance for games or just super
snappy interactions this isn't that kind
of phone the performance for most other
things though is good it never feels
super sluggish or anything there are
some occasional hiccups but nothing
serious last thing is battery life so
it's 24 70 milliamp hour battery
it's bigger than even the Moto X from
last year so when you take a big battery
and you combine it with a not so bright
screen and a not so fast processor it
lasts a long time I got almost 2 full
days of heavy usage screen time of
around 7 and a half hours and it's good
stuff ok so just a quick recap 2015 Moto
G has a decent 5-inch screen at 294 ppi
a mono speaker that gets pretty loud but
doesn't sound amazing a 5 megapixel
front-facing camera all this covered in
Gorilla Glass 3 on the back we have
replaceable covers that are nice and
grippy and a really solid 13 megapixel
inside it has a very beefy battery that
will get you through a couple of days a
Snapdragon 410 processor with one to two
gigs of RAM depending on whether or not
you upgrade at the base model and that's
sufficient for most smartphone stuff
eight or 16 gigs of storage again
depending on whether or not you upgraded
it from the base model and it has an
expansion slot so you can always add to
that all of this in a water-resistant
package it is missing things like AC
Wi-Fi there's also no NFC there's no
wireless charging but for the most part
these are things that you're not going
to get any $200 phone ok so some closing
thoughts here for $180 I think this is
one of the best budget smartphone so you
can get for 2015 it's got a fantastic
camera for the price and everything else
about it is really solid for the basic
smartphone user if you're coming from
iOS and you're using like an iPhone 4 or
4s and you've been interested in trying
out the Android ecosystem this is a
pretty good gateway device it's
inexpensive and the Android experience
is pretty stock and if you're coming
from an Android phone depending on the
phone that you're coming from this could
be a bit of a side grade or it could be
an upgrade I mean it's your decision to
make
that's the end of the review I hope you
guys liked it if you have any questions
or comments type below I spent a lot of
time on this one because it was my first
smartphone review if you guys liked it

if there's anything you liked or
disliked about this video but it's been
nice I'll see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
