front of me are eight laptops and I
would consider these to be the best
laptops right now in mid 2018 so kind of
the best laptops on that premium thin
and light market these are all very
powerful they all have high CPU core
count they all have dedicated GPUs all
most of them do these are yeah these are
like the premium ones so I have for
gaming oriented ones and I have for
content creation oriented ones but in
2018 I feel like there's a lot of
crossover like a lot of stuff that
gamers are looking for is the same stuff
that content creators are looking for so
I've kind of mixed them up but to
introduce them I'm gonna go with the
gaming side first so we have the GS 65
from MSI so there's no more black and
red accents on this thing it's golden
black it has thin bezels and it's by far
the best thin and light laptop that msi
has ever made we also have the Aero 15 X
gigabyte did a pretty heavy refresh on
it this year faster components faster
screen but the chassis is pretty much
unchanged from last year we have the
2018 razor blade this is razors new
15-inch thin and light gaming laptop
it's got better thermals thinner bezels
and it's improved all around this year
we also have the GM 5:01 from ACS so
this is the more reasonably priced
variant of the original Zephyrus it's
packed in a faster screen and a better
keyboard and trackpad layout than the
original zephyrus okay moving on to the
devices that are leaning more towards
content creation so these are for people
that are into like 3d modeling or their
illustrators or video editors whatever
it is that you do if it's content and
you're making it you can probably use
one of these okay first we have the XPS
15 so this is the 95 70 this is a
product ID that's on year three
beautiful screen but the unchanged
design and the thermal limitations are
getting a little stale we also have the
XPS 15 two and one so it's got the
Maglev keyboard pen support tablet mode
it's got an AMD Vega M GPU combined with
an Intel CPU all in a very thin package
for a tuned one we also have the new Zen
book pro from Asus so this is a laptop
with two screens to help for
productivity a regular screen and then a
screen and the trackpad powerful
components but it's also in this
somewhat dated looking chassis lastly
the LG gram so this is a 15-inch
Ultrabook it's not as powerful as the
other devices here but it's crazy light
while rocking a 15
screen so lots of room for creative
projects without having to pay for a
more expensive CPU or GPU which you may
not need depending on the type of stuff
that you're working with now if you'll
notice I did not mention MacBooks at all
and it's not that I have anything
against mac books but right now in mid
2018 it just does not make sense to
purchase a new MacBook they're still
using the seventh gen CPUs and when it
comes to content creation the four core
CPUs and the MacBook Pros just don't
compare to the six core CPUs in the
Windows machines that you see here like
the difference is way too big for me to
just recommend this so unless you're
bound to some kind of Mac exclusive
program like Final Cut then I would
recommend a Windows laptop for
performance ok so in this video I'm
gonna go through some different
categories and then talk about I guess
my top picks for each category and then
we'll kind of choose well I will choose
my overall pick for best laptops ok
let's start with build quality first I
know this is something that some people
don't care about when it comes to buying
a device
I like the device to last as long as
possible and build quality has a huge
play in that the XPS devices are the
best built here the carbon fiber chassis
is really good its strong its durable
this is a material that seems to last a
long time for people the razor blade is
also well built I think it's actually
better built this year than it has been
in other years it's just a really sturdy
device is here the GM 5s are one from
Asus is also really tanky the rest are
still well-made but they don't stick out
as being leaders in build quality the LG
Graham is obviously not as durable it's
tunnel-vision on being ultra lightweight
so there's some material compromises but
for a laptop that's just over a kilogram
it's made quite well
one other thing the msi GST 5 when i did
a review of it i was using an
engineering sample the retail version is
better built particularly in the power
button there's just way less flex on the
retail version than there was on the
early engineering sample units ok if
speaker quality is important to you
these n book pro has the best speakers
of this bunch most of the gaming laptops
are good as well like the GS 65 the
razor blade the GM 5:01 they're all
pretty good speakers the arrow does not
have good speakers it's the gaming
laptop in this pile that just doesn't
have good speakers compared to the other
ones the XPS device is also not very
good same with the LG Graham but best
Zenbook pro it's loud it's clean
got respectable base if your speaker guy
Zenbook pro all right let's talk about
screens a lot of the gaming laptops here
are using the 1080p 14 40 Hertz screen
this is like the popular screen for 2018
they're usually made by auo and they're
very good screens there's a little bit
of difference between all of them like
there's just I don't know if it's like a
manufacturing difference or if it's
driver differences but they all look
slightly different but if I had to
choose a winner like it's difficult I
would say that the razor blade has my
favorite look like it's just it looks a
little bit brighter to me I'm not sure
if it's the actual panel or if that's
the coating they're using on the panel
but it looks a little bit brighter and
the colors pop out a little bit more on
the razor blade screen but all four of
these gaming laptops have great screens
the content creator devices often have
four kek options and here the resolution
and color accuracy tends to be a little
bit more important I've always liked the
4k screen on the XPS 15 it looks good
they're still using the same screen
after a couple years but yeah it's a
kickass screen the webcams on these
devices aren't great like if you're
someone that really cares about a webcam
you're gonna have to get an external one
if you want to get one of these or I
mean if you're just looking for webcam
recommendations the Microsoft Surface
product those all have pretty good
webcams same with the Mac books like the
MacBook Pros
those are good webcams as well if I had
to choose a winner maybe the XPS 15 but
the camera angle looks up your nose so
I'd have a tough time choosing a winner
between these okay keyboard I'm picky
when it comes to keyboard so and a lot
of my reviews all kind of nitpick on
keyboards but here's the truth most
keyboards are good enough they can get
used to them over time so even if if a
keyboard that has a really weird layout
if it's your primary device and that's
like the only thing you'll ever use
you'll get used to it pretty quickly the
issue comes up when you have like if you
have like a work keyboard like your
office or whatever and you have your
keyboard at work and you kind of get
used to that and then you're switching
between a regular keyboard and then like
a weird layout for your laptop at home
that back and forth can mess you up
but for most people if it's your primary
device and it's like you're gonna be
using that keyboard over time it doesn't
matter a keyboard is a keyboard you can
get used to it okay in terms of the best
keyboard of this bunch
I would say that the GM 5:01 keyboard is
my favorite it's got a good feel to the
keystrokes the tiny arrow keys are a
little bit weird but you'll get used to
them the GS 65 keyboard is also pretty
good the razor blade has a
weird shift key on the right side of the
keyboard but again you'll get used to it
with enough time it has a really good
keystroke and I think the best RGB
lighting in the entire industry
in terms of the content creation laptops
I hate using that term content creation
laptops but that's really what they're
geared for I like the XPS 15 keyboard
the most and I would say the LG Graham
has a great layout but the keystrokes
are pretty shallow looking at the ports
these all have a pretty good selection
of i/o except for maybe the XPS 15 two
and one this has four USB see and it's
not that it's like a deficiency in the
number of ports or anything like that
but I guess it works for the demographic
like the people that are purchasing this
could probably make that work in terms
of just sheer number of ports the GM
5:01 has five use B so four of them type
A one of them type C it's got a ton of
USB for people that are like gamers that
want Ethernet I think the only two here
with an Ethernet port built in is that G
is 65 and the arrow 15 so yeah if hard
wired connection is super important for
you then those two SD card slots so XPS
15 and the aro 15 have full-size SD
slots and then these three have micro sd
but who's using micro sd seriously like
I don't know I feel like they just
should have put full-sized SD on those
things if it was possible okay
performance the LG Graham runs a 4 core
CPU without a dedicated GPU it's not for
the hardcores but it's a strong device
for a certain types of content creation
the rest of the gaming laptops are
equipped with the i7 and CPU performance
is strong for all of them but under
stress tests some of the devices have
issues keeping up particularly the XPS
15 it's a chassis that has always had
thermal limitations it's great for
normal workloads but if you're putting a
long render through it or if you're
playing games for an extended period of
time it can throttle down and it's a bit
of a shame because you have a core i9 in
a thermally cramped laptop which doesn't
allow it to flex the way that it could
it's not that it's a poor performer but
if it was cool better it would be better
off
so thermally these are all difficult to
cool the GPU puts out a lot of heat and
when you have thin devices like this the
whole test becomes harder the Aero 15
probably is the best maximum cooling the
airflow on that device is very high it
gets loud when it's cranked up but you
do get a little bit of a thermal
advantage on it the razor has some of
the best cooling we've seen from a razor
laptop today
it's using a new vapor chamber it gets
hot but it doesn't throttle it's right
on the edge of that thermal envelope the
XPS 15 throttles it's a little bit
disappointing there are workarounds like
you can reap aced it you can undervolt
it but just coming out of the factory
it's not performing at the level that I
was hoping for it to but that's
XPS 15 for you okay battery life none of
these are gonna have amazing battery
life because the strong hardware is
tough to keep juiced up a few stick out
is being better than the rest the XPS 15
has always had long battery life so
there's that one well also the LG Graham
that ones a beast but keep in mind it's
a very different kind of laptop from the
other ones here
it's an ultrabook it's running a four
core CPU doesn't have a GPU but I've
included it because for a lot of content
creators that's a right fit they don't
need like good CPUs and GPUs that you
see in the rest of the stuff they want
something like that and that has really
good battery life when we look at the
price it's tough to draw a proper
comparison between them just there's so
many little differences between them
that could account for massive
differences in price like material
choices and stuff like that none of them
are value devices though like these are
all in a premium segment but if you're
lucky enough to be in a position where
you're deciding between them it's extra
hard this year devices are getting
better and even though there's some
differentiating features like
fingerprint scanners or Windows hello
cameras it's a tough choice in terms of
raw value the msi ge62 5 probably has
the best bang for your buck not that
it's cheap but it's slightly less
expensive than the other devices in this
space like that thin and light premium
space ok overall picks my number one
pick is a razor blade they've improved
the device so much this year it looks
better better thermals better screen
better performance like everything
across the board is pretty solid
except for that right shift on the
keyboard I can let that slide because
everything else is so good number two
number three spots arrow 15 and XPS 15
I'd say they're interchangeable though
depending on what you do what you're
using them for I like the XPS 15 a lot
across the board but the thermal
limitations there they're there again
and that bugs me arrow 15 also a good
device all around but it's more like the
overall usability I don't like the
trackpad that much I don't like the
keyboard all that much so yeah that's
like that's my ranking okay
hope you guys
this video thumbs he liked it subsequent
I'll see you guys next time and I hope
this video was useful alright</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
