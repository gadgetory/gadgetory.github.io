Dave 2d here I think for a lot of people
this will be the laptop that they want
so a lot of people are looking for that
laptop that's thin and light that
doesn't cost too much and can play some
games this is that one so if this is
what you're looking for
stick around this is the new laptop from
Asus it's called the UX 3 3 1 it's their
Zen book and what makes this thing
special what makes this video what it is
is the fact that this thing is running
an MX 150 in a very light and portable
package now it's not the thinnest laptop
out there obviously there are thinner
ultrabooks than this but this thing is
relatively thin but they've give it
enough room to allow for a proper
thermal solution because there is a
decent GPU inside this thing ok I'm just
going to go through some things that I
do like with this laptop and then maybe
touch on some points that I don't like
about it in no particular order the
build quality on this thing is quite
good it is $1000 device so you expect
devices like this to have good build
quality and it does deliver the screen
has a little more flex to it I feel than
the older UX 330 but aside from that
great build quality other things I like
the trackpad this is one of the better
trackpads have seen from ACS it's glass
great texture super smooth with Windows
precision drivers you can't get much
better than this on a Windows laptop
there's also a fingerprint sensor on the
side if you're into using windows hello
to log in and the screen is also
surprisingly good it's really bright
it's pretty color accurate and the
viewing angles are good
I do wish the hinge was a little bit
stiffer it's just got a little bit more
play than I would like but good screen
otherwise it's a little bit of work to
get inside you do have to remove the
bottom feet and remove some screws but
inside you can replace the SSD the one
that they include is a little slow it's
a SATA Drive so if you want to you can
switch this thing to an nvme Drive but
there's not much else that you can
replace in here the battery down here is
only 50 watt hours it's not particularly
big it's kind of weird because you look
at a device like this with a 50 watt
hour battery and then devices with 60
watt hour batteries with similar screen
sizes and this is actually getting
slightly better battery life which is
right it doesn't really how they doing
this I think it's through software
optimization I'm not sure exactly what
they're doing but I'm getting a 9 and a
half hour battery with the screen at 215
it's the speaker's also sound quite good
it's got Harman Kardon branding and the
thing is we've seen a lot of bad
speakers hiding behind
Brandin before not to diss the brand or
anything but Harman Kardon at this point
means nothing to me on laptops but this
time around this sounds really good it's
a clean sound with good range and good
volume I do wish that the speakers were
located on the top and set at the bottom
but it's a good sounding speaker the
webcam is pretty much garbage it reminds
me of the one on the 12-inch MacBook if
you use your webcam frequently then
you're gonna have to get an external
because this thing is just terrible
alright the feature that makes this
laptop the most special is its GPU it's
running the NVIDIA MX 115 you've seen my
previous reviews I'm actually even done
a dedicated video on the MX 150 it is a
very impressive card it's not like the
most powerful GPU that someone it is but
it doesn't require crazy heat sinks or
fans but it still pushes out of decent
frame rates in games you can comfortably
play basically any popular title right
now as long as you lower the graphics
quality a bit so if you're a casual
gamer you know what let's not even use
that term even if you're enthusiast
you're gonna be fine on an MX 150 as
long as you don't need really high
quality graphics now if you're someone
wants to play GTA 5 with like 20 mods
running then no this is not the system
for you but for most people you're gonna
be happy with this the cpu they're
running is intel's 8th gen kb lake art
and for the right application like if
you're running stuff they can take
advantage of extra cores performance is
great the fans on this thing are kind of
a mix on idle it's completely quiet it's
literally silent they don't even come on
but when you're doing some more
intensive stuff they kick in and they
don't get too loud or anything but when
you're playing games they get quite loud
and it's actually one of the louder
ultrabooks that i've seen in 2018 now
that's honestly a good thing because
remember if we're dealing with a device
that puts out a decent amount of heat if
you're not pushing it out quickly you're
gonna have problems now I did not notice
any thermal throttling on this laptop
when I was playing games which is you
know it's promising it's good but when I
ran some stress tests I did notice
throttling and it's not something that I
think will appear for most people's
usage scenarios it does seem confined to
stress tests but it is there and
depending on what you do and how
demanding your tasks are it may or may
not be an issue but if you really need
some really intensive CPU or GPU stuff
then this is probably not the best
laptop for you for most people there's
no throttling issue that I can see now
it's not all sunshine and rainbows there
are a couple things that I don't like
first is the port selection so
it's got an okay port selection it has a
USB C port but it uses a regular barrel
plug for charging and I just feel like
that was a missed opportunity because
Universal charging on a device like this
order an awesome it also does not
support the unbolt 3 on that USB C port
so I don't know again a missed
opportunity I'm sure it keeps the cost
down but it would have been nice another
thing I don't like is the top surface so
this has this kind of glass looking
material I'm not sure if it actually is
glass but it just looks tacky and it
makes the whole thing look cheaper and
it attracts fingerprints like crazy so
you're gonna get smudges and stuff on
the top there older one the UX 3 3 2
just had like a plain stainless steel
finish and I like that but well this you
know what this looks like a Chromebook
to be honest like one of those cheaper
Chromebooks come on ace you got it done
better on this one okay another thing I
don't like this is a big one the
keyboard this is a keyboard that has a
great layout but it's not as comfortable
to use as I would expect the keystrokes
are a little soft I feel like the
mechanism for the switch isn't the best
but I think most people can get used to
this keyboard given enough time okay
overall I like this laptop a lot I think
it's a great fit for a lot of people if
you're looking for some that's thin and
light that doesn't cost too much money
and can play some games on the side with
decent battery life when you're not
playing games this could be the one okay
hope you guys enjoyed this video thumbs
be liked it subs you loved it
see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
