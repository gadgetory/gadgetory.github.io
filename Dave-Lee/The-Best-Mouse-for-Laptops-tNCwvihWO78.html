Wireless might no dave22 year and this
is a pile of wireless mice you know I
was clean in my office and I was like I
have a lot of wireless mice and these
are ones that I like there's a lot of
other ones that I've used that I never
kept around these are the ones I like
and I want to do a quick video kind of
talking about why I like them and maybe
one of these might be right for you okay
these mice are actually most of them are
bluetooth enabled I really feel like for
laptops for mobility you just got to use
a bluetooth knives if you have one of
those dongles that plug in you're doing
it wrong if you're using a wired mouse
unless you're playing games you're
definitely doing it wrong
pick up a wireless mouse it's there's
some really good ones some of them are
very inexpensive all right
we're going to start off with not this
one this is not bluetooth the rest of
them are okay this one is a really good
wireless mouse but you need like a
receiver and that's just not really
great for laptop users so screw that
thing that's a razor something or other
the good ones are here okay first let's
talk about this one razor or Akai this
is a pretty unique looking mouse like if
Batman had a mouse it would probably be
this one it's got great tracking but
battery life isn't good and I feel like
the shape of it requires a very
particular fingertip grip I like it and
it's not too expensive but I wouldn't
recommend it for everyone
the next Mouse is let's go with this one
this is a bluetooth mouse that is very
inexpensive it's I think $12 on Amazon
there's another version to this that's
$10 which uses a dongle which is
actually this one if you don't have a
bluetooth enabled computer for whatever
reason or if you're comfortable using
dongles you can save $2 but just get the
Bluetooth one if you can it's literally
the cheapest mouse that I've used that I
enjoy it's made by a company called jet
tech comfortable to hold and it can
handle a bunch of different grips and
the sensor is surprisingly good the one
thing I dislike about it is the battery
it uses a single double-a but it's a
pain in the ass to remove and install it
you got to pull on the battery super
hard to pop it out but for 12 bucks I
still recommend it it's a good Mouse
next up is the Apple Mouse this thing
sucks I don't know why it's in here I
had
it I just I don't recommend this for
anyone it looks very pretty but it's a
terrible Mouse I think Apple needs to
make a better mess next up we have the
MX master mice this is the old one this
is the new one it's a great Mouse and
even though it looks big it's
comfortable to use with small hands it
has a side scroll lots of buttons
excellent sensor the new version looks
and feels pretty much identical to the
old one it has a couple new features
like higher dpi longer battery life and
just mute conclude Logitech flow so
that's a feature that allows you to use
the mouse across multiple computers not
just the cursor between screens we can
actually transfer files and stuff
between the two computers and when I
first use it I thought of super cool
actually feels very magical but I just
never use it and I'm someone who uses
multiple computers every single day I
have two computers on my table all the
time running so I don't know if I'm not
using it I feel like most people
wouldn't use that feature it also has a
small version of this thing DMX anywhere
Mouse so this is the old one the MX
anywhere 2 and this is a new one the 2s
same idea though awesome sensor good
enough to play shooters casually long
battery life I like these a lot
and these MX anywhere might have this
side scroll that the big ones don't
ok last - Microsoft makes a lot of mice
and some of them are terrible but most
of them are pretty good my two favorite
are these two the Microsoft Surface
Mouse and the sculpt comfort Mouse I
like the surface mess a lot it's super
simple
maybe a little too simple for some
people but I love the minimal aesthetic
on it the one thing I dislike about this
thing as a travel mouse though is that
the battery cover is magnetically
attached so it pops off pretty easily it
can fall it in your bag if it pops off
and that's kind of annoying the other
one is a sculpt comfort Mouse and I got
to be honest I think with some looks
pretty ugly it's very comfortable to
hold but it's not a pretty mess the
windows button on the side is touch
sensitive so you can scroll up scroll
down I mean just adds a lot of
functionality and you can press it to
launch the windows button it's
inexpensive and the battery lasts a long
time but my favorite feature by this
mass is actually the horizontal scroll
this is one of the cheapest my set there
with a reliable horizontal scroll that
works right out of the box you don't
need drivers you don't need software
which is really nice now that's not a
feature that everyone uses but if you
like video editing or you have big
database files or Excel files horizontal
scroll is awesome
these are all really good mice and you
can't go wrong choosing any of them but
if I had to pick one as my Universal
recommendation for laptop users it would
be this one the MX anywhere 2 so this is
the older one the 2's is quite a bit
more expensive I think that's like 40%
more expensive this one's so much
cheaper and it's exactly the same in
terms of user experience it's supposed
to have lower dpi and smaller battery
but I'm charging it just as frequently
and the tracking feels exactly the same
between the two and I'm also not using
Logitech flow so yeah this mouse is a
good choice are a lot of people now
there's two other things want to bring
up mouse pads the first one is this
travel mouse pad from Razer it's called
the Razer Kabuto it's basically a really
thin sheet of neoprene it's a cloth
surface mousepad that you can roll up or
keep in between the screen of most
laptops
it doesn't fit macbook so the tolerance
and those are a little bit tighter for
MacBooks I recommend this thing it's
made by 3m it's a hard surface with
great tracking the bottom is sticky to
give it some grip wherever you want to
use it so you can place it behind your
laptop or whatever it's not taped though
it's the microstructure material that
you can just rinse every time it gets
chunky or anything but yeah I've had
this for two years and it looks
basically brand new ok hope you guys
enjoyed this video thumbs if he likes it
subsidy loved it see you guys next time

mouse pads down below in the description
