is a Lenovo yoga 9 20 and this is their
hybrid - one device their fortune in
screen device and this is a product
that's been very well received by the
media by reviewers by critics they enjoy
this thing a lot and I've actually been
using mine for about three weeks I
didn't do a review earlier because I've
actually been using this thing as a
required piece of equipment at work
because I needed a two-in-one tablet
there and I've been using this one and I
would agree that this is a good product
overall I think there's a lot of stuff I
love about it but there's one thing that
really bugs me about this product and
it's the tablet mode now I don't talk
about things that I do like to but first
it's a very well-built device I would
say this is one of the best-built
devices from the novo especially at this
price point they went with good material
choices it's aluminum all around and the
design looks good but there's a lot of
sharp edges around this whole product
and when you use it in tablet form those
sharp edges are really pronounced like
you're looking at basically edges on the
top the bottom the sides
it's sharp all around and I really don't
like holding this device in a tablet
form I feel like a two-in-one tablet
device shouldn't be this sharp on the
edges now the hinge that they use is the
classic Lenovo watchband hinge and it's
awesome it's just built really well this
thing has two major benefits first it
allows you to fold the screen all the
way down to the back I mean that's what
makes it the hybrid tune one device that
it is and it's also a really stiff hinge
in the sense that it doesn't matter what
angle you put the screen at it'll hold
its position and just won't flop down or
whatever it's also nice for like artwork
if you're using the pen on it it doesn't
wobble around too much you can open it
up on the bottom it's just a bunch of
Torx screws but when you get in there
it's a little bit disappointing because
the RAM and the drive are extremely
difficult if not impossible to replace
the drive is super fast which is great
but just make sure that you configure it
the way you want right on the factory
because you won't be able to easily
upgrade the RAM and the storage now the
ports on this thing are good but limited
so you're getting one USB a and two
Thunder well three ports you'll be
charging the device using one of those
ports and they actually support four
lanes of PCIe so if you have an external
GPU you're getting maximum bandwidth
on this device performance is really
good it's running the new 8th gen CPUs
from Intel and the multi-core
applications really flex on these CPUs
but most applications won't feel too
different from the older seventh
generation CDs just because a lot of
applications aren't capable of taking
advantage of the multi-core stuff the
GPU is capable of playing some lighter
games but nothing crazy fan noise and
thermals are also really comfortable
never gets uncomfortably loud or hot the
performance is quite good on this thing
the keyboard is excellent lenovo is
known for making really good keyboards
and this is one of them I got used to
typing on it really quickly and it's
just a comfortable spacious keyboard the
trackpad has good and bad the tracking
is good windows precision drivers can't
go wrong with that the button mechanic
is mediocre it's not a bad click it's
just not as tactile as I'd like it to be
you can hear it it's just more hollow
than I'd like my trackpad speed it's a
fine trackpad just not my favorite
screen 4k panel on this particular one
it comes in a 1080p panel in the base
model but the 4k panel is colorful with
good viewing angles but it's not super
bright see on laptops like dedicated
laptops I guess I'm more forgiving for
not super bright screens but on a tuna
on Harvard device I kind of want to see
a screen that's just brighter because
you often use it as a tablet or as a
tent mode thing and when it's in those
modes you kind of need brighter screens
because you're not always sitting at a
perfectly angled desk and stuff like
that I would have liked to have seen a
brighter panel but this was on bad the
4k screens come with a pen and this
feels actually really similar to the
surface pens at least the new ones 4096
levels of pressure and it's a nice pen
the battery life is really good it's a
nine hour battery with the screen at 250
nits and that's what the 4k panel if
you're running the lower rest screen the
1080p panel my guess is 11 hours maybe
11 and a half hours so full day battery
with ease the webcam looks like this
like the image quality is decent it's
not super high resolution but the colors
look okay the image is actually shot
from the top middle of the screen which
is rare because on a thin bezel screen
like this usually shoots in the bottom
looks up your nose
this looks normal which I like the
speakers are pretty mediocre I don't
love them they don't sound bad it's just
that they're positioned poorly so in
laptop mode they're positioned right on
the bottom they just literally fire
right into the table
with like a millimeter of gap it just
distorts the sound really poorly in tent
mode it's a little better but you
basically have this echo chamber where
the sound bounces back and forth and
again it just distorts the sound it's
also not great in tablet mode because
the speakers are right behind the screen
and the sound just kind of gets
distorted and muffled by the position
again so overall I think this is a good
device a great device if you use it as a
laptop predominantly so if you just
almost never use it for other things
other than a laptop this is a great pick
up I think this is one of the best
two-in-one hybrid devices that have used
when it comes to a laptop device but the
moment you use it as a tablet things
just don't feel comfortable for me I
just don't enjoy the wait I don't enjoy
the ergonomics I certainly don't enjoy
the sharp edges like it's just something
that yeah and I've been using this for
three weeks now pretty regularly I don't
think I'll ever get used to it so if
that bothers you then you probably
shouldn't get this device which makes it
weird because that's what this was for
the whole tune one thing but yeah that's
what we have okay hope you guys enjoyed
this video thumbs we liked it
subs you've loved it see you guys next
