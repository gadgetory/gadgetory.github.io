and this is my fairly extensive review
of the 2015 edition of the Dell XPS 13
now I wanted to preface this review with
just a little bit of information about
myself I do not like desktops for the
past 10 years or so I've tried to do
everything I do on a notebook because I
don't like having two devices that can
do the same thing so occasionally I'll
buy the parts for a desktop put it
together and immediately regret doing it
because I just don't like having two
computers now every time anyone ever
asks me oh you know for the past three
four years
what notebook should I get I invariably
recommend the MacBook Air 13-inch just
because it's it's such a great notebook
in so many elements and if someone can
get used to OSX or if they like OS X I
think it's just a fantastic notebook so
yeah on with this review now you know
how I feel though Dells cardboard boxes
this computer caming yet again another
cardboard box but in a surprising turn
of events within this cardboard box was
a smaller black more premium looking box
which I thought was a nice touch let's
talk about the main design feature the
carbon fiber now I thought I wouldn't be
able to do it justice but surprisingly I
can actually capture the look of the
carbon fiber on camera and you can kind
of see the weave right I hope this shows
up you know how there's a little bit of
a weave you can see like the pattern now
it certainly looks like real carbon
fiber inside like when you touch it it's
got that like very subtle texture to it
but I don't know if it's actually real I
know Dell says it's real but I don't
know for sure
and I don't really feel like grinding
down the resin to see if I can actually
reach the weave but you know what if I
had a few more subs I do it I do it for
you guys now covering the carbon fiber
is a soft touch rubbery grippy stuff it
feels really nice actually and the hinge
over here has a similar soft touch to it
but without the carbon fiber underneath
the top of the notebook is aluminum
it feels pretty premium and it seems
like the inside of the Dell logo here is
filled with some kind of black plastic I
thought it was metal at first but if you
kind of give it a give it a couple
scratches it does feel like it's plastic
the bottom is also aluminum two rubber
feet kind of line the length of the
notebook I tried peeling off the
adhesive just to kind of see how strong
it was and it held pretty well it didn't
peel off so that's kind of nice I have
had notebooks in the past where after a
few months of use it start to peel so I
don't think this will be the case with
this one right in the middle of the back
is this hatch when I saw this hatch the
first thing I thought was wow this is
going to be easy mode Ram upgrades but
you want to know what's behind this
hatch here I'll show you it basically
opens up to a tiny chamber of
disappointment it's two screws and some
serial numbers I mean like why didn't
they build this hatch why did they go
through the elaborate process of
building this intricate metal plate to
cover two screws and some serial numbers
if any of you guys have ideas as to what
it was for please let me know in the
comments because I'm actually pretty
curious turns out you can't upgrade Ram
because it's soldered onto the
motherboard but you can upgrade the SSD
and then there's this vent so this
notebook vents the hotter directly
downwards instead of out the back so I
thought it might actually be an issue at
first because if you're using on your
lap you know this hot air is burning
your legs the whole time but I tried it
out and I'll discuss it later it's it's
actually not bad as it might seem so
when you turn the computer on there's a
power button that has a light the
battery status has lights and the AC
adapter has lights as well it's actually
a little different it's kind of shaped
like a ring it's kind of like curved
LEDs which is kind of nice and it
doesn't change colors in it's charging
state so when you plug it in you don't
know if it's charging or not just by
looking at this LED you have to look on
your computer screen which isn't a big
deal these lights stay on even when it's
unplugged but I actually found it useful
because you can find the adapter tip at
night so if it's like pitch dark and
you're looking for your AC adapter to
charge your computer you don't have to
turn on your light source off you just
look for these LEDs just pick up the the
tip and plug it in something else that
was kind of cool the prongs on the AC
adapter
it tucks in like most AC adapters but
this one can also flip in two directions
so it can flip like this and like this
but I think the idea is that if you ever
have to share a power bar or something
with other devices you can plug it in
like this and I'll take up less space
something else I should have mentioned
earlier are the ports on the machine
there's no HDMI and there's no Ethernet
which isn't a big deal and they also
have a dongle that you can buy to get
these ports back but it's just something
you should keep in mind when purchasing
it the weight of this thing is 2.6
pounds versus a MacBook Air which I
always thought was a really light
notebook that comes in at 2.96 pounds so
even though it's on a substantial weight
difference it's definitely noticeable if
you're looking for it if you put them
side-by-side you can kind of see just
how much smaller it is the screen res I
got with my configuration was 1920 by
1080 there is a higher res version
that's 3200 by 1800 now that one comes
out a little bit of a higher price but
also a decrease the battery life the
screen I got in my configuration is
pretty good but it's nothing to write
home about one thing I did notice though
is if you're using the hardware buttons
the screen doesn't dim down all the way
so you know if you're at work and you're
like browsing reddit instead of doing
work and you kind of want to dim your
screen down to pretend like your
computers off well you can't do that
here there's a webcam at the bottom of
the screen which is a little weird at
first because it kind of catches you in
an unflattering angle it kind of looks
up your nose and it's like looking at
the ceiling but there's no other place
to put a webcam if you're going to have
a bezel this thin so if you video chat
frequently or if you use it for work you
might want to get an external webcam the
keyboard is pretty cool it's got no flex
and it feels pretty nice it's chiclet
keys like a lot of notebooks and I think
everyone's opinion will vary on this but
unless you have really specific keyboard
needs I think you'll grow used to it and
you may even learn to like it
okay the trackpad there is a seriously
annoying problem with this trackpad but
it's something that I think Dell will
resolve shortly basically there's no
software or controller settings I could
find to adjust certain things about the
trackpad so for example the direction of
scroll right now if I'm moving my two
fingers down to scroll down it's
actually moving up I just want to
reverse that and also tap to click I
really don't like tap to click when I
type I find that I'm
constantly pressing the trackpad by
accident but even though it's really
annoying right now I think it'll be a
non-issue shortly the trackpad itself
feels all right it's a little bit of a
sandy or rougher texture than a MacBook
trackpad and the buttons are ever so
slightly harder to click the CPU is new
this year and I think it's one of the
first few notebooks to use Broadwell but
the performance gains as well as the
power savings are minimal at best if
you're looking for massive jump in
performance or power savings you're not
going to find it here I played some
games mostly Blizzard games
I tried Diablo ran fine around 50 frames
per second remember this is only 1920 by
1080 red so if you guys want to pick up
that super high-res 3200 by 1800 your
performance is going to be a lot slower
I love Starcraft 2 but I'm pretty bad at
it I'm in gold League and I probably
shouldn't even be in there but it felt
very comfortable when I played it I was
getting around 50 frames per second and
keyboard actually felt pretty good Oh
Starcraft I love that game I want to
talk a little bit the temperatures and
sound signature of this notebook it gets
a little bit warm not super hot and the
fan kicks in pretty readily now I tried
gaming a little bit on my lap just
because I wanted to test how that bottom
vent would work so on my macbook air the
vent faces away from the computer so
it's kind of when you when it's sitting
in your lap the vent is kind of facing
in the same direction that I'm looking
at it pushes the air seems to push
outwards but this thing seems to be
pushing straight down so I played a game
of Starcraft and it got pretty warm on
my lap but I started to lose and I was
like I can't lose this game so I put it
back on the desk I ended up losing
anyways so it kind of sucked
friggin Starcraft I hate that game in
terms of the fan sound it's really
silent when it's idle it was running
around like 2025 decibels
during games and the fans kick in it
gets around 45 decibel so it's audible
but it's definitely not annoying the
speakers seem to be pretty loud for a
notebook this size now I know this is
subjective so I'm just going to play a
song at maximum volume within the three
different notebooks
okay let's talk battery life Dell
advertises this thing to have a 15 hour
battery life which is even greater than
the 13-inch MacBook Air so the first
thing I did when I got home I charged it
up and I let it drain down and I just
used some casual web browsing and I was
getting about nine and a half hours so I
was doing Windows was doing updates at
the time so I feel like it wasn't a fair
test I charged it up again ran ran it
down again got ten and a half hours this
time and this is because I had lowered
the screen brightness a little bit to
like 60 70 percent so I thought this is
impossible how is Dell saying that they
can get 15 hours from this thing so I
actually tried I basically I turned off
Bluetooth I just browsed like Reddit
with no youtubing and screen brightness
was that like 30% and only then could I
even stretch it out to 12 hours just a
little bit over 12 hours and then
afterward ran out of batteries I thought
what am i doing this is this is not how
you use a computer I feel I felt like I
was drinking internet from a tiny little
teacup so this is not how the Internet
should be used this is not how Dell
should be advertising their battery
power so maybe just the battery needs
time to kind of tune up or tune in or
whatever but I'm not - I'm not too
pleased with this 15 hour proclamation
so far something else to note I got7
half hours watching Breaking Bad
directly from my hard drive yeah just
straight up movies seven half hours I
think you'll get about 10 or 11 hours of
realistic use which is still pretty good
considering that's more than a full
workday but it's still a little shy from
the 15 hours that was advertised so I'm
a little bit bummed about that as for my
overall thoughts on this thing I I think
Dell did an amazing job they hit it out
of the park because this is a
carbon-fibre notebook at $1000 now this
the configuration I got was the 128 gig
drive eight gigs of ram in the i5 with
as I mentioned before the 1920 1080
screen so at that price point to get the
materials that they've put into this and
the finish that they've put into this is
really good so I think it's a good value
and I would wreck
and this to basically anyone who asked
me for a notebook recommendation right
now in early 2015 I'm pretty sure Dell
will be putting out a 2015 version of
the XPS 15 and I'll be sure to do a
review of that when it comes out and
yeah I hope you guys liked this review
it was really long I hope it wasn't too
long but I feel like a notebook of this
caliber really deserved a pretty
extensive review so I hope you guys
enjoyed I did
it was nice I'll see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
