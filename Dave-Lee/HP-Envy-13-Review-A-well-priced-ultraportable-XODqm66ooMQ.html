and this is my review of the HP Envy 13
T so at twelve point nine millimeters
this is the thinnest laptop that HP has
available right now it's obviously super
thin it's got good specs and it's
reasonably well priced
let's take a look it comes in a well
padded box and you get the laptop and AC
adapter and some pamphlets the top
surface is aluminum it feels premium it
feels durable and it's a nice texture to
hold the bottom of the device is also
aluminum and there's some rubber feet
here a couple intake vents and if you
remove the screws including the two
underneath the rubber feet you can
remove the bottom panel there isn't a
lot you can do inside here since the RAM
is soldered on but you can replace the
MT drive if you want but it's just nice
to have the ability to open up your
laptop if you need to going around the
sides on the Left we have a nice and
deep SD card slot I use b3 port and an
audio jack and on the right we have the
power socket a full size HDMI port and
then two more USB 3 ports the laptop
weighs 2.81 pounds so it's very
comfortable to hold even one-handed and
it's an all metal body frame so the
build quality is pretty good the screen
is very rigid it's actually one of the
more sturdier screens I've tried to
twist around the keyboard and the
chassis have a little bit of flex but
it's kind of expected when you consider
how thin the devices the hinge feels
sturdy and the hinge mechanism raises
the back of the laptop up a bit when you
open the lid just to kind of help out
with cooling so the unit I have here is
the HP Envy 13 T D 0 0 0 it has a 6th
generation skylake I 5 running at 2.3
gigahertz 13.3 inch quad HD screen
integrated intel graphics 8 gigs of ram
128 gigs of solid-state storage and it
goes for around $900 if you get the
lower res version at 1080p it'll save
you around $50 the inside has the same
aluminum finish as the exterior the
keyboard area is spacious and I got used
to it quickly but the key travel is a
little short at one point two
millimeters and I don't love the layout
of the arrow keys but overall this is a
very nice keyboard it's easy to type on
it's easy to see when it's backlit and
just overall a very comfortable keyboard
to use
there is a fingerprint reader down here
which you can use to unlock the device
it actually works really well it's quick
and accurate the glass trackpad down
here is also good I wish it was a little
taller from top to bottom but the
texture is great
tracking never skipped in the buttons
feel really solid when they're clicked
it's a pretty good trackpad all around
the screen is a quad HD IPS panel
running at 3200 by 1800 it's not a touch
panel but it still has that glossy
finish but thankfully the screen does
get bright enough so you can use it
comfortably even in bright environments
it has a pretty thick bezel around the
screen which I don't love but the image
quality and the screen makes up for it
it's really high-res it's good contrast
good viewing angles it's got good color
accuracy coming out of the box there is
a webcam up top which doesn't look bad
this is what it looks like the Bang &amp;amp;
Olufsen speakers are on the sides of the
keyboards and I was actually surprised
by how clearly sound like the bass isn't
particularly present but it can get loud
and the mid sound really clear for
notebook speakers they did a really good
job with these in terms of performance
the read speed of the drive is fast but
the write speeds are slower than I'd
like them to be the system still feels
quick overall but if you're doing things
like video edits I would highly
recommend getting an external drive the
core i5 CPU is easily going to handle
any kind of school or work related
projects and multitasking that you throw
at it now in terms of gaming light games
like csgo and mobos we'll hit 50 to 55
frames per second on lowest graphics
settings at 1080p if you want higher
frame rates you're gonna have to drop
the resolution a bit but more demanding
games like fallout 4 and Rainbow six
siege they're still playable but frame
rates are lower at around 40 frames per
second again lowering the resolution
will get you better frame rates but it's
tough to break 60 frames per second with
those games but really demanding games
like Witcher 3 or GTA 5 those just
aren't playable they're too choppy
you really need a dedicated graphics
chip for those the fans are always
running so it makes a little bit of
noise at idle around 30 decibels and
under extended load it can hit high 30s
now there is an option in the BIOS to
turn off the fan on idle and I've had it
off for a couple of weeks and thermally
it doesn't seem to make a difference on
idle it's still cool and the moment you
put it under load the fans kick in right
away so I'll still getting comfortable
temper
under maximum load it never got hot the
45 watt AC adapter is pretty compact and
it's used to charge a 45 watt hour
battery inside the laptop now the first
few days I was using this device I was
getting around five to five and a half
hours of battery life with screen at
around 70 percent brightness and this is
just with regular use watching this
Netflix doing some work some simple
stuff it is a smaller battery and we are
powering a pretty high resolution screen
but that's a pretty short battery life
for an ultrabook
now if you go into the BIOS and you do
adjust that fan so it's not always on
during idle it bumps the battery life up
to about seven and a half hours I still
wouldn't consider that a long battery
life but it is better ok the HP Envy 13
t it's a super thin aluminum Ultrabook
with good build quality the 13 inch quad
HD screen isn't a touchscreen but it's
bright with good colors the speakers are
nice and clear the keyboard on the
trackpad both perform well and are very
comfortable to use but the trackpad is a
little small on the inside the skylake
core i5 the integrated graphics can
easily handle school and work-related
tasks and it can play some casual games
the eight gigs of ram are soldered on
but the mt storage is upgradable and
powering this all is a battery that
lasts around five hours of regular use
if you don't turn off the fan in the
BIOS okay if you're looking for a metal
ultrabook that's thin and lights with
good build quality this should be on
your shortlist there are things I don't
love about it I wish the right speed on
that drive was faster and I wish the
battery life was longer but overall it's
a good performer it's extremely portable
and it's well priced
that's the end of this review hope you
guys liked it thumbs if you did subs if
you loved it it's been nice I'll see you
guys next time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
