and this is a video comparing what I
think are the best ultra books available
in early to mid 2016 now before I go any
further there are other good ultra books
out there some of them have even
reviewed on this channel but because of
other like pricing or general
availability or just not being good
enough I didn't include them in this
smaller group so the cutoff for this
kind of ultra book thing was 3 pounds if
you're above 3 pounds you didn't make
the team
anything under that was eligible so
first up we have the asus ux305 coming
in at 2.6 pounds comes in a couple
variants a Core M version and a more
powerful core i5 version which I have
here next we have the Razer Blade
stealth 2.75 pounds one of the more
interesting laptops that came out this
year because of the razor core that can
connect to it the Lenovo yoga 900 2.8
pounds it's the only two and one device
I have in this video it's also the
device with the most plastic and it's
built but that helps keep its weight
down next up is the Dell XPS 13 also 2.8
pounds it's a mixture of metal and
carbon fiber this is one of Dells best
products and years and then we have the
HP Envy 13 that's also 2.8 pounds but
it's a little bit thinner so these are
the windows-based ultrabooks for this
video and then we have a couple Apple
products the 12-inch MacBook coming in
at 2.0 3 pounds it's the lightest of the
bunch it's also the least powerful
rocking a Core M I almost didn't want to
include this in this video but the right
user it can still be a pretty powerful
ultrabook and then lastly the aging
13-inch MacBook Air 2.9 pounds we're
expecting a refresh or like a complete
dump pretty soon but I got to put this
thing in here because it's like the og
ultrabook when this guy came out it made
the competition open up their eyes and
everyone bumped up their game and
basically spawned all of these things so
what I'm going to do is go over some
categories and kind of give you my top
pick from the bunch and then a runner-up
or two depending on the category the
best build quality has to go to the two
Mac books these things are incredibly
well built they're super durable I mean
people have had these things since 2008
and they're still kicking ass the rigid
chassis super solid hinge and these
things are tanks the runner-up is the
Dell XPS 13 aluminum exterior carbon
fiber interior it's also very rigid now
keep in mind the rest of these
ultrabooks have very good build quality
I mean they wouldn't be in this video if
they didn't they're all-metal builds but
the MacBook and the XPS 13 have the best
build none of these devices have
upgradeable RAM they're all soldered on
because that's just apparently how you
keep these things thin but all the
windows-based machines have upgradable
em to storage some are harder to access
than others the HP Envy you need to
remove the adhesive feet to access the
screws the razor blade stealth has a
pretty delicate ribbon cable to deal
with but if you're careful they're all
upgradable and none of the MacBooks
however have upgradable storage they're
all a little slippery nothing too bad
the razor blade stealth shows
fingerprints pretty easily and not only
are they super visible but even if you
wipe it with a damp cloth these smudges
to a show now some people don't care
about this kind of stuff I do a little
so I'm pretty happy that D brand makes
some skins for the razor blade stealth
they also make them for the XPS 13 and
the MacBook so I'll put a link to them
below and I think they look really nice
aside from the low res MacBook Air all
of these have really great displays the
best-looking display is probably the
fork a razor blade panel it looks
awesome but keep in mind you got to
power all of those pixels and you got to
process all those pixels so on a small
ultrabook like this unless you need 4k
I'd skip it my favorite is the infinity
display on the XPS 13 it gives you a
very immersive experience and it keeps
the footprint really small the downside
is that the webcam is in the bottom
quarter and you may not look your best
from that angle the HP Envy also has a
really good display and so does the
12-inch MacBook if you need a really
sharp looking webcam look if that's
something you care about the Razer Blade
stealth is probably the best-looking of
the bunch the rest of the webcams are
kind of mediocre but I mean the majority
of users aren't too picky about these
okay the best sounding speakers 12-inch
MacBook incredibly good speakers
especially for its size the runner-up
would be the HP Envy those project up
and they sound pretty good the rest of
the speakers are kind of similar I like
a b-minus I mean that's just the nature
of Ultrabook speakers they're very thin
so it's tough to fit a great speaker in
the best keyboard the MacBook Air I
think this is one of the reasons
why this device is still as popular as
it is I mean an oppressed people on day
one and then six years later it's still
a great keyboard for an ultrabook and in
my opinion it's better than even the
newer 12-inch MacBook keyboard the rest
of the keyboards are pretty good the
Razer Blade stealth has Razer chroma
which lets you customize the keyboard
with some lighting it's very cool at
first but it loses its novelty quickly
you kind of get desensitized to it if I
had to pick a runner-up for the keyboard
it would be the yoga 900 it has a very
nice feeling keystroke great travel good
spring back but the layout is a little
off or seriously if you use any of these
for a while you'll get comfortable with
them the track pads on MacBooks are the
best they really are the gold standard
for laptop track pads the runner-up is
the updated XPS 13 that uses the Windows
10 built-in driver it's much improved
over the previous generation drivers
everything else is pretty similar glass
track pads that aren't perfect one last
thing to note the first gen ux305 track
pads that I tested had some issues but
the new ones are improved and you don't
have that double clicking issue anymore
none of these ultrabooks are going to be
like hardcore performance machines I
wouldn't want to do regular 4k video
editing on it but they can play some
lightweight games most of them are
running i5 6200 use the razor blade
stealth has an i7 6500 Yi so it's got a
little bit more cache and a slightly
faster clock not a big difference in
performance though the Razer Blade
stealth will be able to connect to the
razor core for some more serious gaming
now in theory the coral Beals it
connects to other laptops that have a
Thunderbolt 3 connection but developing
the drivers and BIOS updates to make
that connection happen won't be really
quick or easy so if you need to get an
ultrabook that can connect immediately
when the Razer core comes out go with
the stealth the other thing is that the
XPS 13 has a new configuration that has
the iris 540 graphics chip it comes in a
gold color if you're into that sort of
thing but the iris 540 is actually a
very respectable integrated chip I'd say
it's on par with the Nvidia 940 m review
of that coming out soon you should
probably subscribe all right let's talk
about thermals and noise when they're
idling they're all really quiet under
load these ultrabooks are silent these
ones are pretty quiet and then these
ones are a little bit
they're all running dual-core chips and
they're all properly cooled so none of
them get uncomfortably hot or anything
even the i7 chip on the razor is
properly cooled and this is all of them
under load valve you really depends on
what you use your Ultrabook for but
Evette choose one for like best overall
value it be the asus ux305 it goes for
$750 for an i-5 it's wellspect and it's
a great overall device there is no
backlit keyboard though runner up
surprisingly the Razer Blade stealth
which is crazy because it's a razer
product but for the tech you get in
there with the RGB keyboard the great
screen the i7 the ability to connect it
to a core for 999 dollars it's a really
solid so even if you have no intention
of ever plugging this thing up for
gaming it's a really well priced
Ultrabook you just got to ignore that
big bezel the top prize for battery life
goes to the 13-inch MacBook Air it's an
11 or 12 hour battery partially because
it's a low res screen but also MacBooks
a really good optimization to just
slowly sip on battery so the 12-inch
MacBook also has good battery life the
runner-up is the XPS 13 it'll last a
full day of work with like 9 or 10 hours
of battery life the ux305 also has
pretty good battery life you'll get
around 6 to 7 hours on that one as for
my top pick overall for like Best
ultrabook is no such thing as a perfect
ultrabook but the one that comes closest
is the XPS 13 it's a very good performer
looks good the built well fantastic
screen pretty good inputs and it's like
a good price now the close second is the
razor blade stealth it almost got first
place but once you compare the display
bezels I really can't give a thick
display bezel a first place I was like
best ultrabook simply because the
infinity display look that much better
but in terms of value you're getting an
i7 on the base model so you're getting a
slightly better performer at the base
price that's the end of this video I
hope you guys liked it thumbs if you
liked it subs if you loved it it's been
nice I'll see you guys next time
oh if you want individual reviews of any
of the laptops in this video I've done
most of them all of them
most of them I'll link them below</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
