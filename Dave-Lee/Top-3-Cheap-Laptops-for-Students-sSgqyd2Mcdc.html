is a video on some inexpensive laptops
for students and I know you can get some
very cheap laptops out there for like
200 bucks that have Windows 10 on them
but those laptops I feel like they
wouldn't last for regular use for what a
student does day in day out putting it
out of your bag using it everyday those
are not good laptops I feel for students
so what I have in front of me are three
very well-built well priced laptops that
all do different things these aren't
competitors there's not going to be a
comparison of them it's just three
individual laptops and depending on what
you do as a student or what you want to
do with your laptop you might be
interested in one of these and I also
have a couple other side pics as well
but the three main ones are the asus
ux305 and the lenovo 320 s so let's
start off with the Acer first I've done
a full review of this thing before this
is a great device for students who want
to get a laptop for school but also want
to do some light gaming basically it's
an inexpensive regular looking 15-inch
laptop that can handle current gaming
titles reasonably well because of the
video card it has an MX 150 from Nvidia
which is kind of like the GT 1030 and
most current titles are very playable on
this machine if you want a more detailed
review I'll link my video below the
configuration with the MX 150 cost $600
and it's a great laptop for the money
now there were two things like might be
an issue for students first is the
battery life I'm only getting around
five hours of battery life for this so
if you want to bring it to school and
you have a full day of class you're
gonna have to bring your charger with
you the second thing is that it's not
super thin or light it's not like a
really thick gaming laptop but it has
some size to it now if you are looking
for something that's a little thinner
and lighter that is still a good price
point it's this thing Lenovo 320 s so
this thing starts at I think $550 for
the base model it's a full aluminum
build but the chassis has some flex to
it the bottom panel is easy to open up
for upgrading the brand and storage the
screen is a little dim and the base
model isn't a 1080p screen it's not bad
though videos and pictures still look
really sharp at normal viewing distances
the keyboard is comfortable to use but
the keystrokes are little softer than
I'd like and there's no backlighting the
trackpad uses Windows precision drivers
which are really
and the battery life is surprisingly
good as well and getting around seven
hours but this thing comes in couple
configurations starts at around 500 550
depending on sales but great device for
students okay next up we have the ACS
ux302 the ux305 you in the past and this
thing is a surprisingly good laptop for
the money now it's not super cheap it's
700 bucks
this thing has great build quality and a
pretty simple design it has two regular
USB ports a USB C and a micro HDMI it
has a good screen 1080p matte finish and
it gets pretty bright it also has a nice
backlit keyboard and windows precision
trackpad tracking is really good on the
surface it's just a nice texture but the
button clicks are a little shallow they
don't feel bad though just really short
travel the speakers on this thing are
really good they're located on the
bottom and I mean for this price it's
kind of crazy how good these speakers
sound they have Harman Kardon branding
but usually having branding like this
for a laptop speaker doesn't mean
anything they usually sound very average
but these actually sound good
it still doesn't have strong bass but
it's a very clean audio and you'll be
happy with these speakers it is a 13
inch screen it's a little bit smaller
than the other two laptops I've
mentioned so far so depending what you
do or what you want to do with your
laptop this might be too small but if
you're looking for a 13 inch device
you're on the money the one thing I
don't like about this device is actually
the fan noise it comes on way more often
than you'd like it to and when it does
it's pretty loud and actually comes on
when you're doing very fun intensive
stuff like watching a YouTube video or
browsing the web it's kind of weird
because this is something that software
should be able to fix but it's been out
for several months and there hasn't been
a change so we'll see now for the price
for $700 it's not something that is for
someone looking for the cheapest laptop
right there are going to be cheaper
laptops on this but if you're in the
market for some of that's kind of
higher-end
like an XPS 13 or an HP Envy those are
like 900 bucks or more this thing is a
lot less but still a really good laptop
now the other thing I want to mention
this is not part of the three that I was
originally going to talk about is kind
of like an off pick so this is the Dell
Inspiron 13 7000 now this is a two in
one device I'm not a big fan of toon 1
devices I find that they're a little bit
of cumbersome for everyday use as a
student but I know that a lot of my
audience are crazy about tune one
devices just because they're so
versatile
this one's $650 and I think it's the
best foldable tune one device at this
price point now there's a lot of
inexpensive tune one devices and a lot
of them suck just they're not good as
laptops they're even worse of tablets
but this one is very usable in both
forms the keyboard in particular is
surprisingly good for the price it feels
like honestly it feels like they're XPS
keyboard it's really good
trackpad is good it's a Windows
precision driver the whole thing has
excellent build quality lots of metal
impressive speakers for the price it's a
great two and one
the two things that I don't love about
it though are the screen and the battery
life the screen feels a little dim and I
really wish it was brighter because this
is such a good device for media
consumption but because of the dimmer
screen you can't use it outdoors readily
and the battery life could be better I'm
only getting about five hours of life on
this thing but for a cheap but well
builds - and one this is my top pick so
the last thing I want to talk about are
some devices that are well they're not
really on the table here it's kind of
like a theoretical device so right now
the eighth generation CPUs from Intel
have been launched Intel's coffee Lake
and those 8th gen CPUs are kind of
trickling down into all these devices
and everything is getting refreshed so
the seventh generation KB Lake CPUs
those prices are coming down a little
bit but there are some sixth generation
skylake CPU laptops that are
significantly cheaper and they're still
available on Amazon and some of those
devices are barely a year old so they're
actually quite new still it's just a
matter of perception of whether or not
you want the brand-new one that's coming
out or one that's a year and a few
months old ok I'll link all this stuff
below and I'll link some sixth
generation skylake CPU laptops down
below as well as some of those have
amazing pricing like this 510 s that I
have over here but yeah hope you guys
enjoyed this video thumbs if you liked
it
subs if you loved it see you guys next
