today is Amazon Prime Day
where things are often on sale
on Amazon now the truth is
the sales that appear on Amazon
Prime Day have gotten not as
enticing over the years but
this thing holy smokes
this is like okay this is a
thousand-dollar laptop they're
selling for 999$ the original
price is 1200 bucks and at that
original price I did a review on
this thing I was like this is at
twelve hundred dollars one of
the best values you can get
probably the best gaming laptop
you can get for 1200 dollars
and then at 999 at its
current price it is like you
if you're interested in gaming
at all desktop gaming
laptop gaming, any kind of
gaming and you have a
thousand dollars like seriously
consider this because so
here's why on the market
right now there are three
or four brands that make
laptops that are considered
to be competitive in that
twelve hundred dollar
gaming laptop price point
so we have stuff from Lenovo
Asus Acer makes this one obviously
there's stuff from Dell and HP
they're all really good and
they're all like competing with
each other for price but even when
this thing was at 1200 dollars
this thing stood out as being
slightly better than the rest
it's got 144Hz it's screen
it's got a GTX 1660Ti basically
the components that they've
used on this thing are matched
really well with each other
they performed like there's no
bottle necking there's no
compromises on this device to
hit that 1200-dollar price point
there are no name barebones
laptops like Clevo and Tong Fang
that are priced even more than
this thing is so remember last year
Walmart was selling this laptop
called the OP gaming laptop
which was 1400 dollars at launch
but because everyone criticized
its price they drop it down to 999
they sold out really quickly
a lot of people missed out on
that sale this is the same price
but it's even better like this
is a better sale or a better value
than that Walmart device was
and people were sad when that
thing was sold out you can cash
in on this there's three days on
the sale and I can't recommend
this thing enough at that
price point so it's not a
perfect laptop if you watch my
review you'll get more details
on it but there's things like
dislike of it I don't love the
logo on it like it's pretty it's
not like super obnoxious but it's
not like a simple muted design
and the battery life is a little short
it's like a four to maybe
four-and-a-half-hour battery
but at a thousand dollars
I really don't think you're gonna
get a better price for a gaming
laptop for the rest of the year
maybe on Black Friday you'll see
some stuff that's like comparable
to this but yeah highly recommend
this thing right now other devices
they have that I saw on amazon
that were kind of neat the S10
and the S9 are on a pretty solid seal
the S9 in particular this is a
350 dollars phone right now like
if you think about how much these
phones cost to produce these things
at least 150 or 200 dollars to manufacture
so for them to sell for 350 on Amazon
is a killer price but I wouldn't
really consider these phones unless
you were planning on getting a phone
anyways like this thing however
the Helios 300 like even if you were
not intent on getting a gaming laptop
for the summer and you are planning
on building a desktop like can you
actually build a desktop with this
kind of performance and 144Hz screen
and windows license and all the
peripherals to make it a fully
functional computer for that
much cheaper than 999
like I'm sure it can be done
but it's certainly not easy and
you won't have the portability of
something like this so can't recommend
this thing enough man Helios 300 if
you're looking for a gaming laptop
hop on this okay hope you guys
enjoy this video thumbs if you liked it
sub if you love it see you guys next time
and i'll drop a link to the review video
