always been a fan of small form-factor
pcs I've always have the thing for like
tiny pcs just like really powerful
computers in these really small form
factors and well it's why I continued to
use this thing the 2013 Mac Pro I like
it because even though it's a 10 core
CPU and it's quite powerful it's still
really quiet and still super small and
even though the GPU is like old and not
very powerful the CPU in there is still
really capable for doing multi-core
stuff which I like I've been trying to
find a Windows equivalent I've been
searching for a very long time and I
think I finally found something that's
really close this is a Trident 3 so what
makes this thing special is the fact
that it's a very very small computer
it's 5 and 1/2 liters which is very
similar in size to the Mac Pro I'll pull
it back and frame again so you can see
it in comparison
obviously the I mean the shape is
completely different but just in terms
of volume this is around 5 and 1/2
liters this is around 5 and 1/2 liters
now the official volume from MSI's
website is four point seven two liters
and technically it is because they're
measuring the physical space it occupies
but if you look at five and a half
because I'm including the angular
cutaway gap on each side regardless it's
a small case and this is the Arctic
Edition we make another version that's
all black it's like the regular one has
a GTX 1060 has a smaller power supply
everything else is about the same but
because the GPU is weaker than that one
I waited for this one to come forward to
the video design-wise its angular and
boxy I mean some people might love this
look I prefer something a little more
clean a little more minimal but I like
it just because it's small and because
it's white and because it has a single
RGB light for just know you can play
with colors and stuff but overall and
some of the design is good just not
perfect to me the best thing about this
PC is it's five-and-a-half reader size
now there's other ITF cases that are
also really small the one that comes to
mind that's probably the most popular in
terms of like small IPS cases is the N
case m1 it's a 12-meter case there's
another ITX case that's even smaller
it's the Dan case a for SFX and that
thing is seven litres but it's really
difficult to get your hands on it the
msi tried in three is five and a half
liters it's
small you can open it up it's not
recommended because there's a sticker
that says you shouldn't but when you do
you have access to the RAM to CPU and
the GPU you can put up to 32 gigs of ram
in here there's also upgradable storage
but you have to go in underneath there's
an m2 stick and there's a two and a half
inch SATA drive okay has to be
completely honest when msi first sent
this thing to me i thought there's a
desktop i7 in here does a gtx 1070 in
here in a case that's very small this
can't go very well it's got to be either
super hot or super loud or a combination
of the tube it turns out the performance
is really strong it's not the fastest
thing out there but most triple-a titles
you're looking at wicked smooth frame
rates on ultra graphics at 1080p and
some weaker titles will let you play
with good frame rates in 4k but most
importantly every single game that I
enjoy playing to overwatch and player
unknowns battleground those two games
run incredibly well in the system I'm
able to stay near 120 frames per second
with really nice looking graphics
we are obviously works well with this
because it's gtx 1070 any of the ports
up front for easy access if it's going
to a home theater setup or something
video editing is also really nice on
this machine i did my last few videos on
this and well i'll be doing this video
on this machine as well it's a great
performer so the big question is how
good is the thermal performance because
cooling a pc of this size with this kind
of performance is not an easy task and a
lot of small form-factor enthusiasts
struggle with that whole like did we
make it louder and make it cool better
or do we keep it quieter and let it run
hotter but these guys they did a pretty
good job looking at the temperatures the
idle and low temperatures are a little
warm nothing bad it's definitely in spec
of what intel recommends and I'm not
seeing any kind of thermal throttling
but it does run warm the good thing is
that the fans are incredibly quiet when
it's idle it's almost silent but even
under load this is one of the quietest
systems I've used with this kind of
performance they're doing this through
good automated fan control but if
there's one complaint that had about the
thermal management I just wish this
thing had user controllable fans like I
wanna be able to ramp it up and down
depending on whatever I'm doing and it
doesn't have that so yeah it comes with
a mouse and keyboard with controllable
RGB lighting it's not my cup of tea but
they're actually pretty comfortable to
use it's a membrane keyboard feels nice
even though it's free I'm not gonna lie
it feels better than most membrane
keyboards made by big-name accessory
makers the mouse feels less awesome but
it's not bad it's got a weight
adjustable system but either one of
these peripherals are just kind of like
bonus accessories they're very viable I
just wouldn't go competitive MLG with
them the AC adapter is big it's 330
watts but it's just how the Trident is
able to keep its size the power supply's
external and you can always hide it to
keep your setup relatively clean the
Arctic Edition of the Trident 3 starts
at $1500 which is in my opinion a very
fair price for what you're getting I
mean obviously you can build a regular
PC with the gtx 1070 for cheaper than
this there's no doubt if you don't care
about the size of your case you can get
similar performance of this for 1213
hundred bucks it would have better
upgrade ability down the line than this
but it would be a heck of a lot larger
so for em aside
stick all the stuff into a five and a
half liter case and include a mouse and
a keyboard for $1,500 I think it's fair
so some final notes I've toured with
several small gaming pcs the coarser one
is an awesome machine very quiet very
well cooled but it's a little big at 12
liters
the ACS gr8 series or great I'm not sure
how to pronounce it it's a pretty
powerful system but the fans are way too
loud and though tech makes some small
form-factor boxes which are pretty quiet
and small even smaller than this thing
but they're running lower wattage I 5
CPUs which don't really take advantage
of the GPU and they're not as good for
video editing which is what I'm trying
to do so overall I really like this
system if you can tell I have a few
complaints about it like I don't love
the design
I wish the thermal controls were a
little better and there is some bloat
we're not a ton but if you don't like
removing that stuff it is their overall
grade system now so most people who pick
up something like this or kind of in the
market for something like this they
would stick it in their media center
like under their TV kind of like the
console like to replace a ps4 or
something I'm one of the weird people
that I would use this as my regular PC
because I like my PC small and silent
and I'm just weird like that but for
people that are just in the market for
this kind of device this is a good one
alright hope you guys enjoyed this video
thumbs be liked it some of you loved it
I'll see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
