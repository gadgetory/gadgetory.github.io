been using the same few MacBook
accessories of the past little ball for
the past like year year and a half and I
wanted to see if we could do a little
better I wanted to see if there were
like better versions of the ones I've
been using or just like better products
that kind of did the same kind of thing
so I went to Amazon checked out the
ratings and just like bought a bunch of
stuff and here are five MacBook upgrades
that I was able to come across the first
one I know this sounds a little silly
but this is important to me it's the
case and think this is something that a
lot of people kind of overlook when it
comes to laptops I use a skin on it
which is great I mean it looks cool but
it doesn't give a ton of protection the
case that I'm using in the past is this
it's made by initech it's a great case
the one thing I don't like about it
though is that after a while it starts
to pill this is actually the third one
that I've purchased from them just the
material it's felt it's nice but it
actually starts to get fuzzy and just
kind of gross looking so replace it
I won't find something little bit
different I found this this thing's
rated four and a half star in Amazon and
there's two things that I really like
about it the first one is the inner
lining it's got this like flap on the
inside that protects the edge of your
laptop so oftentimes if you have a
zippered case you'll put your laptop in
and the zipper will just rub against the
case because it's just it's literally
right against the metal or plastic
zipper and I'll just rub and rub and
eventually it can wear down the side of
your laptop this one has a flap in it
the MacBook tucks underneath and it just
protects it from that zippered edge the
other thing I like about it is the
actual zipper itself it's made by a good
company so zippers are often overlooked
when it comes to just cases because you
can stick some really cheap zippers on
these things and get away with it this
is a YKK zipper it's like that japanese
brand super popular brand but it's just
like a very durable well-built case I
highly recommend this okay
next item is something that I had high
hopes for so if you'll remember the old
MacBooks head magazine it's something
that I think a lot of people enjoyed and
something that kind of made MacBooks
what they were there have been a lot of
products that have kind of tried to
emulate that or replicate that
experience with some kind of magnetic
connection on the USBC thing this was
one of them and I had really high hopes
for this that this video was actually
gonna be about how this was an awesome
upgrade I've had this for three weeks
now and it died literally like 12 hours
ago this thing died just before made
this video so I no longer recommend any
of
this is actually the fourth or fifth
version like some kind of USBC magnetic
thing that I've tried on the MacBook
they all seem to fail over time I've
tried the Griffin one which was bulky
and expensive I've tried some cheaper
ones some moderately priced ones and
finally I tried this one was made by
bass yes or something like that and like
come on man I don't know why they can't
make these things properly but the idea
of it seems simple right it just seems
like a little work but I've tried so
many they all don't seem to work I don't
recommend any of them unfortunately okay
moving along we have this thing is
something you've seen in a lot of my
videos there's various companies that
make this the more popular one is
Satechi I've used that one this one's
made by kwak kwak or something like that
they're all weird names but they all do
the same kind of thing it's good use BC
hub that plugs into your computer and
for the most part they're pretty good
there's one issue that occurs with them
though is that if you use the hub
heavily like if you have a media drive
connected to this for a video edit it
can get quite hot so I found something
that was significantly better so this is
made by its brand name once
Kingston it's like a fancy brand it's 80
bucks so these are normally like 60
bucks it's a little bit more and it's
quite a bit larger but the thermal
performance on this thing is
significantly better this thing barely
gets warm so if you use a hub heavily
and you kind of need to have your files
transferring through these things like
non-stop I highly recommend picking up
one of these because relying on this
like I've had edits to just stop in the
middle of it because this thing gets too
warm so Kingston nucleon that's not bad
name okay moving along this thing we've
seen this a lot of my videos I really
like this batteries made by tanker it's
got power deliveries you can charge
laptops and stuff like that it's a good
battery pack but I found something
that's a little bit better this is made
by a company called jakhary and what
makes this thing kind of special is that
it's got a power outlet built into it so
it's got your standard stuff like use ba
use PC and it charges via a USB C it's
got like an indicator whatever but the
power outlet allows you to connect your
AC adapter to charge this thing
significantly faster than it would be if
you're just using power delivery through
the USB so a regular battery pack will
charge MacBooks reasonably fast but when
you have a power outlet like this it
actually charges it as if it's plugged
into the wall it's awesome so it's a
little bit bigger I actually think it's
like the same kind of weight this thing
holds twenty thousand milliamp hours and
change this is like twenty six both are
good but he
need a battery pack that can power your
laptop while it's running full tilt like
if you're doing 3d stuff or video
editing on the go and you want to be
able to just give it extra juice without
an outlet this is your choice okay
moving along we have the cheapest item
in this whole video it's the nine dollar
USB adapters made by a company called
nanda or Nunda I think it's nonde the
one I've used before is this regular
standard USB dongle which is fine this
one is a lot smaller and when it's
plugged up to your laptop it's just a
cleaner look I'd much prefer this
aesthetic over the whole dongle life
thing it doesn't have a perfect review
like it's a four star review on Amazon I
think a lot of that comes from the older
model like there was a 2016 version of
this that was not very reliable and a
little bit bigger but the new ones
two thumbs up okay I looked for an
upgrade from the mouse and there really
isn't any you've seen this a lot in my
videos like the MX anywhere 2 s it's a
great Mouse they have them for like 50
55 bucks now but you can't get anything
better at least in my opinion this is
seriously a great Mouse okay that about
wraps it up these are all like little
upgrades that I was trying to bring the
my MacBook experience little bit better
and there you have it some of them most
of them are good this one or any of
these magnetic cables are terrible okay
hope you guys enjoyed this video thumbs
we liked it subs you loved it see you
guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
