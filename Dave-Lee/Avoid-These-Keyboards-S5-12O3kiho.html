looking forward to for quite a while
they announced them in the fall of 2018
and they showcase some demos of them at
CES these are the SK 630 and the SK 650
from Coolermaster they're very
nice-looking keyboards and the whole
purpose of this particular keyboard is
that it's a low profile just
aesthetically pleasing keyboard and they
look really good I think a lot of people
are gonna be interested in these devices
because of how good they look now I got
these about two weeks ago I've been
using them since then and my initial
impressions of these particular keepers
were kind of lukewarm but I thought I'd
try to use them for a while try to get
used to them and the more I use them and
the more I kind of like open them up and
play with them I realized that these are
just not good keyboards and I just don't
think most people should be buying them
or this particular type of keyboard
let me explain these are marketed as low
profile keyboards and just right off the
bat if you compare it to a real low
profile keyboard this is another
keyboard I'll talk about later but this
to me is an actual low profile keyboard
it's called the key cron k1 this is like
half the height of this the Coolermaster
is noticeably taller and it just no
longer feels like a low profile keyboard
if anything it feels very similar to
just like a regular keyboard so right
off the bat it's not really a
low-profile keyboard and the reason for
that I guess the best way to explain
this is to open it up I probably should
have done this in advance this keyboard
has a lot of screws I think it's like
1215 screws most keyboards that have
opened up are significantly easier to
get into it's not hard it's just time
consuming
now if you end up buying this keyword
and you do want to open it up just a tip
there's two screws underneath the space
bar and then there's another screw on
the bottom of the keyboard underneath
the escape button so if top left of the
keyword it's underneath the rubber foot
okay
so on the inside I just want to draw
attention to two things the PCB is
pretty clean like there's no like super
sloppy solder or anything like that it's
like a no it's coolermaster they usually
make good keyboards and they've done a
good job on the PCB I do wish that the
USB connection so it uses use PC which
is great but the actual connector is not
directly on the PCB so they've actually
had to have a secondary kind of piece
and that makes the whole device a little
bit more elevated which is why the
device isn't as low profile as it could
or should be and the other thing I'll
just demonstrate this real quickly this
connector it's use PC it's technically
Universal but it's a relatively
proprietary cable size like you can't
stick most use PC cables to this the one
that include is perfectly fit obviously
but I've tried several other USB C
cables and not all of them fit so just
keep that in mind now another thing I
noticed is that at the bottom of the
keyboard tray you'll see kind of like
two spaces which I think are for other
variants of this keyboard so when they
originally announced this thing they
said that they was gonna have a wireless
version of this and this might be like
spots for batteries but they've designed
this case to be a low profile mechanical
keyboard but it's just not I mean it's
just it's not low profile and there's
one real big reason as to why this isn't
low profile and it's the actual switches
themselves so these switches are cherry
Reds they are low profile cherry Reds
and okay I love cherry switches so my
favorite keyboard switches are made by
cherry but they've only recently gone
into the low profile game this over here
I will show is a other company this
keyboard switch is also a low profile
switch but they've designed this switch
so
the key caps insert into the switch
itself and it just makes the whole
switch a little bit more flatter and
shorter the cherry low-profile switch
uses your standard cherry stem which
might seem like a good idea at first
because you could switch key caps and
such but the problem is that this stem
is a lot higher and it inserts into the
key so just the whole mechanism becomes
a lot taller than your standard low
profile switch and it just makes this
keyboard not feel like an actual low
profile keyboard the typing experience
isn't great but I don't mind the
switches they feel similar to regular
cherry Reds they obviously bottomed out
quicker but they actually feel a little
bit stiffer to me okay so I also want to
talk about the key caps themselves I'm
gonna go back to the properly assembled
version of this keyboard these key caps
are not good they look awesome they look
really really nice they just look very
clean and just boxy and industrial it's
Wyles attracted to this keyboard but
they just type really poorly and
originally I couldn't figure out what it
was that I didn't like about these key
caps and it's two things the dish is
pretty shallow but that's something that
you can kind of get used to over time at
least for myself the biggest problem
though is the spacing between each key
cap like when you're typing on this
thing you're constantly making contact
with the other keys and even if it
doesn't make you have typos like you may
not be pressing those other keys but the
fact that you can feel them constantly
while you type is just an irritating
experience and it's just not a
comfortable keyboard to use and you
might think hey I'll swap out the key
caps to something that I do like because
it's running cherry stems problem is
they're running proprietary stabilizers
so none of the key caps that I had would
fit onto this keyboard which is honestly
a big shame it is such a nice looking
keyboard the RGB lighting is really good
they had some nice software that lets
you do a lot of stuff with it the metal
finish on the top looks nice the layout
of the keyboard is good but there's so
much I dislike about this keyboard that
I can't recommend it to anyone and it's
not the key cap or the switch
individually like if they'd use this
switch with a different
a key cap it could have worked and if
vice versa it could have worked if you
really want something like this so look
if you really want a low-profile
keyboard that is mechanical there is
something else on the market that I
still don't think this is perfect this
is a lower profile keyboard it's the key
cron k1 and this is a better
implementation of a low-profile
mechanical switched keyboard so this is
using chiclet keys as well but they've
got a blue switch in here and they've
just made a low-profile mechanical
keyboard a lot better than Coolermaster
did for a lot cheaper too and it's
wireless so if you want to check either
of these things out a link them below
but seriously for most people I just do
not recommend the Coolermaster SK 650 or
630 okay hope you guys enjoyed this
video thumbs if you liked it subs we
loved it see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
