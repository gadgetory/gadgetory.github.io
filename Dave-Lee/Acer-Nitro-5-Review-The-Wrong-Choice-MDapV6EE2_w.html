is the Acer nitro 5 now this is a laptop
that's geared towards that whole
inexpensive gaming market it's 900 bucks
it's got a GTX 1050 TI 256 gigs of SSD
and a KB Lake chip in here I mean
there's a lot of stuff that I like about
this thing but if you'll notice the
title of this video I don't openly
recommend this thing to everybody and
the reason why is because I feel like
there's a better option than this for
people who are actually interested in
this and it's not because this is a bad
laptop this is actually a very good
laptop but as you'll see there's
something a little bit better than this
so the things that I do like about it
first I really like the build quality
this thing looks less gamer I should say
than the average cheap gaming laptop so
it has a red strip down here but it's
not that bright cherry red is more like
a muted metallic burgundy color it's
still red it's not my favorite thing but
I think it's a lot better than a lot of
gaming laptops and everything else on
the top at least is black even that logo
the Acer logo is just simple black and
the components they've chosen in here
are good the 1050 Ti is that sweet spot
for inexpensive 1080p gaming the port
selection is pretty standard for this
price you're getting three USB A's in 1
use PC not Thunderbolt 3 though I like
the screen it's not amazing it's an IPS
screen and it looks not bad I mean it's
a $900 gaming laptop you're not gonna
get 4k color accurate screens at this
price so yeah I'm happy with the screen
the keyboard and the trackpad are also
both good the keyboard is comfortable to
use nice layout the one thing that's a
little bit weird on the layout is that
the shift and the up arrow are really
close together now I personally didn't
have any issues using it but I think
it'll depend on how your keyboard habits
are if you don't know if you hit your
shift in a particular way you might hit
the upper at the same time but I don't
have any issues trackpad is also really
good Windows precision drivers acer has
totally gone into the whole windows
precision driver thing they don't use
anymore
ilan or synaptic drivers from what I've
seen recently so that's really nice the
speakers are located on the bottom and
they don't sound terrible or anything
they don't sound great but it's a $900
gaming laptop
they kind of sound as you would expect
the build quality in the Nitro 5 is good
it's got a metal top panel but
everything else is plastic including the
bottom panel but all the plastic parts
feel good there's access to the two and
a half inch SATA drive and the RAM slots
through some hatches but if you want to
go deeper you can remove the whole panel
the batteries down here it's a 48 watt
hour battery and I'm getting a little
bit less than four hours of battery life
and that's what the screen at 215 it's
so depending what you do you'll be
around there now so far everything
sounds good right everything seems
proper on this laptop but this is my one
issue with this thing the thermal design
is not ideal so if you look over here
you can see the CPU and the GPU and
there's two heat pipes that pull heat
away from these chips which are cooled
with these two fans and I don't like
seeing game laptops designed like this
so on a regular laptop that doesn't have
a ton of thermal output this is fine
because I mean it's a very effective and
space efficient way of cooling things
down but on a gaming laptop of the GTX
1050 Ti this is not ideal and what ends
up happening is that the heat from the
CPU has to travel along this pipe pass
the GPU before we get cooled by the two
fans and if you use your laptop for a
really long time the CPU builds up heat
now the VX 15 is another inexpensive
laptop from Acer and that thing has a
much better thermal design to me there's
still two heat pipes and two fans but
because the two fans are located on
opposite ends each fan is gonna pull
heat more readily from the closer chip
and you just get better thermal
performance now if all you're doing is
just browsing the web or just doing
light stuff or even playing games for
just really short bursts for like 15-20
minutes then you literally will never
notice it you will not see any kind of
thermal issues but if you play games for
a long time like over an hour you'll
notice that the CPU temperature starts
to creep up and up and eventually you'll
hit that wall the one thermal advantage
that I would say the Nitro 5 has is that
it does have cool boost technology which
is basically built in software to allow
you to control the fans now the VX 15
does not have that this does and it can
be helpful the thing is you can always
get like third-party software to control
the fans but this has it straight from
the factory so the fan on is on this
thing at idle is not very loud it's
actually quite quiet on load it's a
little bit louder audible but not too
but with cool boost on this thing is
quite loud and it's still not good
enough to maintain really high clock
speeds for extended periods of time
despite it being super loud so here's
the thing
for $900 the market is very competitive
right now there's a lot of good options
to choose from the VIX 15 the Dallas I'm
567 the upcoming 75 77 this thing the
Nitro 5 they're all like kind of in that
market so if you're going to make a
laptop that competes with this stuff if
you're gonna spend the time and the
resources like acer did to make the
nitro 5 a brand new laptop why like why
not make it something just more
different there's nothing about this
thing that makes it a compelling
purchase okay I take that back there's
two things that are unique about this
that don't matter to me but I to be fair
I need to just kind of put this out
there for full disclosure this thing has
a design like a visual design that's
better than the other laptops that it
competes with the read isn't super
obnoxious and the rest of it is pretty
simple the screen is also ever so
slightly better than the V X 15 and the
Dell 7 5 6 7 screen they're all IPS but
this one's just a little bit brighter a
little bit more color accurate we're
talking like 2 or 3% so if those things
are important to you and you don't mind
the thermal issues sure go for this
thing but for most people I wouldn't
recommend this the Acer V x-15 is just
better all-round okay hope you guys
enjoyed this video thumbs be liked it
subs of you loved it see you guys next
