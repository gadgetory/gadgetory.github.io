this is a video on the Google home Mini
and the Amazon echo dot so this thing
just came out the Google home in E it's
50 bucks it's relatively inexpensive but
it's just so much cheaper than its
predecessor that thing was a hundred and
twenty bucks I think this is like less
than half price and it looks nice right
but just because it's new and it looks a
heck of a lot nicer than this it doesn't
mean that's inherently better than this
right I've been using this quite a bit
the Amazon echo dot and it's a very good
product but depending what you do and
what you don't do one or the other might
be a better fit so that's what this
video is it's going to talk about what
these products are what they aren't and
I guess kind of a guide as to whether or
not any one of these are actually a good
purchase for you so I'm gonna focus on
three things first let's talk about
using these things as media controllers
so they're both pretty good as media
controllers this thing the Google home
two things kind of bugged me about it it
doesn't have an audio jack out so if you
have a pair of speakers that you want to
connect it to like a hardwire you can't
do that and it also doesn't technically
have bluetooth like it does you can't
just connect it to a Bluetooth enabled
speaker you need to connect a chromecast
Audio to some speakers and then now they
can talk wirelessly and I mean that's
just a bit of a money grab from Google
and they're just basically trying to
keep the chromecast Audio product alive
and it's fair but if you're looking for
good audio and just like a simple audio
with less wires and stuff like that it's
gonna cost you a little bit more with
this device with the Amazon echo dot
it's got an audio out so it's just you
plug it up and you're good to go both of
them can be used as speakers the Google
home minis probably a little bit better
sounding it's not like much better
because neither of them are very good
but does sound a little bit cleaner and
just a little more depth to the audio it
does have upward firing speakers I'm not
sure if that's making a big difference
whereas the Amazon echo dot has downward
firing speakers so when it's on a table
it's just the sound is projected off of
the surface
they both handled TV well this thing
needs chromecast this thing needs the
fire stick V both have their advantages
inherently just from the products of
fire stick versus chromecast but they
both work and I wouldn't say that one is
like massively better than the other in
terms of their video playing
capabilities one thing I have noticed
with the Google home products and it's
not just with the Google home mini it's
with all of the Google home products you
can speak more naturally to them whereas
the Amazon products you need to just hit
those keywords for a bill to trigger the
command that you're trying to make it do
hey Google show me a video on youtube
about overwatch alright playing on
YouTube about overwatch videos from
YouTube on office TV and because of that
difference I find it easier and just
more enjoyable to control my media using
Google home products the one big
advantage with this though and this
probably won't apply to most people is
that if you are an audiobook user or
just more particularly audible this
thing can do like text-to-speech and it
can just read out stories which is super
cool it's so simple I feel like this is
something that Google homes should be
able to do but it doesn't I use audible
and I like audiobooks so yeah the next
thing I want to talk about is using
these devices as an assistant so either
a home assistant or a work assistants or
any kind of like voice operated
assistant and both of them are pretty
good but the winner to me is the Google
home product this thing has just better
connectivity for what I use so
everyone's gonna be different I use a
lot of Google services particularly
Google Calendar and this is excellent
for that tomorrow there are three things
on your calendar the first one is at
12:30 a.m. and its title is busy stuff
one Google home can distinguish between
different voices so if you have one
device in a household with different
people in it they can ask it with their
own voice and it'll react accordingly so
if you have a different calendar from
your wife or your family members it'll
just read your calendar out to you and
tell you your schedule and same thing
with like making call so if you say or
if I said hey Google call my mom it
would call my mom but
I said the same thing call my mom it
would call her mom because our voices
are different calling mom mobile now the
Amazon echo dot is actually connected to
even more services in particular
Microsoft Outlook so if you're an
Outlook user you got to go with this
thing it doesn't even work on the Google
home products when it comes to asking it
questions and this is something that I
don't use very frequently I mean it's
very cool to kind of like trivia time
but it's not something that I use
regularly Google home crushes echo it's
just not even close I want to say it's
like 1 to 10 in terms of the number of
questions that are answered it's just so
much more robust in terms of its
knowledgebase and a large part of that
comes from the data collection Google
has been collecting data for ever and I
feel like it'll be really hard for
Amazon to ever catch up in that regard
hey Google
do you like Siri you know Siri what a
small world hope she's doing well now
the one assistant type feature that
Amazon is just amazing at is shopping
because of Amazon's
ecommerce power right now it's pretty
good like if you need to refill
something you can just request it and it
shows up in your Amazon cart but I think
the future of Amazon's eco products are
going to revolve entirely around the
whole ecommerce thing and that could be
a good thing or a bad thing depending on
how you look at it but I really do think
that's the future of Amazon now in terms
of using these products as home
automation I got to be completely honest
I don't love home automation right now
because I live in a relatively small
condo it's like a small space home
automation isn't that important to me
there's like one large living space all
the cool stuff that you can do with home
automated stuff just is less appealing
in such a small space
but I recently got a house and I've been
looking between these two to kind of see
which will be better from home
automation and surprisingly even though
this is called Google home the Alexa
products or the echo products are just
so much better just they're able to
connect to way more home automation
stuff so if that's your jam if you're
looking for home automation the echo
products are the way to go but you can't
go wrong with either of them they're
both really inexpensive if you're
looking for something that's
aesthetically pleasing the Google home
Mini looks nice and it's been
answering questions making phone calls
it's just not great as an audio
controller because it lacks connectivity
but the Amazon echo dot has a line out
so it might be a little bit cheaper and
better for music controls and it's gonna
have better home automation connectivity
so everything I've talked about so far
is pertinent to right now in late 2017
and all it takes is Google or Amazon to
just tweak a little bit of their
software and these things suddenly have
new functionality and new features and
you don't have to buy new hardware right
this is always gonna just have a speaker
and a mic and a power source and it can
do all of the stuff that we've talked
about and it can do any future things
that Google wants these things to do
like doesn't do very much processing so
yeah I mean these are so inexpensive 50
bucks you can definitely get into the
game of whole home automation or just
smart stuff and check it out okay hope
you guys enjoyed this video thumbs we
liked it subs we loved it see you guys
