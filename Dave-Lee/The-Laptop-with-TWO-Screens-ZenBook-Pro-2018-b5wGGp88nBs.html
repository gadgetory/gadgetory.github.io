is the 2018 Zenbook pro and this is a
device that gets updated pretty
regularly by Asus like every year
there's some kind of iterative change to
this thing but this year in 2018 they
brought something that was well I think
this is the first true innovative laptop
technology that I've seen in quite a
while so every year we're seeing like
things like thinner bezels better
materials lighter materials thinner
laptops which are cool and everything
but they don't really change the way
that we actually work with our laptops
right there they're nice upgrades and
stuff like that but this is different
this is a screen that's built into the
touchpad so you can run it as a screen
pad thing where you're running basically
Asus apps and an Asus interface so you
can pull it down and you'll see stuff
like your calendar a number pad so this
keyboard doesnt actually have number pad
but you can use the number pad feature
on the bottom thing a calculator and you
have your Spotify music player and you
have other apps that Asus can develop
and put onto this screen pad interface
now you can also run as a secondary
display which is actually pretty cool so
it essentially is a smaller secondary
screen that you can just kind of use to
drag-and-drop your programs or your
windows folders or whatever you would
use your secondary display for now Mac
like the Apple Mac books they have that
touch bar at the top and I said this in
my original review but the utility of
that strip like the actual functionality
of that strip is pretty limited and it's
highly dependent on the developer so you
need Adobe or whatever app you're using
you need those developers to create
functionality in that strip for the user
which is cool but it's not nearly as
functional or even practical as
something like this screen pad so I've
only been using this device for a couple
of days and my initial reaction was wow
that's really cool like you know what
can I do with it but then like the
secondary immediate reaction was that is
it really that useful because like your
viewing angle on this thing isn't ideal
right like if you're staring at your
screen like you normally would now you
have to glance down to look at this
secondary screen but after using for a
little bit it just it feels natural
not that it's like a better option than
looking straight if there are two
screens in front of you that would be
ideal but I mean that's never gonna
happen on a laptop anytime soon this
starts to feel useful after even a
couple hours of using it if you're
loading a premiere you can have like
different
it's down there if you want to watch
videos like twitch or YouTube you can
pop that window down there and it's just
in a position where you can kind of keep
tabs of whatever's going on on the
screen without actually having it take
the real estate of your regular screen
it's nice and you can run whatever
application you want in this so if you
have like a security camera footage or
if you're running a remote access
program like whatever you want you can
just make it work and that's the thing
like when I first saw this thing your
brain just goes right to that thing like
there's just something that you can
imagine something that you can think of
that has utility in this setup with that
MacBook Pro it was more like you had to
imagine it you kind of had to think
about you know how could I use this if
the developer did it right this it's
immediate it kind of it makes sense when
you stare at it so how's the rest of
this device it's well it's a Zen book
it's built pretty well it's not as well
built as a goodell XPS product or a
macbook pro but i like it the color it's
like this blue they also have different
colors I imagine but the one I'm looking
at is this kind of navy blue with copper
trim and it also has your standard Zen
book texture to the metal now the screen
is a 4k panel 83% screen to body ratio
the color gamut is great 100% Adobe RGB
100% srgb this is supposed to be color
calibrated at the factory with Pantone
certification it's a nice looking screen
it's not super bright though it's bright
but it doesn't achieve the same kind of
peak brightness as a MacBook Pro and I
keep bringing them up as an example
because I mean this is a very very good
product for content creators and you can
see the similarities in terms of like
product category so the keyboard feels
kind of standard like your Zen Book Pro
keyboard slightly mushy ER keys than I
would want but good layout and good
keyboard overall the port selection is a
little bit weird so they have a micro SD
I really wish our device like this
especially because obviously geared
towards content creators that they would
include a full-size SD it's not there
it's got to use bas too thin about 3s
and an HDMI out so to get into the
inside it's like your standard Zen book
thing
flip it over remove a bunch of screws
this one I've removed in advance seemed
to pop it off here we go okay so first
thing I noticed was that there's only
two heat pipes and because it's running
some pretty powerful hardware I was
hoping there'd be more turns out there's
a third heat pipe that runs underneath
the motherboard so on the backside of it
that'll help cool this down the i9 is a
beast it's running on gtx 10:50 TI and
the
ponens in here are cooled by two fans
that are supposedly upgraded from the
previous generation so they're supposed
to have like thermoformed plastic and
just have better air flow and stuff I
haven't be able to test it out
thoroughly because this is an
engineering unit I haven't been able to
run proper benchmarks but the
preliminary results are good this
thing's not throttling but the
temperatures are a little warm hopefully
it does get better before it goes into
retail again this is just an engineering
sample so the RAM is soldered onto the
board I really don't like that on a
device like this at which you could just
kind of upgrade it when you want it it
only comes out up to 16 gigs of ram from
the factory and it's just baked right
onto the board so that's not the best
thing the SSD and the Wi-Fi card can be
replaced so the battery's down here I
haven't really done battery tests on
this because it's just there's probably
ton of software that's gonna go into the
retail version that's not on here yet
the speakers they're good and they've
always been good Zenbook pro speakers
have always been one of the better ones
on the market
and yeah I feel like this is gonna
change the way that some people use
their laptops I love that little screen
it's useful for a lot of people it's
obviously not for everyone the best part
is that the functionality of the
touchpad or the trackpad itself doesn't
get reduced like it feels exactly the
same as a regular trackpad like you
wouldn't be able to tell the difference
in fact if you turn off the screen it
just looks like a black trackpad it's
got that smooth textured glass with good
tracking the trackpad is sunken in a
little bit more than your average
trackpad but you don't notice that when
you're using it I don't know it's really
cool to me
what do you guys think like do you think
you could make use of it obviously you
could watch like movies and stuff on
this but aside from that like do you
guys think you would use something like
this if you had access to it on your
trackpad like do you find a gimmicky do
you find legit I don't know now in terms
of battery life I don't know how this
affects it again I'll have to test this
in the future but yeah kind of like an
early look at what I could consider one
of the more innovative pieces of tech
I've seen in laptop store this year ok
hope you guys enjoyed this video thumbs
if you liked it subs you loved it see
you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
