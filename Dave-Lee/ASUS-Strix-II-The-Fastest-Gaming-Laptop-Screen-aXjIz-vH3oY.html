is the new second-generation ROG scar so
the Strix g50 4GS this is the newly
updated version of the Strix line the
top surface is still metal but it's a
little boxy err in shape now it just has
some simple rounded corners with the
brushed texture the big change though is
the logo it can now change colors it
used to be locked into that old-school
gamer red color which honestly was
getting really stale now you can channel
your inner rainbow and just let it rip
the build quality and reliability of the
Strix laptops I've always been pretty
good I think that's why they do so well
on Amazon like people buy them they use
them for a while and they have a good
experience with them so that's why the
ratings are so high it is a
predominantly plastic device so that's
the weird thing top panel is metal but
the inside the bottom panel decides
they're all polycarbonate but it's
really rigid like there are laptops out
there that use metal materials that
don't feel as sturdy as this the Strix
laptops are built well now new for this
year is also a light strip upfront and I
really like this thing it's one of the
more unique features on this laptop you
get full control on the software and
there's two regions to light up and I
just find this relaxing there's
something nice and kind of soothing
about this pastel color and the other
thing is not obnoxious right like a lot
of RGB lights on laptop searches on the
front or the side and it's kind of
broadcasting that RGB to the world this
is like it's facing you it's kind like
your own personal RGB space I don't know
it's simple but I like it
one of the biggest changes on this
laptop is the screen so the previous
generation of Strix had some pretty
thick bezels and I think that's one of
my biggest complaints that the had about
the Strix and I think a lot of people
felt that way as well this new
generation has a really thin bezel and
it looks so much nicer it's not
completely bezel as there's obviously a
bit of a bezel still and there's also a
chin so they put the webcam down here
there wasn't enough space up the top I
guess to put one up there they put at
the bottom but it's actually on the side
as well it's not even in the middle it's
not something I think a lot of gamers
use but the image isn't great and the
angle isn't particularly flattering so
the display panel itself is excellent
like straight up excellent it's brights
with good color accuracy and
fast it's 144 Hertz super fast refresh
rate we're seeing a lot of high refresh
laptops pop up in 2017 but this one is a
three millisecond panel I think it's
actually the fastest 144 Hertz panel
I've seen like the fastest response time
on 144 Hertz panel that I've seen games
look so good on this screen there's a
USB C port but it doesn't support
Thunderbolt 3 and in 2018 like mid 2018
I feel like it's just a thing that
should happen on devices like this it's
a high end gaming laptop it's not the
most expensive one out there but
Thunderbolt 3 support is kind of not
expected but it should be there the
speakers they're good they're located on
the side so I like the location and I
don't they put new speakers in this
generation or if it's just a software
update but they sound way better than I
thought they would the mids are clean
the highs are clean and the base is
actually present but there's no cell
book I popped it open expecting a sub
there is no sub there's just really good
speakers so last year's model was tough
to open up fully you get to the RAM and
stuff easily there was a hatch but if
you needed to open it up completely to
access the fans or something it was a
huge pain in the butt this year there's
no more hatch the whole back panel pops
off easily any of access to the fans the
2 6 of ram SSD the hard drive alpha
Charlie replaced the Wi-Fi card is using
a quad antenna for a better reception
and stuff the battery down here is not
big it's a 64 watt hour piece and I'm
only getting around three and a half
hours of battery life with the screen at
250 nets you definitely need a charger
if you're gonna bring it to class or
work or wherever because three and a
half hours is not gonna cut it for a
full day the keyboard this is a
comfortable keyboard good travel layout
takes a little bit of time to get used
to because of the arrow key placement
between the number pad but the keyboards
good overall the lighting is okay it's a
four zone I wish it was individually lit
and there's clear WASD keys here which
are unique but I don't know they're not
for me there's something about this
translucent material that makes it kind
of look unfinished the color from the
lighting just blasts through these key
caps but I don't love the look the
trackpad this is a much improved track
ride from the previous generation
tracking is really accurate it's using
Windows precision drivers and there's
dedicated hardware buttons the palm
rejection could be a little better it's
picking up some occasional left palm
action when I press the spacebar but
it's pretty minor so
performance is strong this unit has a
gtx 1070 to go with that six core 8750 h
the cpu is a multi core beast and the
GPU just crushes it uses that 144 Hertz
panel well a lot of competitor shooters
will hit 144 Hertz even with the
graphics settings cranked up they've
also done a good job cooling it remember
it's a gtx 1070 not the max cube but a
regular 1070 and I'm not seeing
throttling in benchmarks and stuff the
temperatures are good the fans are also
not too loud it's nice to see them cool
a full 1070 without excessive fan noise
even at max load now one of the reasons
why they're able to do this is because
the device itself like I'm sure the
thermal solution is good but this device
is not an ultra thin laptop it's not
thick or anything but laptops are just
easier to cool when there's more room in
there for bigger fans and stuff like
that so this laptop is a much improved
version from the previous generation the
first generation Strix was really good
this is just that much better if you
like a C's listen to their customer base
figure out what they wanted what they
didn't want and made something that's a
really compelling purchase this one here
is the scar 2 and there's a brother to
this kind of like a twin called the hero
2 which looks a little bit different but
has very similar specs but depending on
what you're looking for in terms of
aesthetics you might choose one over the
other ok hope you guys enjoyed this
video thumbs if you liked it
subs you love to see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
