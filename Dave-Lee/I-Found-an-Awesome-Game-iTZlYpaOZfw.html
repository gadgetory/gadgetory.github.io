today's video shot at 60 frames per
second I normally don't shoot like this
but because I'm showing a lot of
gameplay footage I thought I'd shoot at
a higher frame rate I just don't like
this look it just to me it looks like a
soap opera but that's just a preference
thing don't get used to this higher
frame rate okay I got to play one of the
coolest games I've ever played before
it's called beat Sabre it's this VR
rhythm game where you use these
lightsabers and you hack away at blocks
it's kind of like Guitar Hero but
now the reason why I was playing this
game at all is because this new hardware
this is the new vive pro from HTC and
with VR immersion is everything if you
feel like you're in the game if you've
had that like immersive experience where
everything from the real world gets
removed and you're just kind of put into
the game that's the best possible
experience there's a lot of things that
get in way that immersion so you get
like poor image quality or poor frame
rates or just bad audio just wires
clutter there's so many things that can
make VR less enjoyable but the vive pro
is this new upgraded headset that
delivers better immersion so you're
getting higher resolution with built-in
headphones and the whole setup is just
cleaner with this single cable the
original vibe had this bundle of three
cables trailing off this single cable on
the vibe Pro is just so much nicer they
also have a wireless adapter coming out
shortly and it's just a much more
immersive experience 78% more pixels is
no joke so the headsets just more
comfortable to use on this new version
and it has a super-easy knob thing that
you adjust for fit the built-in
headphones aren't amazing or anything
like they're not gonna have the best
sound quality of headphones out there
but it's just so much more convenient to
have them built into the headset and
they flip up and down really easily so
if you have friends in the room you kind
of pop up one side you can kind of hear
people talk while you're playing the
game is it's a really well-built piece
of hardware so the games that I played
look a lot better on the vive Pro than
the original vive this is raw data it's
a first-person shooter I've played this
game quite a bit in the past but at this
high resolution it's a pretty different
feel there's a lot of visual details
that I never noticed before like you can
see all the bullets in the clip and
everything just looks sharper it's a
pretty cool experience and even in a
game like super high this doesn't have a
ton of fancy features or textures but
everything looks just so much cleaner
and sharper and with VR higher
resolution radically improves the visual
experience
now the unfortunate thing is that this
hardware does not come cheap
you still need a good PC to run all this
like they recommend a GTX 1060 or higher
for the vive pro and you also need to
get the headset this is 800 bucks just
for the headset alone and that's only
for people who are upgrading from the
original vive because it's only the
headset if you need the full kit that's
$1,100 see the original vive kit like
the original one from 2016 launched for
800 bucks and that was the full kit that
had headset sensors the controller's the
full deal.this goes for 1,100 now for
the full kit and like I feel like in the
two years that have passed the pricing
for the old one has dropped down but
this new one is still really expensive
that being said five hundred bucks for
the original vive is actually a pretty
decent deal for people that are kind of
interested in checking out real VR and I
mean real VR if you've been testing
stuff out like Google daydream and just
like crappy VR like that's a very that's
a bad representation of VR so if you're
interested in like a good experience
like a really really top-notch
experience this new HTC vive pro is
freaking fantastic and please check out
beat saber because it is seriously it's
the best game that I've ever played on
VR and it's seriously one of the coolest
games I've ever played
