is a surface book to the 13 inch version
now when the original surface book
launched in 2015 I thought of some of
the coolest pieces of tech available at
the time it's just really impressive
because no one else was making something
quite like it two years later we're
still there no one else is making
something quite like this the CPU is
built into the screen it's removable and
it's a fully functional tablet by itself
and then the GPU is in the keyboard so
when they connect it becomes a
full-fledged graphically powered laptop
so I mean a lot of people want something
like this it's something quite unique
but it comes at a pretty steep price tag
this thing this unit here starts at
$2,000 us now there is a cheaper version
but the cheaper version does not have
the dedicated graphics card in the
keyboard so that makes it not as cool or
just not as unique to be honest so I'm
going to focus just the experience on
this one the $2000 version now there's a
15 inch version that's significantly
more expensive I may do video in the
future on that but 13-inch for this
video I want to talk about the hinge
first this is a hinge that when it first
was announced I had mixed feelings about
it because I felt like there's so many
moving parts there's places that dust
can get into there's just a lot of
things that could go wrong I thought
that's not the case two years later
people still don't have any major issues
with the hinge now the design isn't for
everyone it can look a little bit weird
but functionally and mechanically it's
really well made when you open it up
you'll notice that very little has
changed aesthetically the screen is
still the 3 by 2 aspect ratio with good
color accuracy it's bright it's high-res
there's no complaints here there's no
pen in the Box this year it's an extra
100 bucks if you want to buy one which I
thought was a little bit weird but I
guess not everyone uses a pen so it's
understandable the one I'm using is
actually from the eve and it works
perfectly fine the keyboard and trackpad
are nice it's a noticeably better typing
experience than the original surface
book it's a little bit quieter and it
just feels more responsive than the
original surface book keyboard not that
that one was bad it was already good
this is just a little bit better the
trackpad has also improved it's
obviously still running Windows
precision drivers the button mechanism
feels a little more deliberate
when you press it and it's a little bit
louder than I remember the surface buck
1 to be but it feels awesome so keyboard
trackpad both excellent performance is
good it's the quad core cable a car it's
a 15 watt CPU but it's fast and short
bursts multi-core performance is really
strong now but the question is whether
this extra speed really makes a big
difference for what you do and it really
depends on your workflow the truth is
for the majority of people that are
using a device like this it won't make
their workflow or just work experience
that much faster you need specific apps
that can handle multi-core processing
some computational stuff will really
benefit from it and same with video
editing but at the end of the day it is
a 15 watt you processor so it's not
gonna be the fastest laptop in the world
one thing to keep in mind the 13 inch
version does not have a fan in the
tablet component the 15 inch version of
this device like the surface book 250 on
your screen does have the same processor
as this but there is a fan in there so
it's able to run at a higher clock speed
for longer periods of time it also pulls
I think 20 watts instead of the 15 watt
ad max there is some CPU throttling when
you push it hard enough but most people
won't notice it because this is not the
device that people would choose for
really heavy
CPU activity in terms of gaming
performance it's actually pretty good
the GTX 1050 pushes had some decent
performance you have to run it at a
lower than native resolution but light
to moderately demanding titles are very
playable on this device there are
reports that the 15 inch version with
the gtx 1060 is actually pulling more
power than the AC adapter can supply so
it's actually draining batteries while
you're using it that doesn't happen on
the 13 inch version because this is
running a 1050 slightly less power drain
so yeah if you want to play games on
this device I mean neither of them are a
good choice but the issue doesn't happen
on the 13 inch version the speakers
surprisingly these have been improved
this year they're not as good as the 13
inch MacBook Pro speakers but they sound
pretty good and they're positioned well
you get really nice stereo separation
the webcam is really good it's actually
one of the best webcams I've seen on a
laptop the mic quality sounds pretty
good as well
battery life on this thing is very good
I'm getting around 10 hours of use with
the screen at 250 nits now this is with
it in laptop mode with the screen
removed and just using it as a clipboard
I'm only getting around three hours this
has a 23 watt hour battery inside the
screen and I think
67 what our battery inside the base but
overall good battery life it'll easily
last you the full day and for people
that aren't familiar with how the
charging works you can charge the tablet
by itself or you can connect the tablet
to the keyboard and just charge the base
and everything will charge up altogether
the drive speeds are a mixed bag the
read speeds are fast but the write
speeds are a little bit slow the
thermals are good the temperatures are
comfortable both in tablet and a laptop
mode the fan noise under max load is a
little bit loud but it's kind of
expected considering the size of the
chassis so there's a lot of stuff I like
about the surface book too but the big
things are not so much the CPU and the
GPU upgrades it's the little things like
the things like the speakers the
keyboard the trackpad things that they
didn't have to change but they tweaked
it anyways because they're just trying
to make a better product overall and I
really like that that being said there
are things that I dislike about this
thing and the first one the big one is
the price now the price when you first
look at this thing seems very expensive
it's $2,000 for a 13-inch laptop with a
u processor and a gtx 1050 if you spent
that money on something like an XPS 15
you'd get something that's more powerful
but the reason why i cost this much is
because microsoft is the only company
making something like this no one else
makes something like this and the reason
why is because it's super hard to
engineer this hinge and it's super hard
to engineer this device to have a CP up
top and the GP on the bottom because if
it wasn't hard you bet that hallway or
xiaomi with making something like this
for a lot less money but they aren't
because they can't and that is why they
can charge whatever they want to I don't
like the price I still feel like it's
like 10 15 percent more than it should
be because this is such a good product
if it was more appropriately priced more
reasonably priced I think a lot of
people could make great use of this but
we can't because it's just a little bit
another price range for a lot of people
which is unfortunate the other thing I
don't like about this thing is the lack
of a Thunderbolt 3 port so it has a
decent port selection to use B threes
and SD card slot and a USB C but it
doesn't support Thunderbolt 3 and that
really bugs me because this is a device
that costs as much as it does and it's
their flagship products right every sing
other manufacturer out there who's
making flagship laptops has federal
three support in 2017 and it just lets
you connect to faster storage external
GPUs 4k displays or at least multi
4k displays there's just a lot of good
features that come within about three
and it seems so weird that they didn't
include it now the omission of
Thunderbolt three feels almost
purposeful like they did it with intent
and that's what bugs me like are they
waiting for a surface book three to come
out so they can sell that or was it
something like cost-saving measure I
have no idea but it doesn't make sense
to me as to why that didn't include such
a ubiquitously useful port in late 2017
and I guess that leads to my last thing
I don't love about it the AC adapter
they include is a proprietary connector
and it would have been nice if they
included a USBC adapter you can charge
it through that port you just need to
supply your own adapter so overall great
device you just got to make sure that
you're using it to its full purpose
because if you're buying this and you're
not making use of the tablet and you're
not making use of the detach ability and
all that then there are probably cheaper
devices that would been a better fit but
if you can make use of it and you can
afford it's relatively high price tag
you're gonna enjoy it
okay hope you guys enjoyed this video
thumbs if you liked it subs you loved it
see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
