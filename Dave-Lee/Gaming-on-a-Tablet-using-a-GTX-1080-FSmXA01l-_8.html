and this is the Asus Transformer 3 pro
now it looks very similar to the surface
lineup in particularly the surface pro 4
it's always been inspired by that lineup
but this has one big difference this
device has a Thunderbolt 3 port so it
allows external GPU connections now as
of right now this is the only tablet
that allows that future surface products
and future tablets might allow it but
right now this is the only one in terms
of the build
it feels pretty similar to the surface
pro 4 glass up front
magnesium shell the kickstand on the
back can be adjusted to any position
it's stiff it'll hold its position but
I'm not sure about long-term durability
the mechanism looks like it works
through friction between two metal parts
and I don't else that will wear down
over time but it's been working great
for the past couple of months so yeah I
think it should be okay using it as a
tablet it feels pretty comfortable to
use it's a different shape from the
surface product so those kind of have a
bevel on the edge this doesn't have that
it's a different feel but it's still
very comfortable to use now I prefer
using these two muscles with the
detachable keyboard I find that I mean
there are devices that have to flip
around keyboards like the yoga products
and the new XPS 13 I mean this is just
personal preference but I like being
able to use my tablet one hand without
feeling the bottom of the keyboard
underneath I like that some people going
to be different it's just a matter of
personal preference port selection on
tablets is never amazing on one side you
have your standard micro SD slot and a
volume rocker and on the other side we
have USB 3 HDMI port and that Center
Bowl 3 port this model here is $1600 us
and include the stylus and the
attachable keyboard the surface pro 4
has a slightly stronger connection I
think with the magnets are stronger but
this is still pretty secure the keyboard
is backlit it has a great layout like I
wouldn't change a thing on it
considering the smaller real estate it
has to work with you can have it go flat
or you can have it tilted on an angle
both are comfortable use it's actually
really comfortable to use on your lap as
well everything feels solid the typing
experience is good not amazing decent
key travel but the keys are a little
softer or just spongy ER than I'd like
it to be and when you close it
there's no
magnet on the other end to keep it close
like on surface products the trackpad
could be better it uses Windows
precision drivers so I had high hopes
its glass and the texture is good but
the cursor jumps around sometimes not
often but enough for it to be a little
bit annoying I don't think it's hardware
I think a software update would fix it
but as of right now in early January
2017 it's still an issue the stylus
feels really similar if not identical to
the stylus for surface products it
doesn't attach magnetically though so
you got to bring it around with you like
a regular pen the screen is twelve point
six inches 20 and 80 by 1920 pretty
high-res there's letterboxing in most
videos because of the aspect ratio but
that's just the nature of tablet screens
it has very good color gamut and color
accuracy out of the box it's not as
bright as I feel like it could be or
should be I mean it's bright for a
laptop but because of the tablet as well
I kind of feel that in some environments
like if you're outdoors it can feel a
little dim it's running a sky like CPU
you can get it in either an i5 or an i7
both with Intel HD 520 graphics 16 gigs
of ram and solid-state drives the 512
gig drive in my unit isn't particularly
fast I think it's a SATA Drive but I
have seen units with newer manufacturing
gates that had nvme drives in them you
can't upgrade the RAM or the drive I
mean you can configure it at purchase
but you can't open it up and upgrade it
yourself performance for regular use is
good it feels pretty snappy particularly
with the i7 now if you stress this thing
hard like on benchmarks or if you want
to edit videos there is noticeable CPU
throttling and gaming performance on the
integrated HD 520 isn't that good but
when you connect it to an external GPU
using the Centreville 3 port that is
where this thing shines so if you're not
familiar with an external GPU it's a box
and you basically stick a desktop grade
GPU in there so anything from Nvidia or
AMD and then you get desktop GPU
capabilities in your device so the Asus
Transformer 3 pro was originally
designed to work with the ACS XG station
2 that's not out yet it will be soon but
in the meantime it actually works quite
well with the razor core you got to
install some Sun about three drivers and
you need to get some software to run the
whole Razer synapse thing but it works
depending on the card you put in here
you can get some amazing performance
it's a pretty standard performance
around ten to fifteen percent less than
a desktop because of the central three
bandwidth limitations but it's still
good remember though that performance
drops that ten to fifteen percent number
is only if you're using an external
monitor if you don't want to use a
monitor and you want to pipe it back to
the display on the transformer three Pro
you lose even more performance we're
looking at twenty to twenty five percent
and if you're curious that sound about
three capable power and charge the
tablet so it's a pretty sweet set up
something like overwatch doesn't have
great performance on the integrated HD
520 but I connected to GTX 1080 and you
can get some ridiculously good frame
rates one thing to keep in mind this is
a two core CPU there's plenty of game
that will run great on a two core CPU
but there are games that are more CPU
dependent that would do better on a quad
core so you got to research your game if
you want specific benchmarks now in
terms of a GPU recommendation because
this is a two core CPU and because it
doesn't get to clock full speed because
of the CPU throttling I'd recommend
maybe a GTX 1060 or even a 980 if you
know your budgets a little bit lower but
you don't want to just spend money on a
card that you can't really make proper
use of VR also had problems working I
tried connecting an HTC vive had issues
I'm not sure it was because like a port
limitation there is only one USB port on
the tablet the keyboard is actually not
bad for gaming it's kind of strange
because as I'm in a real keyboard it's a
keyboard cover I mean it's not going to
cut it for a 408 p.m. Starcraft player
but it's a very usable keyword for games
there's an exhaust up top it doesn't
interfere when you're playing games but
if you're using some more demanding
applications while you're holding it in
portrait as a tablet it gets pretty warm
up there the fans don't spin when it's
idle but when it kicks in it's audible
it's not super annoying or super loud or
anything but you'll know when it's on
speakers are upfront Carmen Carmen
branded but they're very average
sounding they don't get too loud and the
bass is pretty weak the front webcam is
1080p and it has infrared so it supports
Windows hello for login which is pretty
cool the back camera is 13 megapixel it
doesn't look great but I doubt many
people are going to use this anyways so
whatever battery lights on this thing is
relatively short it's a 39 watt hour
battery normal use like doing work we're
getting around five hours of life with
the screen at 215 it's watching movies
you'll get around 3 and a half hours
which is enough to finish most movies
but for a tablet the battery life is
definitely on the
end of the spectrum now overall I really
like this setup I don't think that this
particular model like the transformer 3
Pro is the perfect version of this
particularly the battery life but this
is the only one you can do it on right
now
I love the fact that it's a tablet when
you want it to be you can connect a
keyboard when you want to type or just
go ham on a keyboard and even external
GPU if you want to play game it's a
super modular system I think this is a
really good direction for mobile
computing I think if I wasn't making
youtube videos I would definitely try to
make this thing my daily driver
hope you guys enjoyed this video thumbs
if you liked it subs if you loved it
it's a nice I'll see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
