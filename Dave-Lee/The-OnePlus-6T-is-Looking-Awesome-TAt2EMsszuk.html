There have been a lot of rumours and leaks about the OnePlus 6T.
But this morning a particularly telling photo was leaked. Now this is a photo of what is supposedly the packaging
of the upcoming OnePlus 6T
and there is no way for us to tell if this is a real photo or some kind of faked box
that someone has made for it.
But my gut feeling is that this is actually the OnePlus 6T packaging.
There's just too many details that kind of line up with previous rumours
plus that thing actually looks pretty well made to me.
Now I want to draw attention to two features of this phone that is indicated on this packaging.
The first thing is that tear drop notch.
So over the course of 2017 and 2018 we saw a huge influx of phones with notches on them
and the Pixel 3XL is looking to have an incredibly large notch - if we're not being trolled by Google.
But this phone has a very, very small notch
and I love the way this looks.
This is actually very similar in design aesthetic to two Oppo phones - the Oppo R17 and the Oppo F9.
Both of them with that kind of water drop notch shape
and it kind of makes sense because Oppo and OnePlus have that tie
through BBK, the kind of parent company -
and it's a really small change right,
it's not like they've removed the notch completely - it's just reduced significantly in size.
but just visually this phone looks so much cleaner
than the original OnePlus 6 that we have on the market right now.
So instead of the 83/84% screen to body ratio on the OnePlus 6
this is moving closer to ~90%.
The speaker gets pushed up so instead of the traditional
kinda speaker grill in the notch they have to remove it and put it
and put a slit up above that water drop
and just have audio coming out from there. The same thing with the ambience sensors,
these water drop notches don't have them in the traditional spot.
The other interesting feature shown in this packaging photo is the inclusion of an
in display, or under display fingerprint sensor.
So this is technology that we have seen from a couple of the Chinese phones
like Oppo and Vivo had phones with in display
fingerprint sensors.
But we've never seen one that was readily available to the North American market.
Now the in display or in-screen fingerprint sensors
that I have seen, haven't been super fast.
Like the fingerprint sensor on the OnePlus 6 or any of the OnePlus phones
are really snappy.
The in display fingerprint sensors that we have seen so far haven't been as fast
so I am a little bit concerned but we will have to see when the final product comes out.
Now the other thing that's kinda neat and this is something that we have known before
is that OnePlus is likely going to have a carrier deal with T-Mobile for the OnePlus 6T launch
and that's just gunna bring a tonne of of brand awareness and just
kind of market awareness for OnePlus as a brand in North America.
But what do you think? I feel like this
is... this is big.
If that packaging is legit, and my gut feeling is that it is,
those two features, like the water drop notch
and the fingerprint sensor are going to be something that really shapes
the...not just OnePlus but the direction of the smart phone industry right now.
I think that's going to be pretty big.
Let me know in the comments below.
I'm actually curious to see what you guys think about it.
There is some talk about OnePlus upgrading their dash charging
to something like super dash charging because Oppo has some faster
charging technology right now.
I don't think that's going to trickle into the OnePlus world yet.
Maybe in the 7 or future generations, but for the 6T that's coming out in October/November
I would say that they're just going to stick with their regular dash charging
Okay,
hope you guys enjoyed this video.
Thumbs is you liked it, subs if you loved it. See you guys next time.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
