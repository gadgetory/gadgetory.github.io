the 2018 Helios 300 the previous version
the 2017 Helios 300 was one of the best
if not the best valued gaming laptop
from last year it had a bunch of great
features for a really good price point
and they've updated a bunch of things
particularly the things that I'd had
issues with last year and they've made a
significantly revamped product so the
big three changes are the screen the CPU
as well as the thermal design so the
exterior casing hasn't changed at all
it's still running this black and red
color scheme it looks almost a little
dated to me like a lot of the newer
generation laptops are going with a more
muted look as well as a less angular
design this has that whole predator DNA
going on it looks pretty aggressive and
it looks really gamer kind of over the
top gamer but it still looks decent if
you're into this look
I personally don't love it but that's
just a personal preference one thing
that this doesn't have is fundable 3
port it has a USB see support just like
the previous generation but once again
it doesn't support Thunderbolt 3 the
rest of the port selection is good and
they're well positioned just knoweth
honorable 3 so if you want to connect up
an external GPU you can't do it the
internals are just as difficult to get
into this year as it was last year you
have to be careful not to snap the tabs
when you're opening it up especially on
the back part once you're in though you
have access to the Wi-Fi card but they
were to give you a great one your two
RAM slots and the two drive bays you
also have access to the fans now the
fans have been upgraded this year these
are actually running metal fins which is
actually something I don't see very
often in gaming laptops it's these thin
metal blades that actually help quite a
bit with the airflow the battery and the
speakers weren't great in the 2017 model
I don't think they've changed on this
year it's 48 watt hour battery you're
getting around 4 hours of battery life
not a very long time you will have to
bring a charge with you and the speakers
also remain quite mediocre they give
pretty loud not a lot of bass but they
sound kind of flat now in 2017 I don't
care too much about these speakers but
in 2018 a lot of the mid and even entry
level gaming laptops have really decent
speakers and these ones fall a little
bit short inside they have a brand new
screen I think it's actually the most
surprising and best feature of this
laptop it's a 144 Hertz screen on a
reason we priced gaming laptop it's fast
it's bright it's reasonably color
accurate it's actually really cool
they're able to use a screen like this
at this price point and I actually think
that this particular gaming laptop is
going to have an effect on the entire
industry because almost every other
gaming laptop at this price point is
taking a 60 Hertz screen on to those
devices and this product just sticks out
as being the most visually enticing and
visually attractive gaming experience
for the people that are unfamiliar with
gaming refresh rates the difference
between a 60 Hertz screen and a 144 or
even a 120 Hertz screen is massive
everything looks just so much more fluid
on a high refresh screen and I'm not
gonna say that if you purchase one of
these screens you're gonna instantly
become a better gamer it's not that it's
just the gaming experience is a lot
better and I think it'll help you
achieve better results you're
essentially seeing double the number of
frames versus a 60 Hertz screen so it's
just a better experience the keyboard
and the trackpad haven't changed from
the previous generation I didn't love
either of them the keyboards decent it's
got relatively soft stroke but the
layout is good the only thing a little
bit weird of the lair is the shift key
again they haven't changed that it's
just right beside the up arrow and
depending on how you type you might hit
that accidentally but decent keyboard
overall the trackpad the buttons are a
little bit stiff but it's using Windows
precision drivers so it's got good
gestures and tracking performance on
this device is great now this models
running in GTX 1060 and is comboed with
the six core i7 and it delivers really
respectable frame rates for most gaming
titles out there if you're playing
something heavier you obviously have to
drop your visual quality to keep up the
frame rates but it's a good combination
you won't be able to max out the 143rd
screen on most games at Ultra but you
can for a lot of games especially
competitive games on high now the
thermal performance on this laptop is
improved this year not that it was
terrible last or anything but it is
better
there's no throttling and the
temperatures are a little bit lower fan
noise is also very respectable nothing
too loud even on Max and you also get
fan control through predator sense one
last thing to note there's a special
edition of the Helios 300 that's gonna
be available later comes in white and
gold no changes internally it's just an
aesthetic change so overall the Helios
300 is once again a fantastic value for
gaming laptops it's amazing that they're
able to stick a 144 Hertz screen into
this kind of price point it's a really
good screen now if you're fixated on
that screen like if you're interested in
this device
exclusively because of that screen
understand that there are ways to stick
high refresh screens on to other devices
it's more do yourself route cost like
100 maybe 150 dollars but if you want
something out of the factory you want
just that you know the whole experience
right out of the box you don't want to
mess around with installing high refresh
screens into cheaper devices I seriously
think this is the best value for this
kind of device okay hope you guys
enjoyed this video thumbs to be liked it
subs if you'd love to see you guys next
