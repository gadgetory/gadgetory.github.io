Dee so last year we did a review of a
toothbrush by a company called quip
they're based out of New York and I
didn't love the product it was pretty
good looks really nice but I kept it
around at work just because I wanted a
toothbrush at work and I continued to
order refills for it just because it was
convenient
the last refill that came in came with a
free upgrade to their second generation
toothbrush much improved
hence this second review so quip makes
electric and manual toothbrushes that
come in different colors and stuff but
they sell them via a subscription
service so you order toothbrush from
them and if you want every three months
or so they'll send you a new head and/or
toothpaste if that's what you've ordered
now the one I have is the electric
version and it costs $40 when it comes
in you get the toothbrush and a holder
inside a travel case or like a travel
tube some toothpaste and some pamphlets
on dental care and stuff the handle is
aluminum and it feels surprisingly
well-made like I don't know about the
plastic ones but the metal handles have
a really nice way to them they're
densely packed right there's a motor and
a battery in a really small metal tube
now I know it's just a toothbrush and a
lot of people don't care about this kind
of stuff but I think they did a really
good job on the aesthetics the holder
doesn't use sticky tape it's actually a
reusable suction mechanism super easy to
install and if you ever want to move it
around you can it's also a better holder
than the old one it drains better and
the bottom pops off so it's easier to
clean the heads now snap off instead of
being a pull off and they feel much more
secure when they're attached the
mechanism on the inside is quite
different from before so this new one
has a few more over Ang's that make it
waterproof but the most significant
improvement is how the vibrations get to
the bristles I'm not sure exactly what
they did but it's a stronger vibration
at the head which I assume does a better
job cleaning your teeth it still uses a
triple-a battery that lasts around three
months and I've been using a
rechargeable battery with no problem the
brush heads have some soft rubber
bristles things around the edge now the
whole thing doesn't spin they just kind
of vibrate when you brush this new
version gives a really solid brushing
experience
it actually feels like any top name
brand vibrating toothbrush but it looks
a lot nicer it also has a tongue scraper
and a two-minute timer the toothpaste is
a pretty standard minty flavor and I'll
ask you around three months for the tube
now the equip subscription service
itself I used to think it wasn't that
useful because really how hard is it to
get a toothbrush and a toothpaste
wherever you want to North America but I
will say this
ever since I've had the quip and the
convenience of just having the heads
delivered to work every three months I
have never once missed brushing my teeth
after lunch not even once in a year it's
kind of weird like I normally don't have
compliance issues with brush my teeth
but normally I wouldn't brush my teeth
after lunch at work it's just the way it
is but now that they're here and now
that the heads are there I just use them
the other thing is if you're looking for
a modern looking toothbrush like an
electric toothbrush that doesn't have a
charging cable and stuff this is like
the only good one out there that's the
end of this video I hope you guys liked
it give me some thumbs we liked it
subs if you loved it it's been nice see
you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
