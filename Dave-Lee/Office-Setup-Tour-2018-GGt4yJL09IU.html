for hey how's it going Dave Toodee here
and this is a tour of my office now this
isn't my studio this isn't where I shoot
my youtube videos normally it's actually
my home and this is like the office
space in my house now it's a very small
space this isn't like glamorous or
anything like that and it's very
functional
I didn't curate this scene to make it
look extra cool or anything this is
literally how I work
originally this room was meant to have
two setups one for my wife one for
myself but because I just have so much
crap it ended up being my office so
right now we have to set up let's start
off with this one over here this is the
Mac setup I would say that this is the
one that I use the most frequently when
it comes to working on YouTube stuff
just because I like the Mac OS system
for just my personal use so we have the
ten core Mac Pro this is a 2013 Mac Pro
I would love to use the iMac in here but
it's just way too expensive to really
justify the cost for myself and the big
reason for me is I much prefer the
widescreen stuff when it comes to
content creation it's really difficult
for me to switch from something wide
like this to a regular sixteen by nine
panel that you see on the iMac Pro this
is running a ten core CPU 64 gigs of ram
and we have your standard kind of Mac
input devices the Apple keyboard Apple
trackpad and actually this is not the
Apple Mouse this is the Logitech MX
anywhere 2 s great Mouse and this is
something that is just really clean
really simple gets the job done now in
terms of the accessories that I uses
this thing I don't have speakers on this
thing so this monitor the LG 30 at UC 99
fantastic monitor it has speakers
built-in so I often use that but if I
need something that's a little more
private I use air pods with this
particular setup and we have a boost
ball for people that know anything about
adidas boost and then we have just a
standard four gigabyte backup Drive that
I use this is a Bluetooth speaker from
Nixon not particularly great but I got
it for free I like it so I use it and
that basically wraps up this area no
there's one last thing
it's the Belkin wireless charging pad
which I use if I'm using the
ten in this area the tables are desks
whatever you want to call these things
they are from West Elm I forget the name
I'll find the link and put it in the
video description I'll link all the
stuff in the video description if you
guys are interested okay moving along we
have the PC setup now I purposefully
chose to cripple my PC set of people
that follow my channel know that I lack
self-control when it comes to playing
games so this thing is a powerful PC for
video editing but the thing is those
devices are often very good for playing
games I feel like I've had gaming
peripherals this thing would not be used
for work very much I would just be
playing games all the time so what I've
done is actually have wireless keyboard
and a wireless mouse and these
peripherals are actually great for just
regular work and productivity but
they're not ideal for playing games and
when I do play games like I don't try to
play competitively on these so this is
the drive Oh caliber keyboard great
wireless keyboard RGB backlighting with
switchable key caps and these are the
cyan key caps from GM k and we have the
MX master 2 SMS so these devices are
great for a Productivity just what I
want to do with this thing
but they aren't perfect for competitive
gaming so the mousepad
is a SteelSeries white mouse pad and the
pc itself if you've seen my older video
on the hype beast supreme pc this is
that machine but I've stripped the red
paint because it was just getting a
little too obnoxious and again I did
that PC for fun I'm not like huge on
supreme but it's cleaned up a little bit
there are some parts that I couldn't
remove the paint as cleanly but I really
like this case it's the Loki ghost s1
case and I just decided to use that for
this particular setup ok the monitor is
an alienware 34 inch curved screen the
reason why I'm using this monitor is
it's 120 Hertz g-sync it's a fantastic
gaming monitor but it's also one of the
few gaming waters that are super super
color accurate this thing's basically is
color accurate as any monitor that are
own for content creation so to round up
this area we have a backup drive this is
the Seagate 8 terabyte drive I really
like this thing one cable no AC adapter
the USB C plugs up right to your PC or
your laptop or your Mac whatever and
single cable backup ps4 which I
occasionally use input into this thing
and this is I've never actually done a
video on this thing but this is the MIDI
fighter 64 from DJ tech tools you've
probably seen videos from like Sean
sabe that have done some crazy stuff
with this I picked this up to just have
fun with it and potentially make some
music for intros and stuff like that but
I haven't gone round to doing much with
it yes okay if you'll notice neither of
these setups actually have speakers so
I'm actually running wireless headphones
on both so you saw the air pods on that
and this one I'm running the B&amp;amp;O
wireless headphones what you use for
video editing and some casual gaming
it's some nice wireless headphones okay
moving along I did it for you anything
here No okay moving along backpack I'll
probably do a video like a what's my
backpack video in the future but moving
on to this side so this area here is
where I do like charging I guess it's
not really a charging area but I just
place my phones here and other devices
that need to be charged so the phones
I'm using right now we have the pixel to
excell the 1 + 5 t and the iPhone 10 if
I had to choose one that I use the most
frequently right now is probably iPhone
10 just goes my family and friends most
of them are on iOS we have batteries so
the battery packs that I'm using right
now are Ankur battery packs this isn't
sponsor or anything they're literally
the ones that I've purchased both of
these they're both pretty beefy ones
20,000 milliamps the others 10,000
milliamps and the bigger ones it capable
of charging laptops and stuff because it
has power delivery which is pretty cool
we have Nintendo switch which to be
honest I don't use that much for your
often the last thing this room I guess I
think this is the last piece it's the
Google home Mini so this is something
that I've grown to like more and more
over time it's just a really simple 50
dollar device that gives you home
automation and just assistant features
and stuff like that it's pretty cool
that basically wraps it up I should know
what to chairs so there's two chairs in
here these are there okay I got to be
honest they look really cool but they're
not for everyone because they are very
stiff they're not like super comfortable
chairs these are from a company called
pentatonix and it's called the air tool
but what makes these chair special is
that the entire chair is made from
recycled materials so I kind of feel a
little bit better about myself using
them and that basically wraps it up this
is the office tour of my house ok thanks
