this is a video on five free window apps
that I think everyone should be using
and this video is a little bit different
from the Mac version that I made a
couple days ago because Windows users
have a huge selection of free apps to
choose from so what I'm going to do is
do five free apps I think everyone
should be using and then list a few more
apps that I think are also really good
also free but are more specialized so
those may not apply to everyone
depending on what you do or don't you
and as usual none of these are sponsored
because those videos suck okay first one
it's an antivirus I'm the type of person
that doesn't use an antivirus because
I'm an idiot but I'm just comfortable
formatting frequently so I'm okay with
it
but for most people who are not stupid
you should run an antivirus my two
favorites are AVG and Avast or AV ASP
there's a site called AV test they're an
independent site that test antivirus
really extensively and then they update
their ranking list so in terms of the
free ones AVG and AV ASP are always near
the top this Ahn thing is up there as
well but it's a paid software so screw
that guy with the current builds a vast
does a better job at detecting current
malware but AVG is slightly less taxing
on your system you really can't go wrong
with either of them I prefer performance
so if I have to choose I'd go with AVG
if you're wandering Microsoft Windows
Defender isn't perfect for detection and
when it's running there's a measurable
performance hit next up we have a
clipboard manager called ditto these are
apps that kind of store all the stuff
you copy using control-c so if you copy
a selection of text and then later on
you copy more text ditto
stores it all into a clipboard manager
really useful for essays development and
just about anything if you've never used
one before install it they're very
lightweight and pretty useful all right
next up is a flux or efflux it's a
program that adjusts the color
temperature of your screen based on the
time of day so during daylight hours
your screen looks completely normal but
as the Sun sets the blue hues get
reduced on the screen which makes it
more comfortable for your eyes it's a
little weird at first because stuff
looks really warm and orange but you get
used to it and once you do your computer
usage at night it's just
easier on your eyes and personally I can
fall asleep more readily after using
computers that's head efflux running the
next thing okay we need to talk about
something related there's an app called
ccleaner it used to be amazing like it
seriously belongs in top three apps for
Windows but Windows 10 has gotten better
and better at cleaning up its own mess
and at this point unless you really know
what you're doing with it I don't
recommend ccleaner anymore especially
with cleaning registries nowadays a
registry cleanup kamesh things up pretty
bad this thing is ccleaner also came
with a good uninstaller but since I
don't recommend ccleaner anymore we got
to find a separate uninstaller program
and my favorite one right now is IObit
Uninstaller it's pretty simple the UI is
good and it just does what it says it
does it cleanly uninstalled your
applications ok the last of this group
of apps is a tax better so instead of
using something super basic like notepad
that comes with Windows there's
something called notepad plus plus it's
basically an ant's up version of notepad
a lot of the features are geared towards
developers there's syntax highlighting
and you can have multi editing but a lot
of the features are awesome for regular
people you can zoom in and out of your
document and my favorite is we can have
different tabs open so I use a text
editor for a bunch of stuff in my life
and notepad plus plus is awesome for it
and I know some of you guys are
developers and you're using things like
sublime and Adam but for the average
person that isn't a developer notepad
plus plus is solid so they'll absolutely
have listed so far those are just apps
that everyone would use oh I think that
everyone should be able to use the next
five are a little more specific so the
first one is an app called discord if
you've been using Ventrilo teamspeak
mumble or some other kind of voice chats
play game you should consider switching
to discord I think it's the best of the
team chat programs it has your usual
desktop client but you can also run it
from a web browser and you can even send
people links that instantly brings them
into your channel it also tells you what
games your friends are playing and if
they're online if you're not using this
yet you should switch next up is OBS or
ODS and it's basics it's a screen
capture program it's how I'm recording
all of these clips but it can stream to
any rtmp enabled service like twitch and
YouTube
it also supports quick sync for faster
video processing has an audio mixer
plugin it's really solid the one thing
that doesn't have is
like a secondary stream so if you want
to stream your game while showing a
webcam of you playing or like a webcam
of your keyboard it doesn't support that
okay if you're looking to edit videos
and you want something a little more
feature-rich than Windows Movie Maker my
top picks are hitfilm and DaVinci
Resolve now the free versions of these
applications are toned down from the
paid versions but there's still very
capable programs I've actually edited
some of my older videos with both of
these hitfilm has more features in
regards to effects like if you want to
add any kind of visual effects hitfilm
has stuff that's built into it and it
basically supports any kind of video
format so if you're shooting from a
GoPro hit film is great if you have a
more advanced camera like a DSLR
I'd go with DaVinci Resolve it has some
really powerful color correction and
color grading tools another notable
feature about resolve is how well it
uses GPUs so if you're fortunate to have
a really good video card resolve can
take better advantage of it now if
you're looking for a free photoshop type
program if you just want something
better than ms paint there's GIMP which
is a pretty powerful photo editor but
Windows users are lucky and also have
access to paint.net so I've used both of
these GIMP is more powerful and has
access to a lot more features some of
the plugins are amazing like gee Mike
paint.net isn't as feature-rich but it's
so much easier to learn how to use so if
you're new to photo editing or digital
illustration I would highly recommend
paint.net fantastic program and I think
for like 90% of people that use it
you'll be able to do whatever you want
to do with a photo editing program ok
the last one is a hardware monitor and
choosing one of these is like choosing a
brand of cereal there are a ton of good
options and everyone has their personal
favorite my pick is hardware info it's
an app for people who want to keep track
of their systems so if you want to see
your processor use temperatures memory
usage it does a really good job it can
monitor your system very extensively and
if all the ones that I've tried I think
that's the best overall package and
that's about it if you guys learned a
thing or two like if you've discovered
an app because of this video I'd love to
hear about it if you didn't learn
anything that's pretty sad but let me
know in the comments below if you knew
about all these apps to begin with I
hope you guys enjoyed this video some to
be liked it
subs we loved it I'll see you guys next
