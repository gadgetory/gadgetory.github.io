is a video on some tech accessories that
I think are super useful for students
and this is not going to be a video
where you're going to see stuff like TVs
and speakers because as fun as those are
I seriously don't think that those are
just really all that useful for students
what you will see are things that I
actually think are well I'm not a
student anymore but I feel like if I had
these when I was a student these would
be awesome okay first up are some cables
they're not just any cable these are
every cable in one cable so these are
made by a company called chiffon and
it's essentially every single charging
cable connected into one USB a cable so
we have mini USB micro USB USB C and on
the big one it actually comes with two
lightning cables so with this device you
can basically charge any phone as long
as those made in the last like 10 or 15
years I think this is incredibly useful
so the thing that makes this thing cool
is how simple it is and you can keep it
in your bag your car wherever you want
they're very inexpensive I think they're
like eight or nine dollars yeah
great purchase very useful in my opinion
second on the list are some battery
packs so my go-to battery pack is anchor
I feel like they make some of the best
quality battery packs on the market
they're inexpensive and they don't have
like stupid features like lights and
like flashlights and RGB stuff going on
very simple but very reliable batteries
that I've owned from even before I
started doing YouTube stuff they come in
various colors and various sizes and
some of the bigger ones from anchor can
recharge some laptops now if you're in
the market for a battery pack and you
want something that's a little bit more
streamlined there are a couple devices
out there that have like built-in prongs
so you can just plug them right up into
the wall to charge and they have
built-in cable to make it that much
easier now sadly I've never found one of
these all-in-one battery packs for use
PC but they do have them for micro USB
and lightning a link book is on below
alright the last thing I want to talk
about is storage and I really think this
device is something that every student
in 2017 should have this is a device
it's just a flash storage right very
unassuming but it has both USB see and
use PA on one device so you can just
flip it around and plug it into whatever
port you want if you format this thing
with X
you can connect it to any computer Mac
OS Windows Linux whatever you want
you're basically unstoppable but the
thing that makes this thing's so useful
is like if you ever want to transfer a
file or if you need to transfer
someone's file over to your computer
whatever like this thing and it goes
onto your keychain right it's so small
it's so insignificant get this thing
this will save your butt so many times
in school like just do it
okay if you want something a little more
substantial we have Seagate and Western
Digital drives these are obviously a lot
bigger these are one terabyte at a
minimum I think they started like 50
bucks are relatively inexpensive and you
can use these things as backup to store
your work your games your videos
whatever you want now I've always used
Seagate drives in the past but I've
actually tried these recently and these
Western digital ones and I find them
actually slightly better they're
equivalent in price but the thing that
makes you kind of cool I mean they come
in different colors so that's kind of a
bonus but they have these rubber feet on
the bottom the Seagate drives don't so
when you place them down on a table the
Western Digital ones just I don't know
they stick around a little better and
that alone makes me prefer them more but
you can't go wrong with out of them okay
that's basically it three pretty
important pieces of technology I think
every student should have</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
