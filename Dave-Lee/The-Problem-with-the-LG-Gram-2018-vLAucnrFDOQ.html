hey how's it going Dave 2d here so this
is the 2018 LG gram and this is a device
that gets updated pretty frequently the
last update was in like December of 2017
three months later we have another
update but this particular update has
been one of the more substantial ones
actually changed quite a bit of the
hardware now this one is the 15-inch LG
gram and actually think this is one of
the more unique laptops that LG makes
because they're sticking the you
processor into a large screen to chassis
which I actually think is really useful
for a lot of people people that just
want like a bigger screen without paying
for really expensive processors this is
a really good choice for them so they've
made some nice changes but there's
actually a problem this laptop that
other reviewers don't seem to be talking
about we'll get there but first I'm
gonna go through some stuff that hasn't
changed
so the chassis I think this is pretty
much the exact same chassis as the
previous generation but it now has the
new mil standard 810g and it looks like
serious business right there's a green
shield and it just makes you feel like
there's a degree of durability that this
laptop has and it does but I just don't
think that particular specification is
very stringent like there's a lot of
products out there that can get that
certification because it's not that hard
you know what to say that this isn't a
well-built laptop it is considering its
weight but keep in mind that its main
advantage is that it's a really
lightweight laptop and every time I pick
this thing up it feels impossibly light
especially for something with a 15-inch
screen but they have to use weaker
materials to reach that weight okay
something I've always disliked about the
LG gram is just how difficult it is to
get into this laptop it's the removal of
eight screws but you got to remove a
bunch of feet like rubber feet that
don't easily go back on because it's
using double-sided tape and it's like
there's just a lot of stuff you have to
do to get into this laptop it's possible
but you have to be careful not to break
any of the tabs now once you're inside
you'll see that the speaker's look like
they've been upgraded and they have
technically but they sound pretty much
exactly the same as a previous
generation a little bit louder but the
sound quality is still not good
I really wish they had properly upgraded
the speaker's because this room there's
plenty of room in there for some bigger
or better speakers but yeah we're stuck
with some pretty weak speakers the
keyboard also hasn't changed it's not a
great keyboard anything it's decent it's
just not the best keyboard out there for
an ultrabook
it's got good spacing backlighting and a
good layout but I just find that the key
mechanisms are a little bit softer than
I'd like another thing that hasn't
changed is the charging so
this thing uses a barrel plug and they
include one a barrel plug AC adapter but
I feel like at this price point they
should include a USBC charger because it
does support USB C charging now the last
thing that hasn't changed from the
previous version is the screen it's a
good screen 1080p touch panel decent
color accuracy I wish it was brighter
it's not that as dim but in 2018 we're
just seeing a lot more ultra ebooks
coming out with brighter and better
screens this one's still good but there
are better displays at this price point
okay let's talk about things that have
changed the big one for me is the
trackpad so it's always had a decent
feeling surface with a good mechanism
but it now uses Windows precision
drivers so the tracking and the gestures
are just a little bit more accurate the
webcam has been moved so it's always
been on the bottom like right along the
hinge it's now at the top of the panel
kind of like a more traditional spot I
don't think the image quality is amazing
or anything but it's a respectable
webcam for people that need it a nice
little refresh they did was to change
the location of the fingerprint sensor
it's now on the power button not on the
top of the trackpad or anymore it's I
think a better location but I don't
think it makes a world of a difference
ok the biggest change in my opinion is
the inclusion of a Thunderbolt 3 port so
now this thing supports Thunderbolt 3
but the weird thing is they didn't
change like the printing on the side of
the device like it doesn't have the
Thunderbolt symbol on it it's just your
regular use BC symbol and instead
they've stuck a Thunderbolt 3 sticker on
the top of the keyboard the other thing
they've changed inside is they've added
a bigger battery so this thing now has a
72 watt hour battery which is pretty
large for an ultrabook and I'm able to
get around eight and a half or nine
hours of battery life on a single charge
that's with the screen at 250 nits and
if you're wondering why the battery life
isn't longer considering how big the
battery is it's simply because it's a
bigger screen 15 inch screen needs more
juice to run their claims have sixteen
and a half hours on their website uses a
pretty unrealistic benchmark so take
that number with a grain of salt okay
let's talk about performance and I think
this is where this laptop has may be an
issue depending on what you use this
thing for so this is a device that uses
an eighth gen you processor and if
you're doing regular stuff that you
would earn Ultrabook it's great good
performance great multi-core performance
it's a good laptop the problem comes
when you want to play games on this
thing so the default card isn't very
good
it's a UHD 620 it's not great for
playing games so whatever but
cuz this thing has a Thunderbolt 3 port
I connected an external GPU to this
thing and the performance is
disappointing so this is the problem
this laptop was not designed for the CPU
to run at Full Tilt's for extended
periods of times when you plug an
external GPU to this thing you hope for
some kickass performance but I got some
serious throttling to the point where it
just was unusable as a gaming setup the
problem is the single fan it's fine for
an ultrabook doing Ultrabook things but
it's not if you're going to be using the
Thunderbolt 3 port so if you look at
other devices like the Razer Blade self
that has two fans XPS 13 that has two
fans even the HP Envy which doesn't have
great thermals has two fans pretty much
every Ultrabook that has a Thunderbolt 3
port that can connect to an external GPU
has two fans because when you're playing
games on a thermally Traut CPU it's
terrible and honestly I feel like LG
just got lazy I feel like they slapped a
Thunderbolt 3 port on this machine just
so they could say they had one but they
didn't spend the time to do it properly
they didn't improve the thermals and
it's a bit of a shame because this
thing's got a lot of good hardware if
the thermal solution was better like
it's got 16 gigs of RAM to nvme drives
and it's got four lanes of PCIe support
on that Thunderbolt 3 port it's just not
a great gaming setup because of the
thermal solution so depending on what
you want to use this laptop for if you
want to use it just for like ultrabook
stuff it's awesome the fan is quiet and
the thermals are good it's a great
laptop for productivity a little
overpriced but it's great but if you're
looking to pick this thing up and
connecting it to an external GPU for
playing games and stuff like that this
is not a great device for that ok hope
you guys enjoy this video thumbs we
liked it subs we loved it see you guys
