and this is my review of the Microsoft
Surface book now I do a lot of reviews
on Tomb on devices like I love the idea
of hybrid devices because I like having
less stuff but for the most part I find
it difficult to use a toulon device as
my daily driver
I find them often underpowered or like
the tablet isn't very good or the laptop
isn't very good but when Microsoft
revealed this thing and they show that
you could remove the screen and use it
as a tablet I was like up up up up up up
up stop my penis can only get sore rekt
so I've had this thing for a week I've
used it every single day and I've edited
two videos on it including the one
you're watching right now here are my
thoughts okay so instead of a slide-out
tray like other surface devices this box
opens up from the top and inside you get
the surface book the stylus some
pamphlets and the charger the device has
a magnesium casing like we've come to
expect from the entire surface line the
finish feels identical to basically
every other surface product and that's a
good thing it feels durable it feels
premium and it looks good and I like the
polish the windows logo up here so it's
the same magnesium finish on the bottom
and it has two rubber strips that give
the surface book a little grip when it's
on a table we'll talk about the hinge
later but when you press this button
here you can remove the screen from the
surface book and it functions as a
powerful tablet which Microsoft has
called the clipboard we have a power
button and a volume rocker on one side
and a headphone jack over here and then
along the length of this entire side we
have connections so these two are for
attaching it to the base and these three
are for transferring data between the
two halves when they're connected and
the middle one can also be used for
charging the clipboard separately if you
need it now inside this clipboard is a
fully functional Windows 10 PC so this
unit here has a skylake core i5 running
at 2.4 gigahertz and has 8 gigs of ram
256 gigs of storage and Intel HD 520
integrated graphics as well as a
discreet Nvidia chip which isn't in here
but it's in the keyboard base and this
configuration will run you $1,900 u.s.
yeah
it's very expensive now the base unit
starts at 1500 but once you throw in the
Nvidia chip you're looking at 1900 and
up the screen is a 13.5 inch panel
running at three thousand by two
thousand pixels so like all current
surface products it has an aspect ratio
of 3 to 2 instead of like the 16 to 10
or 69 like other tablets the
disadvantage is that you get some pretty
heavy letterboxing when you're watching
videos it's not a wide screen right and
then you also lose some width on your
screen when you're editing things with
timelines so for like video or audio
production but the good thing is that
for things like taking notes reading
books or just browse on the web or doing
basically any kind of work one clipboard
mode it's a lot better so for the
purpose of a two-in-one device a three
by two aspect ratio is definitely the
right choice viewing angles are great
and it's really bright like as bright as
a macbook pro dislike and something else
I really like is how dim the screen gets
like you can comfortably view this in
the dark there's an 8 megapixel camera
on the back which gets decent pictures
but come on it's a 13.5 inch tablet you
don't want to be that guy and there's a
5 megapixel camera on the front which
has surprisingly good video quality and
it's used for Microsoft hello it's
basically like a quick way to unlock the
device using facial recognition and it
works really well the tablet experience
is decent it's reasonably lightweight at
one point six pounds but remember it's a
13.5 inch screen so it's a really large
tablet and it's kind of cumbersome when
you use it it's good as a digital
clipboard for sharing things with others
and it's nice and big for illustrations
and any kind of creative work but when
you use it as like a media consumption
device it's really fluid and it's snappy
for browsing the web and watching videos
but it doesn't feel particularly organ
amah or inviting to use like the edges
are a little sharp and it feels really
industrial but for a large screen tablet
it's pretty comfortable to use overall
as long as it has battery life and
therein lies the cat
the battery life on this thing is really
short Microsoft gives a rough estimate
of around 4 hours I got around 2 to 3
hours so if you're watching a longer
movie at maximum brightness you may not
be able to make it through the whole
thing the speakers were okay they get
reasonably loud but the sound quality
isn't great for a clipboard that you
occasionally use to share a screen with
someone it's pretty cool but for
personal media consumption a battery
life of three hours is too short so if
you're looking for the Windows
experience in a tablet I would really
recommend the surface pro 4 over the
surface book the new surface pen is an
upgrade over the previous generation so
this nib has better texture to it it
doesn't quite feel like writing on paper
when you use it but it's better than
before the eraser on the back is really
cool they got the texture right and
legitimately feels like you're erasing
something you'll look for eraser bits on
the screen when you use it so I've
erased a lot of stuff while playing with
it over the past week and the eraser nub
still looks the same it doesn't seem to
wear out quickly you can click the
eraser to start up OneNote and then you
can double click it to take screenshots
and you can hold it to launch Cortana
overall they did a great job on this pen
now I'm not a strong illustrator but I
have a friend who is and she drew a
couple things using the surface book and
like any other tablet it's inefficient
to draw without a keyboard because you
lose your keyboard shortcuts but overall
she thought it was pretty cool and I
quote I thought it was pretty cool
ok the clipboard attaches to the
keyboard using these two tabs here so
you line up the two tabs with the slots
you place it in and then you get a fully
functional laptop and to detach it again
you press the same button here's a cool
fact there is a click you hear when it
attaches which is supposedly a sound
that they put out through the speakers
just so you know it's been detached
because the actual mechanism is pretty
quiet the connection is strong and it
seems reliable like you can carry it
around holding just the screen the
mechanism seems to work well but I had a
couple times when the screen wouldn't
disconnect properly and I had to reboot
the device to get it working again it's
not a huge issue but I'm hoping a
software update will fix this the hinge
itself has this mechanism
that kind of rolls it outward as you
open it so I don't know about its
long-term durability but mechanically it
works really well
but because of this hinge it has this
gap and I've been staring at this thing
for over a week and it hasn't grown on
me at all if anything I've found it more
and more distasteful like I like the way
it looks when it opens but then the gap
bugs me when it's closed and when you
keep it in your bag lint and dust just
love to go into that gap and there's a
lot of moving parts in there so we'll
have to see how it holds up over time
when you connect the screen to the
keyboard base you get a laptop and I'm
going to cut right to the chase here
this is an excellent laptop the keyboard
is nice the key travel is good
three-stage backlight is good the layout
could be better I mean the page up and
page down are up in the function keys
which might annoy you if you use those a
lot and I don't like the up and down
arrows which are the same height as the
left and right keys like I find a little
disorienting sometimes and I'll
accidentally press shift when I'm trying
to press up but aside from that it's a
good keyboard the glass trackpad is also
pretty good I thought it'd be as good as
a MacBook trackpad because I heard the
word glass and it's really close but
there's still the occasional skip
especially in Chrome so I think it's
just the software thing but the texture
on the glass is a little sticky or just
rougher than a MacBook texture but I
feel like I'm just nitpicking here it's
seriously the best trackpad I've used on
a Windows machine to date okay going
around the base on the left you get two
USB 3.0 ports a pretty shallow SD card
slot and on the right side you get a
mini DisplayPort and the surface connect
slot there's only one power button on
this device so you still have to use the
one on the top of the screen even in
laptop mode now the screen does have a
little bit of a wobble when you move it
around or when you poke at it but it's
not a big deal like basically every
notebook screen wobbles when you use it
as a touchscreen
okay let's talk performance the drive
has a fast read speed at around 1,500
Meg's per second but the write speed is
surprisingly slow at less than 200 MX
per second so I edited a couple videos
with the surface book and it's not bad I
mean 1080p edits are smooth 4k edits are
a little choppy err but it's still
pretty usable in comparison to the
13-inch I 5 MacBook Pro 1080p edits feel
identical but the MacBook Pro is
noticeably smoother to edit on in 4k
if I had to guess I think it's the slow
right speed on the surface book like if
you're writing preview files and the
media cache at a right speed of 170
Meg's per second it's got to be hurting
performance now the easy solution is
just to use fast external drives for
edits render speeds were faster on the
surface book with NVIDIA chip so it's
about 10 to 15 percent faster than the
MacBook for 4k renders so this Nvidia
chip has 384 CUDA cores so it resembles
a low-end maximal chip so it's like a
920 or like a 940 m but it has one gig
of ddr4 AM which is less RAM than your
average 940 m it's got faster Ram
because it's ddr5 but less ram okay
let's talk about games the screen has a
3 by 2 aspect ratio so some games will
have block bars on the left and right if
they don't support the resolution so
light games like csgo they run nicely on
this device had graphics on high and I
was getting around 50 frames per second
at 1080p
MOBA is like dota 2 and here's of the
storm to get pretty good frame rates
like I tried to push the graphics
quality and I was getting around 35 to
40 frames per second on extreme graphics
at 1080p so you can easily hit 50 60
frames per second on high graphics
settings games like rust or any kind of
like online open-world environment those
don't run well probably because of that
one gig of video RAM so at fastest
settings at 1080p I was getting around
1520 frames per second I wouldn't really
call that playable Starcraft runs well I
haven't played it in a while and I got
rekt but I was easily getting 50 frames
per second on high settings at 1080p
I didn't notice much throttling in
game's framerate seemed pretty steady
and everything I played and the
temperatures are normal like it's a
little warm on the clipboard screen but
the keyboard stays relatively cool even
under load it's a similar temperature to
a MacBook Pro when it's under load the
fan noise is silent at idle and it's
about 30 decibels when it's under load
so very tolerable it's a 60 watt AC
adapter and like the surface pro it has
that USB plug on the side the battery
life on the laptop is fantastic like I
can easily break 10 hours of regular use
with the screen at 80% playing games
frame rates take a big hit when you're
playing on battery but I got around
three to three and a half hours which is
actually really good and in case you're
wondering when the clipboard is out of
batteries and you plug it up to the base
the connection doesn't like refuel the
clipboard using the batteries from the
base you need to actually have the
charging cable plugged in to juice it up
all right the title of this video is the
almost perfect tune one and I really
mean that if I was tasked to re-engineer
the surface book there's very little I'd
change I'd keep the screen I keep the
keyboard I'd keep the trackpad I'd keep
the magnesium build I keep the graphics
cards I mean I'd even keep the ports
there's no us PC but its 2015 I think
we're good without us PC for another
year one thing that I would change or at
least try to change is that hinge
functionally it's fantastic it works
really well but it doesn't look very
pretty and I think is going to deter a
lot of people from purchasing this
device just because of how it looks it's
a very expensive device very expensive
so you kind of expect your product to
look as good as they perform at this
price point the other thing is that it's
not a very balanced two-in-one device
it's an excellent laptop and it's a very
laptop focused device but the tablet
component is it's not an afterthought
it's very functional and it works well
but it's not as good as the laptop
component and that to me makes it less
than perfect it would I would consider
this a really good product for like a
medical student and engineering student
architecture student basically any kind
of professional faculty student this is
a fantastic device a very expensive
device but a fantastic device same thing
goes for people in the workplace if you
can use both of the components it's an
excellent device for that but if you're
a casual user and you just want to like
consume media or play video games this
is not that device you'll have fun
you'll love it but it's a very expensive
device and you won't get a good value
out of it
that's the end of this review hope you
guys liked it give some thumbs if you
did subs if you loved it it's been
I'll see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
