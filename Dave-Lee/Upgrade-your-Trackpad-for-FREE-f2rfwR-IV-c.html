Dave2D here
So this is a video that's not one of my regular hardware videos
It's about something that has
plagued Windows laptops for a really long time
It's this issue that keeps popping up here and there, and it doesn't matter
if your laptop is new or old, or...
expensive or cheap, it doesn't matter, because you can still have this issue
It's the trackpad
There are Windows laptops out there, lots of them, that have
really crappy trackpads, and that boils down to one thing...
Software. If you have... great hardware
like this one, glass surface, great button mechanics...
But... It's got crappy software. It's running Elan drivers
And, if you're one of those laptop owners that's running
something with an Elan driver or Synaptics driver
You're not having a good time with the trackpad
At least, you can have a better time with the trackpad
using Windows Precision drivers.
And this video explains how to put those drivers onto your existing laptop
So first you have to figure out whether your laptop is running Elan drivers
or Synaptics drivers, and to do that, you just go to Control Panel
Check out the Device Manager and you'll be able to see what you're running
And if you're not running either one of those two,
you're either running Windows Precision drivers already
Or you're running something weird that this video can't help you with
Okay, once you have figured which one you have, either Elan or Synaptics,
You download one of the two files that are linked in the video description
One is for people with Synaptics trackpads, and the other's for the people
with Elan trackpads, and depending on which one you have,
you just download the appropriate one. But in case you're wondering
Both of these files are actually from Lenovo; they weren't meant for
this kind of &amp;quot;hack&amp;quot; that we're doing. They were meant for something else obviously
But, it worked perfectly for this kind of replacement
of the Synaptics or Elan trackpad drivers
So, once you have the file, you extract it by either running the
&amp;quot;exe&amp;quot; or unzipping it, and it will place all the files
into a folder called &amp;quot;Drivers&amp;quot; in a route, and then
you go into your Device Manager again, right-click your trackpad
whether it is the Elan one or Synaptics one, and then you go
&amp;quot;Update driver&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Browse my computer&amp;quot;
Choose &amp;quot;Let me pick&amp;quot; and then click on &amp;quot;Have disk&amp;quot;
Now if you have a laptop with Elan driver, you go for the &amp;quot;ETD.inf&amp;quot; file
And for the laptops with Synaptics trackpad,
choose the Synaptics driver. So basically, you're replacing
the existing drivers on your laptop, whether they be Elan or Synaptics,
and you're replacing them with Windows Precision touchpad drivers
which are SO MUCH better, and the biggest difference you'll notice
is, I mean tracking is smooth and everything
Tracking is just much more accurate with Windows Precision drivers
But the big one is gestures
Being able to use the Windows 10 gestures both accurately and reliably
makes the trackpad so much better
Okay, before you run off to do this, I need to leave a couple kind of disclaimers with you
First, you do this at your own risk
I've obviously tested this on many computers
Probably 40, maybe 50 laptops, and for
the laptop that has worked on, they have been great
But for the ones it didn't work on, they exploded.
No, for the ones that didn't work on, the drivers
just won't update. Windows will be like,
&amp;quot;Sorry bud, we can't take these drivers,&amp;quot; and that's the end of that
But the other thing you have to keep in mind is that, you can't
let Windows overwrite your new drivers with like an automatic Windows update
That's very, very annoying, because sometimes you won't even know that it is updated
And all of the sudden, the trackpad's gone back to its
old, disgusting self, and you'll have to figure out that
Hey, it's because Windows overwrote it
And you'll have to redo the process, so you just need to make sure that
you're downloading the appropriate update
You don't wanna download something that's like, the new Elan, or the new
Synaptics driver. You wanna avoid those
And, the other thing to keep in mind is that,
If you want to, you should probably backup or find a backup
of your old existing drivers
In case if you wanna revert back to them, so go to your manufacturer
Download that driver in advance before you do any of this stuff,
before you try.
Okay, hope you guys enjoyed this video! I really hope this was helpful because...
(sigh)
This has existed for probably over a year
Kind of, it's gone better over time especially with
the new Lenovo driver that's just recently came out like maybe,
two to three weeks ago, it's way better now.
This works on a lot of laptops, enjoy.
Okay, thumbs if you liked this video, subs if you loved it.
See you guys next time!</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
