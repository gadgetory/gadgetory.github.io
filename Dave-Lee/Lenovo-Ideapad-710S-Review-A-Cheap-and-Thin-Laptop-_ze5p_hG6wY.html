Dee and this is a video on the Lenovo
IdeaPad 710 s so this was a product that
was designed to compete against the best
ultra ebooks on the market right now so
things like the XPS 13 the razor blade
stealth but the Lenovo comes in a
package that's thinner lighter and
cheaper let's take a look
it comes in a fairly compact box you get
the laptop inside some paperwork and a
one piece power adapter so there's no
flip out prongs or anything it's just a
simple wall plug the base model runs a
skylake core i5 and it's priced at seven
to eight hundred dollars depending on
sales a similarly equipped XPS 13 runs
around $1000 and so does a razor blade
stealth but that comes with a faster
core i7 processor and all of these have
eight gigs of RAM and 128 gigs of
storage the exterior materials that
Lenovo went with are magnesium and
aluminum the top surface is magnesium
with some aluminum it has a little more
flex to it than the XPS 13 lid but it
still feels solid the bottom panel is
aluminum and you can remove some screws
including the ones underneath the rubber
strip and then you have access to the
internals the RAM is soldered on this
one has eight gigs it goes up to 16 gigs
but the m2 drive is replaceable the
chassis of the device feels pretty
durable the keyboard area doesn't have
too much Bend but the screen shows a
little bit of flex if you put your back
into it the hinge mechanism is well-made
it does need two hands to open it though
now I think most of the price difference
is reflected in the build quality the
Lenovo is like two or three hundred
dollars cheaper than the XPS 13 or the
Razer Blade stealth the build quality is
embed it sacktual e really good
especially for something this thin and
this light but you can see that with the
reduction in weight if you put torsion
on the screen or if you're accidentally
putting pressure on the top panel it
doesn't have the same stiffness as the
XPS 13 but just get a case for it treat
it well and won't be an issue in terms
of connectivity it's a little bit light
on ports there's an SD card slot micro
HDMI a pair of USB 3 ports audio jack
and a system restore switch there's no
Thunderbolt 3 ports so there's no
external GPU connections ok opening it
up the keys on the keyboard are really
nice
I'd say it's one of the better typing
experiences on an ultrabook backlit 1.35
millimetre travel nice feedback if
you're a Mac user you'll adapt this
keyboard quickly the one thing that bugs
me though is the shift key on the right
side of the keyboard another some people
who only use the left shift but when I
first started using this keyboard I
would hit the up arrow instead of the
shift key I got used to it but until you
develop the muscle memory to hit the
smaller key be prepared for typos the
glass trackpad is a good-sized texture
isn't as smooth as I'd like it it's
bigger than the XPS 13 trackpad but it
has an eland driver so tracking isn't
perfect there's the occasional skip
gestures work well the buttons are good
and overall I'd say the trackpad
experience is on par with the XPS 13 the
screen has thin side bezels like the
infinity display on the XPS 13 the top
bezel is a little thicker because that
has a webcam in a more traditional spot
the XPS webcam always film from that low
up your nose angle this one's more
normal the display panel itself is nice
it's 1080p it's bright at 320 nits it
has good color accuracy and viewing
angles and combined with the matte
finish on that thin bezel it's a great
screen the speakers are on the bottom
there are JBL branded and you get Dolby
software for it they don't have much
base but they sound clear and they get
pretty loud or at least louder than you
think they would on a laptop this thin
drive speeds are pretty mediocre the
review unit I have here has 128 gig m2
SATA Drive the read speeds are okay but
the write speeds are kind of sluggish
fortunately you can replace it with the
faster PCIe drive if you want system
performances otherwise good it's got a
sky like I 5 with integrated HD 520
graphics you won't have any issues with
work or media consumption and it can
kind of handle some lightweight gaming
if you want so something like csgo or
even overwatch if you cranked all the
settings down you can hit like 50 60
frames per second at lowest resolution
it doesn't look the best but you can
still get some games in in the middle of
a lecture if you want if you want to
edit 1080p videos it can handle it no
problem just make sure to get an
external drive for your media if you
want to do 4k videos I wouldn't do it on
this one there's no abnormal thermal
throttling but remember I'm
the base model thermally it runs at
pretty average temperatures at max
loader doesn't get uncomfortable or
anything even you're using it on your
lap fan noise is also very reasonable
onload nothing too loud there is a 46
watt hour battery on the inside takes
around two hours to charge a little bit
less and I'm getting around 6 to 7 hours
of regular use ok
Lenovo IdeaPad 710 s a thin and light
ultrabook with respectable build quality
made with magnesium and aluminum it has
a 13 inch IPS panel it's bright with
pretty good color gamut and the side
bezels are nice and thin the backlit
keyboard is very responsive and nice to
type on but the right shift key takes
time to get used to the glass trackpad
is roomy and nice to use on the inside
the skylake processor is plenty powerful
for work and even for some light gaming
and is properly cooled the base model
storage is pretty slow on right speeds
but it is user replaceable the 8 gigs of
ram are soldered on and then there's a
46 watt hour battery that'll last year
on 7 hours so overall this is a great
device it's a thin and light Ultrabook
that still has a focus on affordability
now it has to make some compromises to
keep that price down so things like the
chassis strength and the drive speeds
those aren't fantastic but if you're
looking for a thin and light ultrabook
and you have a tighter budget take a
look at this one you might like it
that's the end of this video thumbs be
liked it subs if you loved it it's been
nice see you guys next time
