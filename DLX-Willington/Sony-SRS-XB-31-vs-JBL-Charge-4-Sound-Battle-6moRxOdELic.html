welcome to another sound battle where we
let speakers speak for themselves
in the battlefield today we're still
looking at the JBL charge 4 and this
time we're going up against the Sony S
aureus XV 31 as usual I will be using a
high quality binaural microphone so for
the best experience please use
headphones and with that said let's hear
the speakers speak
do you and me uptown takes another round
in the disco ball
you
and there you have it so if you're
looking for the loudest of the - if
that's your deciding factor the SROs XP
31 is your guy here it is louder than
the charge for it's not liked by a ton
but it is louder but as far as sound
like what's coming out of them which one
sounds better well it might not be as
loud and I hate that it's a mono speaker
but the charge for sound significantly
well balanced than the Sony SRS XP 31
and the church phone also seems to
handle this a little bit better but both
speakers have some pretty good best
performance if you ask me but when it
comes to mids and most especially the
highs and the judge phone is a game
performing better than the XP 31 so out
of the two that shout phone is the
better sounding speaker but like I
mentioned it's a mono speaker because it
only has one driver so if that's a
deal-breaker for you
maybe the XP 31 is not that bad after
all
I'm sorry actually gives you an option
to choose how you like your sound with
the extra bass feature and they also
give you an app in order to tweak the
sound to your taste you know take out
the bass a little bit or add some stereo
to it but at same time usually what I
tell people is that the app or the EQ is
not what solves everything what the EQ
is able to do is based off of what the
speaker is capable of so I don't think I
ever use eq's on my speakers I play
sound playing as is and that's why when
I do my testing I don't use EQ at all
because those are they introduce
everybody to their own taste so that's
something that you can do by your own on
your phone if you're able to and tweak
the sound to the way you want it so I
don't like to test EQ
unless it's a video dedicated to that
but yeah
Sony gives you an EQ that you can use to
tweak the sound to the way you want it
so that's a plus
people like geek use and you can use I'm
not saying it's bad right they have to
be used so anyways what do you guys
think let me know in the comment section
below if you plan on picking up all you
want to see how much the speakers are
going for right now I will leave the
links to these speakers down in the
description description section below so
check them out use those links it helps
out the channel if you do that and I
really do appreciate you guys to go
ahead and do that and so we handy thank
you very much and thank you for watching
this one if you're new here please
subscribe so you don't miss out on the
upcoming videos if you like the video
leave it a like if you didn't like it
leave a dislike I just want to get some
sort of feedback from you because you
watch the video what do you think yep
thanks for watching I will see you in
the next one peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
