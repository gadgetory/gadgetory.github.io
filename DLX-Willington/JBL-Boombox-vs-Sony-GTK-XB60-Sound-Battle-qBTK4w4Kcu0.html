welcome to another sound battle where
will it speakers speak for themselves in
the butterfield sure that we have the
Sony GT kxb 60 going up against the JBL
boombox two speakers the look and a
displayed to battle against each other
the only thing that kind of surprised me
when I was in Best Buy is that the GT
kxp 60 is the same price as the srs XP
40 interesting anyways to the
battlefield JBL brought to 20 millimeter
tweeters to 100 and 200 millimeter
woofers and to pr's on the other hand
sony brought to 50 millimeter tweeters
and to 130 millimeter woofers so who
will give us better sound well let's
find out as usual I'll be using a high
quality binaural microphone so for the
best experience please use headphones
with that said let's hear the speaker's
speak
feels like I'm in the please come down
go
knew some special place I've never been
I'd like to do something crazy we should
try to run away
Oh
okay so with both speakers playing the
same song at 100 percent volume five
feet away from the sound meter I was
able to get a maximum DB read for the
boombox at 104 DB and the max DB for the
the XP 60 at 102 so the difference is
not so huge but the boombox
is a little bit louder than the XP 60
and this difference could be caused by
the fact that the XP 60 is lacking
significant highs the highest on the
boombox are not the best but the XP 60
despite having twitter's sounds a little
muffled it really feels like they didn't
really take advantage of the Twitter's
at all and people usually say well
that's sacrificing for waterproof nice
but the thing is now even waterproof so
I have no idea what's going on moving on
then moves on both speakers are not the
best at all and with the boombox all you
hear are the highs and the best with a
void in between them but when it comes
to best performance this is where the XP
60 failed in a way that I was not
expecting when I took this huge thing
out of the box with the speaker this
size in the size of the drivers it's
housing inside of it it's best
performance is rather disappointing and
it doesn't matter if you have the extra
bass on or off
either way the boombox does a way better
job it bear its base goes deeper and it
comes out louder than that of the XP 60
I don't know what they did to the XP 60
it just doesn't sound like it looks like
the f our reading of the boombox goes as
low as 50 Hertz but I looked all over
the internet on Sony's website I just
couldn't find that if our reading for
the XP 60 makes you wonder why for this
battle the boombox takes the win for me
here it's not a perfectly balanced
speaker but it's way better than the XP
60 and if your best heavy listener
the way to go is the boombox hands down
the only reason to get the XP 60 is if
you like its other features like the
lights and maybe you being able to use
it as a PA system if you have your own
microphone on the other hand though it's
not waterproof and the boombox is
waterproof so things to think about I
vote for the boombox as far as sound
quality how about you I'd like to hear
what you have to say about the two in
the comment section below and if you let

didn't like it feel free to leave a
dislike I just want to hear and get some
sort of feedback from you and if you're

you in the next one peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
