and welcome to another sound battle
where we let speakers speak for
themselves in the battlefield today we
have the GT kxb 60 versus the bigger
brother the GT k XP 90 now this speakers
are pretty much the same they have the
same features and all the only main
difference between the two is this price
and the physical size of the speakers
the XP 90 is a lot bigger than the XP 16
and that goes for the roofers to the XP
90 has bigger woofers than those on the
xB 60 but as far as everything else they
are completely the same speakers I'll be
doing the recording of the 60 percent
indoors but when you get 100% volume
test we will be moving the speakers out
of doors because it's just unbearable in
a small room like my studio here so
we'll be moving the speakers outdoors
when we get to 100% test with that said
put your headphone his own and let's
hear the speakers speak
down
and there you have it the XP 90 is again
quite loud it's loud way louder than the
XP 60 so if loudness is your deciding
factor which if you're looking at this -
it should be part of it
the XP 90 is the way to go it gets a lot
louder than the XP 60 I'll actually go
ahead and say this if you have the XP 60
there's no need to upgrade or get 2x b9e
unless loudness is what you need so if
that's what you're looking for loudness
go for the XP 90 if loudness does not
matter to you and you like the loudness
of the XP 60 you are all set you don't
need the XP 90 so maybe at 100% volume
you can hear that the XP 90 pumps out
like there's a lot less a lot more punch
to it because it's more powerful than
the xb6 T but that's that's about it
that's about it they are tuned exactly
the same way only the other one being a
little bit bigger and louder than the
other as maybe the lights are a little
bit different on the XP 90 compared to
the XP 60 but that's about it
Vespa needs from me that's that's those
are my thoughts about these two speakers
so I would like to hear what you you
have to say about the two in the comment
section below so drop me a comment make
sure you leave a like if you liked the
video dislike it if you didn't like it I
