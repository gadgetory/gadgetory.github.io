tomorrow is New Year's pretty
interesting isn't it
2019 is coming up but I'm the main we've
the main reason I'm making this video is
to answer too many questions that I get
asked I'm recently can you connect the
judge three to the judge for so they can
play together
and the answer to that is yes I made a
video about this and I'll put the link
down in the description below if you
want to go check that one out in detail
on how to do that the other question I
wanted to answer people ask me if sounds
any good if you have to charge three and
the judge for paired up together if the
sound is magic or really really good and
the answer is well how about I'll give
you a sound sample so you can kind of
get a feel of it I will be when I'm
doing this sound sample I will be
playing the two speakers playing
together they judge three in the charge
for playing together then I will throw
in the charge for just playing by itself
just so you can kind of get a feel of
how the charge four sounds like on
itself in comparison to when you have it
paired with the charge three and yeah
that should give you a better idea the
sound the difference
and yeah I'll be using a high quality
binaural microphone to record they saw
for the best experience please use
headphones and with that said I will see
you on the other side
don't
and they're like you hard when you have
this to the two speakers playing
together I think they do sound pretty
good they cannot play in stereo mode
just like all the other people out there
that make the speakers still your mode
requires the speaker's to be the same
exact model it's really weird but kind
of makes sense that that's how they want
but yeah the two can play together but
they cannot play in stereo mode so
that's the only down downfall but the
two speakers actually do sound pretty
good good good highs in the midst of
boosted a little bit they sound better
for some reason the best Department is
not much improved when they play
together a little bit better but it's
not by a lot but mostly the highs really
good and the mids are also really really
good the highest can be a little bit
harsh maybe if you have that maximum
volume a little bit harsh but for the
most part I do like the two of them
playing together I feel like you most
likely will not need the extreme two if
you have this two speakers already so if
you have they charge three I feel like
if you get the charge for you should get
the sound that you might be able to
gather the extreme two I might do that
video I might do that video the two of
them playing together how cans do you
extreme - because I feel like you
wouldn't need that with you
they do sound good you cannot play
through your mode but they do sound
pretty good what do you guys think did
you like the sound or would you get just
if you have the xtreme3 would we just
get the x10 for just you know so you can
get the sound at the extreme to my offer
somebody who owns one
oh this in general what do you think
about the two speakers and their sound
let me know in the comment section down
below
if you let the video a little like if
you didn't like it feel free to leave a
dislike I just want to give some sort of
feedback from you because you watched
the video if you're new here subscribe
you know for more awesome content coming
your way in 2019 I wish you guys a happy
new year and I will see you in the next
video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
