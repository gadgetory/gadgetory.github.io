and welcome to another sound battle
well that speakers speak for themselves
in the battlefield today we have the
Sony S aureus XV 20 versus the JBL flip
for in this battle the speakers will be
playing at seventy percent volume extra
base on the XP twenty will be off for
the first couple of songs but the rest
of the songs I will have it on I'll be
using a high quality binaural microphone
so please use headphones for the best
experience with us said let's hear the
speaker's speak oh god don't dare to say
oh oh happy to make time
oh and you have to win all around the
disco ball but but I have to pinky never
would see anger is misplaced
again
so for those of you looking for the
loudest of the two the XP 20 is your guy
here it's louder than the flip for but
as far as sound quality I personally
prefer what's coming out of the flip
phone
it sounds more balanced in the lot
cleaner than the XP 20 the best is nice
and deep on the flip for compared to the
XP 20s bass which is not as deep and
sounds weak even with the extra bass on
and at high volumes you will barely tell
the difference between extra bass on and
off on the Sony and the highest seem to
overpower everything else on the XP 20
at these high volumes so for these two I
think the flick fault wins big
the only reason to go with the XP 20 is
if you are looking for the loudest of
the two you are in love with those
lights all the price is right for you
but it's bass and overall better sound
quality of what you crave the flip for
is your guy here but that's just me and
sound is so subjective I would like to
hear what you guys have to say about
this - in the comment section below

watching this one I will see you in the
next one peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
