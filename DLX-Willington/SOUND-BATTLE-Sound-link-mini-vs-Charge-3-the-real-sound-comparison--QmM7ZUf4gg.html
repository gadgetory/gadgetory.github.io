with another video and before I go into
that though I want to thank you guys so
so so much for always coming back to my
videos and watching them and liking the
videos and commenting I really really
appreciate your comments and I tried my
best to answer and reply to all of you
guys but I want to say thank you very
much for being my cool awesome
subscribers if you're not a subscriber
is free so feel free to subscribe to my
channel and with all that said I'm gonna
get into this today we have the sound
link mini up against the charge 3 this
was a real really successful speaker the
sound link it was very very successful
it sounds very good very good base and
this is a really really successful
speaker that sound trigger is a 2016
release so this video is always about
how the speakers sound and that's what
we are doing today here as usual I will
have the speaker's about 6 feet away
from the sound recorder but usually I
play them at a hundred percent but today
we are going to be doing 70 percent the
reason I'm doing this today you guys can
tell me what you think or what you want
but speakers usually sound better not at
their maximum volume they usually fail a
little bit at their maximum so in order
to get the best sound that these
speakers can produce I was thinking to
start doing videos at the sound better
videos at 70 percent volume because you
know it's kind of loud but it's not at
their maximum so that they should give
you the best they can so if a speaker
cannot perform very good at that volume
you won't be any better when you pump
pump it up to 100% volume so that's what
I'm doing if you guys liked it let me
know down below if you don't like it and
you just prefer the maximum volume let
me know below and you know we can adjust
accordingly
so we're gonna be getting into this
video so push your hand phones on and
let the speaker's speak
you
okay so I don't know what to say here
because I feel like the speakers have
spoken for themselves already but I will
say anyways that the Soundlink mini is a
good speaker on its own if you put this
two together
know leave your comments down below of
what you think which speaker sounds
better according to what you've heard
and do not forget to subscribe if you're
not a subscriber and now say again thank
you subscribers for keeping coming back
and watching my videos and liking and I
appreciate you guys a lot and keep it up
I have more speakers coming up I'm going
to put this against probably the flip
three and maybe the five of them twenty
and we can see what the difference is
again thanks for watching and now see
you in a next video peace
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
