there is a bunch of tiny speakers out
there but I had to limit this video at
least to set a limit as to what I'm
calling a micro bluetooth speaker and my
limit was two inches if anything is a
little bit bigger than two inches did
not make it or less did not qualify as a
micro bluetooth speaker to me this this
is not the standard or the definition of
a micro bluetooth speaker but just for
the sake of putting a limit what I'm
able to cover into to put into this
video I just had to set some sort of
limit you know and the reason I wanted
to do this video in the first place is
because Amazon usually recommend stuff
like that to me like speakers and one of
them that they did I believe he was
maybe this guy right here that they
recommended to me I was like that is
small and then I went into that rabbit
hole of looking at all this tiny
speakers and I was like why would
someone want a speaker that small and
how do they sound like are they any good
because my thinking is if you're going
to get any other sort of speaker at
least it has to be better than a phone
this is my Galaxy s8 plus if I'm going
to buy a speaker like this I feel like I
would want it to sound a little louder
or better than the phone that I already
have that I'm going to be using to
stream the music to that speaker so I
wanted to buy all of these and try them
out and see if they are worth it so
anything that does not sound better than
my phone I would call that trash so I'm
going to go through all of this there's
a not all the speakers all the small
speakers that you can buy out there but
these are the ones I have I have eight
of them and we're going to look through
them tell you which ones sound worse
than my phone in which one sound
better than my phone and out of those
that sound better than my phone which
one sounds the best let's get into it
okay so this is how this is going to
work I'm going to start with the worst
of all and then make my well up to the
best of all as far as sound quality and
the worst of all is else this one is not
even available on Amazon anymore and I
think it's for good reason when I plug
it in it works fine but as soon as I
pull out the cable it just turns off
like not even a single second I soon as
I pull it out it turns off so I don't
know if I just got a faulty one but this
is trash and next up is decal dqo
however I want to pronounce that as many
it sounds so so quiet in comparison to
my s8 plus if you crack this all the way
up and crank my phone all the way up to
speak of my phone this is like half the
volume of my estate
to me I think it's just useless I see
you have some other reason that you guys
are using these tiny speakers for let me
know in the comment section below but if
something is now rather than the phone
I think it's useless so Alice this was
just faulty for some reason it's just
not easy for at all don't buy and next
up is they're in sick and for this one
here in comparison to the one we just
looked at the S mini this sounds way
better and if you compare it to my acid
plus it also sounds like it has a little
bit more substance in its found than my
AC h plus
but unless you really need that selfie
button that it has I'm still not really
sold on it I feel like if you have a
phone with dual facing speakers they
will sound better than this guy and like
I said I'm still not very sold on this
guy but since this at least volume of my
about the volume of my acid plus and
it's not as disappointing as the two
previous that we've looked at it's worth
something like I wouldn't throw that one
away
next up is the j2 or the nut
we love nuts and this one shouldn't
actually be here because somehow I
missed it but it's dimensions like the
height dimensions are actually 2.3 I
believe but I didn't see it when I was
doing the shopping for the speakers I
just realized that when I'm putting
together this video so it kind of
cheated but even that is not at the top
so it's okay for it to be in this in
this line up it's a little bit better
than the instinct right here in that it
goes a little bit deeper on the
frequency curve and it's a little bit
loud or two but it also sounds like it's
covered up or it's in some sort of tube
the highs are really really muted
so not mind blowing but it's okay and
next up we have the end called bm3 B and
this one also has a shutter button and
this is where things start to get a
little bit more interesting this one
literally sounds like they took what was
wrong with the nut and fixed it
and most especially considering it's
even smaller than that guy right there
so yeah this is one of those that is
kind of impressive in its way it's also
sounds way better than my acid plus a
good buy right here next up is there
Mars boy b3 and this one is a little bit
better than the end code in that is so a
little bit more powerful and it has
sharper highs which make it sound a
little bit louder than the the end code
right here but yes not by a ton
so yeah a little bit better than the end
code but it's not by a ton it's not like
mind blown and also it sounds better
than my phone oh and next up is this
Arden f2 it also has a smiley face on it
it looks kind of weird and this one
sounds pretty good with a little bit
better lower end than the Mars boy here
that's pretty impressive right there and
next up the best of all these guys right
here
is the era model a 106 it has a passive
radiator down here which I believe kind
of helped set but men considering its
size it does sound pretty good
I am really impressed by how it sounds
for its size and if you compare it to my
acid plus the difference is really night
and day so I feel like this is something
that I would get its really really small
it can fill in a pocket
I'm pretty happy with it it's an
all-metal construction so this is all
like aluminum like it's it's pretty
heavy too like really high quality build
and it comes with a case that will keep
it you know when you draw on your
writing with that all taking it places
but it doesn't have and it's sort of you
know like waterproofing or anything like
that would have been nice out of all
these guys here it's the best sounding
micro micro bluetooth speaker so happy
with it also and when I was reading some
reviews on Amazon like of all different
speakers someone mentioned that they
used bears in a helmet like a welding
helmet so they I guess they drop the
speaker in there to listen to music and
it just kind of got me interested so
like because like I hadn't reviewed any
of these because I have never found a
use for them and someone mention that I
was like huh people use this for
different reasons I guess so
if you like tiny speakers like this I
want you to let me know in the comment
section down there what do you use it
like what pulls you towards micro
speakers like this if you're into them
at all so yeah I'd like to hear that
also I wanted to mention that the
speakers that use
here and not all of the tiny speakers
the more tiny speakers out there so
there could be some better sounding
speakers out there like tiny ones that I
haven't tried out here so if there's
some that you'd want me to check out
specially if you enjoyed this video and
you want me to do more speakers like
bass like the tiny guys if you into them
let me know in a comment section below
and if it's a specific one that you want
me to check out leave it in a comment
station down if they are don't leave a
link because our YouTube will put it
into um spam just tell me the name of
the speaker I can look it up on Amazon
or something like that but yeah let me
know if you enjoyed the video please let
me know and I see if I can make more of
these kind of videos otherwise if you're
not subscribed please subscribe so you
don't miss out on more upcoming videos
that I'm working on if you liked the
video leave a like if you liked it leave
a dislike I just want to get some sort
of feedback from you because you watched
the video thanks for watching I will see
you in the next video peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
