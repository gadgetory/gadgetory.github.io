welcome to this video like you can
probably tell I'm not in my studio so
the lighting is not really meant for
video making so forgive me for the video
quality but that to the side I'm I
wanted to talk about the new firmware to
the GFDL extreme 2 because I got in so
many people who are commenting a lot
asking for my take on the new firmware
that was pushed out to the GBO extreme -
not too long ago but I also wanted to
mention that I'm not going to be making
firmware update videos on speakers
unless it's a significant update to a
speaker if that makes sense row so I'm
just saying I'm not going to be don't
expect to see somewhere update videos on
every speaker like every time there's a
firmware to a speaker because I have so
many speakers and they all every once in
a while will get an update so yes but
for this one here I do have some samples
and I'm going to let you listen to that
they were recorded using out by neuro
microphone so for the best experience
please use headphones and we can talk
about it on the other side of the sample
and take a listen
to me everything feels like I'm please
come
and there you have it
after doing the update to the speaker I
listened to it and it sounded the same
so I had to like because I recorded the
recordings obviously before the update
and then after the update and then I put
her in a computer and I listen to them
and they do not see any difference as
far as sound so whatever the update is
meant for it's not in regards to the
sound at all cuz I didn't notice any
sound difference I know I saw some of
you who said that your speaker stopped
working or something like that I sounded
really bad or it sounded all for the
update oiled sounded really good I've
seen it a lot of comments about it but
as far as for my experience like you've
heard everything sounds basically the
same as far as sound nothing nothing was
affected out at least for my speaker
like you've heard in the sound sample
just right you know we just heard it I'm
so yeah let me know what you think in
the comment section below if you have
any problems if you watching this any
one of the four who have had problems
after the firmware just let people know
about it I don't know if they's if some
fix for it or not but I have not had any
problems but I would like to hear what
you guys have to say about it anyways
this was a poorly this was supposed to
be a short video so I think we will end
it there thank you for watching I will
see you in the next video peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
