aureus XV 32 to the SRS xB 31 but also
since a lot of you have asked
we will also be comparing it to the SRS
xB 30 is there any cool new features or
is there any difference in sound let's
find out hey what's up speaker file is
we live in here so in 2017 Sony released
the SRS xB 30 which was replacing the
SRS xb3
it was water-resistant it was rated for
up to 24 hours of play time was running
248 millimeter for range drivers with a
frequency response rating of up to 20
Hertz had two sound modes the standard
mode in the extra base mode and audio
input a USB a output port and a
proprietary port to recharge the speaker
and in 2018 it was updated to the SRS XP
31 and they changed the design but they
left most of the specs the same except
they made the SRS XP 31 completely
waterproof and the two sound modes the
live sound mode and the party booster
which is kind of a gimmick but at this
time they also gave us microUSB charging
to recharge the speaker which if you ask
me making the speaker completely
waterproof and giving us a micro USB
charging port instead of the proprietary
charging port that they gave us on SRS
XP 30 those two were like the main
improvements that they did here anyways
2019 we now have the SRS XP 32 which is
replacing basically the SRS XP 31 and
obviously the design has changed again
from the old fabric design and they had
on the SRS XP 31
- this mostly plastic design except for
the drill
I'm not entirely sure why they did
because I feel like plastic shows where
in Terra way worse than fabric design
but the design is the designing is up to
them and this is what they chose to do
but if you forget about the design the
specs are basically the same nothing has
changed from the SRS XP 31 to the SRS XP
32 as far as specs same water protection
same playtime same drivers same a fair
rating same sound modes and same ports
yes in 2019 still no USB see charging
why Sony the speaker can still be paired
with the previous models although they
can't play in studio if they're not the
same exact model but it also carried
over that annoying feature were if the
speaker or the battery is drained to
about 20% it will cut the volume to
about 30% so you can't raise it past
that they still carried that over why
Sony so with all the specs staying
basically the same are there any
differences in the sound well let's find
out I will be comparing you to the SOS
XP 31 first and then after the to play I
will also compare it to the SRS xB 30
which is the reason why this video is a
little bit longer than normal but I
wanted to cover all this in the same
video
I'm as usual I will be using a high
quality binaural microphone so for the
best experience
please use headphones with that said
well welcome to the sound Barrow
crazy spin so long to live excitingly
and also just breaking down
all right I think that's enough that was
the one break for me um anyways with the
SRS XP 32 being the exactly the same
specs of the SRS XP 31 it seems like
Sony was somehow able to squeeze more
best out of the SRS XP 32 because it's
definitely doing better than the SRS XP
31 in this best department but also if
you listen to the sound between these
two the SRS XP 32 sounds richer and has
a more defined sound um the improvements
are settled like really small but the
SRS XP 32 sounds better
I'm the highest are still not the best
but I like the way the direction they
are going the two if there's two we're
on sell for the same price or something
like that I would definitely take the XP
32 over the SOS XP 31 in a heartbeat and
in comparison to the SRS XP 30 the SOS
XP 30 sounds a little bit brighter
because it has slightly better highs but
you can easily get the sound of the XP
30 out of the SRS XP 32 by tweaking the
EQ settings in the Sony app the upside
to this is that you are also getting a
better best performance out of the srs
XP 32 which you cannot get out of the
srs XP 30 and again if these two were
the same price like they are right now I
would take the srs XP 3200 over the SRS
XP 31 and only because of sound but even
the added features like this is
completely waterproof this is not this
has micro USB charging this still has
the proprietary charging and they also
give you more sound modes on the srs XP
32 so at the end of it all I would take
the srs XP 32 over any of these guys
right here I'm the only exception to
that is maybe if you find any of these
two guys like really
you eat cheap for the SRX xp3 or the SRA
sex p31 like we're talking 50 bucks or
more cheaper because I don't think the
improvements that they have on the SRS
XP 32 worth 50 dollars or something like
that so if you're finding it that cheap
like the SRS XP 30 and you don't care
about the disadvantages it has and it's
50 bucks cheaper I would say go for it
the sound difference is not that
expensive between the two all the FS are
xxb 31 so yes if the price is right
sure it's not the same price no less x
x.b 32 has a leg over these guys but if
you own any of these I don't think you
should like hurry up and go upgrade as
long as your speakers to works fine I
don't think there's a rush to upgrade
I'm the kind of person who doesn't think
that we should be upgrading our speakers
every year I'm like bringing out new
speakers every year which is kind of
weird it's like phones now but I don't
think we need to upgrade speakers every
year if it's still working fine just
fracking there's not a huge difference
in sound between these two upgrade every
single year but for those of you who
love having the new thing you know yes
it is worth it if you still have any of
these guys you can upgrade there's a
better better better sound coming out of
the SRS XP 32 but like I said if you're
not if you don't mind having your older
speaker still keep it there's no huge
need to upgrade it to the ethic to the
SRS XP 32 so anyways it's been a long
video I think I should end it
thank you very much for watching I'll
leave the links to these speakers down
in the description section below all of
these guys I'm if you use those links it
really helps me out or what it helps the
channel
yes like the video if you liked it
dislike it if you didn't like it I just
like to get some sort of feedback from
you yes thanks
watching if you're new here please
subscribe so you don't miss out the
upcoming sound battles I promised it
won't be this long and yeah thanks for
watching I will see you in the next
video peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
