and welcome to another sound battle
well that speakers speak for themselves
in the battlefield today we have the
sony SOS XP 30 versus the charge 3 if
you're new here make sure you subscribe
so you don't miss out on an upcoming
videos in this battle the speakers will
start out playing at 70 percent volume
and then 40 percent volume for the last
couple of songs the first song will play
with the extra base off and then the
rest of the songs the extra base will be
turned on and as usual I'll be using a
high quality binaural microphone so
please put your headphones own for the
best experience without said let's hear
the speaker's speak hold on oh wait a
minute I've got don't do into space oh
 oh happy to make down oh you think
that do you have to admit Oh
you and me uptown take another round
tilde disco ball hot but I have to be me
never would be anger is misplaced
in the
so for those wondering which one is
louder the HP 30 takes the lead as I've
mentioned before I like the improvements
that have been made on the extra base
feature in comparison to how it used to
be on the XB 3 it now focuses on lower
base and frequencies without degrading
the mids and highs but i should say that
this is true only at higher volumes
anything lower than 50% the base is
going to be overpowering everything else
just like on the XB 40 the judge 3 has
been a good performer in base compared
to speakers in its size but that's
changing with extra base on the XPS
Perley is actually performing better in
base and that's at all volumes I should
say though that at low volumes people
who don't like a ton of base will find
the charge 3 more appealing because it
has a better balance between best mix
and highs at these low volumes
I think Sony needs to put their base a
little bit under control at these lower
volumes but as volume goes up everything
on the XP third is just to get under
control and more balanced and there is
somewhat of a better stereo separation
on the XP 30 compared to the charge 3
it's not huge but it is there so does
this mean that the chart 3 is losing
here in this plateau yes the charge 3
has had its time and I think we are
ready for the charge for the only reason
I'll take the chest we over the XP 30 is
if the price is right if I need a
waterproof speaker because the XP 30 is
not waterproof if I prefer the microUSB
charging to whatever sony has here for
some reason
or the fabric design of the Chie 3 is
more appealing to me but if decision is
only based on sound the XPS 30
would be yet not to mention that you
have the option to turn off the bass
boost with the push of a button which
will make it sound a lot like the charge
3 and also before I go the lights on the
xB 30 could be cool but also annoying
most especially when they're trying to
sing to the beat but can't quite get it
you know what I mean
it just turns out to be annoying to me
so I find myself just stunning them off
and just listening without them on but
that's just me and sound is so
subjective I'd like to hear what you
guys have to say about this too in the
comments section below don't forget to
subscribe if you haven't yet for more or
some videos thanks for watching and I
will see you in the next one peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
