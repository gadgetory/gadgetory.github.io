and welcome to another sound battle
where I will let speakers speak for
themselves in the battlefield studio we
have the creative mover to see buses JBL
go the speakers of five feet away from a
high quality binaural microphones and
are playing at 80 percent volume so the
best experience please put your
headphones on and let's hear the
speakers speak
hold on down awake yes good I've got
some Dennis banks oh happy to make time
eNOS you have to believe me
another round you just allow hock but I
have to be everyone to see
so as you can tell the move Oh handles
the lows better than they go and that's
partly because of the radiator at the
back of the move oh but they also
boosted both the lows in the highs in
the from where in most bass-heavy songs
you'll be getting distortions in sound
from the mover to see I think just
because it's trying to give you a
boosted based experience by the same
time lots of trouble I'm using the same
tiny driver back to the JBL go arm it
sounds a tiny bit louder and the vocals
sound amazing compared to the move up
it basically has no base by the way
don't even try but it makes an highs on
it are better than what you get on the
mover and which one would I do
well I listen to basically music so that
would make sense to go with the move oh
right but wait if all basically music I
listen to is going to be a little bit
distorted then why even bother with it I
would probably go with the JBL go so I
can at least enjoy the lyrics of the
music because it kind of does that a lot
better but that's just me I would like
to hear what you guys have to say in the
comment section below like the video if
you liked it don't forget to subscribe
you can you hear thanks for watching and
I will see you in the next one peace
you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
