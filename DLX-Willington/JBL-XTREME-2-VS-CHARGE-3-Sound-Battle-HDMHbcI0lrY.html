welcome to another sound battle where we
live speakers speak for themselves in
the battlefield today we have the JBL
judge 3 going up against its bigger
newer brother the JBL extreme to a video
that a lot of you have requested so here
we go and oh if you are a passerby
please consider subscribing I swear I
won't charge you for it
but I will bring you new content anyways
in this battle I'll be using a high
quality binaural microphone so for the
best experience
please use headphones with that said
let's hear the speaker's speak
you have to admit
and everyone
it's just upper face
okay so surprisingly the extreme - if
not plugged in it's about as loud as the
charge 3 yep you heard me right the
extreme - playing at maximum volume is
about as loud as the charge 3 if it's
not plugged in I'm what the heck JBL and
for those who don't know yet when the
extreme 2 is plugged in it has a higher
power output than when it's running off
of the battery like portable and this
power reduction during the battery usage
is compensated by cutting down how loud
the speaker can get by about 3 DB and I
personally think this is the worst thing
that JBL could have done with the
speaker which is success in a very very
popular extreme I don't know what they
were thinking but I'm hoping that one of
these days we get a firmware update
which fixes this because it's just
ridiculous the extreme to being about as
loud as they charge 3 is I don't
understand it I'm anyways at least the
best performance of the extreme 2 is way
better than that of the charge 3 where
the charge 3 is spitting out upper this
the extreme 2 is actually giving you
some real deep bass in general the
difference is not by much but the
extreme 2 sounds better than they charge
3 think of the extreme as an expansion
or a blown-up version of the charge 3
they are both good speakers but the
extreme 2 is just a little bit better
than the charge 3 so if you are looking
for the biggest sound and better bass
the extreme 2 is your guy here but if
you're looking for something smaller and
a little bit more portable but still
sounds good then the church 3 is
actually not bad
