summer is finally here which means
camping season so I wanted to show you
guys my addition to my collection of
powerbanks which I believe they are
essential to camping unless you are one
of those people who completely unplug
and go dark while camping I'm definitely
not one of them maybe someday who knows
I mean I'm not like on social media all
the time but I like to have my phone
owned and juiced up ready to take pics
any time you know I mean and I like to
read up on you guys comments every once
in a while while camping so there is
that anyways what I have here is the a
6pd power bank from zen doer it's the
newest from the newer the makers of the
massive a8 I showed you guys a couple
months ago so now the a6 PD has a
slightly smaller capacity compared to
the 8/8 but it still has enough juice to
give you multiple charges to your phone
or your MacBook it has a 20,000 100 mAh
capacity fast charging but what I was
most excited about is the 45 watt USBC
input and output it's always nice to see
things moving towards us PC which I'm
hoping Bluetooth speakers also take the
same route because I haven't really seen
that on any have I know I don't think
there's any Bluetooth speakers that has
us PC that I own I don't own any but I'm
hoping they move towards that you can
charge the power bank using the USB C
port or using the micro USB on the far
left but using the same USB 3 port you
can also charge your macbook or any
device that requires a u.s. PC while all
the other gadgets that need our good old
USB C now USBA
I'll still have it I've been using the
power bank for about two months and the
only complaint I have about it is
the pouch it comes with um I feel like
for the price you're paying for it it
would happen oh I would have loved to
see something that fits and there is a
little bit better and this is the same
complaint I had with their the massive
eight that I showed you guys not too
long ago the carrying pouch this is what
they give you it's a pretty
Luzi cloth kind of I mean it feels good
but if you compare it to these other
ones that you get that I have on my
rough power that you get with the
ravpower they're really really soft or
like spongy I think they have like
almost feels like foam in there so they
look better and they also feel better on
your power bank
so if only they did the same thing here
and they give you something that is a
little bit better because this does not
look very cool so yeah I just wanted to
show you guys this so if you're looking
for its power bank and you're going
camping or you just want to use it with
something that's portable that you want
to use the a6 is something that you
should consider and if you're looking
for something larger the a8 is is huge
it has a huge capacity in comparison to
this but they're both good power banks I
love this the customer service of Zenda
where they've been really nice with me
so their recommendation the a6 PD is an
awesome power bank go pick up one and
let me know what you think in the
comment section below if you're
interested in I'll put a link to it in
the description section below so you can
go check them out I talked to you guys
in the next one thanks for watching
