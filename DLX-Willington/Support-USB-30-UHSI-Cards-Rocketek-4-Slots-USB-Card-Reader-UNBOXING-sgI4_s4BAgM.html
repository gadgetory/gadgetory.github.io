the unboxing of the rocket tech
three-point or USB for SWAT card reader
now I do have a card reader is 3.5 size
internal card reader this guy right here
I actually like it it works pretty well
but I wanted to get something which is
kind of compact in a small size that I
can just toss in my bag and you know
have it with me everywhere I go and I
decided to choose this card reader right
I guess got right now i have to mention
though that the box the size of the box
might not be the same from what you are
going to get if you're planning on
ordering this just because i have two
more items with it so i just wanted to
mention that i use my not be this size
but this is mine for all those three
items so make sure to check the links
section below to look for the review
video that I'm going to be doing after
unboxing it and checking everything out
to make sure you see how you know how it
works in comparison to to an internal
card reader so yeah let's go ahead like
I said the box might not be the same
like what you're going to get so let's
just go right open and see how it
actually comes looking like i got it
from amazon this is the amazon prime
thing i don't know why they use this
because i actually don't have amazon
prime I had it but council did this was
a lot of money here is it it is I have
some protection bags actually get that
away and yeah I guess this is it so I'm
pretty sure what the box you get might
be kind of like this sighs you know
around our size might just stick it in
the mail
kind of value because I'll it would fit
perfectly but yeah this is how he comes
I don't think I haven't won boxing to do
and this is it this comes in a paper bag
plastic Friday man and I guess we'll go
ahead and look at it and spark it it's
pretty sweet and that's how it looks
like on the outside they're just say 0
SP 3 point or portable card reader USB
card reader it tells you all the
disappointed kinds of cards that you can
you know arrayed my British why you can
read all that on amazon and that the
font he had also just a sewage from
rocket take us be flippant or portable
card reader for slaughter card reader
writer our TCR too that's basically as
far as on top and opening it in the
inside here see well stairs and nothing
in here it's just a cover but that was a
card in here looks like you just say
support thank you for purchasing our
rocketed product from amazon com
basically they want you to give them a
five star I don't know about yet I'll
see what I would do about that but this
is the guy right here I just liked it
because of because of its you know it's
kind of a cool design here looks kind of
cool so for this it's not really steady
this is not really steady that's the
name the first flow i see here i thought
you know kind of like clicks in and you
know it stays pretty snug but not really
i don't know it's okay i don't think
i'll really care about that boy would
have been nice if it stays and here it
is these are the two slots back here for
am on my card i have one here that they
can try out i'm putting it the right way
right there and then you can cover it
that's what i liked like just putting a
card in there so it kind of like still
works like you know it flash drive or
thumb drive or whatever you call it when
you have your memory card in there
that's pretty sweet i like it it's one
of the main reasons i got it because
they put in a card and lock it in and
just doesn't look like it's a card
reader and then you have more slots here
for your cards it's pretty sweet so
basically this is an unboxing video and
