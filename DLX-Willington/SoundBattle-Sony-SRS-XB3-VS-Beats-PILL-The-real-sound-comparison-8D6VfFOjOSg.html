welcome to another sound battle where we
let speakers speak for themselves in the
battlefield today we have the Sony SRS
xp3 going up against the pill plus as
requested in this recording the
speaker's of five feet away from the
sound recorder and are playing that 80%
volume put your headphones on and let's
hear the speaker's speak
I've got something to say oh happy to me
you have to win let's just break it down
to you and me uptown dancing all around
disco ball cops but I have to be me and
everyone can see anger is misplaced
you
okay so for those wondering which one is
louder it's the sony and for those
wondering if I have extra bass on on the
Sony the answer is No so the Sony has
more power to it and has brighter more
open music than the Pihl plus and that's
because the meats on a pill plus are
overshadowed by the highs which are more
emphasized than anything else on the
speaker but come to the laws the Sony's
bass sounds deeper and richer but it can
easily distort with heavy bass songs at
higher volumes well as the pillows bass
is not as rich and deep but it doesn't
distort as easily overall I like the
sound I get out of the Sony I think it's
a more balanced speaker than the pill
plus and the fact that you have more
than one sound setting it's a bonus
so in this battle the Sony SRO 63 is the
winner let me know what you think down
below hit the like button subscribe to
the channel if you haven't yet follow me
on Twitter for video suggestions and I
will see you in the next year Happy New
Year guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
