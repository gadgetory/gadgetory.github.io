review of the quiescent surge protector
this power strip gives you 4 SC outlets
and five smart USB charging ports it
comes in an awesome packaging it feels
and looks nicely constructed with abs
material it comes with a four point nine
foot long cable which is long enough to
go from underneath your desk the top of
your desk for placement it has four
grounded 3-prong outlets which makes it
compatible with pretty much everything
on and around your desk that needs
plugging in all the five USB ports
provided on here a smart which means
they can give you up to 2.4 amps for
fast charging of your gadgets this power
station has an on and off switch and to
make it even better it has an on and off
indicator light which is gray and these
are the few things that didn't like
about this product it only comes in one
color which is white I feel like they
should have been another option of that
list maybe black cuz most of my gadgets
are black and also a detachable power
cord would have been awesome it would
have made it a little bit more portable
than it is but that's just me I will
give this product a 4 out of 5 just
because I don't really like this color
and the fact that it's missing the UL
label which to some people it might not
be that big of a deal but it gives me
confidence in a product anyways with all
that said this is something I would
recommend to pretty much everybody to
have on their desk it's really nice
being able to plug your stuff in right
on the desk as compared to going under
the desk to plug stuff in it saves your
bag and saves you time and also I
received this product free of charge for
honest review and that's what I just did
i will leave the link to the product in
the description section
well if you are watching this on youtube
and please do not forget to subscribe if
you haven't already and I will see you
in the next video peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
