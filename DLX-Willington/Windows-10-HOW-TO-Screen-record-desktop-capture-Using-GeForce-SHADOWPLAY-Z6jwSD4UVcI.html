today we are going to be learning how to
screen capture using shadow play on
Windows 10 all right so obviously you
want to open the application and give it
some time too low it up and there you
are it opens up in my array and that's
because the last time I close this
that's where it was so after checking
that your drivers are all up to date and
everything is looking good this is the
button that we want right here just
click on that and you open up this
window actually minimize that so this is
what we're looking at right here you
have all these options right here that
you can tweak around to your preferences
but before any of that is enabled you
have to click and turn on this shadow
play so click that it takes some time a
couple of seconds and there we go so
first off this button right here this is
for you to select where you'll be saving
your videos like well it's saved the
recorded media is going to be saved and
then the next is this gear looking
setting thing if you click on that it
opens up the preferences and most of
these are things that I leave off
because like this one here is for your
webcam in case you have a webcam that
you use to record the screen and you
wanted to you know you it's just to
position where your picture will be or
your feet will be on the screen so I
don't have one so I usually just leave
that one off just like that and then
this one here is the status indicator I
haven't found any purpose for it when
you turn it on it just just it's a
status indicator you know what's
happening with dumb with your shadow
play I feel like it's mainly for people
i'm recording this in games for me i
usually leave that one off too many
frame counter is also just for gamers so
this is just the positioning why you
want you to be honest
screen so I leave that one off to the
main thing that we want here on the
screen is allow desktop capture so you
turn that one on and that enables us to
record this screen right here rather
than just recording in game if it's off
it it can only record the game that
you're playing as soon as you close your
game it's not recording anything and at
the bottom right here it gives you all
the options all the shortcuts to all the
things that you can do and at the bottom
here is all the things I've already
talked about like this is why your
videos will be located and saved and
this is just a temporary file location
why you can change that one too but the
main thing I usually use here is the old
f10 and let's just saves however many
minutes you've chosen it just saves your
video it's a shortcut you just press out
+ f10 like just press both of those
together and I'll save your video will
see that in a minute so that's what the
this button here does it just brings you
to the settings screen but right on this
screen I will minimize that one again on
this screen here you still have these
options right here that you can change I
will start on the right hand right here
and this is the audio right now it's on
off and that's because i'm not using I'm
not feeding my audio right into the
computer so i don't really need it on so
you can choose it to be off so that way
is not recording any audio either in the
computer or the audio that's coming into
the computer and then this next setting
right here is for if you want to record
the audio that's being played on the
computer lets you playing music or your
there's a game going on any audio that's
been processed on produced in a computer
it will be recorded as as well as the
audio
coming from your microphone we have ed
phones on that have a microphone on it
that all you'll be recorded to and then
this setting right here this is for just
the audio that's been produced by your
computer it won't record anything that's
coming coming into the computer and
that's what that does like I said I'm
not using it so I usually just leave
that one off since I record my audio
outside of the computer and then just
put them together later on and then the
quality this is how how much quality you
want for your video basically only just
changes mainly than megabytes per second
like right here as you see it tells you
under settings you have so it's on wall
and if I do medium it's now a 22
megabytes per second and if I chain you
too high it goes to 50 and most of the
times I just do custom and decide
whatever quality I want myself I usually
just do 1080 and then the frames you
have sixty or thirty and i usually do 30
that's mostly what I do so that's that
button the next button on is the shuttle
time and this is the one of the most
important things that you want to set so
this determines how far how long how
much time is going to be recorded by
your recorder once you once you hit the
Save button right here so right now it's
at ten I most of the time will make it
go all the way to 20 just so I know
everything is covered because I don't
ever make videos about longer than 20
minutes so that way as soon as you hit
that button right here it starts
recording and once you hit this right
here when you're done whatever you're
doing like tutorials or anything like
that once you hear the out f10 it will
save the last 20 minutes
now that's important you have to know if
it's all the way to 20 whatever you're
doing has to be under 20 minutes because
if you just keep going past the 20
minutes it's all it's not going to save
all of that stuff so you have to make
sure that you are keeping an eye on time
so if I did 20 minutes and then I did my
tutorial what if i'm working on showing
on in on screen and I go over 20 minutes
to 30 minutes if I'm 30 minutes end and
then I would I hid out f10 it's only
going to record that 20 minutes and it's
not going to be it not is not going to
save the last 10 minutes at the first 10
minutes that I did so you have to make
sure you are within a time limit that's
why i usually leave my 20 because i
don't usually ever go over 20 minutes
and next up right here is all these
different settings right here shadow and
manual enables shadow and manual quoting
modes i really only use shadow that way
i'm controlling the time and whenever I
want to to save my you know last 20
minutes in this case I would just hit
off out of 10 and that's it so unless
you really need both of these I'm not
really sure even worst what the
difference is I haven't found a way of
using them since I don't have many games
that I play using using the GeForce
experience but yeah I usually just leave
my and it just works so basically that's
it I'm the only thing I wanted to
mention i should have said this in the
beginning is the shadow play is only
available if you want line so if my um
if my internet is off so if I for
example right here if I want and
disconnected internet
is this one here right now and then I
open the GeForce experience it will load
up but there's no shuttle play no matter
where I go I can't find it it's not
there so you do have to make sure that
you are connected online before you can
get shuttled place sometimes it's the
case when people don't know and they
just want to record something and are
not online they can find it so you make
sure you are connected so if I close it
and then connect to the internet so now
I'm connected and if i go and reopen it
there you go it's on so you just make
sure you have your intern and on and you
won't have any problems thank you for
watching again make sure you subscribe
