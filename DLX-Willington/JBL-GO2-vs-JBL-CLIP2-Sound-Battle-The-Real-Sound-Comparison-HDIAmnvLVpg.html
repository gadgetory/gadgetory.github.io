welcome to another sound battle where we
let speakers speak for themselves in
about a field today we have the JBL go
to versus the JBL clip - with the
exception of the design these two
speakers are quite similar that both
waterproof both running 40 millimeter
drivers with the same output power the
only difference here is that the clip 2
is rated at a lower frequency response
than the go-to as usual I'll be using a
high quality binaural microphone so for
the best experience please use
headphones with that said let's hear the
speaker's speak
as you heard the speakers are quite
similarly tuned there's not really a
huge difference in the way they sound at
all the highs are not as sharp on the
go-to but they are not bad
the means a better on the clip too and
both speakers have no laws whatsoever it
sounds like the lower frequency response
that I clipped to has only helps with
richer meds anyways for other purposes I
would go with a crepe - just because
it's brighter and it's a little bit
louder than they go to the other thing
to think about is that the go-to has no
strap hook the older gbo go had one but
they got rid of it here which I don't
really understand why they would do that
to a smaller speaker of this size
because if I feel like you need it but
they think got rid of it I anyways let
me know what you think down below that's
been it for this one
thank you for watching a lot drop me a
like if you liked the video dislike it
if you didn't like it I just want to get
some sort of feedback from you because
you watch the video if you're new here
don't forget to subscribe so you don't
miss out on the new upcoming videos
thanks for watching again I will see you
in the next one peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
