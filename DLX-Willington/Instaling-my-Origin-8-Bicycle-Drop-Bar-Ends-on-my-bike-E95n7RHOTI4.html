another video today I will be showing
you just like I promised you guys they
originate by score drop bar ends how I
decided to mount them onto my bike if
you've not been following my videos I
did an unboxing of this so if you want
interested you can go and check that out
the link will be in the description
below
I had to option the first option is this
where I put all my drop bars to the very
end of my bike bars so they were looking
like this and I took that for a bike
ride it did not turn out so nice I mean
it was fine if it's the only option I
can handle it usually I can get used to
it but I feel like they were so so wide
out you just felt so wide being low like
that and your hands spread out no it
didn't work for me so I brought it back
and I switched stuff around well just
like you can see here I took off my gear
changer my brakes and then put the drop
bars inside so like they were inside
then the brakes the gear changer and
then I put on my my the grips
so this is how it was looking like after
that configuration I took it out for you
know a bike ride and
it actually turned out better in my
opinion I haven't seen anyone with dub
buy candles or drop bars like that but I
mean for me worked fine with these
you're kind of like inside so you can
get low and really get that speed going
just like you know a road bike which is
cool which is what I was you know
looking for but anyways so I found this
configuration best in my opinion so if
you something else works for you that's
cool but this is what I found better for
me and that's why it's what I did so and
also if I decide I don't like it like
this anymore I can always go back and
just move them around and put them in a
different a different position and yeah
thanks for watching guys but just
subscribe it doesn't cost anything at
all
just feet that bottom there and then
from and we'll be buddies
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
