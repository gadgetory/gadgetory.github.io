and welcome to another sound battle
well that speakers speak for themselves
in the battlefield today we have the
flip for going up against the Sony S
service xp3 and like I said in the
previous video I have the extra base
feature on the Sony turned off because
you know I don't really like how it
sounds I am out on a side note if you're
new here please make sure you subscribe
it really helps out a lot in this battle
the speakers of five speeds are web form
and high quality by newer microphone and
are playing at 80 percent volume for a
more realistic sound experience please
put your headphones on and let's hear
the speaker's speak I'm happy to make
them oh you can - and you have to with
me
like in town he cut out another round
and Oklahoma but I have to be never one
to be anger is misplaced
to be honest I was kind of impressed of
how well the flip four stacks up to the
xp3 is starting with the obvious the xp3
is louder than their fleet for and if
you listen closely the xp3 has a better
stereo separation which makes it more
room filling compared to the flick forks
which sounds so mono for this reason the
xp3 sounds more appealing to my ear than
the footfall there is only one detail
that caught me by surprise while
listening to the bass heavy music during
the testing for this video if you listen
closely the flip for handles the best a
little bit better than the xp3
this is honestly something I wasn't
really expecting considering the size of
the xp3 there is a little bit more
discussion in based on the xp3 than the
flip for and here is what I mean hope
you can tell
I found this out listening to mainstream
music that I obviously can't play here
because of copyright stuff but I hope
you could tell what I mean by those
samples I just played for you if you
listen to songs that are not based
driven you probably won't notice but if
you do chances are you will notice at
some point the flip is generally a good
sounding speaker but you will also need
an EQ to bring down the highs a little
bit but on the other hand those highs
are the reason it stacks up on the xp3
better than the mini two did in the
previous video so maybe it's not that
bad so a little bit of distortion in the
based on xp3 and somewhat harsh highs on
the flat four it makes it kind of hard
to community one here but I think I'll
go to xp3 just because it has a very
serious situation which is more
appealing to my ears and I think the mid
sound a little bit better but if you
listen to bass heavy music I feel like
you should stay with a swift for because
the xp3 sounds better in other aspects
but I feel like the best is not so clean
so making sure it but if you're looking
at this cool you might want to consider
the price and other features before
committing to one and that's just my
opinion
sound is so subjective and I would like
to hear what you think about these two
speakers in the comment section below if
you were just passing by and found this
video please consider subscribing and
becoming part of what we are doing here
I hope you liked the video if you did
don't forget to give it a like and feel
free to share it thanks for watching
this one I will see you in the next one
peace
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
