another video 2015 was all about
horribles they just exploded like crazy
and 2016 is actually proving to be all
about hovering again but this time
covering Bluetooth speakers the only
difference here is that this time these
ones actually do hover the Bluetooth
speakers cover so I think we are hitting
the right way here so with all the hype
about covering levitating bluetooth
speakers I decided to pick up one myself
too and I got this one for music and Joe
and we are going to be taking a closer
look at it
all right so starting with the unboxing
experience it wasn't the greatest out
there um the Box looked a little bit
sketchy to me I'm considering the kind
of product that you're buying like also
modern and techy I feel like the but
should of representing the same thing
but when you open the box you get a user
menu a USB charging cable and adapter
for the base um the orbs pker and
finally the base now the base is just
that is a base probably full of magnets
that help with a levitation and the
speaker is this little thing here that
music angel calls the orb I think is
from orbit like a planet orbiting makes
sense
anyways they all be small and looks
great for sure on top is touch sensitive
and you'll find all these controls on
here and at the bottom a charging port
and a power button back to the top you
can control the volume skip the next or
previous track call handling play pause
in the orb light control but these
controls are not perfect so I find
myself just using my phone to control my
music that way
which is you know one of my cons about
this product I hope they can fix that in
the next model maybe but let's get back
the fun stuff I'm making this speaker
levitate is not that hard it's actually
pretty simple just connect the base of
the power turn it on
I'm pull the bulb with both of your
hands and put it toward the center and
you will start to feel the force of
gravitation just let it go and the magic
happens look at that that just looks so
beautiful
and honestly this is the only reason you
buy this just to show off and admire the
beauty of hovering nothing more I will
let you listen to its sound equality at
the end of this video but if sound
quality is the main thing you're looking
for look somewhere else
I will tell you this right now that as
the sound quality of this speaker is not
the worst out there you can get away
better sounding regular Bluetooth
speaker for the price of the levitating
speaker but for those of you who like
having cool modern gadgets on your discs
in the office or living room or at home
or anywhere feel free to add this to
your collection I only wish the base
didn't have to be plugged in you can
take the orb anywhere with you like a
regular BT speaker but for the
levitation to work the base has to be
plugged in nevertheless I love this
speaker and I would recommend it to any
take lever out there and it kind of
looks beautiful I like it more than some
other expensive one
but that's just me and here is the sound
taste of the speaker technology
Oh
compares your fun it's way better if
you're looking for higher quality
listening no you can find a way way
better sound out there for the same
price so showing off by it high quality
sound is what you're looking for
do not buy it go buy something else
thanks for watching please please
subscribe and I will see you in the next
one peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
