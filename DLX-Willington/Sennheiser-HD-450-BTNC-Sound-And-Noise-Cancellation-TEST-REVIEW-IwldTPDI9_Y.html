wondering how these sound like well here
connected but before that maybe let's
talk a little bit about them first so
these are sennheiser HD 450 noise
cancellation headphones they are mid
grade headphones going for about 200
bucks I've had them for about three
weeks and these are my thoughts about
them these are over ear headphones that
don't look that bad they have a foldable
design for portability and they come
with a storage bag and the only warm
part about the design is that these are
all plastic and synthetic leather
construction they don't feel flimsy or
anything like that but you definitely
want to be careful with them cause you
know it is plastic after all the comfort
level is right there in between not bad
but also not the best they felt a little
bit tight when I first put them on but
after a couple of days of testing them I
kind of got used to them the ear cups
are not very wide I found myself having
to adjust them a couple times after a
couple hours of listening because my
ears were complaining in discomfort so
if you know you have big ears this might
not be ideal for listening for sessions
that last for hours these take about two
hours to charge a fully drained battery
and depending on how you use it you can
get up to 24 hours of playtime all
controls are on the right cup the LED
indicator the power button the
multifunction button volume rockers
audio input and the micro USB are all on
that one cup on the
then you find on the other cup is the
NFC panel some people like this setup
but I feel like they should have moved
either the multi functional button or
the volume rockers on the other side I
found myself changing the truck
accidentally as I was trying to fill for
the volume rocker in it it's kind of
annoying
this ear cup feels a little bit too busy
here's the noise cancellation test but
you should probably use headphones to be
able to tell the difference okay so this
is how the rule sounds like I have a fan
going and some music playing in the
background plus me just talking here so
that's how the room sounds like and so
I'm going to put the microphone right in
here and noise cancellation is not on
its own and so now let's turn on noise
cancellation
and that's me talking with noise
cancellation on and that's how the sound
that's how much is cut out noise
cancellation is off
nice consolation phone
the noise cancellation is not bad it
will not completely block out people
talking around you all that kind of loud
music playing in a restaurant but it
will definitely reduce the intensity of
the noise may we just cutting out the
low frequency ambient noise I'm planning
on picking up the QC 35 that everyone
says are the best noise cancellation
headphones but until I hear how good
those are I will say that the noise
cancellation here is not really that bad
I mean it cuts off some noise right with
that said how good is sound quality well
put some headphones on and let's find
out
I think it's time every day
ya can eyeball for a minute ride on I've
got this let it roar like a night storm
forever win and don't you ever get in my
way cause otherwise I'm miles up in your
face
teamwork headfirst with my feet in the
dirt extreme thirst for the surge of
adrenaline burst my knees her please
nurse let the medicine work so I can get
in there but professionally superb I
won't stop till I'm certified
I won't stop tell them first rise come
on first prize gold medal get her
running a headache
each time Canabalt for a minute let's go
I got this let it burn like some petrol
I'm getting tougher you see don't you
ever doubt this otherwise I put my money
where your mouth is you're heard right
that the earth is mine
burn bright let the ambition you know
I'm gonna get it every time
okay so my mic YouTube compression and
the headphones that you are using and
not going to give you exactly what these
headphones sound like but it should give
you a very very good idea on how they
sound I personally found the sound not
too bad that seems to be a little bit of
bass boost but it's really really settle
highs and mids are good with nothing
overshadowing the other I generally
think the sound is pretty good for the
price but I should say that if you're a
heavy bass listener these are probably
not for you these are for people looking
for balanced music with minimal to no
boosted anything at all I think there
are better options for best lovers so
what do you guys think please leave a
like if you'd like to see more headphone
videos like this one and down in the
comment section below let me know which
one is you'd like me to check out if
there's any row that you'd like me to
check out that's it for today don't
forget to subscribe I love you all and I
will see you in the next one peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
