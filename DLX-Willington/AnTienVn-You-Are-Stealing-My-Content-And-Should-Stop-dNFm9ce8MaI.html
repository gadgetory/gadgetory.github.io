and thanks to mr. unknown of us because
he's the one who let me know about this
Maharaja Gatto potala be needin Jaime
God but joke I got that is my video that
I made you know about the post three and
this dude auntie n dot VN that Vietnam
because he said I think he's Vietnamese
cuz I looked at you know the words in
his channel and all that and it of
Vietnamese whatever I know how you say
that I think that's it but he downloads
my videos that I upload he downloads
puts his logo into the video and then
re-upload it to YouTube and he has ad
sauna so he's making money off of my
videos I mean they don't have like a ton
of views but at same time and I wouldn't
mind cuz it looks like he's basically
translating my videos like like that's
my full full video of mine that I did
that he just cut out my voice and he
used his voice and then we uploaded it
like basically like not even edited at
all just my stuff so I think it'd be
cool you know - you know publish my
stuff like that in a different language
but you can't just do it like that
that's just stealing I mean you with
this thing you talk to somebody you
agree upon something and then you do it
you know but me just finding out from
someone just laying it letting me know
and you're huffy hola goes into my stuff
that's just not okay you know Antion
whoever you are and doing this video for
you just they know you keep track of my
videos apparently because even my recent
videos are already on your channel
has over 15 videos of mine that he is
uploaded on his channel and it just
takes out my voice and sometimes just
adds music or just uses the sample
session of my videos and it's really
annoying but I don't want to be so bad
but I kill your channel because I know
how hard it is to build it up although I
don't think you even put that much time
into it because I've seen other people's
videos on your channel so then it's not
that bad to just glue your channel
because you're not doing much you're
just taking other people's videos and
using them in your channel that's just
bad like you can't do that talk to these
people you don't give anybody credit
when you do this and that is not okay
you know we put time into making this
videos shooting them scripting them and
all that you know that's time that we
take away from our families from our
jobs and you can't just take someone's
time and claim it and put your logo into
it this it's not okay so you need to
stop doing that
by Friday YouTube will most likely kill
it because I'm going to strike all my
videos on your channel if you do not
take them down by Friday I wasn't going
to make this video but at some time I
was like you know this dude is not gonna
listen and I've sent him comments and
messages but it's not replying so I
figured for not for being nice enough to
make a video because I know he watches
my stuff it's just not cool who does
that like I don't even think someone
could do that like
I don't know it just makes me wonder now
like how many other people that we don't
know about that just take other people's
stuff and use them as their videos it's
different when you give credit to
somebody like you know from this channel
this clip is from this channel like or
talk to people like talk to me hey I
want to do this I want to translate your
videos so we can reach this community
here talk to me let's cooperate like
wait let's do something together and now
just out of the blue he just download
put your logo to it and then upload it
like it's your stuff that is that is not
how you do it it's wrong and you have to
stop it yeah just a little rant there
now see ya next video please</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
