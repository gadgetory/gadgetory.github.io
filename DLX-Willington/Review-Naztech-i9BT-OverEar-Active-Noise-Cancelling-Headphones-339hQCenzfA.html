Willington here with another video and
in the studio today we have the nastic i
9bt AMC bluetooth headphones these are
over ear closed back headphones rockin
bluetooth 4.1 they come in this nice
little box and in a box you get a
hardshell storage case an aux cable a
USB charging cable
occurence through your plug adapter in
the airline dual plug adapter for using
the plane when you're traveling which is
a nice touch the headphones are made out
of plastic but they really do feel
pretty solid and the ear cups are filled
with memory foam and covered with
genuine leather which i must say these
things feel super super comfortable the
headphones have a pretty cool design too
that will actually fit smaller heads
like this one here and you know the big
one which is nice the control buttons
are strategically placed with the anc
switch and the main volume on the right
cup while the music and call handling
control buttons are on the Left cup but
my only complaint about his headphones
comes in here too these buttons would
have been nicer if they were out of the
main housing a little bit more it's hard
to find them sometimes with just feeling
them because they are almost flat on
level with the main housing which makes
it a little bit inconvenient usability
ANC works great it's definitely not the
top of the line if you're comparing them
to the more expensive one
but they are definitely not at the
bottom of the line either how good is
the noise cancellation well a and C is
something hard to explain but I hope
this gives you an idea
I should have said this before the test
but you should have had headphones on
otherwise it's hard to notice the
difference I also love the sound quality
of these headphones most especially when
I have the NC enabled I don't know why
but when you turn on an MC the music
sounds brighter and well balanced that
when you have it off I wish I had an
option to turn off the air and see when
I don't need it but still be able to
have that brightness of music but I
can't do that which kind of sucks
anyways the battery life is pretty good
I've had this for about two weeks now
but the only time I've had to charge
them is the day I got them if you don't
have a Bluetooth enabled device or you
simply just don't want to use bluetooth
you can use the headphones using the aux
input here which is pretty cool not to
mention that they provided you with a
cable so you don't have to go try to buy
one I personally think that these are
nice active noise-cancelling headphones
that are worth the money if you have any
questions about these headphones or have
a comment drop it down below and I will
catch up with you give the video a like
and do not forget to subscribe if you're
not a subscriber it really does help out
a lot thanks for watching and I will see
you in the next video peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
