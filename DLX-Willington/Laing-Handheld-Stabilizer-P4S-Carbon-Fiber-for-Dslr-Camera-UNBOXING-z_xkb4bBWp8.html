and you are welcome to another unboxing
and today we aren't busting this guy
right here I've never used any of these
I was looking at getting the the glide
glide gear and I was seeing really
really really really good
videos that this thing does too and I
liked a couple of futures about it
consolidate taller and I liked its
weight configurations and it was cheaper
so I was like hey I'm gonna try that one
since I'm saving a couple bucks can pick
up you know an SD card or something and
I'm actually good so we will be unboxing
this gentleman right here today and see
what comes with it and let's get inside
he comes with a bunch of junk in here
from Amazon yeah as usual a box in a box
thanks Amazon yeah this is a smaller
profile I like that better get all my
knife opening this guy see what comes in
here
another useless box this is your current
case it feels soft
I think it's padded so you can keep some
stuff in there you know all right but
what's inside oh so nice for that price
to you know come with a bag and
everything and wow there's your guy it's
actually assembled so smooth like oh my
gosh I never used any of this so I'm so
excited to try it out and then just baby
okay let's see what else comes in here
there's a point in here and then also
this 420s right there and
an allen wrench and there is your P
force user operating manual here is your
strap for the bag goes outside if you
want to have it on your shoulder which
is ideal
alright so that is it a quick unboxing a
ton of weights right here and it's
bottom heavy I know I introduced some
settings and stuff but hey Susanna
boxing so we just wait to look at it so
this is what releases he'll handle tight
adjust position this up to handle turn
that will stay there and this one here
makes it follow
that's why I got it it gets so much tall
so I'm pretty sure I might not even have
to use many of these way let me just and
it can sit real stable like that so if I
have my camera on there I can let it sit
like if I have to do something real
quick it's steady like you hold your
camera I mean not to come and bump it
but that that's stable the reason I got
this thing over the right girl is this
final adjustments right here I think
it's so cool like everything is numbered
and the plate has a bunch of you know
like hose in place and and if I can
figure out so you release that
that's just awesome so yeah and as I'm
the bubble level here and there's the
bubble level back here too if you guys
can see that right in there which is
awesome okay
this is like I can't explain to you guys
it's like tight you can't move it but at
the same time so Lulu's like he moves so
so freely I'm excited to try this on
I've never used one
I don't know how everything works I'm
just gonna be figuring this out but hey
is it's exciting just to to learn what
you know how and see and this is the
adjustment for the vehicle so you know
not in the shop but yeah so this will
make it make this right here will make
the plate that came out of or today to
come to the left or to the right and
this one is for back and forth so front
yeah that's awesome I'm gonna be trying
this out and this has has a safety right
here and this is one gigantic cheese
yeah okay man I will not just pull out
which way then it goes way far out you
know for bouncing stuff out depending on
the length you have on there yes
no issue about these things you're
saying that's what I've been hearing
people say flying this baby</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
