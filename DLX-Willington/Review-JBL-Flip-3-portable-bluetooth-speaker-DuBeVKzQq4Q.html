Wellington here this is the JBL flip 3
we aren't going to be taking a close
look at it you can also watch reveal the
charge through here and the buckler
between the judge 3 and the flip 3 here
the links will be down below - first
things first this is the flip 3 is
packaging everything in here is nicely
packed like you would expect and in the
box you get the paperwork stuff and
micro USB cable and the speaker itself
there is a small change in the body
design here if you compare it to the
flip - and I feel like there is a touch
of the charge to his design mixed in
here somehow someone else either they
also changed the grill material from
metal to a fabric material which not
only looks great but it actually feels
better and comfortable to hold in the
hand and JBL also claims that this
material is stronger and last longer
compared to the material that were using
before so timoh test yeah they did move
the control buttons from the top to the
sides of the speaker here and they also
added the JBL connect button but they
are still missing the Skip buttons which
I wish they would change I hate having
to use my phone to skip the next
freaking song oh my gosh
JBO what are you doing the JBL flip
three is now splash proof which means
which means you can take it out even if
there are chances of rain because it
won't damage it now one thing - not here
this is not waterproof
it cannot be submerged into water it's
only splash proof so like rain or water
splashing at the pool those things are
fine but you do not dip it into water
you're going to lose it okay
they move the microUSB port and the 3.5
millimeter port and the acidic cover
here at the back and I appreciate for
the purpose of
splash proofing it's a little bit of a
pain to open but as long as you have
some long nails in you you'll be fine
like the judge 3gb Oh added these base
radiators at each end of the speaker
which vibrate in response to the music
as you can see here and I'm digging it
which I think it's why it reminds me of
the charge we all the church why no
speakers for that matter the speaker now
features JBL connect a feature that
allows you to connect multiple JBL
connect enabled speakers together to
amplify the listening experience and
vast that button right there I haven't
done any JBL connect demonstration and
reveal video here yet but if that's
something that you would like to see me
demonstrate here please leave your
comment down below and I will put a
video in the works for you just for you
okay this speaker is powered by a 3000
milliamp rechargeable battery that was
able to give me about eight to nine
hours of play time which is pretty good
you know for the size of the speaker
I'm gonna quit talking put your
headphones on and let's listen to the
speaker speak okay so the speaker is six
feet away from the sound recorder and I
have it turned all the way up to its
maximum volume are you listening
No
Oh
oh don't go no wait just a minute I've
got something to say oh I'm happy to
make time oh you see this and you have
to admit let's just break it down to you
and me uptown dancin all around the
disco ball there's no reason to
little lamb mary had a little lamb its
fleece was white as snow everywhere that
everywhere that
there is a small small slight
improvement in the speaker in the base
in the base of the speaker but not that
much to call for an upgrade but on the
other hand if you like the new features
like the splash proof the JBL connect
the new design the radiators yes yes you
should definitely upgrade but not for
the purpose of better sound I feel like
they didn't really do much to improve
the sound quality but if you do not own
any of these speakers and you are
looking for a speaker that's under
that's under 100 bucks you are not going
to go wrong this is the best sounding
speaker under 100 bucks
hands-down in that pretty much wraps up
