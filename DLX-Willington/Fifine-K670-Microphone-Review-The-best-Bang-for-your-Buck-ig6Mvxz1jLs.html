welcome to this video and what I have
right here is the K six seven zero four
five five it's a USB microphone plug and
play you basically just grab it plug it
in and it's ready to go you don't need
any software or anything like that and
I've been using it for maybe the last
three months or so and I like it I
actually like it very much I've been
using it on my main computer cuz I don't
have a webcam on there any microphone
that I have attached to it so as soon as
I got this plugged it in and it just
works right away I've been using it on
to do Google speech-to-text a lot
because I do most of my scripts and
stuff like that on Google Docs and if
this is this is just coming so handy to
be able to just speak to it instead of
typing everything and it's just good so
for anybody who does video gaming who
does Skype calling does podcasts dads
YouTube stuff right here it's a really
really cheap option to get into good
audio like for about fifty dollars the
kind of audio quality that you're
getting out of it sounds like a $150
microphone some of them are out there so
it's really really good and I'm really
really happy with how it sounds like so
I feel like for anything that I do that
requires me going to a hotel which is
the reason I've been wanting to get it
because it's usually because of my job I
would have to leave my I would have to
stay in a hotel for about a week or so
or if we had a week I would have to be
at a hotel
and usually during that period of time
and we finally record something I have
to bring my audio recorder and bring my
microphone and you know memory card and
all that but with this one here I just
grab it plug in some the laptop that I
will be using to edit the video or
whatever more annoying and it's just
ready to go just like that
so that's why I was always thinking
about getting one of these
I'll be really easy just get it plug it
in and use it and it's basically that
you don't need any software or anything
like that for it to work I mean you need
software if you're going to encode like
right now I'm using Adobe Audition
that's what I'm using but you can use
any other software that does audio
recording to record it because it's just
basically a microphone it works with any
software that records so I'm personally
happy with it and yes for anyone who is
looking for anything that you know not
going to break your bank but sounds
pretty good this is the microphone right
here it has an audio gain right here and
right at the back right here you can
plug in your headphones right here to
monitor the audio before it even gets to
the recorder or the laptop right back
down here so it pretty nice has a pretty
long cord too I don't want to touch it
because vibrates which is the only thing
that I don't like about this or why I
won't be using like for my main
recordings because I do work with
products on a disc like if I'm talking
about something and you know doing that
so and it picks up that vibration pretty
pretty much so that's the only thing I
don't like about it and so the only time
I will I will be using it is at my main
desk to make holes and stuff like that
but not to do my other video recordings
unless I'm in a hotel because that's the
main reason I would want something like
that when I'm on the go then I will use
it but when I'm in my studio here like
where I have all my other stuff ready
set up I don't see a reason to use it
unless I'm using it at my desk
the main editing desk the workstation so
yes it's a good speaker I'm happy with
it pretty sturdy this is all metal
construction right here it's not
something that is going to break so easy
so I'm happy with the build quality and
for the price I don't understand how
they're able to give it that sort of
beauty quality as well as that sort of
audio I feel
they usually compromise somewhere to cut
the price down to that much so I'm happy
with everything they did here and yeah
if you also look online they are on
Amazon and YouTube here a lot of people
have made videos about it and everybody
likes it like it's like for the price of
it it's hard to beat its sound equality
that's the truth so yes I'm happy I'm
hope you guys if you're looking for a
microphone that's cheaper and sounds
pretty good sturdy high cost you know
high quality construction look at the
k67 0x5 fine it's a really really good
sounding speaker microphone so yes
that's finished for me today I hope you
like it thank you fine for sending this
over I promise I'll be using it a lot on
my computer over there typing and doing
all that stuff so thanks guys
yes I will see you in the next video
