and welcome to another sound battle
well that speakers speak for themselves
in the battlefield today we have the
mini two busses the Sony as far as xb3
and during this test I have the extra
base feature on the Sony XR 63 off
because I don't like how it sounds and
the speaker I feel like sounds way
better with it off
I am also sorry to those who are not
happy about that on a side note if
you're new here please make sure you
subscribe it really helps out a lot in
this battle the speakers of five feet
are waveform and high quality by newer
microphone and are playing at 80% volume
for a more realistic sound experience
please put your headphones on and let's
hear the speaker's speak oh I'm happy to
make down oh yeah and you have to win it
now another round children so far but I
have to be me never would be in this
place
so the first thing you notice is that
the X base B is louder and the second
thing that you'll notice is that the
base is better on the mini to the best
on the X space we is not as deep but
also has a little bit of discussion
going on with bass heavy music but
listening to these two side by side like
we just did it sounds like the mini two
is lacking some needs and some what's
the highs I feel like it was mainly
tuned for bass lovers this one it sounds
better in my opinion it has a better
stereo separation and I feel like you're
getting a full sound with it than what
you're getting from the mini - but for
someone who loves bass and just best as
clean as you can get it
between these two if you are willing to
sacrifice some mids and highs in most
songs you can't go wrong with a mini -
but that's just me and sound is
subjective I would like to hear what you
think in the comment section below if
you are just passing by and found this
video please consider subscribing and
becoming part of what we are doing here
I hope you liked the video if you did
don't forget to give it a like and feel
free to share it thanks for watching
this one I will see you in the next one
peace
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
