Wilkin here and JBL occasionally we'll
send out firmware updates to them
speakers just to fix some things and
stuff like that I don't know whatever
they're trying to do they usually
occasionally we'll send out firmware
updates and the way you know if there's
a family update is by connecting your
speaker to your phone and opening the
JBL connect app and usually when you
open it it will show you that mark that
shows you that yes is a firmware update
you can choose to update the speaker or
you choose not to whatever you want but
recently I think maybe the last three
weeks or so I've been getting so many
questions about that like people are not
getting the notification even when they
know that they have maybe from our
update maybe number I don't know 91.9 or
1.6 and yet they know there is I'm the
current one like on the JBL extreme 2 is
2.0 they know that but when they connect
the speaker to the app it doesn't show
them like this is a newer firmware
version they can run with that speaker
so I saw that so many times and I ended
up you know trying to look into it I'm I
ended up calling JBL and I talked them I
explained what the issue is and
thankfully they know about that issue
and they are working to fix it but what
they told me what the issue is is
there's a compatibility issue between
their app the JBL connect app and
android 9 so if you're right you're
having that problem there's a very very
big chance it's because you have you're
using android 9 I think that's end with
PI or something like that the developers
are currently working on solving the
issue the compatibility issue but that's
what they said
is the issue there is a problem between
109 and the GOP I'll connect app which
makes it so it doesn't show the firmware
update notification if what I call it
that if you want to get around that if
you have someone who is using a phone
that has an older version of Android
like hundred eight which is what was
working on my phone when I did update my
speaker you can try to use that phone
connect put the app on the phone connect
your speaker to their phone and upgrade
your phone when you're speaking then you
can delete the app the app after that
but if you don't have anyone using an
older version of Android if you have
someone with an iPhone it actually also
works they actually specifically said
that iPhone is not having any issues at
all so if someone has an iPhone you can
also put the app on there and download
it to you know app thread your firmware
on your speaker and then you can delete
the app after that but if you're having
an issue and it's an a different version
of Android like maybe you're running
Android eight or something older that
should be working and you're also having
the same issue leave the comment down
there if there's so many of you I'll
probably end up calling them again and
asking about that so they can kind of
clarify so but yeah I just wanted to you
know say because I've been getting so
many questions about it and that people
have been putting them on different
videos just so they can get my attention
and yes you've got my attention and I've
worked on it and that's all I know about
that issue I'm hoping they can fix it
sooner because I like to have the latest
firmware on my speakers so yes at least
they know the issue and you know they're
trying to work on it but that's all I
have for you guys I'm hoping not so many
of you are struggling with this but like
I said find someone who has a different
version and hopefully that will work or
some
has an iPhone and hopefully that will
work and it kind of mixes because
Samsung just recently started started
rolling out Android 9 at least I got
mine like maybe a week week and a half
ago also so it kind of makes sense that
that's when I started getting those
questions that's why I didn't question
the guy who I was talking to but yeah
it's when they started releasing those
Android 9im firmware to these phones
that I started getting so many of those
comments so yes this video was supposed
to be really quick but I think it's
longer than a 1h so I wanted it to so
we're gonna end this thank you very much
for watching if you're not subscribed
you know do it down there it's really
easy it's free actually so you can also
get those this kind of updates and stuff
like this in the future if you happen
this again so if everything is fixed
that'll be cool soon bye yes if you like
the video you live in like everything
like it with a dislike I just want to
get some sort of feedback from you
because you watched a video thanks for
watching I will see you in the next one
