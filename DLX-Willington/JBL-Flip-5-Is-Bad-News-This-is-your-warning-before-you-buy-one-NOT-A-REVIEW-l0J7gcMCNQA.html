video in 2017 JBO
announced the GBO footfall and with that
they also announced the JBL connect
place before that all the other speakers
only had JBL connect remember that and
it's been working good every speaker
that I've relieved ever system the JBL
extreme to the past three they charge
for the boombox they've all had a GPO
connect Plus even the charge 3m if you
update it you can also have JBL connect
plus on it so it's been good so whatever
you get you can connect it to all these
GPO connect plus enabled speakers to do
what so they can play together it is in
stereo mode or in party mode where they
just you can connect whichever a model
and they would play together but with
the release of the JBL I'm foot 5 they
have the first time I saw this was in a
package when I was doing the unboxing it
says JBL party boost what is that
so instead of JBL connect plus which
they introduced on the flip for which
works great
like I've been recommending people if
you're trying to connect in more than
one speaker JBL is the best route to go
because it's so easy you basically hit
the connect plus button and they do the
rest you don't need an app you don't
need anything and it happens like really
quick to but with the release of this
speaker I tried in that video that I was
trying to make to connect the two
speakers and they would not connect I
actually gave up and I was I went back
in while we strike trying to figure it
out and it's still couldn't work and I'd
not been able to make it work the JBL
product boosts whatever they are calling
it that they put on here you can see the
sign is also different from that of the
GBO connect plus it's not
backward-compatible
that's what it seems like i'm emailed
them I email them I haven't gotten a
reply back from home
but if they will even reply but it seems
like they couldn't the party boost is
not backward-compatible so they JB off
with five and what whatever other
speakers are coming up will not be able
to connect to these speakers that have
the newly released GPO Connect class
like what the heck is going on JBL it's
been so nice why why are you trying to
fix something that is not broken um I've
been not happy with DPO recently because
they're moving away from the door
drivers and going back to single drivers
they studied that with a GB of charge
for and now the flip for the flip 5 is
the same thing it's also mono sound
instead of stereo I had not been happy
with that but I was expecting it because
we saw you know when they announced it
in January at CES but now even the
pretty bush thing like what the heck is
going on I mean I have a feeling what
they're trying to do is so when when you
when you get to this point and you want
to buy a speaker instead of buying one
and have it connect with all the other
old speakers that you have now you have
to like oh my speaker cannot connect to
the older ones so I have to buy a newer
one
but if that's the case that is up there
trying to milk money out of you
whichever engineer is deciding this I
don't know this is not okay this is not
okay I feel like that killing that
killing these speakers I'm first going
duo instead of trying to fix how can we
make steel your sound better on these
small speakers you know seek out that
technology that trying to just get rid
of steel all all together just get rid
of it just let's just go mono this how
about we try to make these speakers are
so tiny sound better like have better
stimulate figure out that technology I
mean Sonny is kind of doing it with a
live sound mode it's not perfect but
they're trying to do something like that
just make that steel you'll get out
but JBL is a trying to make sure you'll
come out better or audibly to people who
are listening to these tiny speakers
that just getting rid of stereo entirely
and just making them mono speakers that
pisses me off
and now this so they stopped me that
every time we get to the new flip you
guys are going to flip over to a
different technology like so when the
flip six comes out JBL party boost now
we'll move over from now to JB or party
boost plus it's that it's that what's
really happening oh my gosh so that kind
of pissed me off is not a happy video
I'm obviously I'm going to be working on
you know comprising videos obviously
I've actually been recording quite a bit
but I just wanted to get that off my
chest because it's just really kind of
annoys me a little bit that this is what
they are doing
JBL is just trying to kill their
speakers cuz this is just not OK and I
feel like it's going to affect the sell
of the flip line of speakers at least
this guy here if I mean if I cannot
connect it to the older guys I'm just
gonna go back to the flip 4 because even
after listening to them I'm not noticing
even that big of a difference a little
bit better best performance but it's not
like huge like I wouldn't see why if I
want to connect multiple speakers where
I wouldn't just go back to this guy
right here instead of having to buy this
and it not connect to these other guys
it's different if maybe they will be
putting out if from your update that
will make the pretty boost compatible
bees highly doubt it but my puppy is
going off I highly doubt it but this is
not okay this is not okay thank you for
watching I will see you the next video
I'm gonna attend to the puppy oh my
goodness
