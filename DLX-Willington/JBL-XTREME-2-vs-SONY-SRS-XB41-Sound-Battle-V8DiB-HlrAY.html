and welcome to another sound battle
where we let speakers speak for
themselves in the battlefield today we
have the sony srs XP 41 versus the JBL
extreme - these are both new speakers
and besides the extreme two versus the
extreme this has been the most requested
battle video and for those who still are
waiting for the extremity versus the
extreme I already did that video during
the review of video so go watch the
review of the extreme - and that's where
I did the comparison of the extreme 2
versus the extreme so I'll put the links
to those to that video in the
description section below if you haven't
watched it yet so ^ field
JBL brought to 20 millimeter tweeters -
70 millimeter woofers and to PRS passive
radiators I usually just call them PRS
cuz it's easy on my tongue you know on
the other hand
Sony brought 2 or 58 millimeter full
range drivers and - PRS and note here
for those who don't know yet when the
extreme 2 plays when plugged in it plays
louder about 3 DB louder so I did a poor
on YouTube community here and a lot of
you choice that I should do I should
show both the AC and DC mode while doing
the sound battles but while I'm going to
do that in this video a lot of people
were saying it feels like we're favoring
the extreme tube by plugging it in
because it's made as a portable speaker
that you're supposed to be taking
outdoors and use it there you know it's
a portable speaker that should be used
not plugged in most of the time so when
we're doing this battle
videos we should show that and not
plugging it in because it gets a little
bit louder and favoring it if grbl wants
to fix that they can always send out a
firmware update and makes the speaker
constantly louder rather than us trying
to favor it by plugging it in so for the
rest of the videos I'm not going to be
showing they plugged in mode or AC yeah
SC mode will just be playing the
speakers as they are not plugged in as
portable speakers thank you guys who
commented and thank you all of you who
participated in the poll I hope you guys
understand what I'm saying and kind of
get what I'm trying to get at but we'll
get back to this video as usual I'll be
using a high quality binaural microphone
so for the best experience please use
headphones with that said let's hear the
speaker's speak
Oh
it's barely anything there
okay so for someone looking for the
loudest of the two here is the round
down when the extreme two is plugged in
it gets as loud as the XP 41 but what is
running off of the battery the XP 41 is
louder so if you're looking for the
loudest of the two all around the XP 41
is your guy here and for the best levels
like you heard in the love frequency
test the ex before one goes deeper than
the extreme two when it comes to low
best notes and this manifests a lot when
you're playing music at low volumes the
only disappointment here is that at
maximum volume the best does not get
lifted as much as people might want it
doesn't matter if the extra bass is on
or off which makes the extreme to a
little bit better at these higher
volumes because it's best comes out
still louder on the other end of the
frequency curve however due to the lack
of Twitter's on the XP 41 the highs are
not as good and crispy as those of the
extreme - overall the extreme two sounds
better than the XP for the one I
wouldn't say by a lot but I think it
offers a cleaner sound than what you get
on the XP 41 both these two speakers are
best oriented but I do like that the
export II one gives you sound settings
to choose from compare that to the
extreme tube what you get is what you
get I was actually hoping for something
like they did on the XP I mean on the
JBL boom box like the indoor and outdoor
mode I was hoping for that on the
extreme - but it didn't happen so I do
like the different sound settings on the
XP 41 and the app you can adjust your
sound a little bit better but you can't
do that with the extreme - so another
win for the XP 41 while I'm giving this
wing to the extreme - I do think that
these are both great speakers and I
think the XP 41 would have been
unbeatable if it had some Twitter's
going on
somewhere there but maybe that's for the
XP 42 right sunny in conclusion both
these speakers have their ups and downs
like covered in their full review videos
but the extreme to texture win here as
far as sound quality but do not forget
that the XP 41 is louder than the
extreme 2 when the speakers are both
playing in battery mode so if loveness
is something that you're looking for
between these two speakers bfxdx p41
will be your choice here if you plan on
picking up or learning more about any of
these two speakers please use the links
down below to head over to Amazon um it
helps out the channel and it does not
affect the price of the speakers to you
at all all it does is give you an
up-to-date price of the speaker which
you will most likely find on sale so use
the links in the description down below
please leave what you think down below
legs really help out so please drop me
one and if you didn't like the video
