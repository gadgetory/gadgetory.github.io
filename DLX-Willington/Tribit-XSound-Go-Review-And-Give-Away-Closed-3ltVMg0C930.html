today with me I do have the try bit X
sound go but wait a minute look I have
to how about I gave away it's Christmas
time anyways I feel like Santa right now
but before that what aren't you getting
talking to you lucky person this is a 12
watt ipx7 rated completely waterproof
Bluetooth speaker and not coding to try
bet you can get up to 24 hours of play
time but that's probably dependent on
how loud you're listening to the speaker
and the kind of music you are listening
to the speaker weighs only 380 grams and
it's a lot cheaper than all of these
that might look like it and if you
happen to be the lucky winner in the Box
you will find the speaker itself with a
lanyard and micro USB charging cable and
the paper work stuff looking around the
speaker on top here is where you will
find all your nicely laid out control
buttons and in the back behind this flap
is where you will find your micro USB
charging port and an auxilary input but
remember as usual before you exposed the
speaker to water or something like that
always make sure this is sealed
completely tight otherwise your speaker
will go kaput you are welcome
okay so with all of that said how does
it sound like because if you're going to
wind a speaker you at least want to know
how it sounds right okay so for context
I have the DOS sound box Pro it's about
10 bucks more expensive and it's a
little bit bigger than the tribe it X
sound go but it's about the
in the sconce considering the price
range and the size it's the closest
thing I have to match the X ound goes so
we will be comparing the two just to
give you an idea of how it sounds like
in composing two speakers in its price
range in size so that's what you're
getting as usual I will be using a high
quality binaural microphone so for the
best experience please use headphones
and with that said let's hear what
you're going to win sounds like
you
and there you have it as you could
hopefully hear that very well the tribe
it sounds really really good in
comparison to these speakers so it's a
really really good sounding speaker if
you asked me it has pretty good base it
has things balanced I'll put it off like
for its size really really crispy highs
and if you go all the way up to maximum
volume it this sounds kind of gets not
so good and teeny but if you keep the
volume you know eighty and something
like that it really does sound pretty
good for its size I feel like it's a
pretty cheap speaker for the kind of
sound it's giving you okay give away how
is this going to work pretty easy
actually I'm gonna give away one here on
youtube down from the comments section
below and then I will give away another
one via Twitter and this is how it's
going to work make sure you're
subscribed and you follow me on twitter
and then if you want to win here on
youtube you can just leave a comment
down below implying that you want to win
and people who are not interested in
winning or something like that you can
still comment but don't imply that you
want one you can just talk about what
you think about the sound of the tribe
it X ound go but someone who wants to
win down there just say hey I want to
win or I'm interested in it or something
like that and then over on Twitter you
go to the tweet which I'm going to leave
a link down in the description down
below go to the tweet announcing this
video that you're watching right now and
just leave a comment there saying you
want to win or something like that I
will look into that tweet and all the
the comments on it and that's where I
will choose the winner for the second
speaker so there you have it pretty easy
we're trying to get Twitter going so
it's it's a lot easier over there to
share stuff and communicate with you
guys
and YouTube is getting rid of the
messaging so we're trying to find
another way to communicate with you guys
so that's why I want you guys to go over
and follow me on Twitter one will win
over there and one will win over here
down in the comment section below
only 25th December Christmas Day I will
be your Center and I'll be announcing
who are the winners of the two speakers
so there you have it pretty easy to win
thank you very much for watching the
video and thank you to tribe it for
sending this out and making this video
