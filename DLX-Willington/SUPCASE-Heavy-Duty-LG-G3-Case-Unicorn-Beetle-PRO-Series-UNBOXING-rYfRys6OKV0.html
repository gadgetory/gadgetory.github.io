another unboxing the super cast heavy
duty LG g3 case and this is from the
unicorn beetle Pro fairies I got this
case together with two other items so I
had three items in the same box
so that's why you're just seeing this
right here this is the box that it came
in
it came in with two other items so yeah
your box is not going to look like this
from Amazon it's mine to come in another
box but this is it we'll get right into
it I've been waiting so much to get this
in so you know and protect my phone
we're back so right there
nothing left in there and this is the
bad boy right here and only here saying
you can watch the video of how to
install this on your phone which is kind
of nice that way you don't have to just
guess how it goes and comes with a
plastic on there take that off and it's
a foam in here stem thing feels pretty
solid so this is the other inside piece
that will protect your phone this is the
outside casing which is nice when you
you know when I was working on other
people's videos it looks like this was
like there was plastic all around it but
not which was 9 which is nice because I
was thinking you know having plastic
over my camera that's going to be you
know not so cool I was actually thinking
of just cutting it out if it was all
like plastic I thought it was plastic in
the back too so yeah that's cool so this
is just going to be on the front of your
camera
I mean on in front of your phone and
there's nothing on the back so this one
we just sit on your screen like that and
then this will cover the back I don't
have my phone right here it's upstairs
but but this is just an unboxing so no
really big deal so if you want to see
how it looks like I'm going to be doing
a full review of this product here so
make sure you check that out pretty soon
like you know as soon as I put it on and
use it you know for about a week or two
I usually like to use stuff first before
I review them just so I know what I'm
talking about but yeah that's been it
for the unboxing go please make sure you
check out you know the other video of
you know the review and what I think of
it and how it goes in your hand and yeah
