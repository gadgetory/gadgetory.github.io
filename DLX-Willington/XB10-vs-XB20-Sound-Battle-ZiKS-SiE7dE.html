welcome to another sound battle where we
let speakers speak for themselves in the
battlefield today we have the Sony SRS
XP 20 versus the xB 10 I'll be picking
up another XP tend to see how two of
them compared to the XP 20 but until
then for those who've been wondering how
these two compare
one on one this video is for you the
first song we play with the extra base
off on the XP 20 and the rest will have
it on the speakers were playing at 60
and 100 percent volume I'll be using a
high quality binaural microphone so
please use headphones for the best
experience with that said let's hear the
speaker's speak
please come
crazy
and everyone can see
and there you have it as expected the XP
20 is louder than the 10 and that's
understandable considering the size
difference between the two and honestly
I couldn't find anywhere where the XP 10
performs better than the XP 20 except
for the fact that is able to offer 360
sound experience that the XP 20 is not
capable of now don't get me wrong this
does not mean that the sound of the XP
10 is horrible or anything like that
in fact if you compare a two speakers in
its size it's a great speaker with more
bass than any of these here the xB 20
has an advantage of size and was merged
to be a step up from the XP 10 hence
living the XP 10 with no chance of
winning since the person who made the XP
20 is the person who made the XP 10 the
XP 10 is good for the price portability
and 360 sound if that's what you are
looking for there you go otherwise the
XP 20 is ahead of its little brother or
sister in everything else like I said
I'll be picking up another XP 10 and see
how two of them compare to this one
XP 20 watch out for that video will be
coming out soon let me know what you
think down below don't forget to
subscribe if you're new here I love you
all and I will see you in the next one
peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
