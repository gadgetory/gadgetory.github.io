and welcome to another sound battle
well that speakers speak for themselves
in the battlefield today we have the
pulse 3 going up against the charge 3
the speakers will be playing at 60 and
100 percent volume I'll be using a high
quality binaural microphone so please
use headphones for the best experience
with that said let's hear the speaker's
speak
you
yes in the ventures distance away
Oh III monkey your well-being across
baby girl be the queen bees don't say Oh
Oh
cool
alright so the charge 3 is a little bit
louder
and that's if you're sitting right in
front of your speakers but if you're
behind them going are about equally loud
and sometimes the upholstery seems to be
a little bit louder I would say but not
by much if it is at all the best
performance on both speakers is about
equal I couldn't really hear a huge
difference here what is not equal though
are the highs when the church we had
just come out it was criticized a lot
for poor performance in the highs
they put out multiple updates the
speaker to get the sound that we have
right now listening to this to the sound
of the poultry reminds me a lot of the
chats we before the updates when it had
just come out that if we ignore the 360
sound of course on upholstery all this
is to say that the maintain highs on the
charge 3 sound a little bit of better
than the power screen but like I said
this is only if you're sitting right in
front of the charge 3 and not behind it
if you're behind the speakers you will
get a better performance from the pulse
3 due to its 360 sound capabilities
there is a slight improvement in sound
quality on the past week compared to the
2 but it's not quite enough to really
outperform the charge 3 as of right now
and again this is only if the trust we
is aimed at you if you're behind it the
power stre is always going to perform
better the beauty of the power 3 and the
360 sounding right shore are the selling
points of the power strip but if you
don't care about those things the church
3 would be your best bet here it's
actually a better bang for your buck but
that's just me and sound is so
subjective I would like to hear what you
have to say about these two speakers in
the comment section below don't forget
to like the video and if you're not a
subscriber yet do that too
I love your faces and I will see you
the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
