I've had to have a bought before but
then when they had just come out but I
returned it after a few weeks of use
just because of the safety issues that
hoverboards were having back then
because there were no standards no
testing that was done to ensure the
safety of hoverboards but I've been
keeping my eye out of a system and
finally I have a hoverboard again and I
know someone is gonna type and say it's
technically not a hoverboard and I get
it but that's what everybody says so you
might have to just get over that anyways
this is the gyro warrior have aboard now
since the reason I haven't had a have
aboard in such a long time is mainly
safety reasons my number one question
was obviously how safe is this board
well it has the UL 2 to 7 2
certification stamp plastered all over
and I personally contacted the company
who reassured me that their boards are
tested and certified to meet all safety
standards and in addition to that gyro
are also manufactures hover boards for
other brands which you might even know
so I expect there only to be above and
beyond so I think for safety I'm pretty
convinced that we are good here
so let's unpack it so the packaging is
pretty good everything came pretty
securely packaged and in a box you will
find a power brake the bumper guards
which I forgot to install on mine before
taking it out I might have been a little
excited but you know but you also get a
user menu and obviously the board itself
looking at the board I personally think
it looks pretty sweet and it reminds me
a
of the Transformers Prime which I have
watched only a few times now besides the
design this is not like any other
hoverboards that you see this is an
all-terrain off-road hoverboard
so for someone who has an unpaved
driveway this is something that will
work perfectly it has larger than
average eight point five inch tires most
of the boats that you see at six point
five so these are a little bit higher
off the ground it can handle dirt paths
bumpy pavements gravel grass sand but
out of all those I found sand to be the
hardest to go through and this might be
just because I'm learning and not very
comfortable with the body yet but I also
know that even if bike can suffer when
it comes to a lot of sense so I mean it
will go through a little bit of sand
easy but if it's this thick not quite I
might need to just practice a little bit
more but yeah it's not very good when
it's a lot of sand the build quality
seems pretty good I actually didn't know
but all that blue part is actually
aluminum or aluminium for some reason I
thought is plastic I think most of the
board's that's plastic but this is
aluminum so I think it's a robust and
heavy-duty build the board is also self
balancing which makes it easy and safer
for new riders like me yes I'm not a pro
here I'm all this footage that you're
seeing is from the first day of me
trying out this board so yeah I
definitely need more practice I'm to get
more comfortable with the board yet but
getting started is not that hard and I'm
pretty sure that self balancing kind of
helps out most especially to get on and
get off the board it has a weight limit
of 265 pounds a maximum climbing angle
of 30 degrees and you can go as fast
nine point nine miles per hour and when
you reach Mach speed it will beep and
will automatically start preventing you
from leaning forward trying to slow you
down or at least preventing you from
going any faster and it actually kind of
feels really weird like someone is like
pushing on you from the front like it
it's just a weird feeling and at this
point you really should slow down or at
least try to stop to go any faster
because what will happen is it won't be
keeping up with you your value will be
going faster than the board which could
mean falling forward so once you hear
the beep please for God's sake just slow
down
speaking of speed they have an app that
you can download and connect with your
board for some added features connection
was not that hard to do either
just download the app make sure your
bluetooth is turned on turn on the board
go to the Bluetooth icon in the corner
and tap scan at the bottom of the app
and you should see it show up there just
tap it and you are done what can you do
with it up well you can see how fast
you're going which is cool I don't know
why you would want to write and look at
your phone at the same time but it is
there you can see how fast you are going
and below the speedometer it shows you
how much juice you have left on the
battery
another good touch and right here you
can change the color of the LED lights
and for my favorite feature I think this
is the most important at least for me
this is why I liked the most about the
app um if you're getting this for a
smaller rider a younger a kid there you
have this setting here where when you
turn it on your speed the speed will be
limited to whatever you set it to be so
if you don't want him to go any faster
than this then whenever they hit that
mark
the board will not be going any faster
than that so I think that's a pretty
pretty good touch I really liked that I
think was my favorite feature and if you
plan on using the inbuilt Bluetooth
speaker it doesn't sound greatest but it
is there the sound is kind of dependent
on what grounds you're writing on so
when I was in my house writing it on
carpet it sounded muffled and when I go
to a hard surface because of the the the
drivers are facing fault
I mean downwards whatever is down is
what's reflecting the sound back to your
face or back upwards so whatever surface
you're writing on will determine the
kind of sound that you get from that
little speaker down there but I
personally wouldn't really use it I mean
it's better than the phone sound
definitely a lot louder too but it's not
like the greatest sound if you just need
something a little to listen to it's
there it is good enough anyways doing my
conversation with Jaguar that make us of
this board I contacted them just because
there were no instructions in the box or
in the manual about the app or even
Bluetooth so I talked to them but during
our conversation they also told me that
the app does not work with the white
version of this the warrior so if you're
planning on getting one and you like the
white one they don't it does not support
the app yet so just be warned if that's
something that you're really interested
in using the app on it all the other
ones are good but just a white one and
if you plan on picking up one the best
would be doing the Amazon Prime dip
which is going to be 36 hours this year
which is kind of insane but also got
word that it will be featured in the
deal of the day during that time so it
will definitely be the best time to get
one of these each player if you plan on
picking up one if you've been dragging
together have a board I think now is the
time
and it will be I believe it will be on a
really really good price they didn't
tell me how much they'll be selling it
when I was talking to them but it sounds
like it's going to be a really really
good deal so I would suggest you click
on the link in the description below and
you go check out how much they have it
doing the Amazon Prime so anyways I
think that's it it's really really hot
out here if you can see I'm sweating
like a pig the link to that in the
description section below make sure you
use that link because that helps out the
channel too and shout out to gyro or the
makers of gyro for sending me this board
to try out I personally had a blast with
it and I'm continuing going to be having
a blast with it thank you all for
watching I love you all wait for my next
video after I take a shower with
something because this is it's crazy out
here I love you all and I will see you
in the next video peace
I don't like hot wait did I end this
video I think I did I think I ended the
video so I end this large bruise holy
crap did you guys see the ha I would say
that's a good way to end this video be
careful with your boys I'll see you in
the next video again peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
