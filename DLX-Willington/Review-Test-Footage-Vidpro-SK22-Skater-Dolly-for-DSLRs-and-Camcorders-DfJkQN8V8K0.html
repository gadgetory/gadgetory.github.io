today we are looking at the fit Pro SK
22 skater dolly I have a slider which
I've been using in my projects but the
thing is that with sliders you can only
glide in a straight line so in times
where you might need some kind of
rotation around the subject a tabletop
dolly is your best option I picked up
this one from Amazon from a company
called V Pro for about 70 bucks and I've
been playing around with it for some
time now and here is my experience so
far there was nothing special with the
unboxing but in the Box you get an
extendable handle the dolly and the
magic arm the handle extends up to about
27 inches long and it's one of the
reasons I choose to buy this guy the
dolly itself feels really solid its
all-metal construction with polyurethane
wheels which how stainless steel ball
bearings he does have angle position
markers to help with adjusting the
angles but I found this to be not that
useful half the time the only time I've
tried to use it is when I'm trying to go
straight but I feel like it wasn't
always right on it's kind of useful in
some ways as a reference marker in some
situations but not as useful I guess as
I expected and I don't know if it's just
my dolly but I feel like it's not
well-balanced as you can see in this
shot here that wheel is not touching
every once in a while this does not
happen when I have a camera mounted on
it though but it's something worth
mentioning it I feel like it's not
balanced well the dolly does look good
though
I like those clear see-through wheels a
lot and I also like that it comes with
this handle here this is one heck of a
useful tool I honestly can't imagine
having one without it good job vid pro
the footage quality I'm getting from it
is now
that bad either is the tabletop dolly so
you're gonna have to use it on surfaces
that are smooth as a table table it's
also going to take you some time to get
used to using it how fun watching some
test footage I did don't forget to
subscribe like my Facebook page and I
will see you in the next one peace
you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
