of people ask me which speaker they
should buy or how to choose a Bluetooth
speaker in this video I'm going to try
to answer that question as good as I can
alright so a sound representation or
sound production of sound relay is a
hard thing to decide for somebody as a
lot of people have different tastes when
it comes to sound but I'm going to be
giving you five things five things that
will hopefully help you narrow into that
speaker that might be right for you and
we are starting with the first thing and
that is the price and this might be
obvious but you kind of want to know how
much you have to spend before you spend
it and this will also help narrow down
the things and speakers to look at
during your search which is always good
and I know there are some people out
there who don't really care about the
price of the speakers but just want
something to listen to and that will
lead us into number two portability and
this goes hand-in-hand with the purpose
of the speaker the main things that
you're going to be using the speaker I'm
for example if you plan on using your
speaker a lot while walking you plan on
mainly listening to talk shows and you
just want something a little bit louder
than your phone you're looking for
something that you'll be able to
actually hold with one hand and actually
get a grip of the speaker in most cases
this kind of person will be looking for
a smaller speaker something you know
small not huge for those kind of
purposes and then on the other hand you
have someone who is looking for somewhat
portable speaker but it's as loud as
they can get it offers a lot of bass and
you're planning on using it for like
house parties and stuff like that mainly
then it's safe to say that this kind of
person is looking at bigger speakers
like the JBL extreme and all speakers
that kind of
fall in that category now that doesn't
mean that the reasons I list above are
the reasons to get a small speaker or a
bigger speaker those were just small
ideas that sometimes people use or
things that might help you choose a
speaker to use but they change from
person to person so my point was think
about what you're mainly going to be
using this speaker and that will help
you determine what size of speaker will
most suit your purpose and now on to
number three and that is the features of
the speaker or should I say feature
because with these are mainly talking
about the ingress protection rating or
the IP rating of the speaker and this
will still bring us back to what you
plan on using this speaker the most if
it's just around the house that's what
you plan to use your speaker like you
won't be seeing any outdoor weathers
like rain snow mud you pretty much okay
with any rating but if you're planning
on using this speaker for hiking camping
running swimming I mean if you're
planning on using it outdoors mostly
like all the time it might be a smart
idea to look at something that's
waterproof or at least splash proof so
once you decide what rating you'll be
going with hear thou should also help
narrow down what speakers to look at and
going on to number four is battery life
of the speaker this one is kind of
self-explanatory but the main thing is
if you plan on using your speaker for
long times away from somewhere where
there's an outlet to recharge it um you
want to get a speaker that will give you
the time of the play time long enough to
last however long you're going to be a
well from a charger it's important to
note though that you're not always going
to get the battery life or the play time
that the manufacturer claims and this is
because battery life depends a lot on
how loud you play your speaker for
someone who listens to a hundred percent
volume on that speaker that going to get
less than what's claimed by the
manufacturer and someone who listens to
their speaker at maybe 30 40 50 percent
volume they are going to get a lot maybe
not a lot but you know more than what
the manufacturer claims because the
speaker is not working as hard and the
kind of music you listen to has a play
in here to someone who listens to bass
heavy music they're not going to get the
same play time out of their speaker like
someone who listens to music that barely
has any bass in it and if you use your
speaker to charge your phone you're
going to dramatically cut off play time
and lastly number five is the kind of
music you listen to you want a speaker
that will most represent the kind of
music that you listen to and this is a
lot about your your sound preference
heavy bass listeners you obviously want
a speaker that will best represent um
the laws so you can get that bass that
you crave and then for people who don't
really care about the bass you're
looking for something that will give you
the best fantastic highs and mids that
you can get so this is kind of all about
you and so the only thing I would
recommend is read reviews watch reviews
see sound comparisons and sound tests
and see if people are describing the
sound the way you like it
in the PIO preferences in your category
and then after that you can go all in
and purchase the speaker that you're
looking at or they will help you narrow
down a few speakers that you're looking
at and that will help you decide between
the two speakers you have narrowed down
to um obviously there are other things
to consider while choosing a Bluetooth
speaker but those are the main things
for me that I think someone really needs
to consider and
look at and then you can go into other
details of all the features that each
speaker provides but those are the main
things to look at and hopefully they can
help you narrow down your choices and
help you choose that perfect Bluetooth
speaker for you so if you're new here
