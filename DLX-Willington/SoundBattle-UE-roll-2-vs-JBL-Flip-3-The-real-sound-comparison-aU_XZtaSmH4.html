welcome to another sound battle I
haven't been feeling so well lately I
have a huge list of requested videos and
I just can't put it off any longer so
all that to say excuse me for my voice
in the battlefield today we have the Yui
roll - going up against the flip 3 the
speakers of 5 feet away from the sound
recorder and they are playing that 80%
volume put your headphones on in
let's hear the speaker's speak
homegirl now which is good
just into space oh happy to miss out
oh you think in there you have to win
another round but I have to be never won
see in danger in this place
you
the speakers are about the same when it
comes to loudness and the mids and highs
are also pretty much the same but
there's a huge huge dynamic range
between the lows and highs of the flip
read compared to the role - it almost
sounds like JBL took the sound of the
roll - and added some bass to it and
called it a flip 3 so if some quality is
what you are looking for between these
two speakers the flip 3 is the winner
because of its rich full sound and a
higher bigger dynamic range the only
reason I would recommend taking the roll
over the flip 3 is if what a proof is
the must-have in whatever you plan to
use the speaker because the flip 3 is
only splash proof anyways let me know
what you think down below follow me on
Twitter and suggest sound battles that
you would like to see here on the links
to my pages will be down in the
description below thanks for watching I
will see you in the next one peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
