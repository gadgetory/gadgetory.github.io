YouTube its Willington here with another
unboxing of this strife touch activity
in SmartWatch two-in-one yeah so this is
it here I picked it up for my wife for
her birthday which is going to be in two
days so I got a chance today she's not
here so I can do an unboxing without her
finding out what I got her yet
plus I have to kind of wrap it up in all
that fun stuff she's so much into work
now and trying to get in better shape
and stuff like that so I thought this
would be a good gift because I know
she's talked about it so this is what I
picked up and without wasting any more
time let's get into it
so that's what comes out just like that
and then best to watch itself looks like
there's something else in here
so that's it so we have inside you will
find three boxes of natural what's in
watch well two boxes and the band itself
looks nice let's see what's in this big
box so in here papers thing this is
sizing right here is a sizing guide and
I'm pretty sure this is a QuickStart
QuickStart guide on how to charge band
itself let's see what's in here
we've this is the charging cable it's a
USB to microUSB that's right there and
in here
just a charging cradle that's cool so
this is where the watch will set or the
band be charged and what's down in here
there's nothing in here he's fooled us
so this is young I'm gonna pull you away
just because I want to put it back
together for my wife before I give it to
her
so it's working in a good shape so yeah
that box does not have anything in it
but here's the band Missy from get it
off here before you yeah that was easy
and that's the bend right there just a
low bow just right there strive and that
doesn't stick that's the back of it so
that the charging connections with those
connect to those pins in a cradle in
there you can see that let's try it out
that just opens like that and you make
sure these face the same side as those
opinions are just like that
snap it and then just connect the USB
USB to micro in here to somewhere and
your computer or any you know computer
or whichever church that you have for
your SmartWatch
and that's it um I kind of wanna show
you guys how it looks like on your hand
this is this has many options back here
it's a really long one so that's if your
hand is bigger than that Lenny won't fit
which I really highly doubt and one I
mean do they do but most people are this
will fit you for most people this will
fit I'm pretty sure and then
they have many options here - yes it's
actually comfortable and that's how it
looks like this spot my watch and the
rest so if you want you're comparing how
big it is this is the Sony SmartWatch
and that's how it is how big it is
compared to this obviously if you're
getting this kind of stuff you want to
go something small because it's a
workout thing you don't want something
huge universe that's why I was I went
for this and places my wife and I don't
think she would want something big like
this she thinks this watch is so big but
I think it's small but but yeah that's
it that's how it looks like on your hand
and it's honestly I think it's
comfortable like it is nice and all this
like I put all this band back here and I
don't feel any uncomfortable
it can easily be like put back there
even if you're going all the way if
you're that skinny I don't think you'll
be in the way of anything at all it was
still fit and be comfortable and then to
take it off it's just basically that and
put it back and this is really like snap
and like don't worry that it's going to
come off or anything so now I've
loosened it so it is nice honestly it
feels good but yeah that's the band
right there
it's made in China if you can see that
just like you know
so it's made in China but they have this
here I think you can get feel sure
you're not gonna want to use this this
toy here and you want it shorter you can
tie it off they have markings there so
you can cut off here and there's a kind
of marking here too so in case you want
to cut it off or anything like that but
yeah this this is the charging right
here it has a lock like you leave a look
so you just release it and open it and
when you'll watch your band is in like
that just bring it down and then you
snaps right and just like that and then
when you're done you just release that I
don't want to take this off like I said
it's my wife's I bought it for her I
don't really want to like want it to
look like it's not new so I'm going to
do a review for this so make sure you
subscribe I will do a review if you want
to see an in-depth after I give this
four on this for her and use it and hope
she let me test it out and come up with
a detailed review of how it works and
how to use it and you know everything I
find out about it the goods the bads and
do's and don'ts and everything that you
might want to know about it so depending
on when you're watching this I might
have the video up already
so make sure you check that out to make
sure you do not miss out on it but
subscribe to my channel and I will see
you in the next video peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
