welcome to another sound battle where we
let speakers speak for themselves in the
battlefield today we have the onyx
studio 5 going up against the JBL
extreme 2
to the battlefield the extreme to
brought to 70 millimeter woofers and to
20 millimeter tweeters and officially is
rated to go as low as 55 Hertz on the
lower side of the frequency curve while
on the other side the studio five
brought one 120 millimeter woofer 125
millimeter Twitter and yes it is a mono
speaker but it's also rated to go as low
as 50 Hertz and as usual I'll be using a
high quality binaural microphone so for
the best experience please use
headphones with that said let's hear the
speaker's speak
and this is kind of where the extreme
two ends
okay there's a little bit there but I
think that's the end of it
okay so the extreme two is louder than
the studio five by about one DB
according to my measuring so not really
by much but it is a little bit louder
I'm the highest only extreme two are
also a little bit more defined than
those on the studio five
but while the extreme two could be known
as a best heavy speaker and the studio
five actually has more bass than the
extreme two and as you could hopefully
tell with the low-frequency response
test and the studio five is able to
reproduce lower notes that the extreme
tool can only dream of and for those
people who are not all about the best
you might actually find it to be a
little bit too much bass in some songs I
do personally like both the speakers in
that if we disregard the design of the
studio five but here's what I think if
you are interested in the most balanced
speaker of the to the extreme - it is it
is brighter it's louder it's waterproof
in has stereo sound on the other hand
for someone who doesn't mind a little
bit more best in their music like a
little bit more than even what the
extreme two can give you well then the
studio five won't disappoint you and
this doesn't mean that all it places
bears bears horribly balanced blah blah
blah no that's not what I'm trying to
say it actually sounds pretty good they
balance things out pretty good it's just
that for someone who is used to
listening to flat sound that's your kind
of sound profile that you like you will
find that with you with a studio five
it's it wins a lot more on the best
heavy side even more so than the extreme
