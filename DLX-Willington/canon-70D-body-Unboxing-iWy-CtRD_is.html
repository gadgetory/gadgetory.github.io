with another unboxing today we are going
to be unboxing the canon 70d body i just
got this off from amazon I've been
debating between the this camera here
and you know the gh4 or the gh3 but the
budget has been so tight if I had to go
with the gh4 I had to buy in or more
lenses for it because right now I only
have the Canon glass that I usually that
my tears flower that I'm recording with
right now and so if I had to switch I
won't have to buy lenses for a GH for
the Micro Four Thirds cameras which I
don't have right now so I decided to
just up to grade to the 70d right now
and then save up for a big change you
know buying bodies and lenses but let's
get right into this and see what comes
when you buy the justa body of the canon
70d so i already cut the Box open and
you know some bubble wrap in here and as
usual you know for safety purposes
there's a box in a box I'm gonna make
sense and that's all that comes in there
to show that's my order details so
that's the box I mean it looks like it's
a kit but it's actually right here and
pretty sure they use the same casing for
the kid and the body they just put a
sticker right here to say body
we show if I take it off probably two
new little to 135
fish for that's what I would say but I'm
not gonna get into that but we'll get
inside now this is everything that you
get your user guide for the camera and
the software and there's more software
right here and on utilities like drivers
and stuff my warranty card and when we
get right down in here if you can see
here is the charger here's the battery
the next struck the code that connects
to your charger this is the USB to
mini-usb connection to your camera
because you want to do that at some
point from way up there or something and
here's the thing that we're waiting for
as the body I'm gonna put that aside
right awhile we this is this that's
alright you guys don't really care right
okay so it comes in this really soft
material to keep the camera nice and
soft and nice and safe and you know
awesome
and there it is I've been doing well I
have about six weddings already set up
for this year 2015 I'm I'm going for
about ten weddings to do that's why I
wanted to get a second camera cause it
really helps out you know getting
different angles and making sure one
camera is covering its part when you
have to move with the other camera so
that's why I got you know I upgraded and
got a different one so I have two
cameras actually three there's one that
I use for my white and roll
like all the way in the back is and I
 order so JVC the one that's
recording right now that's a 60d and
when we check the lens cap off looks
freaking clean and awesome it's a swivel
screen which is what I was going for you
I don't I like sweet ball screens it
makes everything so much easier it's
clean one year one SD card doesn't have
dual USB SD cards and just like the 60d
you still have that locking mechanism
right there you have to lock I mean it
locks you have to press that the only
cool thing about this is that it doesn't
stop so like the 60d it goes to like all
the way to record two video recording
and it stops you can't move anymore so
you have to go back the other way this
is cool cuz you know you can go any size
that you want without it stopping so
that's that's awesome
him and the recording is still back here
that's all for instead of having your
video recording mode up here I see it's
just right here just on a turn like that
which is cool because it kind of sucks
like on my 60d always having to if I
want to take a you know a picture I have
to go up here and go all the way to the
video and then if I want to go back to
my picture there twists around until I
get the picture taken again so that's
kind of really nice that they just you
know put that right there you can switch
right away through photography or video
mode so easily it definitely feels
lighter and the sitting on the setup
back here is pretty much the same I feel
like all this has been moved to from
here to here and they play on some I
mean it's changed a little bit here but
hey that's that's still cool I still
like it and this is the battery it's
gonna open it and put it in and like
this video
you know how it works the battery you
know it's pretty much the same as it was
on my 60d I don't see any difference I
would put that baby in like that and
turn it on make sure that's okay I don't
know why you want
the battery's dead
let me find one of my batteries right
here real quick okay I figured out what
the problem was apparently both of my
batteries were dead and I didn't know
the one that came with it was dead and
the one that I put in to try it out
was dead so I found it third battery
while one of my brother's the third one
and that's that was that one worked so
I'm I am happy now I was like dang no
singing stuff but to Amazon now this is
what came with a 60d so you just plug it
right into the wall it has those knots
right there to just go right into the
wall but it difference with this one is
it has to go you put plug this into here
and then plug this into the wall I feel
like that's the only difference
everything else looks the same if you
can well let me show you the LC is 6e
and this is LC e6
so I guess there's a little bit of a
difference between the two but mainly
they look the same this is the charger
that came with this this is the battery
that came with this camera and I'm
charging it on here and is
working very fine so I don't think
there's much of a difference between the
two since its churches the same kind of
battery yep so that's been it please
subscribe to my channel and let me know
what you think about this how do you
think it compares to 60d am I gonna love
it I don't know yet but if you know
please don't forget to with your
comments in the comment section below
and I will see you in the next video
thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
