welcome to another sound battle where we
let speakers speak for themselves so
like I promised in the previous video I
went to Best Buy and picked up another
XP 10 so we can see how the XP 20 sucks
up to 2x beat ends playing in stereo
mode this video would have gone up a
couple days ago but I was waiting to
feel a little bit better than I did when
I made my previous video my voice
sounded really really bad and I
apologize for that and thank you anyways
let's get back to this video the XP tens
will be playing in stereo mode in order
for you to be able to hear that you need
to be using headphones so they can
separate the left and right channel I
will be using a high quality binaural
microphone so please again use
headphones for the best experience with
that said let's hear the speakers speak
and there you have it the to expert end
sound about as loud as the XP 20 the
main difference here is that the music
from the two expert hands sounds a lot
more open and wider and more room
filling than the XP 20 which sounds
directional like pointed at you but best
coming out of the two XP tens is about
the same as what's coming out of the XP
20 which is one of the areas where the
XP 10 was lacking behind in the previous
video I do prefer the highs coming out
of the to X P tends to those coming out
of the XP 20 but the midst of the XP 20
sound better in my opinion with that
said the serious sound coming out of the
two XP tens is really good you can
distinctively hear the right and left
channel in the music with XP tens which
sounds really amazing you should have
heard that if you were wearing
headphones and honestly stereo
separation is the main area where I see
the XP 20 losing to the 2x be tens so if
still your sound is not what you're
looking for in the 2x beat ends
I still think the XP 20 would still be
the better choice here but that's just
me and sound is so subjective
I'd like to hear what you have to say
about this too in the comment section

upcoming videos thanks for watching I
love you all and I will see you in the
next one peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
