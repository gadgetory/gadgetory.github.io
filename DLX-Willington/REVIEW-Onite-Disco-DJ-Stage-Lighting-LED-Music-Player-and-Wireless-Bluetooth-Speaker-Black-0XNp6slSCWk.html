speaker as well as a colorful stage 30
light it plays music via bluetooth the
TF card or micro SD card the USB flash
drive and has FM radio for your favorite
radio station
it comes with cool color effects and
it's bright enough to light up the room
pretty nicely if you are the kind of
person who throws a lot of home parties
this could be a step up in the fund it's
wireless
which makes it pretty portable to move
around and place any where you want it
to be and it comes with the remote that
allows you control pretty much all the
functions of the light from a distance
which is nice the only thing I didn't
like about this light is that he doesn't
really give you control over the colors
so it's already pre-programmed so you
turn it on and it just does its own
thing so I would have loved to be able
to control the colors I want whenever I
want other than that it's a pretty cool
looking product and they give you two
color options you can either get it in
black or white which is nice in the Box
you get the unit itself a USB cable a
3.5 millimeter jack the remote and a
user manual I will leave the link to
this right in the description section
below if you want to go and check it out
on Amazon and don't forget to subscribe
leave your questions and comments in the
section below and I will see you in the
next video peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
