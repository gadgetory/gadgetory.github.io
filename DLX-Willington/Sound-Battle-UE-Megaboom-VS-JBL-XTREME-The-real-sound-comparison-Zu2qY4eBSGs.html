welcome to another sound battle where we
left speakers speak for themselves in
the battlefield today we have the UE
mega boom going up against the JBL
extreme as requested the speakers of
five feet away from the sound recorder
and they are playing at 80 percent
volume put your headphones on and let's
hear the speaker's speak
oh no no trust me I've got something to
say oh I'm happy to me down for you
thinness do you have to admit let's just
be
me uptown dancing all around till the
disco ball pops I have two big me and
everyone can see you think it is this
place
okay so what did you guys think leave me
a comment down below bye in the meantime
I will tell you what I think of the two
speakers both speakers like close to the
same when it comes to how loud they can
get and I found it to be the same for
the mids and the highs except for some
songs I found the bass to spill a little
bit into the mids on the mega boom
when it comes to lows the extreme
handles the bass better than the mega
boom if you listen to the mega boom by
itself and not comparing it to the
extreme it is a great speaker and you
can barely notice its shortcomings in
the walls but put it against the extreme
set by side you will definitely hear the
difference in the laws now if we mix the
laws mids and highs you will get more
the flat sound from the mega boom and
with the extreme you will get more of
the bass boosted sound experience and I
also find there to be a better
definition between the lows mids highs
only extreme in my opinion the GBO
extreme wins this battle but I will
break it down this way if you're someone
who likes to listen to flat music with
no boosted anything by just one flat out
music the mega boom is your guy here
but for someone who listens to bass
heavy music or you're just watching this
video to find out which one has deeper
bass the JBL extreme is the guy for you
let me know what you think down below
thanks for watching I really hope you
found this video useful if you did like
the video subscribe to the channel if
you're new here and don't forget to
follow me on Twitter thanks for watching
this one and I will see you in the next
one peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
