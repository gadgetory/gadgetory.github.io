another review and today I'm reviewing
the dual USB car charger from DB power
so this is a regular car charger just
like the ones you've seen out there on
the market the reason I chose to do a
review of this one is because it's a
little bit more than your regular car
charger first off this is compatible
with fast charging it's able to give 2.4
amps out of both ports at the same time
and this guy is all metal construction
and that should tell you a lot about the
build quality it really does feel pretty
solid now this car charger is probably
heavier than the regular ones you've
used before but there's a reason for
that one being this is all metal
construction and the last time I checked
metal is heavier than plastic so that's
number one and number two and this is
the reason I personally got it
this is a window glass hammer it's
constructed strong and heavy enough to
break glass with that said the main
reason I love this guy is its
practicality most of the glass breakers
are made to be stored away in a glove
compartment
which could be hard to reach in some
cases but all the secretly reports are
made to be an arm's length of the driver
which means the time you would have
spent trying to reach for a glass
breaker from your glove box can be used
to concentrate on getting out of the car
since this little guy will be in your
arms length now that's practical anyways
beauty is in the hands of the beholder
and I personally think it looks
beautiful what do you think it actually
lights up when you plug it in as you can
see it down there the Sakho that you are
seeing down there that's
and I actually like that it blends in
with the color of my stereo that's the
part for me I was able to get a full
charge from 15% on my LG g3 in under two
hours during my testing I should have
started with this but in the Box you get
the thank-you card a user manual which
actually shows you how to hold it and
how to use it in the way that will be
easier to break the glass and actually
you get the actual product so with all
that said there's only one con that I
found about this guy at least for me not
all the time but sometimes I was having
trouble for it to stay connected
I have to twist it or put it in the same
way for you to be able to work which is
kind of inconvenient so thank you for
watching this video don't forget to
subscribe like my video with your
comments down below if you have any and
I will see you in the next video I will
leave the link to this product in the
description section below if you wanna
go check it out and yeah I will see you
in the next video peace
