these are the aah 45 bluetooth
headphones and speaker and the reason I
really wanted to share this with you
guys is because they are not like any I
have ever had before these are part
headphones and part bluetooth speaker
all Schlesser speaker skills it has a
speaker on the side and one on the other
side
I don't know anyways you can use them
like regular and headphones and if you
feel like sharing what you're listening
to with whoever is around you you just
flick a switch and tada
everyone around you can hear what you
are listening to kind of like this this
is you listening to music in headphones
mode
and this is what people around you will
hear if you have them in speaker mode
and if you have them in speaker mode
this is what you will hear if you're
wearing the headphones on your ears
pretty cool right okay so as headphones
they sound it pretty good for their
price the best is there a nut
overpowering meets and not bad in eyes
are also pretty good overall I think
they sound surprisingly good for their
price at the speaker they are not the
best but definitely better than your
phone speaker with that said I highly
recommend wearing the headphones around
your neck if you're going to use them as
a speaker or put them on a table or hang
them on something and this is mainly
because when they are in speaker mode
and you have them on your ears all you
will hear is really hollow rebar being
sound and nothing good and this is
because they they turn off the inside
drivers and all you hear other drivers
facing outwards it's not a very pleasing
sound I think these are pretty cool
headphones and they kind of look and
feel pretty cheap most especially those
buttons but let's not forget they are
cheap headphones for the sound equality
they give you most especially in the
headphone mode I've had them for over
two months or so and I've been using
them not as much as my kids because they
love them too
and so far they're holding up pretty
good so maybe the not so bad I mean time
hotel they are also not the most
comfortable headphones out there but
this might also be because I have never
found any on here headphones to be
comfortable enough for me to wear them
for over an hour or so so if someone who
wears on here headphones might find them
okay but to me they are not very
comfortable to wear for over an hour
anyways my favorite thing about these
headphones is just
being able to just take off your
headphones you to be wearing them but
you have to do something else just being
able to check them off and do whatever
you have to do but on the flip of a
switch you can still listen to your
YouTube video or Netflix or whatever
you're listening to with the headphones
of your head that's I think that's a
pretty pretty cool idea
there are kind of bulky in that way just
because they have to push to put those
extra drivers in there and I feel like
it could be implemented if we
implemented a little bit better but I
think it's a pretty pretty cool idea
yeah it's pretty cool and what do you
guys think um I have a link to these
headphones in the description section
below so make sure you go check them out
on Amazon and see what other people are
saying about them because they have some
pretty cool unique reviews over there so
make sure you go check it out you know
my people might mention something I
haven't mentioned here so anyways thanks
for watching this one I liked it if you
liked it share it and I will see you in
the next one peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
