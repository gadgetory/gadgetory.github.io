welcome to another sound battle where we
let speakers speak for themselves and
today we are taking the sound battle out
side and with us we'll be bringing the
srs XP 41 going up against this the JBL
extreme - as usual i will be using a
high quality binaural microphone so for
the best experience please use
headphones I'll be placing the speakers
above 40 feet away from the sound
recorder that binaural microphone and
this is just so since we're trying to
test for sound quality and how loud they
can get we'll be praying the speakers
play will be playing the speakers that
100% volume through all the samples but
I also just wanted to say that it was a
little bit windy every now and then out
there but again those that if those are
the conditions that you will be finding
outside if you're going to be mostly
using the speaker's outdoors so it's
kind of appropriate so you can kind of
hear how these peers through the wind
and whatever you might find outside but
yes let's go outside and find out how
they sound like
and there you have it
if you are looking for the loudest of
the two like every DB counts the XP 41
is your guy it's louder than the JBL
extreme - I missed not by a lot but it's
a little bit louder I think my DB give
me a DB difference of 1 DB between the
two so it's not a lot but X the X P 41
is louder than the JBL extreme - on the
other hand if sound equality is your
main point here the Xtreme two is taking
that weight here it does a good job
maintaining its sound equality even when
we are playing them that loud outdoors
it's still contain maintains a sound
quality which is really really nice to
see so personally I've been using the
extreme - a lot more in comparison to
the XP 41 outside if I'm going to be
doing anything outside I feel like I
brought the extreme - more than I have
brought the XP falling one and that's
because it's robust I mean this one is
robust - but also I do like it sound
quality how it maintains its best
performance in the hiset also you know
and for speaker that does not have any
kind of outdoor indoor mold stuff like
that it's it's pretty pretty good I
would recommend the extreme - if you
know you're working at this - but on the
other hand if loudness is what you're
looking for that every DB counts the
extra 41 it is if the price if you're in
a tight budget and every dollar counts I
feel like the XP 41 is always pretty
much a little bit lower in price in
comparison to the extreme - so that's
another reason to go with the XP 41 but
otherwise if you're basing this off of
just sound Wow
or loudness again louder better sound
quality so yes it's up to you to decide
I would like to know what you guys think
about the two speakers in this outdoor
comparison thank you for watching this
I'll put the links to speakers down in
the description section below so you can
kind of check out their current pricing
that they have on them right now they
could be on sale you never know
wait the links them in the description
section below if you're new here
subscribe if you're not new thank you
like the like the video if you liked it
leave a dislike if you didn't like it I
just want to give some sort of feedback
from you because you watch the video so
why not yeah thanks for watching again I
will see you in the next video peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
