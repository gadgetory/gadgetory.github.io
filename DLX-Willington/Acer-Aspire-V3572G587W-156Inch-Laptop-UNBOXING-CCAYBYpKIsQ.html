the unboxing of the Acer Aspire V 3 5 7
2 G and this is the Platinum version on
the box there's nothing cool we just
shipped from Amazon there's another box
inside the box yeah I ordered this too
in the same order that's why you shipped
in here on the box this is how it looks
like let's say I should probably check
this so you can read it like that that's
how it looks like that side and this is
how it looks like this side it says 15
right I'm not sure what V 15mins which
is the same thing here but I don't know
hope is what we ordered
I think that's the series or and there's
a seal right here like you can see and
on it it says check contents if seal is
broken in case this is working they're
saying you should kind of wonder why so
it wasn't broken in my case so I think I
open it the wrong way
there is this is the charger it comes
with a charger like you know we all
expect is a charger right there there's
you know the cable that goes pretty much
with a charge I believe and they sealed
battery for the laptop he doesn't come
install it into your laptop
nothing else there and since they use
our menu to set up guide and here's the
laptop itself take it off as Amazon
letting me know that my package has been
delivered cool a little late but hey
it's cool and ya might watch my watch
tells me this is the user manual this is
the startup guide this is the user
manual man this looks cool yeah like you
can see there the batteries naked
there's no battery installed yet I'm
gonna go ahead and just turn it on for
you guys like that there's a spy of V 3
5 7 2 G 15.6 inch and it's running
NVIDIA GeForce 8 4 0 M the right says it
right on there the I fight for let's go
ahead and see these other stuff that
comes in here just take it out and have
a feel for it this is the battery this
learn how to install it without looking
at the manual ok configure

the manual its installed unless if it
starts it doesn't then might be wrong
