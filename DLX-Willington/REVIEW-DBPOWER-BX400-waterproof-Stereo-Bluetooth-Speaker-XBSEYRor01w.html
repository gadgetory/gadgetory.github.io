the review of the bx 400 from DB power
now this is a portable bluetooth speaker
from DB power which plays music via
bluetooth or from a TF card or call it a
micro SD card all through hardwiring
using the aux input now what's different
about this speaker is that it's a
portable waterproof bluetooth speaker
which basically means is made for
outdoors but before we get into details
about it let's see what you get in the
box you get the speaker itself a user
manual and micro USB for charging the
audio cable and the belt clip now as you
can see this speaker looks pretty
portable and fills looks premium I would
say they really did a good job designing
it it looks awesome this thing is pretty
straightforward to connect to your phone
and during the testing I was able to get
about four and a half hours of playtime
at its highest volume which means if you
are listening at the average volume you
could easily get six hours of playtime
that DB power claims the sound is pretty
good to give you a better understanding
of how it sounds I compared it to my g3
both the speaker and my gift we were set
at maximum volume four feet away from
the recorder take a listen that's my
phone
that's the bx 400 my phone be x 400
I personally found the sound to be good
considering the price range the speaker
is in and the features you get including
waterproof and speaking of waterproof I
did testing for this too now DB power
does not specify to what extent does the
waterproofness low or and so I said not
here before you expose this speaker to
water make sure this is shut tight
otherwise um yeah you're gonna lose it
okay let's go
I'll motor the Bluetooth life a three to
tell the bluetooth device is connected
successfully i will leave the link to
the product in the description section
