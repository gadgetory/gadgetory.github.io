and welcome to another sound battle
well that speakers speak for themselves
in the battlefield today we have the
Sony SRS XP 30 versus the JBL flip for a
video a lot of you have requested to see
in this battle the speakers will be
playing at 70 percent volume extra based
on XP 30 will be off for the first
couple songs but for the rest of the
songs I will have it on I'll be using a
high quality binaural microphone so
please use headphones for the best
experience with that said let's hear the
speaker's speak Oh God comes into space
oh happy to make time oh do you have to
win me Oh give me another round
Jill disco ball but I have to be me
never would anger
please
so maybe just
so the XP 30 is louder and more powerful
than the flip for it has a way better
best performance which goes deeper and
even at maximum volume it retains more
best than the flip four and this is the
main area where these two differ from
each other but the sony also has
somewhat of a better stereo separation
than it would fall but this is something
that you can only notice when speakers
are in close proximity to you the highs
on XP 30 are not as sharp as they are on
the food form which makes it sound a
little softer than the flick 4 but the
difference here is not that huge the
flip 4 is a great speaker for its size
but for these two I think you get a
better sound out of XP 30 than the Swift
for most especially if you don't mind
playing around with EQ but honestly even
if you're not into accuse the ability to
switch between two different sound
settings on a push of a button is really
handy it makes the speaker accommodate
people who like lots of bass by turning
on the extra bass or people who don't
like it and you just turn it off
but that's just me and sound is so
subjective I would like to hear what you
guys have to say about this too in the
comment section glow if you're new here
don't forget to subscribe so you don't
miss out on the new upcoming videos
thanks for watching this one I will
see you in the next one peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
