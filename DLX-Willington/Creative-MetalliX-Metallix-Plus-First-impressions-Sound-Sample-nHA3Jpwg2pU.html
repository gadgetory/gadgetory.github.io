and like you've seen I've just unboxed
two speakers from creative so those of
you who are not familiar with them for
some reason they are the makers of the I
roar sound blaster roar - I will go and
the creative mover to see so they are
really popular when it comes to speakers
they make a lot of other stuff too but
that's the stuff I'm interested in that
I bought from them and they also have a
lot of other speakers that I don't have
here but those are the few that I have
shared on this channel and now these are
their newest ones and ways at the end of
this video I will be letting you listen
to these two speakers I'm a few sound
samples so you kind of know how they
sound like but I do want you to let me
know what's because would you want to
see up against any of these guys just
let me know in the comment section below
and if you've not subscribed why not
this was released like leave at the end
of 2017 and this one here is newly
released this might be the first video
you see of the creative metallics plus
anyways they sent me them to me free of
charge so thank you creative force being
nice enough to send me this this is just
more of my first impressions because I
just open them I thought I would just
share with you guys so this is the
creative metallics around the speaker so
this one has a TF card where you can put
in your card with music on it and play
music off of that instead of
using Bluetooth or auxiliary Ziller I
could never say that word the aux input
anyways on the card you can play mp3
files you can play flag files and you
can also play it well files so pretty
cool and here you have your judging
power to the aux input the on and off
button standard and also the mode also I
think this one also has FM radio on it
but from what I've read you have to use
you have to use the the charging cord in
order to get FM radio this is this is
what acts as an antenna so it has to be
connected in order to get radio on there
so it's kind of a bummer I feel like
they should have not done it that way
but it probably helps with a better
signal or something like that so it's a
pretty robust speaker as far as it's
pretty hard I think this is hard
aluminum like aluminum right here so
it's not something that is going to
break pretty easy and it feels pretty
solid really really good build it has
those bottom feet the rubbery rubbery or
sticky sticky pad at the bottom it won't
be moving around so that's pretty cool
it has a 37 millimeter driver and a
hidden PR passive radiator is in there
somewhere just hidden you can see the
post airports on here that will help is
still vibrate and then for the metallics
plus it also has the standard control
buttons on here is the power button
bluetooth play the volume rockers and
also the pops auxilary input in the
charging port back here this one does
not have a fame radio on it
and it also it does not have the ATF
card spot so for those of you who is not
an insane anything Bixby back off
that's Bigsby listening to me it also
it's also aluminum just like this guy
right here these are like sister-brother
speakers this is just a bigger version
and for this one we have two drivers it
doesn't say what size they are I
couldn't find the size of the drivers on
here but from looking at them I don't
think they are any more than 35 i
outside more than more like 30 or 32
millimeter drivers then it also has a PR
in the center here so yes those are the
speakers pretty cool I think they look
pretty good
this reminds me well I don't think I
have a speaker that looks like this
but as far sighs it's about the size of
the UM the flip three JBL flip three
actually have the flip ball right here
so the football is a little bit bigger
than the flip three but that's how it
compares so it's more of the size of the
flip three but if you want we can
compare it to the flip for the flip that
we just want you guys to let me know
what you would like me to put it against
and then for this one here it's more of
the size of their the Sony it's every
sixty ten it's a little bit bigger I
mean this guy here is a little bit
bigger but that's something that I
really really want to compare it to it
also has a PR here so they are about the
same foam fracture as far as sound
they are both 360 sound stickers the
only difference is that Sony was able to
give you this here so you're able to
play it as a directional speaker which
is a plus I feel like they should have
done the same thing here but they did
not so yeah we can pull it against that
and we can also compare this to the
but to see to the creative metallics but
it's up to you guys I want you to let me
know down in a comment section below
what you would want to see a battle
against which of the two so we might
compare just the two of them to see how
big the difference is as far as sound
comparison between the two of them I do
like the speakers
I think I'm interested in hearing on how
they are going to sample I have not
listened to them yet either
so I think I'm gonna do that and you
guys can let me know about 125 and
connect what you want for me to do so
yes I'm gonna be playing them and you
guys can listen to them and then let me
know in your comments section below
what speakers you would like to see
battle against them please let me know
in the comment section below I love you
all and I will see you in the next video
enjoy the sample music why is my beard
always so itchy
you have to admit
yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
