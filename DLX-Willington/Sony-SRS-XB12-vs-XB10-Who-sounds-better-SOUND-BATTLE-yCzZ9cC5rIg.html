here and welcome to another sound battle
where we let speakers speak for
themselves in the battlefield today we
have the Sony S aureus xB 10 going up
against the new guy the SRS XB 12 and no
there is no XB 11 according to Sony
there isn't a huge difference between
the features and specs of these two guys
except for that the SRS xB 12 is
completely waterproof now and it doesn't
have NFC which is weird cause Sony has
always put NFC on almost everything they
make I'm at least as far as speakers go
so seeing a speaker with no NFC from
Sony it's just weird
I wonder why anyways how do they compare
sound wise I'm as usual I will be using
a high quality binaural microphone so
for the best experience please use
headphones with that said let's hear the
speaker's speak
I'd like to do something crazy
we should try to live
and surprisingly there's a pretty
significant improvement in sound if you
ask me it's kind of hard to tell most
especially at lower volumes but the SRS
XP 12 is definitely doing better in the
lower frequencies the XP 10 might sound
like it has more bass coming out of it
but that's because it's pushing out the
up of myths and disguising them as
actual bears which actually just makes
it sound muddy and distorts a lot most
especially at maximum volume it's just
unusable
well as the best out of the Esk the XP
12 might not come out as loud but it's
actual
best with some real substance to it I
mean it's not going to sound exactly
like their other bigger speakers out
there but for the size of the speaker
and the best that is coming out of it
which is actual like substance bears
coming out of it I think they did a
pretty good job and not only that even
at maximum volume I don't know if you
were hearing that the sound coming out
of the SRS XB 12 is clean and like real
sound it does not distort as much as the
XB XB 10 here so i am really happy with
what they did with the SROs XB 12 here I
think Sony is onto something here and
the speakers that close to the same when
it comes to loudness maybe the XB 10
might actually sound maybe a tiny bit
louder but considering how muddy and
unusable maximum volume is on the SOS XB
10 i I would give this Weiner its waning
even in that department as far as
loudness so I mean I don't like this
strap the new strap is I don't like it I
understand why they made it this way
it's just so
you can actually hook it around
something so I understand why they made
it this way but I feel like there are
other alternatives that they should have
taken instead of using this you know
button style thing I hate it it's hard
to play with you have to have nails and
all that so I don't like that I don't
like this strap I don't like that they
don't have NFC on here but you don't
really use NFC that often so all in all
I'm happy with the SRS XP 12 in
comparison to the SRS XP 10 very happy I
think they did a pretty good job anyways
let me know what you think about the SRS
XP 12 like the video if you liked it
subscribe if you haven't yet I'll put
the links to these speakers in the
description section below if you want to
pick one up if you use those links it
helps out the channel I'm thank you for
watching I will see you in the next
video peace
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
