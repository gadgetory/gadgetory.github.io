Willington here and welcome to another
sound battle when i wheeler speakers
speak for themselves in a battlefield
today we have the I roar go going up
against the charge 3 as usual the
speakers at 6 feet away from the sound
recorder and they are playing an 80%
volume now during this test I have roar
on the go turned on so put your
headphones on and let's hear the
speaker's speak
I've got something to say oh I'm happy
to me down but you have to break it down
uptown around till the disco ball pops
but I have to be me everyone you see is
Miss maze don't tell me
to what
okay so the speakers have spoken my ears
have heard this is my judgment when I
said that goal I am actually referring
to these speakers so take note with a go
on its default sound profile which means
with the war and the EQ futures turned
off that is Sol little difference
between the two speakers that go has
slightly better highs and the judge 3
has slightly better lows which makes
them pretty much droll
but if you turn the raw on on the goal
then the judge 3 starts trailing a
little bit and the goal has an open
bright sound compared to the charge 3
and the fact that you are able to change
to different sound settings depending on
your different sound preferences makes
the speaker more accommodating to all
sorts of listeners so in my opinion
sound wise I think the goal takes the
lead here what do you think I would
really appreciate a comment down below
and like if you liked the video
subscribe to my channel if you're not a
subscriber it really helps out a lot and
thanks for watching this one and I will
see you in the next one peace
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
