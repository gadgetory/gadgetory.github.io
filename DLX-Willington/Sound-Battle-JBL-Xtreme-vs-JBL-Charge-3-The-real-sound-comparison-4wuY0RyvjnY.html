welcome to another sound battle where we
let speakers speak for themselves in a
battlefield today we have the JBL charge
3 going up against its bigger brother
the JBL extreme i call it a bigger
brother just because it looks like a
blown-up version of the charge 3 with
some minor differences here and there I
would take this moment to remind you
that if you have any speakers that you
would like to see them battle here live
them in a comment section below and
after you do don't forget to subscribe
because that's the only way that you
know when I upload your requested video
as usual the speakers are six feet away
from the sound recorder and they are
playing at 70 percent volume without
wasting Anam of your precious time put
your headphones on and let's hear the
speaker's speak you have to win
just breaking down - you're with me
uptown dancing all around the disco ball
pops but I have to be me everyone can
see and anger is misplaced
don't tell me
Oh
never count the stuff
you
okay so the speakers have spoken my ears
have heard this is my judgement as you
might have guessed the JBL extreme is a
louder speaker and it has heavier bass
for heavy bass lovers you cannot go
wrong with this one on the other hand
the judge three is not as loud but it
has a better balance between the highs
mids and lows this actually almost no
mids
in the JBL extreme so with the judge
three you're getting the whole package
with just enough bass compared to the
extreme where you're getting just the
highs and the over-exaggerated bass so
in my opinion the church 3 is a better
sounding speaker but for people who only
care about the bass you know all about
the bass but a bass no treble the
extreme is the speaker you are looking
for but those were my ears what do you
