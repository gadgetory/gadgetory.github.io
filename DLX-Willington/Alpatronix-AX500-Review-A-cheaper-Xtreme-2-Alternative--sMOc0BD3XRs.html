today we are taking a close look at the
ax 500 from Alper tronics and what
features does it have and how does it
sound like stay tuned okay so what do
you get in the box
I'm a US PC charging cable which is
awesome an auxiliary cable the paperwork
stuff and lastly the ax 500 itself with
the caring strap which is nice and
looking at the speaker the front grille
gives it somewhat of an old-school vibe
but elsewhere it actually does look
somewhat modern and it does feel robust
and rugged this is all plastic and this
garbs here I believe are to protect that
pr's the passive radiators are in here
just trying to keep away those curious
hands but the speaker does feel robust
and it doesn't feel like it's something
that is going to break easily
looking around the speaker in the back
here is where you will find a USB C
charging port which is really really
nice an aux input and a USB port to play
tunes off of a USB flash drive if you
want to feel like not so many people do
that anymore but if you want to you have
it I'm on top here is where you will
find a microphone for making clothes the
battery indicator LED lights the only
three I feel like for would have made at
least a lot more sense but really three
anyways they also have the status
indicator right here right here I'm your
basic control buttons and lastly the EQ
button to switch between two different
sound settings
the speaker is IP x5 rated it's not
completely waterproof I feel like they
should have made it I px7 at least from
the way it looks like like robust but
it's only IP x5 writer so be careful
with it it will take a splash of water
but do not submerge it it's running
Bluetooth 4.2 to woofers and to tweeters
with a total power output of 40 watts
you can get up to 10 hours of playtime
at about 50% volume
at maximum volume you are only looking
at two to three hours of playtime and it
takes me about three to four hours to
fully charge a fully drained battery the
speaker also has TW s through Wireless
Stereo which means you can pair two of
them up to play in stereo mode for a
bigger sound experience and speaking of
sound how about we hear how it sounds
like for reference here I will be
dropping in the extreme to every now and
then so we can hear how the a x500
compares to the extreme - so yes watch
out for that I will be using a high
quality binaural microphone as usual so
for the best experience please use
headphones with that said let's hear the
speaker's speak
I don't know how this day it seems to me
that everything has gone so fast each
day it feels like I miss the I
don't know how this day it seems to me
that everything has gone so fast each
day feels like I miss the ball please
come my way
please come my way I will need you I
think it's time to get out of my
okay so that's that but before I give
you my opinion on how that speaker
sounds how about we hear the tws mode
how does two of them sound together and
to connect them this is what you gotta
do
turn off the Bluetooth on your phone if
you already had the speaker's connected
up double tap the power button they will
make a sound after a couple of seconds
when they are connected turn bluetooth
back on and connect to the blinking one
and that's it next time you turn both of
them on they will just connect instantly
it's only the first time that you have
to go through those steps in order for
them to initialize that connection
between them anyways how do they sound
like here we go
okay so if we are to directly compare it
to the JBL extreme to the extreme to
comes out better because mainly because
of the better best performance most
especially at maximum volume where the a
X 500 is carrying a bass quite a bit but
if we compare that in consideration with
the price difference between the two
where you can almost get two of these
for the price of the extreme two I think
the ax 500 does how to pretty good for
the price of it I honestly wasn't really
expecting that much best to come out of
it but it really did surprise me I mean
has good highs thanks to those tweeters
they have in there the mids are also
quite inert good I'm it's not as
balanced as the the extreme two you know
but like I said price difference is also
really really big between these two guys
so I think for the price that they are
selling this guy right here it's a
pretty pretty good choice much
especially if you don't have the money
but you are looking for something that
is close to the JBL extreme - I also
don't know if you guys notice but this
is actually a little bit louder than the
JBL extreme - so if you're looking for
the loudest of the two yeah the ax 500
is actually a little bit louder the only
thing I wish they had done is maybe make
this guy IPX
seven rated so it's completely
waterproof like the JBL extreme - but
other than that I feel like it's a
pretty good competitor to the extreme -
most especially if you do consider the
price difference so and if you have the
money and you're able to buy two of this
I think they do sound really really good
in stereo mode it could be just because
I like stereo but I do enjoy when they
are playing together in stru your mom
that was pretty pretty good thanks two
outputs are onyx for hooking me up with
our speakers they also gave me a code
actually I don't think I'll yeah they
give me a code I'll put it in the
description section below down there i'm
also leave the link to the speakers down
there if you want to check it out the
code would drop the price to about $99
or something like that so really really
nice I like doing down there anyways
thank you for watching I will see you in
the next video peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
