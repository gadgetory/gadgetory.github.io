with another review this is a USB 3.1 on
hub with seven ports by one by one by
one by one made by one by one by one by
one that's kind of cool now this little
guy comes nicely packaged in a box looks
beautiful it's made out of aluminum in
really feels solid it comes with a power
adapter the velcro tape the user manual
in the warranty card it has an LED light
which shows the power and activity if
something is going on or files are being
transferred which is nice there's not
really much to talk about this hub so we
are just going to go right into the
speed test i will be using a PC running
Windows 10 32 gigs of ram and a quad
core i7 processor so I'm going to go
ahead and plug the card into my computer
and let's see how fast it goes
all right that's the result for that now
let's grab the card into the hub
and let's see how fast it goes as you
can see there's not really that much
difference in speed i leave the link to
this product in the description section
below if you are interested in it and
please do not forget to subscribe leave
your comments below or questions and I
will see you in the next video thanks
for watching peace
you
oh
hmm
from Congo
very something to you
an elderly Florida lady that her
shopping nakhon returning to her car on
four males in the act of leaving with
her vehicle she dropped her shopping
bags and drew her handgun proceeding to
scream at the top of her lungs I had a
gun and I know how to use it get out of
the car before men didn't wait for a
second read it got out and ran like mad
the lady's somewhat shaken then
proceeded to lower her shopping bags
into the back of the car and got into
the driver's seat she was so shaken that
she cannot get her key into the ignition
she tried and tried and then she
realized why it was for the same reason
that she had wondered why there was a
football frisbee and 2 12 packs of beer
in the front seat a few minutes later
she found her own car part 4 or 5 spaces
farther down she loaded her bags into
the car and drove to the police station
to report her mistake the sergeant to
whom she told the story couldn't stop
laughing he planted to the other end of
the counter where for pale men were
recording a carjacking by a mad elderly
woman described as white less than five
feet tall glasses curly white hair and
carrying a large handgun no charges were
filed the moral of the story if you're
going to have a senior moment make it
memorable that's funny i think i've read
on i know i'd rather look for two but it
gets
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
