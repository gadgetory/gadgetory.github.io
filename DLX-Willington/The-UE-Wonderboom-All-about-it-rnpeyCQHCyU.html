this is the Wonder boom in case you're
wondering this is the newest speaker
from Ultimate Ears writing time to raise
for the money with the all-new JB
elsewhere for like the other boom
speakers from UE this is - a waterproof
speaker has 360 sound made possible by -
full range 40 millimeter drivers
promising 10 hours of play time it has a
fabric grille like it's bigger siblings
and around the speaker the first thing
you'll see are the big volume rockers
like we've come to expect from UE and on
top you'll find the UE logo which
actually looks pretty pretty you will
use it to play pause and skip to the
next track but not the previous track
and you will also find the power button
and the LED indicator up here on top and
around the back is where you will find
the charging port what notice something
missing this is where you would usually
find the aux input but UE decided to go
Apple and ditched it
there is no aux input with this speaker
you can only use this with bluetooth now
as much as I like having the option I'm
personally not pissed about it but I
know some people who won't be happy
about this but again Apple did the same
thing and people seem to be over it let
me know what you think about that down
below if you buy two of these you can
pair them up for a bigger sound just by
holding down the UE logo and both
speakers with no need of any app just
like the JBL connect and connect plus
the only main difference here is that
you can't separate channels for each
speakers for studio sound experience
which makes it kind of pointless for me
because that's like the only reason I
pair two speakers but if you're looking
for a big
sound you can still do that you just
won't get this to your output so most of
us were not happy but the footfall could
not connect with its older siblings with
JBL connect well guess what Yui did the
same thing here you cannot connect this
speaker to its older siblings JBL
promised an update which we're still
waiting for I hope it comes out soon but
at least as of recording this video Yui
has not promised any kind of update to
make this possible I hope they do but
overall I like how the speaker looks
like it's so compact and I think it
doesn't look bad at all
I'll play some sound samples for you
guys here but before that let me know
what speakers you'd like to see a battle
against the Wonder boom in the upcoming
videos in this sample I'll play the
speaker at 70 percent volume and it's
being recorded with a high quality
binaural microphone so please listen
with headphones for a better and natural
sound let's go you have to
that's actually not bad the speaker is
actually louder than I expected
considering its size and don't quote me
on this but I'm pretty sure this sounds
better than the bloom - we'll definitely
do a sound battle bit to you but I think
that's my guess I find the sound to be
clean
good highs good meds and the best is a
lot better than what they did on a boom
- no too much of honking here thank God
and of course I'll be doing a lot more
listening to the speaker with a bunch
more songs but as of right now I think I
like what I'm hearing but that's just me
and sound is so subjective I would like
to hear what you think about this
speaker in the comment section below
please drop me a comment there tell me
what you think and if you haven't yet
make sure you subscribe to the channel
so you don't miss out on the upcoming
great videos there's so many new
speakers and I just can't wait but that
concludes this video please don't forget
to leave a like if you liked the video
leave me a comment down below and I will
see you soon peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
