and welcome to another sound battle
well that speakers speak for themselves
in the battlefield today we have the
mega bomb going up against the revolve
plus in the battle the speakers will be
playing at 60 and 100 percent volume
I'll be using a high quality binaural
microphone so for the best experience
put your headphones on and let's hear
the speaker's speak yeah yeah cannibal
for one minute right on got this little
bowl I cannot stop but ever win and
don't you ever get in my way the quad up
in your face teamwork is so much in the
dirty street those super-sensitive
adrenaline burst when you sir please no
system medicine work so I can get a damn
professional super bubble stop them
certified subscribe get first prize gold
better get a man in a gonna fall for one
minute let's go I got this let it burn
let some petrol it did / yes it did you
ever doubt this is wonderful my plate
with your message your her right to the
hurts mine for a break with the ambition
you know I'm gonna get it every time
light-hearted aside so bright
yes or no let go let go let go and see
my name in lights and open it alright
let's go
I never would be
ha
ah
and
oh man so as far as loudness is not
really a winner but speakers are equally
loud but I will say that the revolve
plus is a little bit more room selling
as moderate volumes the highs and both
speakers are not bad but at maximum
volumes the highs on the revolve sound
really bad with no definition at all in
some songs
in contrast to the highs the best
performance is without a doubt better on
the revolve plus the megaphone pushes
out upper base while the revolve pushes
out real lower best myths and book
speakers are ok and for those who love
360 sound the revoke plus does a really
better job than the mega boom like
literally no matter where you are around
the speaker's even above it the sound
still sounds the same in the end I think
the revolve plastics elite for me here
it's got rich sound with better bass not
to mention the true 360 sound experience
although the highest kind of soft at
maximum volume in some songs if you keep
the volume a couple notches down it's
not that bad but that's just me and
sound is so subjective I'd like to hear
what you have to say about these two in
the comment section below don't forget
to subscribe if you haven't yet I love
you all and I will see you in the next
one peace
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
