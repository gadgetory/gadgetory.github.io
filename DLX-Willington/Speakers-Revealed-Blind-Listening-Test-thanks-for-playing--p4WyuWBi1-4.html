everything right Oh
some of you were really off but a lot of
you guessed everything so right like
like Werner if you just own all these
speakers and you just know how they
sound or it was complete guesswork but
here we go
can you guess and there we go yeah so a
B C D yeah so a lot of you interestingly
were able to guess this and it's just
amazing all these people here got it
right good job good job good job you
guys
somehow I don't know if it was
completely luck or like guesswork or you
guys just have these speakers and you
knew I don't know you guys nailed it so
that's pretty sweet and then for other
people that did not guess right I just
wanna say thank you for playing
I think it was cool I enjoyed the video
if you're the kind of person also who
enjoyed this kind of video let me know
if we if you want me to make more videos
like this I think that would be that'll
be cool just let me know then maybe we
can make it every once in a while you
know you once or twice a year or
something like that I don't know just
let me know to enjoy it this video I
think it was cool I liked reading
comments but I didn't want to comment on
them just because I'm like some of them
have required me to like tell you you
know because if I were guessing and tell
you nervous and like I'm not a like
comment I'm just gonna keep my eyes away
but I was seeing you guys comments
coming in like you guys right you got
right you got wrong Oh
would you switch this over they'll be
fine but as far as which ones
sounded better I don't think anybody did
the Yui did it did you actually yeah I
see one here well I bought four see yeah
so Davis thinks C's do this but a lot of
you didn't think C was AB is actually I
think C got most of the everybody was
saying C is the worst not everybody
excuse me most people which is kind of
interesting
but the thing is with you is some
signature you either love it or you
don't like it at all because it sounds
so far different from these other
speakers for some signature the child
forgot most of the like favorite votes
and then this came second they charge
three and then this one and then you got
I think the one that I told you about
you is like there was like the one the
only one you got or something like that
but it got a lot of the down votes like
no I don't like that one like the worst
sounding one you got a lot of those
really interesting makes me wonder what
kind of people listen to watch my videos
here Jimmy those people who are just
kidding I love you guys but yeah what
what the other thing interesting is that
even if someone did not get all this
right they were able to pin point out
that the C like almost everybody was
like yup see easy even if they switch
these around or something like that
the only buddy me knew that C was UE so
that was really interesting I really
enjoyed this video just reading those
comments it was really really fun but
yeah if you'd like me to do these kind
of videos more something like that if
you enjoyed it let me know down there so
we can work on more videos like this cuz
that was fun for me just reading the
comments just reading everything always
really fun to do but yeah if you'd like
us to do this again you know place it so
many times I
just let me know please but also if
there are other kind of games or videos
that you would like me to do that
not about speakers off the about
speakers but something something
different let me know you know I guess I
want to get into some other things that
won't be focused mainly on just you know
sound battles and speaker reviews so it
could be something else about speakers
or it could be something completely else
that you guys would enjoy to watch here
just to kind of mix things up a little
bit yeah just let me know I'm telling
you guys because I know nobody else is
going to watch this if they're not like
subscribers people who like my videos or
who all is coming back so I can ask you
guys to let me know what you think you
know that because I know I don't think
your strange is gonna be on this video
at all so yes as usual I do appreciate
you guys always commenting and thank you
for playing this game with me even if
you didn't get it right
thank you for playing you guys were
really really awesome I wasn't expecting
that that many comments and you know
that kind of feedback that you guys gave
me on that video so I really really do
appreciate that and thank you for all
the good nice things that you've always
said to me in those comment sections
down there I really do appreciate it and
oh tomorrow Thursday is gonna be
Thanksgiving and I wanna say Happy
Thanksgiving to you all eat lots and
lots of Turkey and I'm gonna be eating a
lot but yeah watch what you eat but you
know this one day that you get to eat a
lot of turkey so you should eat lots of
Turkey because it's Thanksgiving and
that's what you do right because for
those who don't like turkey and begin
that is they called vegan vegans

vegans and what's the word other people
who don't eat meat this is another one
this is a vegan and I'm gonna google it
