welcome to another sound battle where we
let speakers speak for themselves and in
a battle field today we have the UE boom
- going up against the sony srs XB 3 if
you have any speakers that you'd like to
see them battle here leave them in a
comment section below and I will get to
them as soon as possible and don't
forget to subscribe because that's the
only way that you'll know when I upload
your requested video as usual the
speakers are 6 feet away from the sound
recorder and they are playing at 80
percent volume without wasting any more
of your precious time put your
headphones on and let's hear the
speaker's speak I'm happy to make down
my business do you have to win
is misplaced
you
okay so the speakers have spoken my ears
have heard this is my judgment the xp3
is louder but also has a richer sound
with some highs maids in some base on
the other hand though the boom too has a
better stereo output surprisingly and
handles the highs and the mids
a little bit better which leaves me with
a Sony as the winner because of its rich
sound you know you have a little bit of
everything the bass studio and some meds
so what do you guys think I'd really
appreciate your comment down below and
like if you liked the video subscribe to
my channel for more awesome vids and I
will see you in the next one peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
