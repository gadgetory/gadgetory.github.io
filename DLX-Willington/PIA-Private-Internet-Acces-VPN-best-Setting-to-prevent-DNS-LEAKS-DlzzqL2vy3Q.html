here and today I will be talking to the
pif VPN users private Internet access
users now with all the DNS leaks going
around all over the internet and people
having trouble on their IPs being
displayed in places they should not be
over the Internet I thought I would make
a video to the PIAA users like me so you
know which settings you really need to
have turn on on your computer in order
to have privacy and making sure that
you're not having any leaks even if
you're using a VPN so we will get to
that it's so obviously the first thing
you want to do is go get into your
settings that you can get to by right
clicking on that icon on the tray and go
to settings this is that but what you
need is going into the Advanced Settings
if this is how you are set up like this
you are not safe I mean you are safe
compared to most people who just go in
and without any VPN or proxy but you are
still not safe you can still show your
IP address in some cases alright so we
are about to change that making sure to
make sure your security is as high as it
can be so just live there this SS works
for me and the port forwarding just
leave that you know unchecked it's safer
to have it unchecked than it is when you
check it
the next thing down here is the VPN kill
switch now what does this do you can
only get to the Internet if you have the
VPN turned on without the VPN turn on
there is no internet on your computer
that's what that does there might be
times that you might forget so in case
you forget and go on you know online and
using the internet before activate
in that case you will be open to the
world
so this Killswitch just enables just
make sure that you can only go online if
you remember to turn on your VPN so I've
always left that one on now when you
turn it on you're going to get a warning
they just telling you that this one
might cause some connection issues and
will not work if you use more than one
network it of interface on your computer
simultaneously so let's say it can only
disable one connection so if you have a
VLAN connection and a wireless
connection it will disable one and one
will still be able to communicate so you
want to make sure that you're only using
one connection at a time so yeah just so
you know so the next one up is a D and a
SLIC protection now this is one the most
important of all now as you can tell by
what it's called the DNS leak protection
feature activates VPN DNS leak
protection this ensures that DNS
requests routed through the VPN that's
basically why it is you just make sure
that all the DNS you know requests from
all different websites and software's
out everything is just routed through
the tunnel nothing goes outside of the
tunnel so you do want to have that
checked now again they will give you
this warning right here or rather
letting you know that it would just
requires modifying the operating systems
network settings and in some cases can
cause connectivity issues but is not I
haven't had any problems maybe once
actually I had to uninstall the app and
reinstall it and it
to find which I'm glad it did because
for some reason this application that
does not auto update so as soon as I had
those problems I uninstalled it and
reinstalled it I got more features and
more connections here that I can use
compared to what I used to had have
before so I'm glad that happens but
that's off the topic anyways so yeah
they'll let you know that you might have
connection issues but like I said I've
been using it for over a year now and
I've only had one time recently that I
had to it wasn't connecting for some
reason so I had to uninstall it on the
app and reinstall it and it works great
so just go ahead and enable that and
there we have those two done and
basically that's so far good and then is
this one-way ipv6 leak protection
I mean it's ipv6 is not common right now
so most likely you don't need it but you
might so I usually will leave that one
on to just to ensure maximum protection
you know I know people are using it you
know the the the ipv6 is you know
getting bigger and bigger but it's not
something that's really big right now
yet because everyone is ipv4 at the
moment but yeah it's something that I
mean it doesn't hurt anything so you
just leave it leave that one connected
to just to ensure you know maximum
protection and that's basically it
that's basically it if you have all
these settings marked the wedding all
right now you are safe I can't say 100%
because it's the init you know things
change and people are always finding
ways but as of right now I have not had
problems with my connection with having
MS and I haven't had any leak leaks at
all sorry what you want to do is go
ahead and save and I'll actually go
online here and show do DNS leak test so
let's you
is one in this one oh come on
so this is what it's shown which is
obviously wrong so that's good and we
can do a standard taste and that's
basically still along us not me and
actually I wanted there's another place
here that I used this on right here and
is seen trying to find something and
also sing the the same thing so I'm
obviously proof right now none of this
is right this is the public IP that is
being shown this is the local IP that's
being shown and it's also wrong both of
these are wrong
um so yeah you do want to do those
settings and with all those sayings up
to right you will be all set please
thank you for watching do not forget to
subscribe to my channel for more awesome
awesome videos and I will see you in the
next one bye
so what we want to get to is the
settings and you know you can get to
those by left clicking on an icon right
