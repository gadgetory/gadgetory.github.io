with another unboxing video and today we
are unboxing the one by one bluetooth
disco LED dome light it has a long name
on Amazon and I didn't feel like saying
all those words but I put the link to it
in the description section below so you
can check that out if you're interested
but let's get to why we came to this
video seeing what comes with it and how
it looks like out of the box like I
usually say there's a box in a box this
is one that comes from the manufacturer
one by one and I delete the other box
was just from Amazon just for shipping
reasons so it's easier to open just
right there and there bubble up
everywhere and man I feel like this is
bigger than it looks on Amazon so
freaking being
okay so you get a power adapter right
here just like that
it's a gleeful you know connecting your
light to power source and this is the
remote that you get small state out of
here there is power sound play calls
back forward these are all the controls
I believe for this guy right here and it
comes with that battery thing that
you're supposed to pull out there so now
we should be able to work this is the
user manual for Super LED dome light all
right and you get your warranty
information right there you're supposed
to fill that out I believe and then send
it in to so they know you purchased this
summers a label there that shows this is
the top I'm gonna bother with that right
now but yeah that's beautiful it's so
click powerful on here it's freakin
awesome okay so there's your power input
and it looks like that's the mic not
sure if Mike is like you talking into it
and then it reacts to your voice I think
that's what it is and there's a speaker
I believe right here that's a speaker
I'm not so sure about we're going to
find out pretty soon when I plug it in
and infrared sensor right there there's
an LED light that I believe for you know
when you connect the Bluetooth and
that's about it yeah I'm going to plug
it in so we kind of see what happens
after that
system ready for Bluetooth connection
ready for device connection it tells you
stuff and my room when I'm filming from
right now is all covered in the
greatness of lights all right let me try
to connect it to my phone and see what
happens
and shows up here as QL 196 L so I'm
hoping is that one I'm gonna try it
Bluetooth connected there you go
Bluetooth connected so this thing it
sounds like it can play your music off
of your phone or you know a Bluetooth
device so that's kind of cool I'm gonna
play something here so we can see there
you go
yeah I guess he is a he gets loud you
know for being in the house just playing
you know music in the house it's not so
bad
alright guys so that's pretty much it
for the unboxing I'm going to be making
a review video after a bit of setup of
this slide and I will show you guys how
it works with you know with all these
settings on the remote and what I think
about it if I like it if I don't like it
or you know all that things so if you
really wanna see all of that make sure
you click on that video on the screen
right now make sure you subscribe to my
channel like the video if you liked it
the link to this product will be in the
description section below so make sure
you check that out and I will see you
guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
