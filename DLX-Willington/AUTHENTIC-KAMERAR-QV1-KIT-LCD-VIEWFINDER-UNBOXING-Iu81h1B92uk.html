another unboxing video in this one we
are going to be unboxing the camera QV 1
kit in here it comes with the LCD
viewfinder and a quick-release rail
system so right on the box usually
there's nothing exciting you know right
from amazon this is where i got it but
right on here as you can see nothing
really fun is going on so we'll just go
right ahead and open it and see how it
comes oh if your final fantasy box this
one is not as you can see it's kind of
beat up a little bit here about
hopefully nothing is damaged in the
inside okay it looks
it's really the box in a box as usual
it's nothing in that box so put it aside
and aim this box I believe we'll find
what we are waiting to see and it's
really tiny though it's doing it has a
rail system well not that doubt that
long so thank you 18inch there that's
how it looks like this how they pack it
and ride this is the viewfinder here so
wrapped up in a bubble up put that there
this is the flight for the royal rods
and I think the viewfinder bass wrapped
up this is the next up and I think this
is it um it's clean cloth like flow
cleaning your screen and these are the
rods in a minute end an allen wrench and
that's all that comes in the box put
that side there okay what do we want to
look up fast let's look at this
I'll be doing a review video I think
after about a week after years in it
sometime a week or two and i'll be
putting up with your videos you know to
let you guys know how this baby works
what I like and what I don't like about
itself don't forget to check that out um
here this is how he gums yep just if you
find out right there these are locking
mechanism here as you can see this
spring but there I think this is what
you pull up and so come up and then when
it comes down should lock in
there was that about
oh well we'll look into it and see oh
that's it right there and let's look at
the plates there's another allen wrench
in here I can see
there is another allen wrench I'm
guessing that one mainly works with
these oh this is really solid actually I
like it this all meadow there's no
plastic anyway except for this the
locking thing is plastic but it's like
really hard plastic you can't really it
feels will really really hard like like
not plastic like metal but and that's it
as well your rods will go in here this
guy's way here and this is just a next
drop I don't think you're really
interesting is looking at that bad these
are the rods they are 18 um 18 inches
long I mean eight inches long long I'm
sorry but yeah you got it 18 new bill
wait longer than this but it's eight
inches long and looks like this
basically that comes with it there's no
manual or anything if you're interested
in such stuff which i don't think i
would need a manual for that but that's
it for this video please subscribe to my
channel and do not forget to come back
and check out for the review videos i
think i'll be doing that I'm push way in
about two weeks I like to actually use
you know stuff and have a fill of them

weeks I'll be doing a review for this so
