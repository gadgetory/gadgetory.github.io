we are doing a review of the kinetic k1
bluetooth speaker now this is a fairly
pricey Bluetooth speaker running from
about 110 dollars on Amazon to 150
dollars in the local stores after
playing around with it for some time
here is my personal opinion about this
speaker let's get started now the
unboxing experience wasn't bad
everything was packed rubbed nice and
safe um and in the box you get the
speaker charger the k1 battery and micro
USB cable and obviously the speaker
itself and some paperwork stuff the
first thing I noticed was the weight of
the speaker is by far the heaviest out
of all my collection which was you know
promising out of the bag it definitely
looks pretty pretty to me I personally
like the design of this little guy he
looks classy and you know different and
from the feel of it it doesn't feel
cheap at all the build quality seems to
be pretty solid and obviously the first
thing I wanted to see is how the battery
pack works with it so I tried it right
away and I was pretty amazed by it the
eject button works pretty well and the
where the battery comes out is pretty
cool watching that is so cool and
satisfying anyway the case total
capacity is 2600 mAh amp and you can get
an extra one or however many you want
for more playtime from that website at
about 25 bucks each but between the
internal battery and the case cell I'm
averaging at about 10 hours of play time
which is pretty good not to mention I
kind of listen to loud music anyways so
that's good anyways I'm not going to go
into details about how to use this
speaker because all these buttons are
not new to us at all but I will point
out though
that the LED ring right on top here is
not just for design the front semicircle
is a battery meter for the removable
battery and the back one is for internal
battery that's pretty cool and it caught
me by surprise before the sound test
though I would like to mention that I
really wish they had included the skip
buttons on top here or somewhere else if
you ever need to skip back or forward
you are gonna have to go back to your
phone or whatever you're streaming your
music from and do it over there which is
kind of annoying to me an inconvenient
not to mention anyways let's go to the
sound test
I have my son recorder seven feet away
from the speaker and I have the recorder
set so the volume does not clip or
distort when I bump up the volume of the
K one speaker as usual I will first let
you listen to my jittery to give you
something to compare the sound to that's
because everyone has a phone so if you
can compare the sound of the phone to
the speaker it kind of gives you an idea
of what the speaker actually sounds like
in comparison to a phone let's get
started that's the Jeep we at its
maximum volume and now they came one
so that's it what do you think of the
sound I would love for you to live me an
answer down below but anyways I
personally I'm not so impressed with the
sound quality of this speaker
I was honestly expecting something you
know out of this price range to sound a
little bit better than that I feel like
the sound is a little bit too flat for
me I happen to own a sound fixed speaker
that you can get for under 60 bucks and
I use it mainly on my bike I put it next
to the k1 just to see how they compare
and hear the results
I could be wrong here but while the k1
is a little bit louder than the sound
freak
I think the freak sounds better with a
little bit better dynamic range in its
sound and does not sound as strained at
a smacks volume like the k1 but I do
like the design the build quality and
most especially the removable battery I
feel like I could be used this on trips
and stuff like that just because of the
removable battery that gives you more
playtime but I so wish they supported it
with some good sound that would have
been awesome
and I also hate that this is not a
microUSB charging port why the heck they
did not see that these Kings are so
inconvenient oh well thanks for watching
leave your comments down below and
please don't forget to subscribe like
the video and I will see you in the next
one peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
