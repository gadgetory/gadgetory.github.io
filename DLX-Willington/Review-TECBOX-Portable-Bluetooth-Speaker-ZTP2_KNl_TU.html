another review and today we are
reviewing the tape box bluetooth speaker
this is a classic design with a modern
finish kind of speaker and I think it
looks pretty cool in the box you get the
speaker itself a mini USB charging cable
and aux cable and all the paperwork
stuff which is mainly in on the user
manual this figure is made out of
plastic with a metallic finish on top
here which gives it that modern look and
feel widget think looks pretty cool
looking around the speaker we find an
aux input a microSD card slot the USB
drive Ford a mini USB charging port with
a charge indicator light right below it
and finally the Onan off switch and on
top you will find a bite of buttons that
you need to control the music including
the mold and call handling buttons and
right below the controls you find these
LED lights which as soon as you turn on
the speaker they turn on and give you
that cool white effect and finally at
the front in the grill you find the
screen which shows you what mode you're
in the volume you know and so on
connecting the speaker to your phone is
a breeze but there is one annoying thing
about this speaker every time you turn
it on this happens bluetooth mode blue
cheese connected if I was the make of
the speaker that would be the first
thing to get rid of in the next model
anyways considering the price of the
speaker it really does sound pretty good
for the sound test I have the speaker
seven feet away from the audio recording
device
I bumped it up to its maximum volume for
this test
are you listening very
let go a little
little lamb mary had a little lamb its
fleece was white as snow and everywhere
that Mary went
I just want to think that for the price
of the speaker the sound quality is now
but it sound a little bit strained at a
maximum volume as you can tell but it
sounds pretty good a couple notches down
on the volume thanks for watching and I
really hope this video was helpful to
you if you have any bluetooth speakers
in mind that you'd like to see me with
you on my channel here please go ahead
and leave them down in a comment section
below and that will get to them as soon
as again and with all that said thanks
for watching I will see you in the next
video as long as you do not forget to
subscribe peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
