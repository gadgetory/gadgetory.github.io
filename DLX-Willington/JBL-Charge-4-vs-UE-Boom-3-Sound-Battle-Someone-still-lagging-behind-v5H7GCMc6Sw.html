welcome to another sound battle where we
let speakers speak for themselves and in
the battlefield today we'll have the JBL
charge for going up against the ue boom
3 as usual I will be using a high
quality binaural microphone so for the
best experience please use headphones
and with that said let's hear the
speakers speak
do you and me
you
so if you're looking for the loudest of
the two that will be harder because the
speakers are about the same when it
comes to loudness um the boom three
might seem to be a little bit louder but
if it is it's not that much so so what
I'm trying to say is when it comes to
loudness the speakers are about the same
but putting that to the side the two
speakers have completely different sound
signatures and that is possibly
explained by the fact that this is a 360
speaker well as this is a mono speaker
directional so it has a completely
different sound signature as far as
sound it balanced and all that I feel
like the judge fold does a better job it
has a wider range as far as dynamic
range between the highs and lows because
it because we're tight I mean where they
don't mind me but we yeah this has this
goes way deeper as far as only the
frequency curve well as this does not go
as deep it has a pub bass so personally
I'm not a big huge fan of the kind of
bass that most of the UE speakers puts
out even the mega boom not a huge fan
because it just doesn't go as deep they
play they play with the upper bears and
I know some people love it which is
probably why they are such popular
speakers but personally I'm not a huge
fan I do like though that it's a stereo
speaker you still get a little bit of
sound the better sound image but at the
same time it's a it's also 360 anyway
actually I'll just talk about that a
little bit people always get mad at me
kind of when I place the speaker however
I place it when I'm doing the sound
recording but it's called a 360 speaker
for some reason you know for that very
reason and honestly if you get the
speaker and you're going to be listening
to it I feel like most people look at
this as to be the front of the speaker
not the back you're not going
to place it down like this in whistle if
you're stunning this way you're not
going to place it down like this and
listen to it this way
I feel like instinctively is that a word
you're going to place this speaker down
like this to listen to it because this
just looks like the front so it just
makes sense to place it down like that
so that's why every time I recall the UE
speakers I do it like that and something
like no you should focus it into of
course I think there's a driver right
here it has like two drivers but it's
cold at three six two speakers so I feel
like instead of always trying to like
look for all we should do this and then
the highs are too high and then before
like no you placed it the wrong way
because it's not so poison you know
you're recording the driver itself so
it's nice gonna be high and then when
you place it like that people like no
that is not it sound is you should focus
so it's it's always a tug-of-war and I
hate it so why I decided that's what I
do
it's called a 360 speaker if you wants
to fix that they can do three drivers or
something or you have to deal with how I
record it cuz I can't I can't like this
is the front of the speaker that is how
I record it sorry if I'm making anybody
mad but I just wanted to address that
cuz I know people always come into my
videos into like you're placing the
speaker wrong you're placing you should
place it like that if you do it like
that they get mad so I don't know I
think this is the front and that is how
I record you if speakers cuz they are
also called 360 speakers anyways I do
like the sound signature or the way the
JBL sounds it handles everything pretty
well I do like the mids on the doubloon
from the boom through here I think it
has pretty good meds someone who loves
meds and you like to hear those vocals
or you're going to be listening to
movies and all that I think this is a
better it could buy for that but if
you're mainly going to be listening to
music I think they charge for does it
better
job in balancing everything out and not
to mention it goes way deeper like real
good best that you can get out of it in
comparison to what you eat gives you
just some sort of upper base so
personally I think this wins and I hate
to say that because I hate that it's a
mono speaker at the same time I really
do not like the best that comes out of
you is because I think I don't think
it's real best it's just a purpose and
I'm not done for it but that's up to you
guys I think the judge for takes the win
here but I would like to hear what you
have to say about the two speakers in
the comment section below if you want to
check out the see the prices what they
are selling for right now if they're on
sale or not I'll put the links down in

thanks for watching and I will see you
in the next one peace I'm sorry I think
that was ranting if I made anybody mad
for talking about a 360 thing sorry but
I feel like I had to address it alright
