welcome to another sound battle where we
let speakers speak for themselves in the
battlefield today we have the Sonos
play:1 going up against the charge three
for the QES heads out there let's do
this and now we'll tell you what I think
at the end of the video as usual the
speakers are six feet away from the
sound recorder and they are playing at
seventy five percent volume put your
headphones on and let's hear the
speaker's speak
hold on oh no we toss me I've got
something to say
oh oh I'm happy to make time for your
feelings do you have to win me let's
just break it down to you and me come
town takes another round and the disco
ball pops but I have to pick me and
everyone see anger is misplaced
you
and there you have it guys Sano's is way
louder I almost put up the volume of the
chat three but I decided not to just so
you guys can actually hear the
difference between the two speakers as
far as sound quality the charge three
may not be as loud but both speakers
handle lows pretty well Sano's Bears
sounded a little bit punchy to me in
some songs but I don't think it's
something that an average consumer would
notice all be concerned about as far as
mids and highs the play one handles this
better than the charge three which makes
its music sound a little bit brighter
than what you get from the charge three
the play one has a mono output while the
charge three has exterior output but
honestly you can only tell the
difference if you want two to three feet
away from the speaker's as far as which
one you should buy I will give you three
things that will hopefully help you make
a decision and don't forget to like the
video and subscribe to my channel if you
find this video helpful at all number
one is sound quality I'll give this to
the play one because of its brighter
music and loudness and number two is
portability the play one plays music
wirelessly but it has to be plugged into
a power outlet it's made to be a home
system not to be moved around like the
charge 3 which is battery-powered
and can be taken pretty much anywhere
and reason number three is video
playback the play one plays music using
its app only and the app does not
support video playback so you cannot
watch videos on your device with the
sound coming out of the play 1 this
includes videos stored locally on your
device or YouTube videos so if this is
something that you were counting on the
charge read might just be what you are
looking for I hope you found this video
helpful if you did like the video
subscribe to my channel follow me on
Twitter and I will see you in the next
video peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
