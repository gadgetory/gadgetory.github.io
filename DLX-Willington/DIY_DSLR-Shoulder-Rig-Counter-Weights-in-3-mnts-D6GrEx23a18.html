another DIY episode today we will be
making a counterweight for ideas of our
reg so to achieve what we are going for
we will need a couple things before any
of that though you need to make sure you
have enough room at the back end of your
Elsa steam while you will be mounting
your counter weights and if you have
room this is what else you need scuba
diving both ways if you visit your local
scuba diving sharp like I did they
usually have some kind of cheaper
version of both weights which are
usually like these ones here and that's
what you need in order to achieve the
look that I achieved with my project you
can try but I doubt you'll be able to
find the kind of weights that i have
here online because i already try to
find them all over the internet with no
work at all you will also need two bolts
or 1 u-boat with the corresponding nuts
and by nuts i mean these nuts here and
you will also need some flat washers and
these kind of washes here not sure what
they are cold but i got mine with a
u-boat so there you go ok now that we
have everything i went ahead and painted
all my weights and all the hardware so
you know they kind of blend in with the
rag and also to keep the woods from
rusting now we put everything together i
attached my tests come dr 60d onto one
of the weights like this here which is
what you will be doing if you have any
quipment that you can mount at the back
of your rig say field recorder or a
battery pack they kind of help to
balancing out your rig so i took both of
those together and put them on top of
the rails like this and then after
figuring out how much weight i needed at
the back i went ahead and lined up the
rest of the weights below the first one
just like you can see here i put this
washer that i got with a you board on
top first and then the
boat or the boats and kissed us what you
use in turn at the bottom put on your
washers your nuts and then we all set
don't use a lot of counterweights just
because you can as it takes a lot of
stress away from your hands it's all
being put on your shoulders so you might
end up with a sore shoulder at the end
of the day I learn this the hard way so
watch out for that and that's it so what
