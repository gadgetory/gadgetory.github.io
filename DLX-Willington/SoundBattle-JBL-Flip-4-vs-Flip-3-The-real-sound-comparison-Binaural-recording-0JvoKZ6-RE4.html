and welcome to another sound battle
well that speakers speak for themselves
in the battlefield today we have the
flip to be going up against the all-new
flip for on a side note if you're new
here please make sure you subscribe it
really helps out a lot in this battle
the speakers of five feet are webform a
high quality binaural microphone and are
playing at 80 percent volume for a more
realistic sound experience please put
your headphones on and let's hear the
speaker's speak
I'm so ready to show you it is good and
I can't be what is it it is a bit
faithful and also be the hit of the
party
let's break it down to you with me
uptown and all the local park but I have
to be me and everyone seriously
Oh
and there you have it like I said in a
previous video there is definitely an
improvement in sound quality with the
neo fluid for the lows are definitely
better but the highs also sound a little
bit lifted up compared to the flip 3 I
also noticed that at about 65% volume
the based on a flip four starts getting
throttled you will hear the mids and
highs go up as the volume Rises but the
bass will stay constant
but overall the foot forward sounds
cleaner and clearer someone asked a
question in the comment of the previous
video is the sound quality of the flip
three half of that of the flip phone
and my answer is no I wouldn't say there
is that much difference between them
maybe just over three quarters if we
were to look at it in those terms the
improvement in sound quality is
definitely there but it's not like so
huge I would love to hear what you guys
have to say in the comments section I
hope you liked the video if you did
don't forget to give it a like and also
if you're not a subscriber please do
subscribe I will appreciate that thanks
for watching this one I will see you in
the next one peace
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
