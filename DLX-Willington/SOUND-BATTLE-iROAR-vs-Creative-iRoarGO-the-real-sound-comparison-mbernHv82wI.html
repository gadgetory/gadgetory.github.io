welcome to another sound battle where we
let speakers speak for themselves in the
battlefield today we have the I war
going up against its smaller little
newer brother the creative Aurora go
aside not here I'm actually going to be
referring to the creative eye or go this
sticker right here as the goal since
it's easier to say so the goal is the
newest that was released recently
following the release of the I wore in
the beginning of 2016 but these two
speakers have five drivers with the I
war having a slightly bigger sub in
twitter's which also makes its overall
size bigger than the go
but what we're wondering here is the
sound quality that different that's what
we're here to find out both the speakers
have more than one sound settings so I
will let you listen to the default
balanced sound in the first round and
then turn Raw on on both speakers and
I'll let you listen to that too so this
might make this video a little bit
longer than normal but but I'm just
trying to make sure I have covered all
phases it's all for you guys as usual
the speakers are six feet away from the
sound recorder and they are playing at
seventy percent volume without wasting
any of your precious time
put your headphones on and let the
speaker's speak
Oh No
I've got something to say I'm happy to
make down you have to win let's just
break it down to you and me love town
dancin all around just go ball pops I
have to be me everyone can see
oh I'm happy to me you have to win let's
just break it down to you and me
okay so the speakers have spoken my ears
have heard this is my judgment quick
side note if you are not a subscriber
you can support me by subscribing I
would really appreciate that anyways as
you might have guessed the aisle boy is
louder thanks to its overall bigger size
and it handles the lows better than the
goal thanks to its bigger subwoofer
other than that both these two speakers
have the same sound signature and that
goes for all sound modes the things to
work out in order to decide which one to
get between these two are the features
in loudness so if you're looking for a
speaker with a little bit more features
and louder and has an overall better
base the eyeball will be your guy here
but in my opinion the co is a better
choice if you consider its water
resistance the size and its price I feel
like the eye roar is a little bit
overpriced but those are my ears what do
you guys think leave your comment down

watching this one and now we'll see you
in the next one peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
