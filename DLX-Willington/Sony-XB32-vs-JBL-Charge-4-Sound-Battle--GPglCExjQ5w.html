here and welcome to another Saudi battle
where we let speakers speak for
themselves
I'm in the battlefield today we have the
sony srs XP 32 going up against the JBL
charge for the main difference between
the two as far as the sound battle is
concerned instead this is a stereo
speaker with 248 millimeter drivers well
as the charge for here is a mono speaker
with only 150 by 90 millimeter driver as
usual I will be using a high quality
binaural microphone to record this so
for the best experience please use
headphones with us said let's hear the
speakers speak
crazy excitingly
okay so where do we start cuz this is
kind of a tough one
anyways so as far as loudness they are
about the same they are both pretty loud
but when it comes to maximum volume they
are about the same loudness so no winner
there the sound quality of both speakers
is pretty good they both have lots of
bits for their size and the xB
thirty-two has a better frequency
response reading and doing the frequency
response test you could hear that the xB
32 even and as low as 40 Hertz it's
still producing some usable sound and
will last a charge for maybe at 50 Hertz
so you have a usable sound but anything
lower than that is basically non
existence if there is really unusable so
I guess you could say that the xB
thirty-two takes the wane as far as best
performance but while playing music you
could barely hear any difference between
the best performance of the xB 32 and
that of the charge for so I would say
both speakers handle best equally good
the church for seems to be doing a
little bit better in the upper mids and
highs and which makes it sound a little
bit brighter than the xB 32 but if you
use Sony's app and tweak the sound of
the srs XP 32 you can easily achieve
that brightness of the charge for using
that up so I still think they both still
do good in this area but honestly they
both speakers sound pretty good and
close to each other your decision to get
one or the other is going to depend on
brand loyalty because we all know we
have that kind of side that we mean but
also on the features so let's say sony
has likes has different sound modes to
choose from an EQ to fine tune your
music is a stereo speaker which is the
best way to listen to sound but these
are all features that the JBL charge for
does not have on the other hand at least
as of making this video the charge phone
is way cheaper than
SRS XP 32 put links to them in the
description down there but also JBL has
USB C charging which is a big deal to me
and it might be to you too it's an all
fabric design which means it won't show
wear and tear like Sony's plastic design
it has JBL connect plus which is way
easier to use than Sony's wireless party
change so if you intend to buy more
speakers from any of these companies
here with the intention of connecting
them for better
Biggers to your sound whatever JBL is
the better route to go because it's way
way easier to use than Sony's so like I
said both of these speakers sounded
pretty good and you're not going to be
disappointed by the sound of any of them
of the Arve but if I had to choose just
one of them I would take their their
service XP 32 just because I think JBL
needs to go back to I know I know I'm
gonna say the stereo sound because I'm
gonna say I hate the single driver and I
know a lot of you do not care about
studio overall mono but I do and I am
against it
anyways I'll leave the links to both of
these guys so you can get an up-to-date
pricing just follow those links it kind
of helps out the channel and let me know
what do you think about the two speakers
what did you think
do you like one over the other are you a
brand loyal kind of person or you know
discuss down there
I'm thank you very much for watching if
you're new here please subscribe so you
don't miss out on other sounding battles
and all sorts of awesome videos coming
out like the video if you liked it
dislike it if you didn't like it I just
want to get some sort of feedback from
you because you watch the video thanks
for watching again I will see you in the
next video
