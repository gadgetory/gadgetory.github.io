and welcome to another sound battle
well that speakers speak for themselves
in the battlefield today we have the
both reverb + versus the jet BL extreme
now I know the extreme is a lot bigger
than the revolve + but the point of the
video is to compare the biggest portable
bluetooth speaker that both offers right
now to the biggest portable speaker that
GBO
offers and the price points are kind of
comparable if size matters to you you
know which one to get over to but if
you're curious of how these two compare
sound wise sit back and relax cause
that's what we are doing here on a side
note I'm doing it thank you giveaway so
if you haven't watched that video I'll
put a link to it in the description
section so you don't miss a chance to
win one of the things I'm giving away
the link will be in the description to
that video back to this video the
speakers will be playing that 60% volume
and that hundred percent volume I'll be
using a high quality binaural microphone
so please use headphones for the best
experience with that said let's hear the
speakers speak
Oh
Oh
hold on go away just good I've gotta
make oh I'm happy to make that oh you
can dance you have to with me another
round till disco ball but I have to be
me
everyone the anger is with me
and donate we took our
and there you have it right off the bat
the extreme is louder than the revolved
plus which is something I was expecting
considering the size difference
the revolt class has a fantastic 360
sound which is more room filling and
sounds wider compared to the extreme
which is directional and sounds like it
and I like it I mean it sounds
directional the vocals on the revolved
price also sounded better than the
extreme on the other hand the extreme
has better stereo separation which is
kind of expected here some want better
best performance - and better definition
in the highs most especially at maximum
volume and honestly if you plan on
listening at maximum volume the extreme
is what you want without a doubt the
revolt class sounds pretty bad at
maximum volume compared to the extreme
and that's not me exaggerating so in my
opinion the extreme takes the lead in
this battle but if the design size
premium feel in the true 360 sound
matters to you the revolt class is what
you need here but that's just me and
sound is so subjective I would like to
hear what you guys have to say about
