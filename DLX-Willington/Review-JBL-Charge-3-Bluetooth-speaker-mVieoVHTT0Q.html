is the jet BL charge 3 the newest
speaker in the charge line of the
speakers from jet BL you can also watch
the review of the flip 3 here or the
budget between the charge 3 and the flip
3 here if you are interested and now
we'll have those links in the
description section below - before we go
any further this is the box it comes in
it comes packed neatly like you'd expect
and in the box you get the charge 3 the
paperwork stuff a 5 volt USB wall
adapter and a micro USB cable the one we
are looking at here today is black but
you can actually get this speaker in
other different color options so what
are the main differences between the
speaker and the previous model you ask
well they did if buddy redesign both the
way it looks in the material used it now
has a fabric material weave which not
only looks great but has a better grip
in the hand and from the sounds of it
it's supposed to be even stronger than
the metal mesh that were using before so
that's good as far as the design goes
this is the previous model and this is
the charge 3 the grille is wrapping
around the entire speaker and I think it
looks better that way I dig it
the other change is in the battery life
the charge 2 + 2 + promised 12 hours of
playtime but this bad boy is going for
20 hours of playtime which is a massive
improvement I mean you'll probably won't
be getting 20 hours depending on how
loud you listen to your music but at
least they should get you at least 18
hours of playtime depending on how heavy
and how loud you listen to your music
and it still features the six thousand
milliamp hour banking built into the
speaker for you to change your hungry
devices which is always a nice touch the
biggest main improvement here is the
move from splash proof to waterproof
the judge 3 now has a rating of ipx7
it can be submerged into water up to 1
meter deep for 3 minutes and its
performance will not be affected which
is awesome you can take it out to your
drills and not worry about the weather
it will survive they also added the play
post button which I like a lot but we
are still waiting for the skip buttons
please GBL think about it it really
sucks to always have to go to my phone
to skip to the next track they moved the
microUSB port the 3.5 millimeter port
the USB port under a suit cover here at
the back and I'm pretty sure this is for
the purpose of the ipx7 rating which I
don't mind at all I mean you might need
to keep something a nails on you but
that shouldn't be a problem
JBL exposed the best radiators at each
end of the speaker which vibrate in
response to the music as you can see
here I love it you also still you also
still have the same controls like the
previous models and the charge 3 can be
synced up with other compatible JBL
speakers to play the same song at the
same time for a bigger sound experience
if that's what you are looking for I
haven't demonstrated that here I'm is
called JBL connect if that's something
that you are interested in and you want
me to do a video about it leave your
comment down below
I'm gonna quit talking let's do some
sound testing so the speaker is 6 feet
away from the sound recorder and I have
it turned all the way up to its maximum
volume
Oh
Oh hold up girl no wait just a minute
I've got something to say you should I'm
happy to make time
oh you feel as and you have to admit
let's just bring it down to you and me
uptown dancin on the ground til the
disco ball pops but I have to be me and
everyone can see anger is misplaced
and I'm gonna
it's never gonna
there's no reason to prove yourself
something funky are you listening
okay so as far sound quality I honestly
don't think they did any big
improvements if you compare it to the
previous model they charge to plus which
is okay with me because I like the sound
of the charge to plus it's just that we
always expect something better with
every upgrade right when you guys think
