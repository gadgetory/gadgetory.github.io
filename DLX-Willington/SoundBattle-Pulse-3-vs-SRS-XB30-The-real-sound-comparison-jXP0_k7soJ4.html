and welcome to another sound battle
well that speakers speak for themselves
in the battlefield today we have the
palace 3 going up against another light
speaker the SRS XP 30 now the speakers
will be playing at 60 and 100 percent
volume I will be using a high quality
binaural microphone so please use
headphones for the best experience with
that said let's hear the speaker's speak
with a drill without me thank you
this thing with yes in the ventures
distance away
Oh
by
Oh
we cool
so in front of the speakers the XP 30 is
louder but if you place the speakers in
the center of the room and you find
yourself behind them the pulse tree is
going to appear a little bit louder
because of its 360 sound capabilities
and if and this also makes it more room
filling compared to the XP 30 actual
volumes about 40 percent the XP 30 will
give you deeper best with the extra bass
odd but as you get to higher volumes
Sony cuts down the bass and it ends up
being about the same as what's coming
out of the post 3 the highs on the post
3 are not as sharp as some people may
find them more appealing than the shop
hives on the expected I personally
prefer the mids and highs all the xp3
but this is only if you are in front of
the XB 30 if the speaker is in the
center of the room the people behind the
XB 30 will find sound of the pulse 3 a
lot better than that of the XB 30
because the post we has 360 sound no
matter where you are you will get good
sound well as the XB 30 is directional
only people in front of it get best
sound and those behind it get muffled
sound generally speaking I like the
sound of the XB 30 but if you're into
life the XB 30 is no match to the past 3
this thing is way too beautiful and I'm
sure it's the main selling point here
but that's just me and sound is so
subjective I would like to hear what you
have to say about this too in the
comment section below don't forget to
subscribe if you haven't yet I love you
all and I will see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
