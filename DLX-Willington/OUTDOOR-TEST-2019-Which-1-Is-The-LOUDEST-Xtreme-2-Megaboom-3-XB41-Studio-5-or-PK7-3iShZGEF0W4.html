before we go outside I have a few things
to mention these are the speakers that
we're going to be comparing the reason
you're not seeing the boom box or the XP
60 is because we all know those are
going to be louder than anything that's
here so what made me just focusing on
these mid-range speakers and I also want
to mention that their Studio 5 is not
necessarily a speaker that you should
get if you're mostly mostly going to be
using the speaker outdoors and that's
because it doesn't have any sort of
protection to it I mean you can use it
outside don't get me wrong there's
nothing wrong with that but you have to
be really really careful with it because
if water gets to it it's kaput
because it doesn't have any sort of
water protection all the ports are just
open like that so be careful with that
and the other thing I wanted to mention
is that during the sound sample we're
going to be listening to the same
portion the same part of the song all
the speakers will be playing that same
part and the reason is I mean usually I
would put a song and then switch between
speakers as the song goes if that makes
sense but it's time I want to play the
same part of the song and all the
speakers I will be playing the same part
like that's same caution in that since
we are looking at the loudest while
trying to find it the loudest of all I
don't want to play one speaker playing
this portion is songs sometimes loud and
then they calm down at are not as loud I
don't want the speaker to get an
advantage of playing the portion of the
song that's loud then move the next
speaker and they hang it by the time
that speaker is playing that portion
it's the song is not as loud so you can
blame this speaker but when actually the
actual song is just not loud so trying
to explain I'm hoping you understand
what I'm saying but yes all the songs or
the speakers were playing with some
portion of this song pop-pop-pop-pop
more the next
on to the next portion then all the
speakers be playing the same portion so
yes I just wanted to kind of sell my
think and I guess you get it let's go
outside okay so we are outside we're
going to be recording the speakers I
already have them all up there I'm also
have a DB meter set up over there just
so we can see you know it kind of gives
us a reference on how loud the speakers
are as we play them instead of just
depending on how we hear so it's about
two feet away from the speaker and right
here where we are well I have the
binaural microphone we are about forty
feet away from the speakers over there
so quite far away and I know it's kind
of windy out here at this moment wasn't
like this when I came out here but it's
kind of windy ever since I said setting
up like it usually happens when I try to
do outside videos but as it's windy I
feel like when you go outside and you're
going to be using this speaker these are
the kind of conditions that you're going
to be finding out there so maybe it's
not so bad that you get to hear them you
know in this kind of environment so you
can kind of experience the real life not
when there is no wind and then when you
get to by the speaker music there is
Wayne and it's just unusable get it
anyway so let's get to it go back to the
studio and talk about it after we've
heard how they sound like enjoy
yeah
and there you have it I feel like the
speakers have spoken for themselves but
in case you didn't catch it
here's the recap starting from the
bottom is the pk7
following that is the studio five that
mega boom three the extreme two and
lastly coming out at the top is the srs
XP 41 when it comes to loudness the XP
41 is the boss so if you're looking for
the loudest out of these guys here
outdoors the SRS X before t1 is for real
but I want to give a shout out to the
studio 5 mainly because this it
surprised me out of all the speakers
when we brought them outside I don't
think I've ever used it outdoors no I
don't remember any time I've used it
outdoors so when I brought out there for
the first time in hearing it I was
surprised by how much this it retains
even playing out there like out of all
the speakers that we heard you probably
noticed how good how deep and how thick
the best that comes out of the studio 5
is even out there it doesn't like
doesn't fade away it just it sounds like
it so kudos to the studio 5 it kind of
sucks that it's not an outdoor speaker I
mean you can use it outdoors but it
sucks that it doesn't have any sort of
protection like for water like not even
IPX pipe at all like I feel like if it
had that that would be a pretty good
speakers outside
you know that was a good surprise but
anyways I feel like I should end this
video what did you guys think drop me a
comment down there um thank you very
much for watching I'll leave the links
to all these speakers in this video in
the description section down there so
you can check it out use those links
that really do help me out and if you're
new here subscribe so you don't miss on
the upcoming videos again thank you very
much for watching I will see you in the
next video congratulations to the piece
