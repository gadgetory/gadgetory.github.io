and welcome to another sound battle
well that speakers speak for themselves
in the battlefield today we have the
power tree going up against the pulse to
the speaker's will be playing at 60 and
100 percent volume I'll be using a high
quality binaural microphone so please
use headphones for the best experience
with that said let's hear the speaker's
speak
and you
drilling and alchemy yes in the ventures
to raise awareness for ice cream but the
old Bell me girl fee between ba ba
you
so the past three is a little bit louder
than the past two the difference is not
huge but it's there most especially at
maximum volume and with a fact that the
Pao's 3 has 360 sound that means that it
will be equally loud in all directions
which is not the case with a pulse to
the post we has a higher power output
and you can clearly hear that difference
in its sound there is a little bit of
better bass performance from the past 3
but the difference is not as big as I
was expecting
um the biggest improvement for me here
is that the past 3 has less distortion
while reproducing lower bass notes but
as far as hitting lowest frequency notes
it's only at maximum volume that you
notice the post we doing a slightly
better job
the highs on opposed to sounds slightly
better if you're right in front of it
and that's because both the drivers are
pumping right at you but as you move
away to the back the power street starts
sounding way better
and due to 360 sound the pulse 3 is more
room failing and has a wider sound
stretch but on the other hand I feel
like there's a little bit of best spill
into the means on the bow 3 let me know
if you feel the same way or that
generally speaking this is slight
improvement in sound quality on the
pulse 3 compared to the 2 but it's not
that big it didn't really reach my
expectations at least like I said in a
previous video design 360 sound and ipx7
rating are the main changes here but
that's just me and sound is so
subjective I would like to hear what you
have to say about this - in the comment
section below don't forget subscribe if
you haven't yet like the video if you
liked it I love your faces and I will
see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
