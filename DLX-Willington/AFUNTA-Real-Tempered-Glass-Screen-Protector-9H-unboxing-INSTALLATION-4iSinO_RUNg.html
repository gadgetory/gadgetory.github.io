with another video in this one we are
going to be unboxing and installing the
entire screen protector we are unboxing
just so we can see what comes with it
and we are installing well just so we
learn how to do it or just see how it's
done well maybe just how I did it so
what do you get in here we take off this
label and then the first thing that we
see right here these are the
instructions of how to pull it on and
this is our dust removing tape and here
is the screen protector it's swell
tempered glass screen protector I really
hope this home sub pretty well because
hey it's gonna be better work because
I'll be so mash and you also get the
screen wipes you get one and two I
believe one is a wet white and two is a
dry wipe so you apply them in that order
let's get this started I grab my 70d and
get started with wipe 1
so after playing wipe number one then I
get my wipe number two which is a dry
wipe clean that baby up and get them
ready for the screen protector you know
make sure you get all as good as you can
you know getting all the dust off and if
you still see some dust on it you can
get this dust removing tape like I'm
doing here you know start taking off
that dust off of there until it looks
all nice and really really clean that
you can't see any kind of dust hanging
out on there so then I grab the screen
protector and you know make sure it's
facing the right way
take off that screen protector protector
that's on the adhesion side and this is
how I did it I kind of like put one of
the sides onto the screen and then kind
of guide it the other side you know if
that side that's down is lined up
everything else is due to you know bound
to line up and that's how I did it and
as you can see it's being adhered on
there without me doing anything I hope
you guys saw that it kind of like so
fainted so you probably did it back you
just it's all on there right now no
bubbles no nothing but I still kind of
like rubbed my card
well my speedy card and use the fiber
cloth that I provided with it and kind
of like still kind of like pulling it
off a little bit
make sure it's all adhered pretty well
and as you can see it looks really good
it's on there pretty well put it tight
all lined up so perfectly and as you can
see like here everything works just fine
like there's no delay or anything you
just you know every touch work so I'm no
problem with this so please make sure
you subscribe if you've enjoyed the
video check out my other videos on my
channel and I will see you in the next
video thanks bye
