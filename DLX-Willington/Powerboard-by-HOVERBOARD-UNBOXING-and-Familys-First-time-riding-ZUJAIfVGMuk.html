another unboxing video and today we are
unboxing the power board by hoverboard
this is the box I'm not sure why they
decided to cut that out but my guess
would be made in China they just didn't
want it on there but that's just a guess
but it's kind of weird that they did
that it just doesn't look professional
anyways let's look inside huh
this box looks different from what I was
expecting this is what the website shows
or Amazon these are the pictures that
shows and this does not look like that
but let me open it farther and see
now this is definitely a different look
I really really hope this is the right
thing that I ordered otherwise I will be
so pissed off and this says smart
balance wheel I ordered Power Board
I'm so confused but I'm still gonna be
opening it and see what's inside
all right so when you open it the first
thing you see is this remote right here
and right next to it here this is I
believe the charger next to it right
here is a gleave the carrying case and
they have the user manual right here
smart drifting scooter those are not the
words that are are on this box so I'm so
confused I want to see what's in here
let's go to it so at least this is black
so the one I ordered was black because
the pictures on Amazon showed it has a
name on the front of it that says power
board so when I get out and see if it if
this is the same thing that I ordered
there is no name powerboard on here like
you can see on the front here there's no
power board word anywhere so I don't
know I don't know what I got at least
it's black so and there's the button
right here to turn it on and as you can
see there is a green battery indicator
put some pressure on it see how it feels
another white turns on dang it feels
pretty good I'm gonna be recording
myself doing this for the first time so
stay stay tuned
but anyways close shots of this guy here
before I try it out for the first time
nice wheels part looks good the back
looks scared lights at the front I would
say generally it looks good at least you
know for me I like that they have this
protective bumpers on here
the rubber stuff on there it's kind of
nice
alright so I'm gonna put this down don't
mind my basement it looks kind of ugly
in here but it's okay just watch me just
watch me try it out
I'll make sure
okay
why should i gun flown anything
yeah
make the same pressure
oh there you go
do one freshen one side
I guess so
okay moving forward forward put the
pressure on both feet this one here did
it
he's not happy</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
