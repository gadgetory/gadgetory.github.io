another video um one of my friends asked
me what I used to create my DVDs and
blu-rays for my clients and that give me
the idea for this video now I've been
doing a lot of wedding videography
lately you can watch some of my samples
right here if you are interested but
when I send the blu-rays and DVDs my
clients I like them looking a little bit
decent so what I do is label them and in
this video I'm just showing you what I
used to do so and it's basically three
main things obviously a printer a CD
designing software or app and obviously
a printable discs I use a brother
printer MFC gh7 0dw
the still model number I got it for
about a hundred bucks it's not the
top-of-the-line print quality like the
ones from Hollywood but it's definitely
way better than just writing on the DVD
with a marker my clients are usually
actually surprised by how custom that
DVDs and blu-rays are which is always
what I'm going for the software I used
to design the labels is called neo soft
CD level and it came with my printer I'm
honestly not sure if you can get it
online but I'm sure you can find out
using Google I let this software just
because it's really simple to use and
it's made to work with my printer so I
keep it simple and just use the software
that came with the printer if need
arises I'll probably upgrade my printer
and the software
but as of right now this still works
well for my needs
thanks for watching and now would really
love to hear from you guys what printer
in-app do you useful leveling your DVDs
blu-rays and CDs leave your comments
down below and don't forget to subscribe
and like the video and I will see you in
the next video
