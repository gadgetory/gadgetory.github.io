after the sound battle of the XP 40
buses the Xtreme a lot of you wanted to
know which one is louder at maximum
volume of doors and which one kind of
sounds better at these high volumes so
in this video that's exactly what we are
going to be finding out if you haven't
watched the sound battle of these two I
suggest you go check it out I'll put the
link to it in the description section
below so go check that out
but there was a little bit windy out
today so I try to put the mic somewhere
where there's not a lot of wind
interference the first couple songs will
will be about 20 feet away from the
speakers and the last song will be about
50 feet away from the speaker's the
speakers will be playing at 100% of
volume and the extra bass on the xba-40
will be on and I'll be using a binaural
microphone which requires headphones for
the best results so put your headphones
on for the best result and with that
said let's hear the speaker's speak
Oh
so as you can hopefully tell the
extremal is louder than the xba-40
are these volumes you're not going to
get the best sound out of any speaker
but the extreme does sound better the
extreme actually maintains more bass at
maximum volume than the XP 40 and for
those who are always asking me no I
didn't use any cues here and I don't use
EQ in my sound comparisons i text
speakers the way they come out of the
box with whichever sound settings they
have to offer out of the box in
conclusion I don't know about you but
for me I think the extreme is winning
here what do you think let me know in
the comments section below
subscribe if you haven't yet thanks for
watching this one and I will see you in
the next one peace
Oh</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
