welcome to another song battle where
will it speakers speak for themselves in
the battlefield today we have the sony
srs xp3 going head-to-head will be
charged three as first requested by
panda if you have any speakers that you
would like to see them battle here leave
them in a comment section below and when
you do don't forget to subscribe because
that's the only way that you'll know
when i upload your requested video so
when people go out to buy the sony
xperia they are mostly looking for its
base since its what's mainly advertised
by sony on this speaker so for that
reason I did this recording with the
extra base on the Sony turned on as
usual the speaker's are six feet away
from the sound recorder and they are
playing at 80 percent volume put your
headphones on and let's hear the
speaker's speak
you have to break it down
okay so the speakers have spoken my ears
have heard this is my judgment I don't
know if you guys could tell but this is
a tough one as both speakers perform
almost the same but there are little
things here and there that might help us
distinguish between them the xp3 is a
touch louder than the judge three and I
know it's hard to tell through the
headphones but the xp3 also has better
stereo separation that they charge three
and the highs are better on the sony
xba-1 other hand the charge three has
Reacher and strained lows the bass
sounds older a bit better and despite
the lack of the full spectrum of the
highs the music sounded a little bit
more natural on the judge three compared
to the xp3 where it sounded a little bit
more compressed so this is what it comes
down to if you are looking to find out
which one is louder and has better highs
the X B 3 is what you are looking for
but if you're here to find out which one
is better at lows the child 3 is what
you are looking for not to say that the
expert 3 does not have bass or does not
perform very well in lows the charge 3
just performs a little bit better most
especially at high volumes where the xp3
seems to cut down on the volume of the
base which is not the case with the
charge 3 what do you think I would
really appreciate a comment down below
and a like if you liked the video
subscribe to my channel for more awesome
videos and now see you in the next one
peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
