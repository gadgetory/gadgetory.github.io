welcome to another sound battle where we
let speakers speak for themselves in the
battlefield today we have the Sony no we
have the Soundlink micro going up
against the Sony sr s XB 10 in my
previous video I asked q guys to tell me
which speakers that you would like to
see battle against the all-new sounding
micro and so far the most requested
video has been the Sony S aureus XV 10
has this video I'll be using a high
quality buy new microphone to record
this thought for the best experience
please use headphones with that said
let's hear the speaker's speak
moaning oh no wants what I say come into
me for the work that I put into because
my last name
that's right I'm surprised let's ride
did you diminish every time playin hard
till it's finished
okay so the micro is louder than the xB
10 and it actually sounds more powerful
than the XP 10 at pretty much all
volumes and also I specifically chose
somewhat of bass-heavy music so we can
hear how these two compare in lower
performance and physically the sony
cannot really handle bass heavy music
and by this I mean this bottom here is
not strong enough to hold up to the
vibration that comes out of the best so
as you could tell I was trying to put it
back in place cause it keeps moving so I
would recommend if you're using this and
you have to kind of keep an eye on it if
you're playing bass heavy music
otherwise you will find it on the floor
because it does not sit at all the
Soundlink micro does a way better job of
play of staying in place without having
to move a lot so kudos to this guy here
and this one here I don't know and I try
this before using this having it like
that on the table but it was still the
same thing like if you play bass heavy
music this guy is going to move around a
lot
so that's something to keep in mind and
the mic Pro has better best performance
on the XP 10 but the XP 10 is not really
so far behind I was actually surprised
on how well it stuck up to this guy I
was expecting a far bigger difference in
best performance but it holds up pretty
good the main problem with the XP 10 is
the distortion in sound and due to the
fact that when you play bass heavy music
it doesn't quite stay down that also
causes more vibration to it so it's
sound and the best performance just
sounds kind of bad but I'm I was
surprised of how well it kind of stuck
up to this guy here because this is a
high-end speaker and the other thing to
mention is the sony sounds kind of
strained weak and tiny compared to the
micro here so if you're looking to buy
one of these
in price is not an issue for you the
best choice to go with is the sound link
micro but if you're really really
terrible budget the ex b10 is not a bad
speaker for its price and size the
soundest produces is well worth it it's
actually been my go-to speaker to refer
to people who are looking for a tiny
speaker but has some best in it this has
been what I've been recommending people
so it is a good speaker for its size
it's just that both stepped up the game
a little bit here so AB Aspen is for me
I would really really love to hear what
you guys have to say about these two in
the comment section below so drop me a
comment down there and let me know what
you think about the two speakers would
you buy the XP turn over the X the micro
let me know down there and also I like
when you guys leave me some likes so if
you like the video please drop your like
so other people can find a video too if
you're not if you're new here and you've
not subscribed yet go ahead and do that
so you don't miss out on their upcoming
videos I love you all thank you for
watching and I will see you in the next
one peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
