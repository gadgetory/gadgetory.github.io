Wilmington here and welcome to another
video now if you are new here you've
probably haven't seen me do any other
video other than ones about Bluetooth
speakers and yes I do love Bluetooth
speakers but one thing that I have not
been talking about or that I I guess it
can older here for about two years you
know I've done a few videos about power
banks and that's because I have a little
bit of an addiction outside to power
banks not really an addiction but yes I
love power banks and for the past few
years for the last year or so I've been
using this as my main power bank this is
the wrath power our ppb 0:43
it's a twenty thousand one hundred mah
capacity so it's pretty big I just like
the ability to be able to charge my
phone or whatever if I'm using it like
mainly my phone on my tablet if I'm
watching videos on it I don't want to be
attached to a wall to a wall outlet
I just like the freedom of being able to
charge my power bank and sit wherever I
want and watch my videos without having
to worry about running out of juice um
Zen doer reached out to me and they
offered to give me the power bank so I
can test it out and I was like oh sure I
mean I get so many emails about
different stuff and people want to send
me so I can try them out and hopefully
share them with you guys and some of
them I most of them I just ignore them
because they're not things I'm
interested in I'd like to share things
that I actually like and enjoy but when
they reached out with bears the first
thing that caught me was there on the
capacity of the power bank
26800 M H that is HUGE it's about six
thousand more than I'm the one the main
one I've been using lately they're rough
so I like the capacity and size-wise - I
mean if you compare it to this one I've
been carrying with me everywhere it's
it's not a soul a faker but as far as
other sizes it is small so I would say
size-wise out say they are comparable so
that is not a huge big deal for me
because I usually either leave it in my
backpack if I have one on me this is
always in my backpack or I live in my
car because I can always grab it if I
need to charge but I always have a power
bank with me um the other thing is this
clean this thing has a screen here now
this one is here in most power banks
usually have only about four dots this
one has four dots here that will show
you how much juice is left but with this
you have an actual screen here it's an
LED screen so now like fancy or
touchscreen or anything like that but
it's enough to give you increments like
you have 100% I have 99% 98% like it
shows you all those increments so you
know exactly how much juice you have
left I didn't know how much I needed
that it's really really good it gives
you a sense of like a sense of security
like you know how much you have left on
there for sure not just guessing by the
dots that you have on there that each
one represents 25% so you don't know if
it's just got to 25% or it's almost out
of 25% range so that's really really
nice and the other thing is the quick
shot three-point or now I know my Galaxy
s8 plus does not use quick eye 3.0 but
having it on there ensures that the
future phones and future stuff that I
might have that will possibly have quick
Shh 3.0 are covered so it's quite more
of a future teacher a future proof
feature for me so I like having that
four ports to charge your
you can change your speakers and
whatever stuff that you want four of
them right there and the other thing is
the design so I'm not a big fan of how
it's actually designed but I know that's
subjective and I watched I saw a lot of
reviews that people actually do like how
it looks like they send me the silver
version and if I would have liked the
black one better but I'm not so sold on
the design but it is a durable a durable
power bank I saw a video of this of the
Zen doer they were testing it and they
put it on the floor and a car ran over
it and this thing was fine so I have not
personally done that test just because
it's winter here and there's snow
everywhere outside but also I like it I
don't really want it to break just in
case now there are a few things I don't
really like about it and the first thing
is the carrying pouch this is what they
give you it's a pretty
Luzi cloth kind of I mean it feels good
but if you compare it to these other
ones that you get that I have on my
rough power that you get with the
ravpower that really really soft or like
spongy I think they have like almost
feels like foam in there so they look
better and they also feel better on your
power bank
so if only they did the same thing here
and they give you something that is a
little bit better because this does not
work very cool and the other thing also
it's takes forever to charge most
especially if you're not using the
picture through the quick charge
three-point or charger which I don't
have so I have to charge it normally but
it still took me about 11 and a half
hours to fully charge this thing from 0
to 100% for so it takes some time but it
is not cool but I don't think it's
something that you can avoid with such a
huge
capacity so it's not cool but it's
understandable the thing is kind of huge
you know what I mean
now the other thing I noticed though
when I plug in for stuff charging all
the pots it warmed up a little bit not
like a lot like hot hot hot but it was
warm enough to where I would feel I
could feel the warmth to the touch but
that's only when I had all this stuff
plugged in and yeah it is nice I loved
it I love this one and it's definitely
my new favorite power bank this is what
I did because I don't like this stupid
pouch I got I used the one that that I
had on my PB 19 that the DOE AK series
of rough power it fit pretty good on the
Zen diora so that's the one I'm using
that's the one I'm using for carrying it
along around because it's a lot softer
and I think it looks better and not as
weird as weird as the is pouch here so
that's my addition to it I hope you
liked the video I like to share this
stuff I love like I said I love power
banks and they are pretty cool so that's
that was my experience with this um
thank you very much zenki worth for
sending this guy out to me I loved it I
loved it and I would recommend it to
anybody who is looking for a big
capacity power bank to use camping or
whatever just around the house or at
work or whatever you go you know what I
mean and I didn't mention but in the Box
you get the power bank you get a micro
USB cord you get the pouch and the paper
work stuff so that's what you get in
here when you buy it thanks for watching
this video there's many many many other
is coming up pretty quick so make sure
you're subscribed she's to see all the
new speakers that I'm going to be
bringing into the house
thanks for watching and I'll you all
Happy Happy New Year I will see you in
the next video peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
