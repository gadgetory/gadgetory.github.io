and welcome to this hopefully quick
video now following up on my previous
video a lot of you a lot of you have
been wondering about the AC versus DC
mode on the studio v because we had an
issue if you don't know with the this
extreme to when it first came out there
was a huge difference in sound and
loudness mainly between when it's
plugged in to AC mode and when it's not
plugged in which is which is what I'm
calling DC mode just because of that and
because a lot of you have been wondering
about it I figured I would just do this
quick video just to show you guys that
if there's any huge difference in sound
like it was with the extreme - I'm going
to give you a sound sample just one song
of AC versus DC mode of the studio five
and then maybe we can talk about it on
the other side with the sound sample
I'll be using a high quality binaural
microphone as usual so for the best
experience
please make sure you use headphones
otherwise you might not even tell the
difference at all
anyways take a listen
so yes there is a little bit of sound
difference like loudness wise not
quality loudness wise there is a little
bit of sound difference between the AC
and DC mode on the studio five but it's
not as bad as it was on the extreme -
when it first came out so I would say it
is good nothing I can complain about
there so yes the reason I did not
include this in the previous video that
I did of the extreme two versus the
studio five is because this Pickers are
actually made to be used as portable
speakers that's why I usually don't see
the need of including the AC versus DC
mode in those comparisons and also that
that's a lot of audio to record because
you have to record all those songs so
you're going to be using in a sound
battle when the speaker is plugged in
then do the same songs when the speaker
is not plugged in and then do the same
thing for the second speaker that you're
going to be comparing it to so so you
end up with about four and four files
that you have to go you took into
editing and sync them up chopped them up
and then mix and matching and all that
it gets a little bit tedious I feel like
if I did that for every sound battle I
do we would get a lot less songs because
it takes forever to edit something like
that and I don't really have a lot of
time on my hand to do all that stay or
all those things so yes justice I just
wanted to let you guys understand why I
did not include that in the previous
video or in many other videos that might
be coming it's just because these
speakers are made to be used in
um DC mode mainly that's how they are
advertised and that's how I use them if
they speaker guys it's dying I just play
to the side and grab a different one but
I also know that is not it's a luxury
that everybody has so I understand that
bad yeah I hope this video kind of
cleared up some things for you if you're
new here please subscribe you can like
the video a little bit away if you liked
it leave a dislike and just want to get
some sort of feedback from you because
you did watch the video so let me know
what to think and when you're done I
will see you in the next video I have
the charge the charge for here I'd not
open it because it just came in for some
reason mine always takes forever but
yeah here it is we're going to be
checking that out so make sure you
subscribe if you're not subscribed so
we're gonna be taking a look at that um
thanks for watching I will see you in
the next video peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
