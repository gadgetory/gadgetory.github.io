as you guys might know not so long ago I
picked up these speakers you can check
out the review that I just did not so
long ago I'll put a link somewhere here
on the screen I picked up this guy and
I'm loving it so far I don't use it
really that much but it's cool it just
sits there and loved it takes so but I'm
a curious guy and I like to know how
things work most of the time so so I'm
going to open this up and we are going
to see what's in here and if you know
stuff in there you can leave your
comments down below now what's going on
or if you have an idea of how this works
but I don't know much about these
speakers I'm just curious on how they
arrange those magnets down in here and
in here for this thing to be able to
work just like this so you invited for
ride and let's check this out I'll get
my screwdriver here one yes this - the
strong can keep hitting me from opening
up but I'm kind of determined to do this
not sure if I will be able to pull the
screws out because
I'm not going to try to take them out
cause I'm pretty sure that magnet is
pulling on them so okay that one is on
screwed Tristan
so there's a speaker right there man I
really want to break it really really
careful good this is your battery right
here the rechargeable battery lithium
battery just glued on there you kind of
tape right there
and here's the magnet this thing is also
freaking strong small man oh man that's
strong so it's just a magnet and take
all this stuff on this one here just
basic probably workers that go to this
unit up here but
I'm interested in this space right here
this kind of it my opinion interesting
about if you guys enter that's the
magnet right there and see what we got
gone wrong looks like we have one two
four screws and I will need a different
screwdriver and a little guy what screw
right here
alright so I think we got it
look at that so this is just a cover
nothing fancy I'm trying not to show you
guys what's down there before I look at
it so you know hit okay Hughes the
reveal yeah
that is insane so all the cool lights
that show up on a top ring here and here
are the same LED lights so these things
are just reflecting the light through
their while letting the light go through
the in here that's how you get that cool
way effect but they're not individual
LEDs here and then there no they're just
these guys right here okay that felt
solid plug this in hopefully I don't die
and turn it on
mmm fancy
all right let's see this
ha
that is cool who needs a cover you don't
need a cover that is also probably mine
like this thing is cool oops
gonna kill it
see so now this magnet this magnet is
magnet now the same poor priority as
doing up here so pushing it pushing
pushing and push there so in sub just
balancing right there nowhere to go
it's not cool now one thing I wanted to
see so now turn this off just to see
look at that
I turned a switch off but this thing is
still still obtaining
apparently the switch is just for the
lights so you guys now know
I was curious I get in so much trouble
when I was little I'd always try to fix
things that are not Brooke but I was
just a curious kid just like anybody out
there who is watching this video
probably tequilas head so yeah I was one
of them
and I actually ruined a couple things
which is the reason my parents refused
me to touch their stuff is they knew in
their absence the night might be
something that gets broken
here click you feel it'd be cooler it's
interesting</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
