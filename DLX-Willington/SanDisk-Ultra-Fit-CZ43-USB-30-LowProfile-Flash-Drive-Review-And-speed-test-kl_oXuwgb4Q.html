Wellington here and today we are going
to be reviewing and speed testing the
Sun disc out for fit model cz 43 and the
one I have here is a 32 gig m and this
is a USB 3.0 flash drive so let's get to
it just to keep it short in my car I do
have Bluetooth but I mainly use it for
calls like receiving and and making
calls but playing music I for some
reason I don't know if there's somebody
else out there but I play music off of a
flash drive in my car don't ask me why
that's what I do so that's the reason I
got this flash drive the build quality
of this guy's feels pretty solid like
I'm to the feel of it it feels like a
strong build and it actually looks kind
of nice I mean you can look like it
looks really nice and blends in with my
car and also it looks premium it's not
be able to feel cheap or anything like
that so I honestly just love the quality
of this little guy so far has been
holding up really nice so I have no
complaint in the quality and also for
this being such a small flash drive I
love the fact that it has an activity
indicator that caught me by surprise I
wouldn't think you know something this
small I wasn't really expecting that but
that's really nice to have and I would
highly recommend this for someone else
who uses who plays music in their car
using USB flash drives this is a really
really nice smaller profile flash drive
and I actually really love it now done
with all of that I'm going to be doing a
speed test and let's get to that right
now I will be doing this test on a
system running geforce gtx 760 and intel
i7 cpu at 3.5 gigahertz 32 gigs of
1920 by 1200 resolution on Microsoft
Windows 10 let's get to it
so I made this folder here that has a
file that we are going to be using
during this test it's about two gigs
heavy I will go ahead and plug in the
ultra fat and there we go open up this
folder I'll grab the file and drop it
now right now we are going at about 77
megabytes per second which is not bad
90s and then it's sudden drop to 2019
that's weird I'm gonna afford this so we
can get to the end pretty fast so I'm
not so sure why but for some reason we
had a drop that was kind of weird but
anyways let's go ahead so I'm gonna go
ahead and delete this footage from the
SSD my computer and then transfer the
file that we just copied to the ultra
fat back to the computer
and damn that was quick that was really
fast I couldn't see it I'm just gonna
freeze a frame here just so we can see
how fast he was going yeah so it looks
like it was going at two point all three
gigs per second yeah that's why it was
just a flash but yeah that's really good
I would say um so to conclude this I
personally love this flash drive and I
would recommend it to anyone who is
looking for something to play music in
their car or someone who just wants a
really small nice handy little flash
drive to use to transfer files it's
really really really small and nice
