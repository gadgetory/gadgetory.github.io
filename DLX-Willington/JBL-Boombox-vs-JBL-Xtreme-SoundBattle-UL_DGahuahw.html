welcome to another sound battle where we
let speakers speak for themselves like I
promised you in the previous video we
are going to be taking a close look at
how the all-new JBL boombox compares to
the old GFDL extreme now if you want to
know more about the grbl boombox
i already did a review a full detailed
review video I'll put a link to it in
the description section below
but this video just like all the other
sound better videos we will be only
focusing on how these two compare sound
wise now I'll be using a high quality
binaural microphone to record this so
for the best experience please use
headphones with that said let's hear the
speaker's speak
just break it down
so with the size and power output of the
JBL boombox
the Xtreme has next to no chance of
coming out louder the boombox
is significantly louder than the JBL
extreme now the two speakers have pretty
much the same sound signature with the
main differences only coming in with the
loudness and the best performance the
boombox does a better job reproducing
the lows it's best goes deeper in indoor
mode if you compare it to that of the
extreme and also when you turn on the
outdoor mode it's best goes louder or
sounds louder than what's coming out of
the JBL extreme now both speakers
prioritize best they are both bass heavy
speakers the boombox is just taking that
a little step further by giving you a
choice to decide between what kind of
bass or how you like your best by giving
you the indoor and outdoor mode which is
always a nice touch we all love choices
right oh they just catching up to Sony's
extra bass on/off feature hmm anyways
the boombox takes the wind for me in
this battle and that's mainly because of
three things it's louder it has a better
bass performance and also the ability to
choose what kind of sound experience you
want by giving you the Indo in outdoor
mode which is something that the JBL
extreme is lacking but that's just me
I'd like to hear what you have to say
about this - in the comment section

upcoming videos and if you like the
