another quick review so let's get
started so my wife has a Galaxy camera
and so far we haven't had any kind of
protective case on it but my almost
three-year-old son has been getting into
picture taken a lot lately so we decided
to get some kind of protection for the
camera for those unfortunate drops
eyebrows around on Amazon and I came
across this it comes with a neck strap a
cleaning cloth and a pouch out of the
box this case looks clean and stylish
and it promises protection for sure it
just attaches to the bottom of the
camera using the provided stylus quarter
inch screw and then the top part
connects to the bottom half to cover the
entire camera which is really easy just
snaps on the case has cutouts for the
speaker and every strap which is kinda
nice but there are few downfalls to this
case though you have to entirely take
off the top in order to take pictures
and you have to take the bottom off in
order to charge the camera which is my
biggest disadvantage right here but
that's what you get and it fits okay I
just have this feeling that it would
have been a little bit better if it was
a little bit tighter you know tighter is
always better but overall I think it's a
nice looking case and my wife does love
it for sure she's been carrying her
camera on her more than before since she
got this case so I'm sure she loves it
so if you own a Galaxy camera and you're
looking for something to protect it here
you go I will put the link to where I
found this one in the description
