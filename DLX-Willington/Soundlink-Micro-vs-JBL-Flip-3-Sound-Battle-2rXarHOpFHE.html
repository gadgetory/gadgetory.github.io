welcome to another sound battle where we
let speakers speak for themselves in the
battlefield today we have the Soundlink
micro going up against the JBL flip 3
this is a 360 speaker
it fires upwards to give you a 360 sound
experience this one is directional you
have to face it to you to give you what
it was intended to give you but for the
sake of making things even I will be
placing this one facing forward I mean
upward to just so it also kind of gives
us a 360 sound experience that where
everyone is facing the same direction
and it should be a more comparable sound
coming out of both of them with that
said I will be using a high quality
binaural microphone so for the best
experience please use headphones let's
hear the speaker's speak
[Laughter]
with the superb elimination of the true
word every time there's a new attack
they can be heard in a thirsty I stay
awake we do the toast rates to the
moaning oh no one's what I say come into
me for the world that I'm gonna be Degas
mom's name that's right I'm sanctified
cuz I pay the price
let's ride did you get the minister
every time playing on till it's finished
and then some people get hurt right that
the earth smile for a break with the M
beside you I'm gonna get it every time
to shine so bright no let's go let's go
let's go
okay so although not by much the flip
three is a little bit louder than the
sound link micro and also at maximum
volume it sounds a little bit more
powerful than the sound link micro again
both speakers are well balanced with a
little bit of best spilling into the
mints and I also noticed that the highs
on the flip three a little bit better
than what you're getting on the
Soundlink
micro and as far as best performance
there's not really a huge difference
between these two they equally do about
the same job the only difference here is
the size that the micro is able to
produce what the- the JBL flip three is
able to produce and that's considering
the size difference of the two so I'm
really really impressed by what both was
able to do with this small speaker if
you're looking to get one of these two
that's only three things that are going
to be determining which one to get and
that is their waterproofness this is not
waterproof
it's only splash proof but this is
waterproof so there you go number two
the size this is so small you can fill
in your pocket or as this is not a small
speaker but you cannot fit where this
guy can fit and number three is the
price this guy is a lot more expensive
than these guys
so obviously the performance of the
Soundlink micro is mind-blowing
considering its size so if you have the
money it will be the best choice to go
with because it has all the other
features and it has a good sound for its
size but if you don't have the money and
you don't mind about waterproofness this
is not not a bad choice either because
you're basically getting the same sound
that you'd get with this just with a
little bit of a bigger form factor of a
speaker and that's been it from me today
if you're new here
please subscribe if you're a subscriber

like so other people can also find the
video and hopefully join us here I will
be doing other videos about the
Soundlink micro so if you have a video a
speaker that you'd like to see battle
against the Soundlink micro drop it down
in a comment section below as well as
what you think about these two speakers
I love you all thanks for watching and I
will see you in the next video peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
