and welcome to this video we're going to
be taking a close look at the JBL
extreme 2 and we're also going to be
comparing it to the JBL extreme that
goes for what features have been changed
or upgraded or downgraded and we're also
going to be comparing the sound so the
review and sound battle if you're
interested in that stay tuned okay so
the unboxing experience is going to be
like any other JBL speakers nothing
fancy and in the box you find the JBL
extreme to a power adapter the paperwork
stuff and a strap which is kind of been
improved it now has a bottle opener and
why are you giving me a black strap to
go with a blue speaker it just kind of
looks like a knockoff just doesn't look
right
as far as design there are a few
touch-ups here in there this extreme 2
is slightly bigger than the extreme but
the main frame or skeleton if when I
call it that is not changed as you can
see the speaker look pretty much the
same with just minor touch-ups here and
there you still have your buttons up
here the only difference is that instead
of the JBL connect you now have the JBL
connect plus on the new JBL extreme 2
which is fantastic because that means
you are able to connect all the new JBL
connect plus enabled speakers with this
new JBL extreme to the key ours have a
new design on them with a 3d JBL logo
print and I'm personally conflicted on
this I thought I liked the design of the
old pr's but the more I loved
and use the new speaker and look at
these ones the mom like I kind of don't
mind them so it's kind of a toss-up of
that one
you still have your strap hooks up here
but they are slightly redesigned they
look bigger beefier and I personally
think they actually look better than
that
the old ones here and since this is the
waterproof speaker they now have all
your ports behind here behind this flap
and this is where you will find your
charging ports and yep they still have
no USB or micro USB charging or even USB
C charging not cool JBL and next to that
is one USB port for charging your
power-hungry devices a service port and
lastly a 3.5 millimeter audio input and
as always always make sure you have this
completely sealed off pretty tight
before you submerge or expose the
speaker to water otherwise it's gonna go
kaput and your warranty will not cover
it so always make sure that's sealed
before exposing the speaker to water
that's a pro tip right there they still
have your power indicators right here
down at the bottom just like the extreme
they have different feet here if they
look a little bit nicer
so that is a nice touch there's not
really any difference in the grip on the
surface but they are different and the
material as we all know that's what JBL
has been doing for the last few speakers
that they've been making with the fabric
material so that is still there but I
think well they have the cool
JBL extreme - logo on there so that is
new but I think that's it for the
outside now let's focus on what they
have housed inside the speaker and see
what's the difference between
the two internally the JBL extreme two
is slightly heavier than the JBL extreme
by about half a pound and they updated
from bluetooth 4.1 on the JBL extreme to
bluetooth 4.2 I was hoping for something
like 5.0 as far as Bluetooth version but
we're still rocking 4.2 or more speakers
I'm not sure why because it's been out
for quite some time now but Bluetooth
manufacturers or makers are still
running 4.2 at the most so I'm not sure
what's going on there and I don't know
the extreme two is now completely
waterproof you can submerge it into
water and it will not be affected at all
that's in comparison to the JBL extreme
which only is splash proof IP x5 raining
whereas this one has ipx7 rating they
have shuffled around the sizes of the
drivers to hear a little bit we now have
17 millimeter drivers in the JBL extreme
to comparable to the 65 millimeter no 63
millimeter drivers that we had in the
JBL extreme and we had 35 millimeter
tweeters in the JBL extreme and they
have downscaled that to 20 millimeter
tweeters in the JBL extreme 2 now the
next thing that is probably affected by
the changes in the drivers is the
frequency of response rating now we only
had 70 Hertz lowest rated on the JBL
extreme but now the lowest rating on the
frequency curve on the JBL extreme tube
is 55 Hertz which is good don't get me
wrong that is really good at least when
it at 70 but I honestly was hoping for
something a little bit lower than that
on something like maybe 20 Hertz or at
least 40 Hertz at least 40 Hertz
I mean Sony is doing that with the
x-term
speed speakers the XP 40 the XP 41 the
XP 31 they can all go as well as 20
Hertz not as loud like you can barely
hear it but it is there and I was hoping
for something like that for speaker this
big a new wasted version I don't know
why JBL could not go at least lower than
55 but disappointed but I'm happy that
at least they went lower than the
extreme and talking about frequency
response maybe this is a good time that
we get a sound sample of these two
speakers so we can compare and contrast
and see which one maybe sounds better
and we will start that with a frequency
response test as usual I will record
this using a high quality binaural
microphone so for the best experience
please use headphones and with that said
let's hear the speakers speak enjoy
basically nothing there it's barely
anything there you have to win
you
okay so as you could hopefully tell the
best performance of the GBO extreme - is
better than that of the JBL extreme
surprise surprise overall I think the
JBL extreme - sounds better
it's it has a wider dynamic range in its
sound it sounds cleaner and overall I
think the JBL extreme - sounds better
and you're asking which one is louder
well that's where things start to get a
little bit funky see when the extreme
two is plugged in it's about as loud as
the JBL extreme they're about the same
but when this is running of its
batteries when the JBL extreme 2 is
running of battery no cords attached the
extreme is louder than the GFDL extreme
- why they would do that I have no idea
my guess is they didn't want to cut down
the playtime hour or the advertised
playtime hour on the JBL extreme - so
they wanted to keep it at 15 hours play
time on the box but since this has
bigger drivers and they have it has
bigger bears which means will drain
power a little bit modernist
so instead of putting in a bigger
battery they thought well we just cut
down the consumption of the speaker
during the battery mode so it does not
drain the battery which will make it
less hours to get out of it compared to
the JBL extreme so instead of going that
route so because they want to save that
they just cut down the power consumption
the power output of the extreme - just
to keep the power I mean they play time
the same on the two speakers
I don't get it I would up with father
speaker to at least have 12 hours to
play time advertised and have it loud
because when someone is buying these
speakers here it's not because they want
to keep it plugged in if you go outside
you want the speaker to be as loud as
you can get it you know what I mean
instead of coming inside plug it in or
so loud when you plug it in but I'm
gonna be indoors I don't want it to be
as loud as it gets I want the opposite
go outside you can make it as long as
you want and when you come inside you
usually tell the speaker down because
it's a confined smaller room than the
outside but what JBL did here I have no
idea what they were thinking I don't
know okay so I think those are the
notable differences between these two
speakers I'm not sure if I missed
something here so the big question is is
it worth it to upgrade personally yes I
would upgrade in a heartbeat I mean I
kind of already did and I'm gonna get
rid of this but here's the thing
I'm the new upgrade the improved
performance in sound and you know that
better best performance is good for me I
like this most of you already know and
we now have a fully waterproof speaker
which is another plus I hate the battery
on the JBL extreme I suffer a lot they
stupid thing will tell me to go charge
it and I will go charge it two minutes
two SEC's for when I take another look
at it I would say it's only got like two
like two bars on there so the battery
issues on the JBL extreme are not very
very enticing like welcoming but I like
this one here because at least so far
it's Barry performs better wolf
I mean I hate the fact that it has the
stupid
different performances doing the AC or
DC mode but overall I think it's a
better speaker if JBL can put out maybe
of a firmware update to where they take
out that limitation during the battery
mode I would be very very happy with
this speaker otherwise if you're someone
who is looking for the loudest of the
loudest when you go outside I think this
would be a better deal here I mean it's
still what up I mean splash proof and
it's louder outside it's smaller and you
will be getting it cheaper because now
this one is out you're probably sitting
about at least a hundred dollars getting
this so there is that in addition to
wait I think that's it that's cut that
