welcome to this video
this has been an impulse video that
means anything I didn't really plan on
doing this video but I decided to do it
so it's not have I don't have a plan for
it so excuse me if I ramble a little bit
the sub case the makers of the unicorn
beetle phone cases had emailed me and
they were asking if I I would like to
try out their their cases for the new
phones and by then since I was planning
on buying one I accepted their offer
Michael yeah send me those and the
reason I did is because I use their
cases for everything that they make
their cases for that I own but when they
sent me the the cases I was expecting
these also came in the package so I
don't know if there's some people who
make this sub case also make these
phones or what is going on I just know
that these came in the package too so
why not do a giveaway because either way
even if I was buying an S 9 I wouldn't
need all these cases that's what I'm
trying to say so just make sure you're
subscribed and you will let me know
which phone cases you would prefer the
unicorn beetle Pro it's like the heavy
duty of all of them as far as sub case
goes so this one actually comes with a
screen protector already inbuilt and
this is the plus if you know what I mean
the only downside to that is the fact
that this the case is at least in the
old ones that I've had before the screen
gets scratched pretty easily
cuz it's plastic like it's nice the day
you put it on but after two three months
or so it's gonna be a little bit too
scratched if you've watched one of my
videos i screen fixed mine i took it out
and actually used a different screen
I'll put the link to that video in the
description section below but I was
after I had used the case for quite some
time
and I the screen was just too dirty so I
just took it off and then this is a
smaller version which is basically the
same as what you're seeing here on my
phone it's not as heavy duty as that and
he doesn't have the screen protector on
it but it still does a job and it's not
as bulky as that we can also take a look
at it and maybe this is how it looks
like and actually I do like this one
better than one I have on my phone it
has a better design they light actually
designed it and wow this is actually
like creepy like the material they used
on here it does not slide it's not like
plastic that that slides like this on
here is this one's like like those shiny
spots on if you can see those but on the
edges here they actually grip you like
to your hands they stick now like sticky
like glue but hence moving they kind of
stick a little bit so that is pretty
cool so if this is what you would prefer
it's a little bit smaller than this just
let me know in the comment section just
say unicorn biro
so this is the unicorn beetle Pro and
this is just a unicorn beetle so if you
would like to be far if you prefer this
smaller not so heavy-duty not so heavy
duty case I want you to let me know in
the comment section below and just say
unicorn beetle so that's what you will
be getting if you win and then these two
say I blossom I blossom LLC so I'm
guessing they are from the same company
but under a different branding or this
is a sister or parent company to them I
don't know I know that those are the
people I talk to
but I sent me all this so and this one
is the rose gold these are all for the
galaxy s 9 not the s9 + mr. s 9 this is
rose gold so if you want to win this one
you just take down below I Bluffs on
Ellis no I blossom rose gold this is
what this is they color the phone hmm
interesting it looks a lot like pink
here this looks same someone like gold
that's an interesting card and this one
is the same as saying the same thing I
blow some black and this one also comes
with a screen protector inbuilt and it
has a sit through back so you can
actually see your phone in there I wish
I actually had that Cox es name with me
to pull this things in so you guys can
see them and then the next one is the
clay cold clay cold never heard of them
I'm guessing it's the same thing somehow
related to subcase I don't know but here
it is also looks a lot like the rose
gold color yep so this is the I blossom
rose gold and this is the clay core rose
gold so they look a little bit of
different I think I personally probably
would prefer this it's right here to
this but that's just me then lastly this
is the Moomba Moomba black moon bob
black if this is what you're interested
in if this is what you'd like to enter
for just down below moon by black and
there you have it now for all of you for
anyone who wants to win and on this
please make sure you subscribed and for
those of you who are not sure or killed
you don't Wayne or anything like that
I'll be putting links to all these cases
down
in the description section below so you
can check them out so if you're
interested please make sure you go check
them out like I said I've used this sub
case a lot a lot more and I really I
really really love that cases here and
I'm glad that they actually they
probably found my videos my older videos
I've made about the cases basically I
knew that I'm a fan like I love that
stuff so they decided to send me some
and I really really appreciate that sub
case big sub I wouldn't mind you guys
sending me more stuff maybe the cases
because I actually just pulled a case
for my Galaxy Tab a ten inch from you
guys so I really love that cases they I
think they are good for their value they
are pretty cheap in comparison to order
box otter box I've actually done a video
comparing the two of the sub case versus
the otter box after two years of use and
I will link that video down below and
you can see a huge difference as far as
sustainability yeah that's been this
video thanks for watching please I don't
know what to do with all these cases
since I'm not gonna be using them I'm
using them so please let me know in the
comment section below which one you
would like to win in case you're going
to be you're going to be getting an the
galaxy s 9
so yeah just let me know in the comment
section down below and you can have
yourself a free have yourself a free
case for your phone if you pre-ordered
it already or you're thinking of getting
one or you want to give it as a gift to
somebody just I don't care just make
