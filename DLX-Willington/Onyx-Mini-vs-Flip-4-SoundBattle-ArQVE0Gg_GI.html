welcome to another sound battle where we
let speakers speak for themselves in the
battlefield today we have the JBL flip
for going up against the onyx meanie
I'll be using a high quality binaural
microphone so for the best experience
please use headphones with that said
let's hear the speaker's speak
I don't know love this day it seems to
me everything has gone so fast it feels
like I'm is come every day
can we go someone do some special place
I'd like to do something crazy we should
try to run away
okay so the football is a tiny bit like
barely louder than the Onyx mini in fact
it's pretty much indistinguishable with
a human ear I had to use the DB meter
which actually gave me 89 89 max DB on
the Onyx mini and 90 DB on the flip for
socks
apparently the flip phone is a little
bit louder than the Onyx mini and while
the highs on the flip for a little bit
sharp the highest on the Onyx meaning
are a little bit too soft so it feels
like the sweet spot is in between the
two when it comes to highs but for the
myths the Onyx mini is doing a little
bit better than the flip for there is a
little bit of best feeling into them but
they are more pronounced and better than
what the footfall is putting out so for
the mints the Onyx mini is doing better
and let's talk about the best now to
most people the best that is coming out
of there
onyx mini is going to sound better and
that's because they boosted the upper
base probably at around ninety and a
hundred Hertz or so but the best is not
necessarily deeper or cleaner than what
the footfall is pulling out and in fact
if you listen closely the bass that is
coming out of the flip phone is actually
tighter and cleaner than what's coming
out of the out of the Onyx meaning and I
know there's a lot of words and probably
confusing but to give you an
understanding of what I'm talking about
here is a frequency response test
so yeah as you probably heard the best
out of flip 4 is not as loud but it's
surely cleaner and tighter than what the
Onyx mini is pulling out now with that
point made I do actually like the
overall sound of the Onyx meaning now I
think the Drowned mids and they're
somewhat harsh highs on the foot for
kind of leave the sound of the flip on
the Onyx mini sounding a little bit
better and more pleasing to the ear then
once you get out of the flip 4 so for
this battle the wind goes for the Onyx
meaning but I should say I should
mention that the meaning is not
waterproof like the flip for so if that
matters to you you probably want to stay
away and get your stuff to flip for just
because it was built for the outdoors
and the sound difference is not really
that big anyways what do you guys think
I would like to hear what you have to
say about the two in the comment section
