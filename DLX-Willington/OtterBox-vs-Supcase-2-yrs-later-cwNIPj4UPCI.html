another video I have people who have
been asking me about the sub case for
the order box Defender this is the sub
case this is how it looks like after the
two-year use and it's made out of like
hard rubber and this is the winner it
gets tiny scratches here and there but
if it thinks to works like you can see
this the cutouts still work pretty
nicely anything you know works in looks
not so soft so bad like it's still in
fairly in a good condition out there and
now this is the otterbox defender is on
a and s5 the case is made out of softer
rubber it is soft so over the time it
stretches out like you can see on this
phone it's pretty loose like you know
when you look at the sub case because
it's made out of hard rubber it's pretty
intact and still strong as compared to
this one here that's now pretty loose
and you can see on the back here you
know this cutout of the camera it looks
you know like is fraying off it's
peeling off you know it does I would say
does not look very good I feel like
around this point gonna be thinking
about replacing it but for the sub case
obviously it does not really need any
replacement after the two years of use I
feel like it still looks you know
clearly stable it has a crack here but
that was about actually upset over a
year ago when I was I'm switching out
this case and I didn't pull it off the
right way and I snapped it there so yeah
you want to be careful with that this
inside frame it can easily crack but
yeah I'll say the sub case in my opinion
holds up better over a period of two
years on the other hand
both these two cases will do their job
they've gone through all kinds of
beading but they've stood up to it and
they've done their job on the sub case
are usually pretty much always half the
price of the OtterBox in the sub case in
my opinion hold up better as far as
staying you know looking nicer and in
good shape they hold up better compared
to the other box Defender but the
close-up to you
leave me a comment down below and tell
me which case you use and why you prefer
it over the other and how to talk to you
guys in the next video I hope you
enjoyed this one I have many videos
coming up the ton of Bluetooth speakers
in the house and you will be watching
those pretty soon and I'll see you in
the next video peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
