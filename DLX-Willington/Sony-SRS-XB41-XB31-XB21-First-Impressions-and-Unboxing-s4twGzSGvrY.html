good here and welcome to this hopefully
short video now I do have a ton of stuff
going on this weekend pretty crazy but I
got I just got this speaker I mean this
package it has the XP 41 the XP 21 the
XP 31 all the new speakers that I didn't
pump tand I'm pretty sure you guys I've
been found to see just how they look
like and what's new so I'm not sure if
I'll be able to work on a video on this
weekend like a more detailed video but I
thought as I go through what I'm going
through I would make a video just on
boxing video because I really really
want to see how they look like and just
get my hands on them just to people they
may know what's going on and what Sony
has done so instead of just opening them
for myself and looking at them and go do
what I have to do I thought I would make
an unboxing video and hopefully upload
it as quick as possible
yes so you guys can have something to
chew on as I work on other video
probably by the time you guys are
watching this I might be already working
on a more detailed video review of one
of the speakers or something like that I
don't know so yeah here's the unboxing
and first impressions of the XP 4131 and
21 and the other ways and I also wanted
to make this video you guys don't follow
me on Twitter so it's hard for me to ask
questions like this like what battles do
you want to see battle against today
these speakers the new speakers so I
made this video just to ask that
question I want you to let me know in
the comment section below what sound
battles are you just eager to watch what
do you want me to work on as soon as
possible what some battles do you want
to see any other speakers against any of
the speakers in here so just let me know
in the comment section down below so I
can start
working on those videos as soon as
possible anyways and I go ahead and open
this package here and here we go
this time I got some different colors I
have the XP 21 I believe
yeah thanks p21 in red and I got the XP
31 in white I believe that's what they
called it and then the xB 41 stop it
that was my phone who are you
that's one all the speeches here I Spit
my phone triggered something
apparently anyways so these are the
speakers X before we're on the X P 31
and the X be 21 which one should we open
first okay this small one okay so this
is the xB 40 no xB 21 yeah it's pretty
pretty cool that's the packaging right
there and on here it says this
waterproof and dustproof it has
lifestyle mode time not tough and
experience your sound and lighting so
you can run if you guys have heard about
it but you can tuck the speaker and it
like makes pretty mic like beatboxing
don't you call it no just like you tap
it and it makes like the drum cymbals
and stuff like that so it's kind of
pretty cool not entirely sure how useful
that will be but we'll we'll be finding
out when we do the final review it's
just open and see what's in there just
hang there they're probably telling you
make sure you seal that before you put
this in water so I'm kind of happy that
they finally I'm waterproof these
speakers that's where Sony has been
losing to JBL and the UE speakers so
you've got all your manuals and stuff
and you gotta you its micro USB here to
change this people
so here it is the answer is X be 21 I
get a say I like the new design far far
better than the older ones day like
yesterday s aureus XV 2 hour 20 you got
this little two feet here for
stabilizing my speakers that's pretty
cool they got rid of the batten layout
that they had before to this new one and
I think it's pretty cool still now you
got your NFC right here and yeah nice I
don't know Pippi has this is the SRS XB
31 just look at that for this will look
at them like in detail about I don't
want to just talk about one because I
feel like the features up oh the same
just they're different like lighting on
speakers and sizes so yeah so your menus
and then it micro USB charging cable now
this is a big deal here this is a pretty
big deal i'm sony has always used the
SRS with their previous models they have
always used the weird like ping ping
charging for that speakers and they have
changed that with that new speakers I'm
pretty sure of it as before you want to
to this this is a big deal I kind of
like like they actually finally listened
and they changed that that on the
charging to that so you can see here we
don't have that weird ping charging
output its Joe's just a micro USB
charging right there so that is really
really nice I'm really really happy that
they did that and you still have your
audio input here Wireless I mean the
wire
Audio - you prefer that you have all
your bachelors back here again like it's
already six before you wanna I mean the
21 then you have all your buttons out
here again so pretty cool NFC and look
at that I kind of kind of really like
this color so this is the Holy One so
there's still pretty good difference in
size but it's not like really really big
but I'm just happy that they did this
cool
Big Ups to Sonny I want to look up the
big boy now
hoping it's in focus
I'm sorry forgot how big this thing's on
XP 41 okay what do you get so your menus
are right in here and they want to see
what kind of charging
it's probably in here fingers crossed
and old school so this is what they've
been doing for all that speakers they
give you this weird weird charging cord
instead of the micro the most under 12
charging and this is Jay what JB also
does with they're the bigger speakers so
it's not it's not just Sony but yeah Bo
with that JBL extreme this is what they
do and I fit uses more they need more
power walk but also it's five volts so I
don't know but so I got balconies maybe
I should have got in another color
it still looks cool I like it I like the
new lighting I think this is overall
this is a better design than their older
speakers I like this I like that they
actually went in with the fabric now
instead of the weird but not weird but
the regular plastic okay so I was
reading about this but I wasn't sure but
it looks like so you can either charge
it using this pin they're still using
this this or you can use a micro USB
cable but that one is not provided which
is right here it says DC in five volts
or both ports use five volt which the
USB the micro USB uses give said
whatever so that is really cool I'm
really really happy that Sony went that
route thank you thank you guys
that is really really cool so again you
have your battery indicator the wireless
poly chain add button all in the back
here and you also still get that the
audio in and then you can also still
charge your phone or whatever gadgets
you have that might use you as B so this
is cool so these are the speakers right
here we're going to be taking a detailed
look at them I'll be making you know as
you guys know videos so we're able to go
more into details and pumped to hear how
the studio live sound mode sounds we'll
be testing that out too so if you were
interested in seeing more detailed
videos about this to these speakers
please make sure you subscribe and watch
out make sure you you hit the bell icon
so you don't miss out when I upload new
videos so these are the speakers guys we
can you know just turn them on so we can
see those cool lights turn on if we have
any batteries on there oh yeah look at
that
and here's a signal I'm not sure if I'm
in focus
okay I can do that it's pretty tight
anyways
look at that mean I can you guys so so
so cool I'm kind of pumped I feel bad
well can I get some point that I do have
a ton of crap going on and I I just
can't be here and just work on this like
right away so but I want you guys to let
me know in the comment section down
below okay that's better
I'm back in training anyways so yeah
like I was saying I want you guys to let
me know in the comment section below
what speakers that you would want to see
battle against all these new speakers
that XP 41 the big guy the XP 31 m2
xv-21 I would like to see what you guys
want to battle what sound battles that
you would want now I don't have really
much to say I kind of have to go but
these I do like the new design like
definitely best I like this better than
the older the old versions is kind of
far for me here still has this L it is
going around the speakers I do I do like
that and I looks like the main
difference here is kind of like the same
with the older speakers they the main
change was in the lighting of the
speaker's like the lights that you get
on here and then and then just the sizes
sizes of the the woofers I believe this
one has like 50 58 which is a change
last yeah I think they had like 6 to 100
meters talking about them first and this
one I think has 58 and maybe this one is
48
I'm not sure I'm not sure about what
size the size of the woofers in your
speakers but yeah that's been it that's
been it I will be doing more videos you
can we will hear the sample and
that in those videos but just wanted to
give you something to chew on so you can
start so voting for these guys here I'm
pumped
excited and happy so hopefully they're
not disappointing as far as sound goes I
wish I hope I hope that there is a good
guilt difference in sound especially
with the highs on their other speakers
and you remember the 50% battery then
the speaker drops volume - way way lower
I hope that's not the case here that
they have changed that but I would
definitely be testing that and I will
tell you that when I bring back the
speakers in other videos and full
reviews and sounded battles and all that
you know a lot about this because but I
just wanted to let you guys know they
aren't in the house and let me know what
you want and don't forget to go over to
Twitter and you know start following me
for more updates on speakers and all
sorts of stuff thank you for watching
please subscribe if you're new here and
I will see you in the next video peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
