welcome to another sonic battle where
we'll have speakers speak for themselves
in a battlefield today we have the
charged we've going up against the
pillow plus as usual the speakers are
six feet away from the sound recorder
and they are playing at 80 percent
volume without wasting any more of your
precious time
push your headphones on and let's hear
the speaker's speak
this is my judgment a lot of volumes we
are speaking 50 and under you know both
these two speakers sound pretty good and
with some songs I feel like the pill
plus was doing better well the church
twisting it like it was a little bit
closed like who was lacking mints and
highs and that's because the pill class
has enhanced highs like the highlight of
this speaker is in the highs that's what
they concentrated so it sounds brighter
at lower volumes but if you crank the
volume up I'm talking 60 and above the
the highs on the till plus start
becoming noticeable and by the time you
get into the 80s and 90s and 100 they
become too much for my taste to
understand what I'm talking about if you
haven't yet go and watch the real sound
test of the til plus I'll put the link
in the description section below and on
the screen go watch that and that should
give you an idea and understanding of
what I'm talking about but surprisingly
the lows stayed pretty much as good as
the judge tweak but I get over drowned
by the highs that are so so so enhanced
like I don't get it
without saved if you intend to listen to
keep the volume not over a half like 50%
and lower any of these two speakers will
do the trick because they all sound good
at that volume but if you intend to rise
the volume into the 80s the better
choice is the charge three it has an
overall better balanced sound at all
volumes what did you guys think I really
really need to hear from you guys on
this one so drop me a comment down below
and like the video if you liked it if
you're not a subscriber
I'll appreciate your support please
subscribe to my channel thanks for
watching this one again and I will see
you in the next one peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
