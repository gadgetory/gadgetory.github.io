welcome to another sound battle where we
let speakers speak for themselves I'm in
the path field today we have their
all-new
JBL charged for going up against the
older guy the JBL charge
3 since this is the first time that we
have the charge fall on the channel
these are the main differences between
these two guys and the first one being
the drivers or should I say driver
instead of the 210 watt 50 millimeter
drivers that we had on the charge 3 we
are moving over to 150 by 90 millimeter
single driver in the charge for and what
that means also is that we're moving
from stereo speaker to a mono speaker
and move that I think is bad the charge
3 was writer to go as low as 65 Hertz on
the frequency curve whereas the charge
for is now rated to go a little bit
lower up to 60 Hertz on the frequency
curve so that is good and the judge for
now has USB type-c charging port I
really appreciate that maybe the design
is a little bit polished on the charge
fall but mainly looks pretty much the
same that is good I feel like those are
the main differences everything else is
pretty much the same between the two
speaker the same waterproof rating ipx7
if you have updated your charger 3 you
should also have their connect plus
feature on there and yeah it's basically
the same design this is a little bit
bigger actually the judge 4 is a little
bit bigger than the charge 3 but like I
said everything else is pretty much the
same it's just those few things I've
told you are the main differences
between these
two guys now with all that said how
about sound that's what we came here for
right I will give you a sound sample and
we can talk about it on the other side
as usual I will be using a high quality
binaural microphone so for the best
experience please use headphones and
with that said well let's hear the
speaker's speak
- you and me uptown another round
you
okay there you have it honestly
listening to these two side-by-side kind
of lowered my expectations that I had
for the charge for quite a bit actually
I was expecting a little bit more out of
it I feel like I should stop putting my
expectations too high with these
speakers because it sounds a little bit
better there's a little bit of
improvement in sound like you've
probably heard it has better best
performance it's not by a lot but it is
better it goes a little bit lower I
think that lower rating really does show
up in the sound it also generally has a
better balance between the mids this
ties the balance things out a little bit
better than they did it done it is only
charge three but it's not like the judge
3 is so bad
1 discharged 3 first came out it was
real really bad it was lacking highs
like crazy and by this descent they sent
out quite a few updates that they sent
out and the speaker actually right now
sounds pretty good that he's a not
terrible like they were when it first
came out so that's good but comparing
these two this is still tuned pretty
pretty better it might just be because
it has a wider dynamic range as far as
sound frequencies just because it has a
lower a better best performance that it
sounds it just sounds a little bit
better but it's not to the point where I
would be like this is blowing this will
blow your mind away you know what I mean
it's a little bit better a little bit
improvement in sound but it's not so so
huge that I would straightforward go to
you know recommending the speaker to
anyone who is looking at either this or
this in fact it's a toss-up for me
because while this is a little bit
improved I do not like the fact that
they moved over from a stereo speaker to
a mono speaker I
don't know why they decided to do that
but I really hate it I like still your
sound in the fact that I moved over from
that to this mono just kind of makes me
sad I really hope they move back to
studio in the future productions that I
do up a charge for at least well then
you'll be the charge five I don't want
them to keep this um it makes sense like
with the the studio five it makes sense
that they did that just because of the
the way the speaker is designed you kind
of expected that but with the speaker
this form factor I feel like it should
be
exterior speaker like I don't know why
they did that most especially comparing
this is these are fifty millimeter
drivers in here two of them if you put
them together they probably basically
give you the same size of speaker that's
being here you know what I mean
so it's not like this they don't have
space for it because this is actually a
little bit even bigger so I don't know
why they decided to go that route but I
don't like it most people produce sound
in studios so if you're looking for a
speaker that will reproduce your sound
to the best it was for you know if it
was meant to sound the chart we will do
a better job of separating those
channels better than the charge for will
do for most people it won't make a big
deal but I was very disappointed by the
fact that it's a mono speaker for some
reason that kind of bothers me a little
bit but I know most people don't care
most of all won't even notice it but
yeah there you have it it's a toss-up
for me it's hard for me to just say I
prefer this one over the other I do like
the better bass performance on here like
I probably already said but I don't like
that a ceremonial speaker
and I don't know I don't know I what do
you guys think like what do you think
about these two speakers I'm rooting for
the charge three just because of the
fact that is stereo so if you're looking
for the best represented the best
representation of the sound the charge
three will do a better job even if it
doesn't have as much best as this does
it's not by a lot even you know what I
mean so this will do a better job giving
you a better representation of the sound
the way it was meant and this one here
will sound more balanced know that but
it works wish all the channels stream
them together to use so you will not get
that stereo separation that good
soundstage so I don't know you have to
make a decision here you have to make
that decision based on what what you're
going to be using the speaker and how
you like your sound okay that's it this
video was not scripted so I might have
gone a little bit longer than normal but
just spitting out what I got and that's
it and if you're new subscribe also if
you want to pick up any one of these
I'll leave the links down in the
description section below so you can
check those out if you use those links
it helps the channel out and it doesn't
add any kind of cost to you to the price
of a speaker so feel free to use them
and help me out I really appreciate you
people who actually go ahead and use
those links it really helps me out
maybe charged for they charge three
likely charge for the charge for it is
like this light kit if you like it if
you don't like it if it tastes like can
you do a dislike piece</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
