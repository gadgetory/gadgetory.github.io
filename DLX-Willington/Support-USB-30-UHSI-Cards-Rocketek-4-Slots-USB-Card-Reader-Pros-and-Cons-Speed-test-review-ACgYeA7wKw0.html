review of the rocket tech 4 slot USB 3.0
card reader I've had this for about two
weeks now been playing around with it a
lot and we are going to be looking at
the pros and cons of the build itself
why I like it why don't like it and will
be also looking at it's on a computer to
just you know to compare speed to as as
in comparison to other you know card
reader how it compares when you're using
it in a 2.0 port or 3.0 port so we'll
get right into it
okay so right away we'll get started
first of the pros is the fairly small
and compact this is a really small you
know card reader for being a false flat
card reader it's really fairly small I
mean it's not a smallest out there but
it's not huge - it's easy to carry
around so I would say that's a good
thing then other good thing is you know
the port covers these guys right here
you know keeps everything dust from you
know going in here or going getting into
here and not that much cuz this is a
hole here right yeah it kind of covers
it except for these slots right here
those are not covered but at least these
are covered and this also it helps you
cover this card in here so you can leave
it in there like you know almost all the
time if you're not going to use it in
your in your camera or whatever you use
your cards for and it just kind of makes
it turn into a thumb drive or a flash
drive if I might say or whatever you
call it so that's a good thing
the other good thing is the activity
indicator so if you put it in a computer
this will light up and it will let you
know if something is going on on
and I could also say that it's a good
design I mean one of the reasons I got
it kind of looks really really cool it's
not the best but I like the design it
looks it looks great I like it it also
has the touchable USB cover so it's a
good thing so if you don't want it on
you can still you know take it off and
still looks beautiful if you if you like
it like that so if you want even more
smaller I guess that's you know there
for you but I like this one so I think
I'm gonna leave that on and another
thing is the strap the neck strap loop
so you can put in your you can put a
loop in here or whatever and just you
know cut it around in your neck if
you're into that
that's excuse me that's an option for
you right there you can just put your I
can put a strap in here and then you are
good to go so that's another thing and
the last thing is I think it's really
fairly economical I mean you know cheap
it's not that you know highly priced
it's a good bargain so now the cons for
this thing first and I think the only
one is this cover here yeah it just
comes off just like that and as you can
see it doesn't really stay in place so
if I put it here and I instead of it you
know staying there pretty tight he's
really really loose just doing that just
takes it off it doesn't quite stay in
place so that's a really big thing and
what's funny is that you have the loop
on here which means this if this is to
fall off
you've lost your card so that's
something to watch out for is not really
strong like
you know and I kind of like it on here
but that's a that's not a good thing and
that's mainly it for the physical part
of this card so I'll get to test it out
onto the computer and see how it
compares to my internal card reader so
let's get to that this is the card that
we are going to be using for this test
and this one is the card reader that we
are going to be you know comparing the
Warka tech to because is what I have so
I already have the card into the
internal card reader that I just showed
you so we'll go ahead and open that up
this is the file right here that we are
going to be you know transferring around
to see how each one does and this is how
big it is it's a tool I will set two and
a half games so I have a folder here
I'll just make another one right here
that we can use so we are going to
transfer stuff from that card which is
in my internal card reader onto the
computer so let's see you know how what
speed it reads it act there so as we can
see it's reading at 18 19 18 19 so the
average is 18 megabytes per second so he
jumps in between 18 19 18 19 but mostly
18
I'm going to for this a little bit so we
don't sit here and wait forever although
I think it's going to be about two
minutes right here it says so I'm going
to fall this a little bit okay I'm back
so this is about 90% done and it's been
going 18 19 but mainly 18 that's the
speed it's been going at 18 megabytes
per second and it's done that took about
two minutes to I mean two and a half
minutes for for it to fit to do all that
and that's my regular card reader 2.0
speed internal so I'm going to go ahead
and switch the card and put it right
back into the rocket card reader but I'm
going to put the rocket egg into a 2.0
speed port onto my computer okay so I
went ahead and put the card into the
rocket egg and I place the rocket egg
into a 2.0 USB port onto my computer so
I'm going to go ahead and delete this
file get it out of here too and get the
same file and put it on here by this
time we are using the rocket tech in a
2.0 point-to-point or port
and right away we can see the difference
this is running at 40 megabytes per
second as in you know compare it to like
it's about to just a little over two
times faster that's a good thing
you know last before he was saying yeah
it's going to take about two minutes but
it's just 45 he started at 45 so and
he's going at 40 I mean that's a huge
difference right away like it's not even
in a 3.0 it's just in a 2.0 a 2.0 USB
port so you can see the difference right
away that's really cool I would say I
mean it's good even if you're using it
just writing a 2.0 it's better than you
know the regular ones so as you can see
it stays pretty much at forty 1.2
megabytes per second most of the time so
you can right away see the difference
but that's not the end let's go ahead
and pull delete this one go ahead and
delete that and put the card into the
three point or reader I mean a 3.0 port
on to my computer so let me go ahead and
do that okay so I went ahead and moved
the card reader into a 3.0 port and I'll
get back to the file and move it and see
how fast you're going for be any
different from having in there 2.0 let's
go ahead and do that
and yeah as you can see from a 441
megabytes per second to 68 I mean 60
yeah 68 that's different that's that's
good I would say that's good and the
card that I'm using is rated for 40
megabits per second does his feel but
this is forcing it to run at 68 I would
say that's a good thing I like it so yep
that was you know about 10 seconds right
there so I hope this really gave you
some idea of what to expect from getting
this card and you know help you make
decisions that's been it for this video
