welcome to another sound battle well
we'll have speakers speak for themselves
in the battlefield that we have the GT k
XP 60 going up against the srs XP 40 30
and the SRS XP 20 as usual I'll be using
a high quality binaural microphone so
for the best experience please use
headphones with that said let's hear the
speaker's speak
I'm happy to make time you have to win
don't turn me
so interesting right so I lower volume
everything from the XP 40 30 and the 20
sound way way better than the XP 60 is
able to put out they have good bass they
have better treble and they have good
mids so honestly if you only the XP 30
40 and the 20 there is no reason to get
the XP 60 like they have a good sound
the only failing part is when you bump
the volume all the way up to maximum
volume they sound a little bit weak
compared to the XP 60 and that treble is
kind of mushed up like that it's not
very good and the best drops way too low
like it's not enough and this is
probably because of the X piece at the
XP 40 if you've watched my review of
video X before you know that when the
volumes go up the best drops way way too
low and when the blooms go down like the
3% this is too too too much and it's
really really good and so I'm it's
that's probably what's causing what's
affecting the performance of these three
but if you really really don't plan on
listening to maximum volume the sound
that is coming out of this get of these
guys here if it's not at maximum volume
is way way better than what you're going
to get from the XP 60 the XP 60 is not
really in my opinion standing up to its
size like it looks like this beefy good
guys driven kind of speaker and then you
listen to it and you compare it to other
speakers and it just sounds like man you
know so I'm not really happy with what
they did with that speaker if you can't
tell so my vote will still go for the
three speakers cuz they sound better
they have a sweet spot whereby the XP 60
does not have anything like a sweet spot
doesn't matter if it's a maximum volume
if it's a lower volume it still just
doesn't sound right so unless you like
the features the XP 60 is able to give
you that the three speakers cannot offer
you most especially if you want to use
it as a PA system like connect a
microphone to it and use it to address
people maybe that can you know get you
can get that speaker but if that's not
the case I feel like you will be better
off with the three speakers on this side
than the XP 60 they did not do a good
job with our speaker so that's it what
do you guys think I'd like to know what
you have to say about the two
comparisons in the comment section below
don't forget to subscribe if you haven't
yet like the video if you liked it
dislike it if you didn't like it I just
want to get some sort of feedback from
you because you watch the video thanks
for watching this one I love you all and
I will see you in next one peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
