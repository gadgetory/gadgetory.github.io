and welcome to another sound battle
well that speakers speak for themselves
in the power of field today we have the
Sony in subways XP 10 versus the JBL
clip to the speakers will be playing at
60 and 100 percent volume I'll be using
a high quality binaural microphone so
please use headphones for the best
experience without wasting any of your
precious time put your headphones on and
let's hear the speakers speak
hold on girl now wait just a minute I've
got some damn to say I'm happy to make
now you have to with me when we come
down and all around disco ball but I
have to be and everyone should be played
you
okay so if you could tell the XP 10 does
a better job on the lower side of the
frequency curve you can somewhat hear
real bass coming out of it compared to
the clip - the only downside to this is
that the best distorts pretty easily
most especially at maximum volume on the
other set though the highs and mids on
the quick tour are better in my opinion
they click - although it lacks quite a
lot in bass compared to the XP 10 it has
an overall cleaner sound if you ask me
for someone who likes a lot of bass but
doesn't want to go out and buy a bigger
speaker the xB 10 is great if you keep
the volume under 70% but for someone
looking for an overall cleaner sound and
don't mind having minimal bass in your
music the cripton would be your best
choice here and if you're here to find
out which one is louder in the two songs
they clipped or seemed a little louder
but in most songs
I couldn't tell any difference both
speakers out there are about equally
loud but that's just me and sound is so
subjective I would like to hear what you
have to say about this - in the comment
section below don't forget to subscribe
if you haven't yet love you all I will
see you in the next one peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
