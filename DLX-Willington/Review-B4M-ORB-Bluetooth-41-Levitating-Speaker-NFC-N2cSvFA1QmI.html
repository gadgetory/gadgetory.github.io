videos so I did a review about a
levitating speaker before from music
angle and you can watch the video here
if you haven't watched that one in your
interest in watching that one so I found
another one here that I figured you know
why not do a view about it
it's the before before all the things I
like about this speaker is the fact that
it won't take so that's the main thing
about this and now say this right now
that if you're looking for a speaker
that you want to use for the purpose for
the sole purpose of listening to music
you're looking for that high quality
sound of music this is not for you this
is just for the sake of the coolness of
levitation this is the only reason you
buy this kind of speaker there are few
out there that are actually like good as
far as sound is concerned but I also way
we're expensive on the back here you as
you can see there is a power button a
charging port and a Bluetooth button for
pairing when you're pairing your device
and on top here is the NFC which is
another cool thing about this speaker
most of the other ones just do a regular
connection but this one has actually NFC
and this is the spot right here on top
well you can just connect it an NFC
enabled device and you can instantly you
know pair your device just like that
instead of going through the Bluetooth
staying in our
that which is not a big deal for me but
and a sister with my kiss on my phone I
can't use NFC and I usually find it
harder to take off my kiss just to use
the NFC the nice thing about this too is
that this legs here can actually guide
you when you are pulling this thing on
here if you're too close to to that
light it will tell you oil you know stop
lighting up so you can learn how to
easily balance it is using the guides of
these lights right here which is really
really really nice with my music angel
yeah I mean it's not like a big deal
it's not so hard to to connect it just
because it doesn't have those guidelines
but I guess those lights are kind of you
know nice to just for the sake of just
showing you that oh so you don't have a
lot of bending like falling to the side
but at the same time this is also easy
to connect just without that feature too
so I can't say that that's very very
good but someone was now done it before
no problem they'll probably like that
it's a smaller a smaller base as
compared to that one which is kind of
big and I feel like the distance between
the orb and the base is a little bit
bigger if you compare it to that one
this speaker has a rechargeable battery
so you can just plug it in here and it
will charge it or using any other
changes that you get that you use for
your for charging your phones and stuff
like that so that's really handy I do
like it but like I said as far sounds
it's not the best but it's way when a
couple times better than your regular
phone so I would say instead of playing
music using is your phone this would be
actually better
okay so I've decided to do a sound test
outside just so you can get a feel of
what the speaker will sound like outside
because most of the portable speakers
you know are mostly used when you're
outside you know enjoying music outside
where you don't have access to your
better sounding plug-in speakers so
here's the test
it's it's not the worst it's not the
worst speaker it's way better than just
using your phone so I personally love it
and I can see myself using it but yeah
so that's been the review if you have
any questions about the speaker or
anything like that just let me know in
the comments down below and I will talk
to you in the next video peace okay
let's see
thanks for watching and I will see you
in the next one peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
