welcome to another sound battle where we
let speakers speak for themselves in the
battlefield so that we have the sony SRS
XP 30 versus the SRS XP 31 there is
definitely a difference is physically
between the two but we will be listening
to them and see if there is any
improvements in the sound department and
remember the prices I just shown you
might not be right by the time you're
watching this video so for an up-to-date
pricing of these speakers please follow
my affiliate links down below for which
will also support the channel and I
appreciate that a lot so thank you as
usual I'll be using a high quality
binaural microphone so for the best
experience please use headphones with
that said let's hear the speaker's speak
I'm happy to have to win
I like to do something crazy we should
try to run away it's been so long since
I've been myself and you forget so fast
how to live inside me
volcanic love light pulses I was gonna
say say clown fish jumping put your
backside now it's a while pick your jaw
Chapel my blow Freddie Freeman just
nothing in the weekend so you know it up
okay so it sounds like Sony only
concentrated on the physical design
upgrade and actually waterproofing the
speaker and not so much on the sound
which is not bad because the XP 30
didn't sound bad the XP 31 is a little
bit louder than the XP 30 and while both
speakers cut best at maximum volume the
XP 31 leaves you with a little bit more
in its sound than the XP 30 but this is
not something very very noticeable on
the other hand the highest of the XP 30
are a little bit better than those of
the XP 31 but also this is now by a lot
honestly as far as sound between this
tube the biggest difference is the fact
that the XP 31 has the live sound mode
which the XP thoroughly does not so if
you own the XP 30 there is really no
reason to upgrade to the XP 31 unless
you like the live sound mode on the XP
31 and want a piece of it or you love
the new design the new charging port
most especially which I love that they
finally join the rest of the world right
when the world was moving towards the
USBC but I'll still take it and lastly
if you want to have a completely
waterproof speaker but if sound is your
main reason to upgrade to the newest
speaker there isn't really much of that
here so I would sleep with the XP 30 all
the XP 3 for that matter because
honestly it kind of sounds like these
two speakers here but if you don't own
the XP 30 or the XP three you should
probably go with the XP 31 just because
it's newer it's waterproof and it has
more features on the XP 30 and XP 3 what
do you guys think drop me a comment down
below if you're new here please
subscribe so you don't miss out on the
upcoming videos if you liked the video
leave it a like if you didn't like it
leave a dislike I just want to get some
sort of feedback from you because you
the video thanks for watching this one I
will see you in the next one peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
