welcome to another sound battle where we
let speakers speak for themselves in a
battlefield today we have the JBL
boombox going up against the all-new GPL
extreme - I did full detailed review
videos for each of these speakers so if
you're looking for detailed reviews for
any one of these I will put the links to
those videos in the description section
below but this will only be about sound
comparisons and as usual I'll be using a
high quality binaural microphone so for
the best experience please use
headphones with that said let's hear the
speaker's speak
okay so considering the size and power
output of the boombox the extreme to
just has no chance of coming out louder
and the boombox is quite significantly
louder than the extreme - well the sound
signature of the - is closed there are a
few notable differences between them the
best performance of the boombox is way
better than what you get only extreme -
it goes deeper in indoor mode and in
outdoor mode it's best also comes out
boom ear and louder than what's coming
out of the extreme - and while both
speakers have the same size of Twitter's
when playing at maximum volume the highs
on the extreme - sound a little bit
better than those of the JBL boom box
playing at maximum volume and as for the
mids I also think the extreme two is
doing a better job and the memes that
one area where I always feel like I'm
missing out when I'm using the boom box
now both speakers prioritize best they
are both best heavy speakers but the
boom box is just taking it a little step
further and also giving you a chance to
decide how you like your best by giving
you the choice to decide between the
endo and outdoor mode which both and
will change the best performance which
is something I was kind of expecting
only extreme - but we definitely did not
get that which is a bummer
maybe the extreme 3 who knows with that
said the overall sound quality of the
extreme 2 is better than that of the
boom box it's better balanced and sounds
cleaner
however for someone looking for the
loudest the most bears you cannot go
wrong with the boom box what do you
think let me know in the comment section
below
