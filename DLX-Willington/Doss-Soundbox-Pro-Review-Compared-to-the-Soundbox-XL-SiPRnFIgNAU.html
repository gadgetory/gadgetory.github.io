and this is the dose sound box parole
speaker that might look familiar to some
of you and the reason is this is the
Sony S aureus XV 30 as you can tell
ie almost 100% sure almost 100% sure
that it influenced the design of this
guy here I mean the only thing that's so
different is the layout of the buttons
on here and the front is a little bit
slightly slightly different but not by
much she can literally tell that while
they do that I don't get it
anyways but yeah this is the sound box
Pro and right away the unboxing
experience is not going to be any
different this kind of average you get
in a box you get the speaker itself the
micro USB cord and the paperwork stuff
nothing fancy
anyways with that said what do you find
around the speaker in the back here you
will find your micro USB port for
charging the speaker audio in input
right here and a TF card reader so if
you can put music on a micro micro SD
card you can put it right in there and
play music off of there and on top here
you have your power button the extra
bass like Sony has and then you have the
ad here that's for connecting to
speakers because it's compatible you can
connect up to two speakers and we're
going to try that out here because I
have two of them so yes and then you
volume control buttons on there and play
pause then you have that ring of light
you know
kind of like on the Sony but anyways I'm
gonna start doing that because it's not
what we're talking about but you guys
can tell anyway so this is the speaker
right here it's IP x5 rated which means
it is splash proof
I'm although on Amazon they say it's
waterproof I wouldn't I feel like
waterproof is at ipx7 and above which is
ipx7 and ipx8 but i would say do not
submerge this in water it's not
waterproof it's not completely
waterproof it is splash proof so you can
splash water on it and you'll be fine
but it's not completely waterproof so
don't go by what they sell amazon page
waterproof anyways besides the design
looking familiar the actual build
quality it does feel pretty sound like
this is heavier but it's also bigger but
also if you feel how this feels it
really does feel pretty sturdy like it
doesn't feel fragile at all at all it's
pretty strong I feel like it's something
that can last you for some time
as far as build quality so that is
pretty good the only thing that I don't
really understand like the lights here
okay because when the volume is low the
lights do not react to to the sound
they're like kind of doing their own
thing so they it's not good but then
when the volume is all the way up they
just like go off like crazy like no
syncing to the sound or anything like
that which is what they're supposed to
be doing like going to the beat of the
song but they just go off which makes me
think that the the lights in here are
being controlled by some kind of sound
sensor like you know the width otherwise
I will react to whichever sound you make
and then they can change I feel like
it's the same thing here they're not
being controlled by the software but
rather with some sort of sound sensor in
here to to the point because usually
like with the
speakers you can play volume very very
low but they because they using software
of some sort of some sort of processing
before playing the music they they can
still react to music but this one here
when the volume is too low because the
sensor is not sensitive enough to to
hear it they don't do anything but when
the music is too high they just go off
crazy like any sound that it's coming
out of the speaker they are trying to
react to it so dislike so I don't really
like the lights on here so personally I
would just keep them off and not use
them at all but when you're playing
music around 50 to 60 percent in volume
they are fine so they they kind kind of
catch up to the sound of the music kind
of laggy but a little bit better medium
moderate volumes but high low useless so
you can get up to ten hours of play time
out of the speakers so that is not bad
the output power is 20 watts according
to this so before we talk about how it
sounds how about we do get some sound
samples and we can talk about it on the
other side but before actually we do I'm
going to show you the difference between
the sound the extra base on and extra
this off you know before we go ahead so
how about we listen to that first
and that's it I feel like I'm not a big
fan of the extra base on here and that's
because all it does is cut out the highs
on the speaker which makes it sound
covered and not very pleasant to my ears
it's not like lifting up the bass and
pumping stuff up I feel like maybe a
little bit but it's mainly mainly just
cutting out the highs and leaving
everything else and just the way it is
so nothing crazy I don't like the extra
bass on here so for the next songs I'm
going to be taking off the extra bass
and then for reference since I have the
sound box Excel how about I put that in
the center with this too to the sides
here and then we can see how this
playing in stereo mode compared to the
sound box Excel you know you can talk
about it on the other side and the
reason I'm doing that is you can't
really compare this to it it's I tried
it this this sounds so horrible compared
to this so rather than rather than going
through listening to these two and then
doing another comparison doing the two
against this let's just skip to these
two verses this guy right here because
this sounds really good and this mess is
just not a match
so we're just going to go right into two
of these playing in studio mode versus
the sound box Excel check it out
you have to win
and there you have it while the two are
not the worst sounding speakers on the
planet
and they have an amazing stereo image in
this kind of setup they're not the
greatest sounding speakers and not very
very pleasing to the ear this distortion
going on in here and actually let me
show you that I don't know if I we
quoted it right here yeah see I don't
know if you can hear that yeah there's
some sort of distortion going on in
there like this thoughts a little bit
like something something is not right so
I feel like they missed something here I
don't know it goes without saying but
there still does sound way better than
these two here I mean I do like the
studio image that you get from the two
light left-right if they do sound pretty
good in that way but as far as the sound
quality itself this is way better
I'll get this instead of getting two of
this and most especially if you're just
looking to getting one of these compared
to this this this is just no way
but yeah you heard it what do you think
would you get two of these instead of
this the highs actually did sound pretty
good like that
medium volume there they do the highs
that pretty good on this setup here they
do sound really good but I mean this
this sound that's coming out of here is
also really good you
directional it does not have as wide of
its to your image but at same time this
does sound there's a lot of destruction
going on on these speakers here and the
sound is not well balanced you don't
have as much bass as you have here so
this just can just can't win but what do
you guys think what do you think drop me
a comment down below and I would really
appreciate that if you're new here don't
forget to subscribe it really helps out
I do have links to all these speakers
and my gadgets that I use making videos
down in a comment section below
so check the I mean check the
description section out down there for
all the links and all that about thanks
to you thank you for watching if you're
new here again please subscribe it
