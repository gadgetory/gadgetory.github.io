welcome to another sound battle where we
left speakers speak for themselves in
the battlefield so that we have the Onyx
studio 5
going up against the JBL boombox
in the boombox is running to 100 1
millimeter woofers - 20 millimeter
tweeters and is officially rated to go
as low as 50 Hertz well as on the other
side the studio 5 has one 120 millimeter
woofer and 125 millimeter tweeter and
it's also rated to go as low as 50 Hertz
on the frequency curve and as usual I'll
be using a high quality binaural
microphone so for the best experience
please use headphones and with I said
well let's hear the speaker's speak
okay so as expected and the boombox is
way louder than the studio five we're
talking something like ten decibel
difference as far as loudness so if the
loudest is what you're looking for well
there's two your five I mean the boombox
here is your guy
but while the studio five can't get as
loud as the boombox
it seems to do all the other things
sound better than the boombox
the highs a a little bit soft but not
bad I'm the meets out okay and the best
is great I mean if you look at the size
and price difference between these two
guys you expect the boombox to win this
battle by a lot of points but that's not
what's happening here
somehow the best coming out of the
studio five is richer and deeper than
what the boombox is able to deliver um
this is something that I wasn't really
expecting when I was getting into this
video I mean the thing might not be as
big and might not be as loud and might
look like a handbag but man does it have
some good richness and it's not just the
best on the studio five is generally the
best balanced speaker between these two
like the balance between the best meats
and highs is better than what they did
with a boombox here most especially with
their the mix on the boombox really died
out a lot they suffer a lot and the
highs on here
I also a little bit like Grammy I want
to say I don't know if that's the right
word but they don't sound very good
they're a little bit to her sometimes
like mr. Stoker at high volumes but
between the two balance wise this was
this is a well balanced speaker in
comparison to the boombox so not just
the best but overall it's a well
balanced speaker so if you add a better
best performance which is something that
you would have expected on the boombox
it is a well packaged speaker I feel
like the only reason to get the boombox
over this to do five
if you want well the loudness cuz it's
way louder than this to your five but
also this is studio sound output it has
two drivers
well four drivers but it outputs this to
your output well as this is just mono
just directional one one stream of music
and well as and also this is waterproof
this does not have any sort of
waterproofing we do something I feel
like at least they should have given an
giving it an IP x5 maybe something like
that but everything is just exposed like
that so not waterproof no protection at
all so if those are the things that you
value yeah then the boombox would go for
it but if you're going specifically and
mainly for which one sounds better and
has more value to it I mean for $200
compared to over $400 like twice the
price the sound that you're getting out
of the studio five is way better than
what's coming out of the boom box and
that's comparing the price the size like
this was a little bit of a
disappointment like for speaker this
size to come out and just outperform it
most especially in best performance
because that's the only thing the first
thing that you kind of think about when
you see a speaker that is this big
called boom box and then coming out with
the studio 5 and it gives you that rich
best that is just this cannot quite get
to it's just amazing you go down I'll
come there and help you okay
anyway so what do you guys think I'd
really like to hear that in the comment
section below and if you plan on picking
up one of these or you just want to see
what the current the current pricing on
the speakers is they usually go and sell
I'll put the links down in the
description section below so you can use
those and go check them out
it doesn't really add any price to what
you would pay if you just somehow went
to the site to Amazon and barri there
but when you use the links it really
helps me out it helps the channel out
and I really really do appreciate you
guys will actually go through with that
so yeah if a new here please subscribe
so you don't miss out on the upcoming
videos that I'm working on already hello
random like I hope you like it because I
got see you next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
