Wilmington here and welcome to this
giveaway video but before anything at
all allow me said thank you to all of
you my subscribers around this time last
year I had about 500 subscribers and I
want to say thank you thank you to the
500 that we had then who are still here
and thank you to the 4500 plus that have
joined ever since then
to be honest you guys are the reason why
I keep going you are the fuel that keeps
me going and not because I don't like
making videos for fun but there's just
something about knowing that I have a
group of people out there who like what
I do and stake and always come back to
see and comment and you know just love
what I do is it's amazing you guys keep
me going and I say thank you very much
for keeping up and always coming back to
the channel I'm working on many other
things I'm planning on expanding the
channel so we can look at other products
still in the audio I'm in the audio
category at least for now but yeah I
planning on doing some things better
because I know how I'm not perfect in
what I do and I always work on expanding
and making things better so you guys
actually enjoy and get something out of
my videos but this video is about a
giveaway so like I said before I had I
have two of these the SRS XP charities
and I promised you guys that I would
give away one of them
to somebody because I don't really need
to I mean I lost to your music but why
not give away one for you guys so so
this is here and as I said I would have
some other things to throw in and this
is the chromecast Audio from Google and
I I've actually never opened it I think
for some reason did not after buying it
I didn't feel like using it I don't know
so if you interested in this yeah that's
something I'm going to give away and the
reason I'm doing this is so instead of
just giving away one thing to one person
the more people I can give something to
other thank you you know the better so
and I have the third things here I'm not
sure how many of you are Carta base but
they yet they do exist this is a
headphone amplifier yes so this is feel
and it's e11 custom the model number is
e 11 if you don't know about it you can
google it these are pretty cool things
if you need one what it does actually is
first of all it can amplify the music
that you're listening to it's really
tiny like it and then should open it
it's very small like it's meant to be
portable so you can put it in your in
your pocket and walk with it while I'm
working on your audio so this is the
actual size of it it's really tiny it
just goes right into your pocket but it
has a couple settings on here like the
EQ saying basically keep your headphones
you don't have enough base in them and
you want to boost this kind of works
like a bass booster like you can put it
on it has like three
yes three settings and has the gain
control and here if you're going with
your headphones are not very loud Alice
not as loud as you want them to be yes
they have a setting on there and so um
yeah this is here so those are the three
things I'm going to give away um I don't
know um if you if there's one thing here
that you want to win I want you to
display the comment down below of the
name of whatever you want to win so just
comment down the words you want it's our
six facility just yeah I will win the X
be 30 or I want a X be 30 or just X be
30 the same thing for the chrome audio
chromecast Audio or the feel xi
headphone amplifier so whatever you want
to win just put it down below and I will
choose three people or pick three people
randomly who will win whoever commented
which product that they want to win yeah
so and you have to be subscribed you
have to be a subscriber this is a thank
you to the subscribers so if you're not
a subscriber you have to either
subscribe or you you probably won't
learn anything this is a thank you to
the subscribers the other thing I wanted
to say on the last I think four weeks I
haven't uploaded anything and the two
main reasons one is mainly mainly
because of work I'm only home only
during the weekend and yes I have a
family and got two boys and you know I
have a wife so if you if your home just
a weekend you have you want you want
time to spend with your family and yeah
work just kind of sucks right now but it
does not really give me time to work on
YouTube videos to speak
demanding of us we have to be far far
far from home so we we stay in hotels
most of the time and then come back home
just for the weekend so it's going
through just July - July and so at the
end of the month by next month we should
be able to have videos the same way the
reason number two is we've just moved so
I'm not in the in the room that you guys
are used to Alicia you can kind of tell
the difference by the way the room
sounds and how it looks back there it's
kind of different I haven't really
figured out what to do to that wall and
all that you know setting up stuff in
here but yeah that has been taking a lot
of my time so but as soon as this is
done I promise we're going to be going
back to two to three videos a week I
have you know a couple speakers a new
here that I haven't showed you guys and
some of the ones actually that I
realized I have not shown you guys I
don't know stuff isn't going on a lot
here but I have there involved plus the
revolt plus in the house and I'll be
working on it but like I said I don't
have a lot of time so things a little
bit slower but that video should be
going out pretty soon so you watch out
for that other than that um thanks for
watching and I wish you luck I wish I
could give away more than these things
to more people but yeah this is our half
for now and yeah thanks for watching if
for some reason you found this video and
you're not subscribed to the channel go
ahead and do it because it's free and it
really helps me out a lot and I was
really appreciate it but my subscribers
thanks again good luck and I will see
you in the next video peace
