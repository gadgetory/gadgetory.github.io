going on down in Las Vegas I'm not there
but I've been able to see quite a few
speakers that have been announced over
there and this video is kind of just to
give you an idea of what to expect in
this to do as far as Bluetooth speakers
JBL has announced a few speakers that
JBL flip five will be coming out in 2019
the design doesn't look very different
from the foot four but maybe two things
they've seen they're different and
that's the charging port has moved from
microUSB to a USB type-c pretty cool um
the only other thing that I'm seeing is
that they have something that they were
calling their new racetrack shaped
driver driver driver which means we are
moving away from the studio duo drivers
that we had on a flip phone down to
single driver like they did with the
charge for I don't like that move but
listen to it and see and they say it
should have a better best performance
which is probably true because the JBL
changeful not by a lot but i did a
little bit better than the GBO it shot
three so fingers crossed I'm kind of
excited to get my hands on it they also
announced the JBL JR pop which it looks
like this been out for maybe a month or
so already but I hadn't gotten my hands
to it and I didn't know it was actually
out there until today and when I saw it
being announced over there at CES but
it's a kid-friendly speaker not in a way
that it was sensor they you know bad
words out for kids but just that the
kids can play with it and it won't break
it's ipx7 rated it can play for up to
five hours I believe and it has a little
ring light on it it comes in six colors
so they announced some of the things
obviously but I've mostly focused on
Bluetooth speakers so I'm going
to move on to Sony and Sony refreshed
all no not all of them but most of the
SRS XP series of speakers they announced
SRA the SRS XP 12 and that's succeeding
the SRS XP 10 pretty cool it looks like
the only difference here that I've seen
is that it's now completely waterproof
not water-resistant like the SFA's XP 10
was they also announced the SRS XP 22
this one coming in replacing the SRS xB
21 and this one here not really much
defense time the same drivers same
everything except they are moving away
from the old fabric design to some
fabric and some plastic I kind of liked
the previous models you know the way
they were designed that all fabric but
all they've also changed the wrapping of
the writing still one light one single
color LED light there but completely
different kind of design about the same
size it looks like but yeah and also
they also mentioned the SRS XP 32
replacing the SRS XP 31 again nothing
else is different
except for the design of the speakers
and I kind of also hate it looks like
they still have microUSB charging I feel
like they should move over to USB type-c
like JBL is doing and I was expecting
them to do is that at least you know
with this release of this speakers but
yes they're sticking to their guns that
still running looks like I could be
wrong it really does look like it's
microUSB charging and nobody asked me
said anything about the USB type-c so
yes micro USB charging still on there
this is where I would say they announced
the SRS XP 42 but I haven't seen
anything about that I'm not sure if
that's keeping bad for this you were not
rebranding or refresh I don't know but
it looks like there's no SRS XP 42 at
least
what I think they would have named it I
don't know I haven't said anything about
that I'm not sure if they're not doing
that or they're going to release that
later
I don't know anyways they also announced
the gtk xb7 and - and judging by the
dimensions and everything it looks like
the size of the gtk xb9 a which we
looked at I don't know of a year ago or
something it is quite big lots of lights
on it and yeah we'll be checking that
out when it comes out moving on what
you're looking at here is actually not a
grill sunny he's not making drills just
yet but what you're seeing here is
another speaker that they have announced
its code the GT k PG ten it looks like
it's a kind of tailgate kind of speak
here that you can bring out and outdoors
and use the flaps come open they have a
lot of things going on this is one this
one is really interesting and I really
want to check it out so I will probably
be checking it out I was going for about
$250 kind of a steep price but yeah we
will be picking that one up and checking
it out just because it kind of it's
really interesting and I don't know I
want to check it out so stay tuned for
that interesting speaker and we'll be
looking at it as soon as it comes out
okay so the video is getting a little
bit longer than I was intending to so
agreed so we will be going through these
other ones pretty quick try bit
announcer speaker 2 they announced the
max sound plus and looks a lot like the
sound go but I don't feel it'll be big
or something I couldn't see any good
pictures of it but yeah we'll be
probably checking that one out - Paul
audio POW poor audio also announced an
interesting speaker is called more I'm
kind of interested in this one it's a
collapsible pocket speaker they connects
to your phone magnetically so you can
have sound instantly like forever I know
that it's kind of gimmicky but kind of
interesting I want kind of to check it
out so we might be looking at
this here anchor also announced some new
speakers the a new line called rave
series looks like there it looks like
they're also joining the party light
speakers also I'm interested in the rave
itself because it looks more interesting
and has lice and all that so we will be
checking that one out for sure and they
also announced a smaller version of that
the rave meaning but they also announced
some other smaller speakers the icon and
icon mini so quite a few speakers oh my
gosh sorry nineteen is gonna be crazy
obviously you want to be stay you want
to stay tuned subscribe so you don't
miss out when those videos when the
speakers coming to the studio those
videos start coming out this video is
getting really long and I want to stock
it so it is anything I've missed I
didn't write it down or it's just out of
my brain right now but it's kind of wait
