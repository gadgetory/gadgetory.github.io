welcome to another sound battle where we
let speakers speak for themselves in the
battlefield there we have the sony SRS
XP 41 versus the JBL extreme this has
been the most requested video in the
last 2 weeks or so so let's get it out
of the way a reminder here I already did
the review of the XP 41 and I also
compared it to the XP 40 in that video
so if you haven't watched it yet I will
leave a link to it down below for you
back to this video to the battlefield
JBL brought to 35 millimeter twitter's
to 63 millimeter woofers and 2p ours on
the sites of the speaker on the other
hand sony brought to 58 millimeter full
range drivers and to PRS one in the
centre front and the center back as
usual I'll be using a high quality
binaural microphone so for the best
experience please use headphones with
that done let's hear the speakers speak
I'm happy to make and you have to with
me
Wow
you
it's like mapping
about 20
okay so as far as loudness you can't go
wrong with any one of these there are
about the same in that sense and the
biggest change I've noticed in the XP 41
is that it doesn't cut out its base at
maximum volume as much as the XP fully
did so that is good and overall the best
performance of the XP 41 is better than
that of the Xtreme most especially at
extremely low volumes and as the love
frequency response test pointed out the
XP for the one goes a lot deeper than
the grbl extreme when it comes to low
best notes however there's a little bit
of upper base hanging out in the midst
of the XP 41 which makes it sound a
little bit muddy in the lack of the
hives to complement it makes the overall
sound of the speaker not very pleasant
the extreme is not a perfect speaker and
I wouldn't recommend you to buy one
right now because it's not waterproof
like the XP 41 and it has battery issues
and most especially the extreme two will
be out in probably less than a month so
if you really need an extreme I would
probably wait until the two comes out
and then decide but anyways I think the
extreme has a better overall sound in
comparison to the XP 41 the bass might
not go as deep in the mids are not as
pronounced but the highs from the
tweeters are a very very good compliment
to its sound I think it takes the win
here do you agree
look I love that Sony has a ton of
features on their speakers but I feel
like that ignoring the sound aspect of
things I mean sure you can use this Sony
music up and tweak the sound a little
bit to your taste but I don't know what
do you guys think likes really help out
so please drop me one and if you do like
the video also feel free to leave a
dislike please subscribe if you're new
here and you haven't subscribed yet
follow me on Twitter and thank you for
watching this one I will cut you in
next one piece</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
