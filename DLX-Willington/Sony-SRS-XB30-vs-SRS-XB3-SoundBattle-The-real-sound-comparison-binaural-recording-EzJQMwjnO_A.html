and welcome to another sound battle
well that speakers speak for themselves
in the battlefield today we have the
sony srs XP 30 going up against the XB 3
so judging by the price and the size
it's safe to say that the XB 30 is the
successor of the XB 3 there is
definitely differences between the two
but we will be listening to them and see
if there is any improvements in the
sound department if you're new here
please consider subscribing it's free
and it really helps out the channel it
also ensures that you don't miss out on
the upcoming videos in this battle the
speakers will be playing at 70 percent
volume and I'll be using a high quality
binaural microphone so put your
headphones on for the best experience
with that said let's hear the speaker's
speak oh don't go now wait just a minute
I've got something to say oh oh I'm
happy to make that oh yeah you have to
admit
another round till disco ball pop but I
have to beat these everyone see anger is
this place no hate me
this is a tough one isn't it so judging
by the sound of the - yes the XP 30 is
replacing the XP three with extra base
off the speakers sound almost identical
to each other
although the XP 30 is a little bit
softer but when you turn extra base on
this is when you start to hear some
differences in the sound of the two I've
not been a big fan of the extra base on
the XP 3 because it only lifted up the
mids to give you a sense of a bigger
vest without really increasing the
actual bit and it doesn't really sound
that clean to me but with the XP 30 the
extra base actually concentrates on
boosting the best the lower frequency
and leaves the mids and highs alone for
the most part the stickers about the
same when it comes to loudness and they
both decrease the best outputs at
maximum volume but you are left with a
little bit of mode based on XP 30 than
the xp3 on these high volumes overall I
do like the sound coming out of the XP
30 the improvement in sound is not huge
but it is there so for this battle the
XP 30 takes my vote I think it's an
overall improvement to the XP three in
sound with a bonus of a light show but
that's just me and I know sound is
awesome
Directive I would like to hear what you
guys have to say in the comment section
below if you're new here don't forget to
subscribe so you don't miss out on
upcoming videos thanks for watching and
I will see you in the next one peace
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
