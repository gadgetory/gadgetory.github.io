welcome to another video this is the
sound link micro the smallest speaker
that both now offers it's a very small
speaker about the size of this JBL clip
- it's a little bit bigger than the JBL
go and the mover to see but if you add
price and performance adding these guys
into the mix of competition is perfectly
fair we're going to be taking a closer
look at it listen to it and see if it's
worth the price stay tuned
what I have here is orange but you can
also get it in black and midnight blue
so just like the sound without a - you
also have multiple color options
unlike the revolve and revolve + and
both meant these to be a speaker that
you can bring with you pretty much
anywhere enhance the ipx7 rating which
essentially just means it is completely
waterproof even if you submerged it into
water it will be fine I totally
personally tested that and it still
sounds good as new so just like the clip
2 has equipped and the road 2 has a
lanyard for you know putting it places
Bose has what they are calling a tear
resistant shrub basically a fancy name
for thick rubber you can use it to strap
it on a ton of stuff like your bag you
buy your pants tree branches basically
you can use it to strap it on anything
that is not too thick for it and
basically the way this truck works is it
has a little hook on the underside which
goes into the little hole on the back of
the speaker and when I was using it this
thing really stays in married somehow
grubs in there pretty good and it does
not come out I have no problems with it
when I was trying it out looking at the
front of the speaker here you will find
volume rockers and the
function button and on top the power
button the battery indicator lights a
microUSB port for charging the speaker
and finally the Bluetooth button and no
there is no flap covering the microUSB
port
I think this water filled it from the
inside you know kind of like what
flagship smartphones are doing lately oh
and again there is no audio jack on here
you know kind of like what flagship
smartphones are doing lately I
personally I personally don't think I'll
be missing it but if you're the kind of
person who likes to listen to hard wired
music this one is not for you the only
option you have is Bluetooth the speaker
has little feet on the back to help it
be stable when being used on a flat
surface but also to ensure that you
don't block that base port at the back
if you buy two of these you can connect
them together using the Bose Connect app
I mean you can listen to them either in
stereo mode or party mode and the
speaker can also be connected to play
together with the Bose revolve or
revolve class okay so that's enough
talking about the speaker how good is
the sound quality well as usual I will
let you guys listen to the speaker but
before that let me know what speakers
you'd like to see battle against this
boss micro in the comment section below
doing the sample going to play I will be
recording and using high quality
binaural microphones so for the best
experience I recommend wearing
headphones
I know love this day it seems to me that
everything as I'm so happy feels like
I'm in the phone please come I will need
your help I think it's time okay my
everything
and
you'll stay with a paper trail say what
a big house in the Hills Jimenez same
with the money yet in the best sex lube
and I'm paying it what I see is cream
money all around me girl be the queen
bee if something fishy about my girl
and there you have it
the sound that's coming out of this
little guy small as it is it's just
amazing being able to hear some best
that much bass coming out of this little
guy is unbelievably good I think both is
really really on to something here now
the bass coming out of the speaker is
not perfect but considering the size of
the speaker that is producing it it is
good the sony xba-1 someone asked me
which one is the smaller speaker that
they can get with the most best as that
comes out of it this has been my go-to
speaker but ever since trying this the
difference is so big the best coming out
of here considering is I'd say out says
smaller than the xB 10 but how small
best than the XP 10 has to offer it's
definitely the speaker out recommend to
anybody who is looking for the smallest
speaker they can get but with the most
best that they can get out of it Alice
from the ones I've tried this has this
is the smaller speaker with the most
base that you can get out of the speaker
I think the sound of this speaker is
closer to that of the JBL flip 3 now we
will definitely be doing videos of
comparing these two in the XP 10 and
other speakers that you guys might want
so if you're not subscribed make sure
you do so you don't miss those videos
when they go up now of course I'll be
doing a lot more listening to the
speaker with a bunch more other songs
and if I find anything new I will report
it in the upcoming videos but as of
right now I love what I'm hearing out of
this
speaker there's a pretty good balance
between the highs the mids and the lows
and the fact that is 360 sounds we can
just place them in a table in prison 360
or you can listen to it directional I
mean it is a good speaker I like what
I'm hearing as of right now alright is
it what the price for someone who is
working for exactly this size of speaker
and that kind of sound it probably is
because you're not going to find any
speaker that in that is in this font
factor this size at least from the ones
that I tested that sounds close to this
that sounds like this at least in as far
as bass goes so if this is exactly the
size and sound are you looking for it's
probably worth it because you're not
going to find anything in this foam
factor why they said that sounds as good
as this but also I might just be a cheap
person but I think it's a little bit
overpriced and I hope but the price that
they have up right now is more of the
launch price in that the prices will go
a little bit down in a couple months or
so because I feel like it's a little bit
of a price a hundred and ten dollars for
this thing I don't know but like I said
if this is exactly what you're looking
for it's probably justifiable because
it's a small speaker and it sounds
pretty good for its size so maybe it is
justifiable but let me know what you
think did you pay that for this speaker
or not let me know what you think in the
comment section below and also likes
help other people find the channel so if
you like the video please give it a like
and if you're new here subscribe so you
don't miss on the upcoming videos that
will be coming
soon I love you all and I will see you
in the next one peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
