looking here and welcome to this video
okay so I'm actually getting ready to
leave for a trip and but I just got this
and I didn't want to leave because I'll
be going for about a week and I didn't
want to leave you know without checking
them out so I decided to do this video
so we can kind of get a first look and
how they look like and in comparison to
the older generation that these guys are
replacing I do have the xB 32x be 22 and
the xB 12 right here and at the end of
the video I think I will have time to do
a quick recording so you guys have a
little bit of a sound sample on how they
sound like so at the end of the video I
will give you guys a good high-quality
binaural recording sound sample anyway
so we're going to start with it
xB 10x B 12 right here from what it
looks like I don't think there's any big
difference this is the xB 10 right here
I do have this box and from looking at
the main features mainly City design
kind of looks the same but if you look
at the features right here that they
mainly a different eyes on the box it
looks like you know the main difference
I'm seeing here is that this is the X
b12 is ip67 rated so it's completely
waterproof and dustproof or as the older
guys it is only water resistant just IP
x5 so that's the main difference that
I'm seeing here
we still micro USB charging for some
reason sony is not moving the XP time
into the USB type C charging generation
so that's kind of sucks but yeah so it's
basically looks like the same thing the
only difference is just a water proofing
so
this one is now completely waterproof or
as this guy was only water resistant so
that is cool but we'll see how sound
wise things compare let's open this
stuff and take a look at it so you get
your paperwork stuff right there the
little guy
oh this truck is different that strap is
different and yep micro USB right here
kind of disappointing I don't know why
they're not moving over to USB type-c
I've heard this little bit more
expensive to produce
maybe that's why cutting cost yeah this
is the guy I got a blue one because
that's all that you had I didn't have
any college or instance getting these so
whatever they had is what I got so yes
let's get their older guys so we can
kind of compare them a little quick on
how they look like this is the xB 10
right here so right off the bat look at
that I think they redesigned this I
think it's for the best
it looks kind of nicer and the bottom
here this had a texture on it and this
one does not is the same design up here
saying here so and it's the same thing
as far as buttons everything is saying a
little bit different layout but yeah
and the charging is back here to kind of
looks the same but we had a micro in the
auxiliary input same thing here so I'm
not really seeing in a big difference it
just disrupts which I don't know if this
is a good idea cuz I know this is kind
of nice why you could sit set the
speaker up to just sit like that so you
can kind of face if you don't want it to
be sitting just straight like that but
they've changed that now they don't give
you that option I guess you can still
lay it down if you still want like not
very nice but yet so in the grill this
is a completely different I'm driver if
you can see in there this is different
than this on here and then the grill is
also larger holes if you can tell in the
video up there this is larger the holes
are larger so you can see the speaker
well as these ones are pretty tight so
how does the strap work I do like this
to color kind of combination here
is this where I'm being embarrassed
right now because I can't figure out of
this
really it's a way too much work okay so
this is kind of lame
it works like a button wait this is the
eye for the button and this is the
button right here that's kind of lame
this a lot of work jeez I don't like
this why not just do a snap maybe yeah
not a big fan of this it's a lot of work
I mean if you're just gonna be hooking
it onto stuff is okay but you have to
loop it over something check this off
we'll pair and hook it back in and then
technically taking it off is also going
to be work that's not really cool anyway
so turn it on if you come this time
battery yeah
XP 22 this is the guy okay so let's see
what they advertise on here as the main
things all right sister XP 21 and Wanda
is being replaced from working on here
basically everything looks about the
same on here I don't see any big
difference at all
but obviously the design is different so
yes that's the old guy let's look inside
and actually it looks like
get loose the guy a guy in black 622 is
the only car they high like I said
anything I got today I didn't really
choose a collet cuz this is all they had
and the speakers right here paperwork
stuff and micro USB charging why nice
Ani
why alright micro USB charging not very
interesting so that's that as far as
design completely different I mean it's
kind of has the same kind of look kind
of round a little bit round on that you
can see but this is more rounded the new
guy is more rounded off than the older
guy and about the same size you can see
if
I'm sorry this is a tiny bit a tiny bit
bigger but they're mostly the same and
as far as the buttons here the same
layout kind of power volume rockers
play/pause this one has a live sound
mode right there I think this this does
not have it you would have to go into
the the app to activate that I'd fail it
but they put it live on here life for
life sound mode is live on here which is
pretty cool
as far as the back here they look I
didn't go okay
so cool lighting still just the one
color white like this one there there's
an also give you just a one color
whichever color you have so this one has
to read because it's a red speaker and
yes so nothing very very different
except for they design now I'm as far as
design I'm not quite sure if I thank you
it guys it kind of looks better like
what do you guys think how if I like
this plastic like the rubber rubbery
feel but I do like the way they kind of
made the light look like and I it makes
me wonder if next year they're going to
make this go all the way across
I mean they kind of started there right
there
so they're interesting but going to move
on to the X b32
going through this movie fast and now
the X be 32 actually says 24 hours of
playtime right on the box
which is the same thing that this guy
here was also advertised for 24 hours of
playtime is to the xB 31 which is the
previous model that this guy is
replacing because you didn't know
and looking at the main features that
were advertised if you work on here this
is the new guy everything is pretty much
the same the only difference I'm seeing
on all these speakers is that they're
now including this salty water safe
salty water proof for everybody wanna
call it and that's not something that
they were I'm claiming on this I'm the
older guys so I wonder if that's the
only improvement that be oh and when if
that's why they actually decided to take
off the the quad or the material that
they used for this older guys I wonder
if these are not good for salty water so
they ditched that and went with a rubber
maybe but let's see how the xB 32 looks
like get this whiny blue and what do you
get paperwork stuff and micro USB again
I don't know why I feel like this it's
not cool Sony USB see everything ok this
is not cool at all
the xB 31 this is the older version
right here and this is the new guy right
here as you can clearly tell so the
buttons layout here is the same thing
same same but I also added the live
sound mode I don't know why they're
adding that is it like really nice do
people use it a lot like that make it
easy for people instead of the extra
best feature to be right there
I feel like that'd make a lot more sense
but that's probably people who love live
sound mode maybe I'm not a huge fan of
it and here you are same thing you know
they have a charging charging spot they
have to charge your device hungry power
power-hungry device the same button
layout pretty much everything in here is
the same I think that is some size like
I don't see any difference in size this
looks a little bit fatter here if I
think's because this one is around it
off so it looks a little bit smaller but
it's basically this that is same size
and as first design I don't know like I
dig like this pretty nice but I also do
like kind of like this design right here
I don't know what do you guys think um
like the Wyatt see how that wraps around
how far it goes all the way to the back
here you guys see that all the way to
the back it's the same kind of lights
that they used on this they just this
redesign them to look a little bit
different so that is pretty cool and if
see the sony logo is not here anymore
like they did here and they also have
those little feet down there but big
sony word
down there I personally don't know what
I think about the design of it it's not
bad but it's also not like oh it's so
much better than the other one so I
don't know I think the design is okay I
don't know what to say as far as it
looks like it's mainly how they look
like is the main thing that has changed
and everything else has stayed pretty
much the same of course I haven't
listened to them and I'm probably going
to be bringing maybe the xp3 to on the
trip with me so I can listen to listen
to it but most of these I'll be I'll
have to come back for my try before I
can actually listen to them extensively
and then come back with a full-on
detailed review and sound battles so I
want you guys to let me know in a
comment section below what you want to
see as far as sound battles have a food
mind but I know a lot of you are going
to ask for but yes let me know what you
want to see in the description section
down there
I don't I will eventually put links to
these speakers down there when they are
available on Amazon so you can easily
just shop for them down there but as of
right now this is what I have I'm gonna
go upstairs in my recording room and
record these guys for you guys
so you can kind of get a feel of how
they sound like in this video and then
later on in the sound battle videos we
will be taking an extensive look and you
know sound comparison to other speakers
and see what they did different we'll
also be doing this you know sound battle
these two and then this one with this
guy here this one here with the X be 10
so we'll be seeing if they did any
changes as far as sound between the
older version
in the new version so yes stay tuned for
that thank you for watching this I'm not
sure how often I'll be posting videos on
next week I'll be going but I'll try to
this one is probably gonna be up when
I'm already there so won't be too long
okay
all right so that's been it for this
video enjoy the sound samples coming up
I'll be using a high quality binaural
microphone so for the best experience
please use headphones while you listen
and I will see you in the next video
