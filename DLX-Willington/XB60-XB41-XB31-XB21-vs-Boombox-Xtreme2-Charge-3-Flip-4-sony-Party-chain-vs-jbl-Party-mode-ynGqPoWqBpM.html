welcome to another sound battle where we
let speakers speak for themselves in the
battlefield today we have well I feel
like we should call this the gang battle
because we have the gang of Sony
speakers going up against a gang of JBL
speakers on the sunny side we have the
GT kxp 16 ganged up with a 41:31 and the
21 and then on GB outside we have the
boombox ganged up with the extreme to
the charge 3 and the flip phone and I
also wanted to mention that with a GT
carry speakers while Sony speakers all
speakers will have an extra best own and
on JBL side or the speakers will be
playing well they don't have any mode so
except for the boombox so on a boombox
the first couple of songs also I will
have it playing in indoor mode and then
for the rest of the songs we will be
going into on the outdoor mode I also
have quite a few sound sample a little
bit more than no more just because I
want to give you guys as many sound
samples like different songs to help you
kind of understand I don't know I just
thought it would be better that way so
but feel free to skip through if you
want to I'll be putting up what I guess
and skip guide during the sound sample
yes so you know where to skip to if you
want to do that otherwise I think we can
go ahead with this video I'll be using a
high quality binaural microphone so for
the best experience
the best experience please use
headphones with that said let's hear the
speaker's speak
this day it seems to me has been so fast
feels like it's down
summer news special plane stop get there
bill I'd like to do something crazy we
should try to run away
all right so what do you guys think I
think both setups are not terrible and
if you're looking just for the loudest
setup of the two it still won't be any
easier because according to my DB meter
I got about 100 point five on a sunny
setup and I got a read of one hundred
point three on JBL setup so basically
the loudness difference is not also that
big so that about the same that's how I
read it and the DP meter was five feet
away from the speaker's doing the
measuring going into sound quality I do
like the highs on JBL set up better
I'm Sony's speakers are a little bit
weak when it comes to the highs and they
don't really even have that much texture
to them so I do prefer what is coming
out of the JBL speakers as far as highs
but on the other hand the meats on the
Sony's are better than those on JBL I
mean JBL setup has improved if you
compare it to last year when we did this
comparison but they're still not as good
or as pronounced as they are on Sony I'm
talking about the mid-range
so there's a little bit of an
improvement but still Sony is leading
the myths they come out more pronounced
than they do on JBL setup and lastly the
best performance thanks to the boombox
JBL is leading this department
comfortably sony is lagging behind in
the best performance it doesn't matter
if you have the extra bass on the Sony's
or off and it doesn't matter if they're
the boom box is in indoor mode or
outdoor mode the the GBO is to perform
better than the sun is set up hands down
last time i also talked about the
synchronization of music between the
different speakers and so
I was lagging behind pretty good in that
department I think we also had a few
songs that refused to sync up and it was
not very good but I'm happy to report
that when I was doing this setup Sony
actually performed it really good like
spot-on like JBL both sides sync to the
music previous seamlessly you couldn't
tell if the more than one speakers
playing on both sides so kudos to Sony
for stepping that game up cause last
year when we did this snap on this test
their speakers were not quite spot-on
you could hear a little bit of lag
between the different speakers so they
did a good job here I did not have any
problems with that as you can hopefully
tell it sounds like one speaker both
were the Sony set up and JBL set up and
the last thing I wanted to talk about is
pairing of speakers Sony's wireless
polishing is still pinging but to
connect it took me close to 15 minutes
just to get all those four speakers to
play in sync mainly because they could
not connect with each other I would
connect two of them and the three would
not connect I mean the adults would not
join the party and then I went to the
app I tried to use that I actually
downloaded the menu instead of reading
I'm like what am I doing wrong I was
doing everything right it's just wasn't
working like they were now could make
not connect to each other and I was able
to get them to connect after about 15
minutes it's a pain in the butt
now compare that to JBL speakers where
all you have to do turn them on
literally and then just press there they
connect plus button on all the speakers
top top top top and that working
together I think Sony needs to figure
out a way of just making that work
seamlessly like it's its way of a hassle
when you're trying to connect so new
speakers to play together it's
might be easier when you're just doing
two speakers with Sony but if that more
than 2 speakers it's a pain in the butt
I went into my app and disconnected all
the others from Bluetooth so they
wouldn't be trying to connect cuz it's
even worse in that way but they were
still fighting each other and we're not
connecting at all with JBL Tata Tata
blah and it goes so I'm really thankful
I think JBL was onto something with
their JBL connect glass and Sony needs
to catch up in that department I'm in
that department and this goes without
saying but if I were to choose between
the two setups JBL would be my go-to and
I would prefer JBL set up over Sony's
set up mainly because better highs they
have better best performance I like this
and I'm just a easy way to connect they
connect so easily compared to Sony I
wouldn't I wouldn't want to do sunny and
setup again like if it was gonna be that
frustrating like it was when I was I'm
working on this video so yes what do you
guys think about you know the two setups
I would like to hear that in the comment
section below I will also leave links to
all these speakers in the description
section below if you're interested in
looking or checking out one please use
those links it doesn't seem like much
