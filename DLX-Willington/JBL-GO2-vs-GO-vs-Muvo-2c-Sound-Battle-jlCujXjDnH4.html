welcome to another sound battle where we
let speakers speak for themselves in a
battlefield today we have the new JBL go
to buses the older JBL go and we will be
also comparing the go to to the creative
move or to see and see how the two
struck up to each other and since I
haven't done the review of the go-to and
I honestly don't think I will be doing
one but here are the main differences
between the new JBL go to buses the
older JBL golf number one the physical
design has changed as you see here I'm
the rounded of the corners to give it a
little bit of a modern look which I
think it looks better number two the new
design comes in with an ipx7 rating
which makes it completely waterproof and
number three I'm not sure what JBL was
thinking but they were brave enough to
get red of the strap hook for a speaker
that you're supposed to be bringing
outdoors if you're bringing it on a bike
you need it you need to be able to hook
it onto something unless you're just
going to put it putting it in your
pocket which you kind of muffle out the
sound of your speaker I'm not sure what
they were thinking but I think getting
rid of it was a bad move it might just
be me but there you have it
they did a few tweaks here in there and
if you want to know all of them here's a
spec sheet but let's get into this video
as usual I'll be using a high quality
binaural microphone so for the best
experience please use headphones with
that said let's hear the speaker's speak
okay so between these two there is
almost no difference in sound maybe just
maybe at lower volumes the ghost sounds
a little bit softer than they go - it
sounds like they opened up the midst a
little bit and maybe push the highs up a
tiny bit on the go - but this is only
noticeable at lower volumes at maximum
volumes you can pretty much not tell the
difference between the two speakers and
if you're looking for some bells even
the tiniest of it look somewhere else
honestly between these two unless you
really like that waterproof feature and
the rounded off corners and the design
of the new JBL go - I would stick with
the older JBL go cause it's a little bit
cheaper I think it's a better deal okay
so how about the go-to against the mover
to see
let's just break it down me down
it's not by a lot by the laws on the
mover to see are better than those on
the go to but while the base and highs
are boosted a little bit on the to see
the meets are not as pronounced which
kind of makes the speaker sound a little
bit closed off and not as vibrant as
they go to on the other hand the meats
in highs only go to sound better which
gives you better vocals for clear lyrics
and podcasts so each one has a one-up
together so if your best flavor the
mover to see is going to be more
appealing to you but for someone here
for the sake of better build better
vocals brighter sound the JBL go to will
be great and will also save you a couple
bucks what do you guys think I'd like to
hear what you have to say about the two
in the comment section below like it if
you liked it dislike it if you didn't
like it I just want to get some sort of
feedback from you because you watched
the video thanks for watching this one I
will see you in the next one peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
