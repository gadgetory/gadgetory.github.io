and welcome to this video this is the
SRS xB 41 the old new speaker from Sony
and upgrade to the SRS XP 40 in this
video we're going to be taking a close
look at it find out what's new what
improvements have been done in
comparison to the SRS XP 40 and we will
be getting a sound sample so we can get
a feel of how it sounds like stay tuned
so right off the bat
the first and biggest change you will
notice right away is the design of the
speaker they've changed the entire form
factor of the speaker which looks better
than last year's model in my opinion and
they have joined the club of the fabric
designer for their speakers like the JBL
and ue and it's all for the good I think
the speaker still features LED lights
like last year's model but this time
they stretched them all the way to the
sets of the speaker if they keep
stretching them like this I feel like
next year they will be surrounding the
entire speaker
wanna bet the placement of the buttons
has changed with the design with your
commonly used batteries on top here and
the rest of them hidden away in the back
behind this flap here is what you will
find the add button to connect with
another SOS XP 41 for studio sound
experience I'm the wireless polishing
button to connect up to 100 wireless
polishing capable speakers for a bigger
sound experience very light control
button to tell you how much battery you
have left on your speaker and with a
long press
you can turn the lights on and off a USB
port to charge your phone or anything
that uses a USB and audio jack and we
set button and two charging pops that's
right two charging pots
it looks like Sony heard our cry and in
addition to the regular port they
usually put on their speakers they added
a micro USB charging port the speaker
only comes with a penny charger with no
micro USB cable but I feel like a lot of
people already have those laying around
so I feel like this should not be a
problem I just appreciate the fact that
they gave us that option
finally the speaker is rated for 24
hours of playtime if it's being played
in standard mode with lights off but
this is only if you're listening to
relatively low volume at maximum volume
you are set to get about three to four
hours of playtime out of it and speaking
of battery life if you guys remember
with the XP 40 when the battery dropped
down to 50% the volume of the speaker
drops down to like 25% and it won't go
any louder than that no matter what you
do until you charge the speaker which is
one of the most annoying things that
Sony could have done with this speaker
well they still have the same thing
going on here with a little bit of
change to it I was able to use my
speaker at full blast until the battery
got to about a dream about 20% and then
I got the evil voice please join and
then the volume was cut down to about
25% volume and it wouldn't let me go any
louder than that so it kind of like last
year I'm still annoying but the only
difference here is that the volume goes
this the battery level has to drop all
the way to 20% not at 50% like they did
with the XP 40 which is a little bit
better but still annoying honestly most
of the specs of the XP 41 are the same
as last year's model except for three
changes the biggest being waterproofness
unlike the xba-40 the xba-40 one has an
ip67 rating which makes it completely
waterproof which has been the area where
the XPS speakers have been losing to JBL
and UE speakers the second difference is
in the driver sizes the X before he has
261 millimeter drivers well as the new
41 is running 258 millimeter drivers but
despite the fact that X before t1 has
slightly smaller drivers it's still
rated at the same frequency response as
the xB Foley and then lastly Sonny is
introducing a new sound mode they are
calling the live sound mode and they
think you will love it so much that they
got rid of the extra best button and
replaced it with a live sound button now
the speaker still has the extra best
feature but this time to enable it or
disable it you have to hold down the
play and volume down button for about 3
seconds if the light is green you are in
standard mode if the light is white you
are in extra base mode you can also
switch between the sound modes using the
app so that's kind of good I guess okay
so what's live sound mode I already put
out a video comparing you to the extra
bass so if you want to hear the
difference I will leave a link to that
video so you can check it out by anyways
according to Sony they should give you a
three-dimensional listening experience
and you should get a wider soundstage
which in turn should equal to a festival
vibe so your music should sound like
it's being played live in front of you I
personally found it to be good in some
songs and not as good in others it
performs better at lower volumes than
higher volumes when you turn it on you
get a boost in the upper mids and highs
a little bit of echo added to the mid
free
quinces and lastly a boost in the left
and right channel separation for a
greater studio sound experience which i
think is the only reason that i've
considered listening to it because it
gives you a greater stereo separation
like I mentioned before the speaker can
still be controlled with the Sony music
up to do all sorts of stuff and I will
let you see some of what you can do with
it as I let you listen to the speakers
so you can get an idea of how to speaker
sounds like and what you can do with the
app and as usual in order to give you
the best 3d sound experience I'll be
using a high quality binaural microphone
to record this sound test but in order
to experience the 3d sound experience
you have to use headphones we both said
here we go
I don't know how this day it seems to me
he's come away
need your help I think it's down
dad smoking on the stub have some
fathers back on the back to be back -
when you set up up down there but
another one it's coming throw favorite
just coming - what - making their Sammy
me at the W of what attorney musica
nothing it turns down here yeah we
stupid
the speaker has the sound signature of
the xba-40 but I think the xba-40 sounds
slightly better I think it has slightly
better highs than the XP 41 if you
listen closely the best performance on
both speakers is pretty identical
although I think that means on the XP 41
a little bit better there a little bit
lifted than they are on the XP 40 the XP
41 also features what sony is calling
the party booster you need to make a
sound
I mean the kids enjoyed it but I think
it's just a gimmick and again the XP 41
can be paired with all the wireless
positioning capable speakers including
last year's model the xB 1964 T 30 and
20 which is pretty cool
but the ad or studio pairing function
still only works with speakers of the
same model so you can pair the xB 41
with the XP 41 for still sound but you
cannot pair the XP 41 with the XP foley
force to your sound in conclusion I feel
like the only improvements that Sony did
here at the physical improvements but as
far as sound there is not really a big
improvement in comparison to last year's
model so if sound is your main concern I
feel like you're better off with the
xba-40
obviously if all the new features that
are on the xB 41 mean a lot to you yes
go ahead and upgrade but if sound is
main concern I think the xba-40 is a
better Buy well that wraps up this video
thank you very much for watching if
you're not subscribed go ahead and do
that leave the video like if you liked
it if you didn't like it leave a dislike
I just want to get some sort of feedback
from you because you know you watch the
video thanks again
I will see you in the next one peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
