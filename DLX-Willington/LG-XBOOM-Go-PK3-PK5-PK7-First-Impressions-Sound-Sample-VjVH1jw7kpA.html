three
I think it's been sitting in here for
two months now Wow
sitting on my desk like totally further
about it so if you wanna see the clip 3
review comparison let me know comment
section below and let's get to this
video hey what's up YouTube
whaling turn here and welcome to this
video now as you've probably seen
already the title we do have LG speakers
in the house we're going to be trying
out
LG's audio and see what they are after
when the main reason I'm doing this
video is just so I can get an idea you
know well what's in the box how they
come and all that but also mainly to ask
you guys what and find out what you guys
really want to see as far as comparison
to some of the other speakers that we
have so yes introducing the LG this is
the PK 7 I believe the PK 7 p k5 and the
PK 3 so we're going to be unboxing you
look at what they come with as well as
well it keeps us sleeping so I probably
won't do the recording of the audio
right now but I will put a sample audio
at the end of the video so you can
listen to each of this the speakers just
to give you just an idea while they
sound like and then when we go into the
detailed reviews and some comparison we
can actually compare them to some other
speakers that we already have in the
house in here so I want you to let me
know what you think what you want to see
any of these speakers compared to
anyways what should we open first maybe
the
pk3 I think so I guess so full
disclosure I did open these boxes before
well I didn't like get into everything
because I had some helpers here who were
helping me because they wanted to be in
the video
all right they're gonna start okay you
talk to them I know this is guys but
they got a little bit of disagreement
you know and that did not go well so we
kind of reopening so I didn't like
really listen to them though so this is
still it was kind of chaotic so I was
like you know we're done with this go to
bed but anyways this is the P Kate Reed
not true be careful yeah I actually
noticed this in the box while the
speaker's came on the box was beat up a
little bit so I'm hoping doesn't look
like there's usually a ton of foam in
here so I don't think it affected the
actual speaker that will be interesting
to see but that's open this PK 3 and the
first thing you see is the user manual
and this speaker right here
let this cat out so you can grab it to
pull it out this is the PK curry here
the charging cable stuff I believe are
you kidding me and this is USBC make you
sing that so you get a USBC pretty cool
exciting stuff I'm happy to see that LG
that's a good impression
okay so this is the speaker user manual
USBC in the speaker itself I believe
there's nothing else in there come back
later anyway so this is the PK 3 I mean
I want to say that the flip for is like
longer but this is wider so but they
have a Wynyard here well linear hook I
wonder if they I feel like they should
have given a linear with it but no but
yeah you can hook something here so
that's pretty cool um they have PRS on
the sides here you can see passive
radiators I kind of do like the design
though it's not bad
that looks pretty pretty cool with no
Meridian technology I don't know
so power button Bluetooth + - audio play
microphone enhanced best pretty cool I'm
guessing that kind of works like like
Sony's extra bits so I think so and then
in the back here
you do have well the DC in the USB C
port I love that and then you also have
the micro I mean they put a 3.5
millimeter jack and then you have also
have the reset button there so this
doesn't seem to be such a bad speaker
I'm hoping it the sound is not also that
bad
doesn't work cheap so that is good well
I'm kind of excited I wanna see for that
right yeah I want to see the PK 5 it is
the same thing
PK 5 okay so this is one of the ones
that we already opened with my kids
so this is usually in a plastic bag like
you stole with the with the pk3
came in a plastic bag but we took that
off in the first time that we were
making the video but yeah
does it also use USB see you is BC that
is so sweet
so yeah user menu the USB C for charging
the speaker I'm really really thankful
that they finally someone is doing that
I'm moving towards the USB C alright so
in the back here you also get your USB C
DC 5 volt input and audio in one point
of 3.5 millimeter charge a reset button
and I'm not sure what that button does
it has like plus signs on it
it's probably for adding more speakers
to to it like to connect more than one
speaker like they add add button on
Sony's I'm guessing so yes I found it
out it's called do a play so like I was
guessing is for connecting more than one
speaker so they can play in sync and you
also have the same stuff here nice times
but the battery is warning so yep and it
just died
come on guys so it it comes with no
battery on it that's kind of
disappointing so you get enhance the
best on here but you also get an
addition of clear vocals setting on here
so I guess that probably makes the
vocals sound better I'm assuming let's
look at the big guy here this is the PK
7 and same thing here we open this one
already with my kids but it also comes
in a plastic bag
so has a huge cage on it it's pretty
heavy too
it's pretty pretty heavy and then in
here you SPC CEOs business no break AC
adapter so this one is not used USB C
equals the same route like the JBL
extreme and extreme too so that's kind
of a disappointment I was hoping for USB
C all the way but not all right so in
the back here you have the duo audio
right there - the same thing the port in
for the 3.5 millimeter audio and then
your charging port right here I'm
surprised they didn't give you a port to
charge like someone took a USB C port to
charge your phone cuz I feel like every
everything this size they're usually
doing that but they don't they don't do
that on this which I don't mind because
I really if I use that anyways because
you know it just drains your speaker and
I see you guys know I have a ton of
power banks so I don't really need this
speaker to do that B that's what they
were saying thinking - Hannah yeah you
turn it on
really really LG the battery warning
dead I'm gonna die come on guy he's that
ruin is the excitement then you have
your clear Hawk horn enhanced bass so
this is are basically the same here the
settings that I mean the buttons that
you have on here basically identical
yeah so you guys let me know what you
want to see against any of these
speakers in the sound battle videos I do
like the cool lights
I think Sony is
computer here is the peaking of whites
the pk3 I don't think the pk3 has
analytes on it that's not cool Sony yeah
the K the cages are kind of weird I
don't know like what I think about it
it's like it's not terrible like I
wouldn't say it's like so bad like I
think it might be even handy just to
carry it but I think it's kind of a
strange design that you have probably
have to get used to but I don't like
mind it like I don't mind I do not mind
the design anyways they have some cool
lights there maybe I will see if the
lights perform better on here then the
Sony's the Sony's lights on it speed 40
but before you want because I do like
the 41 it looks I think those lights
wrap around anyways I will be doing the
recording of this because so you guys
can have an idea of how they sound like
at the end of the video but the main
reason I'm doing this is so I can ask
you guys what speakers that you guys
really really want to see battle against
the these speakers what do you want to
see battle against the pk7 or what you
want to see battle against the PK 5 or
what do you want to see battle against
the TK 3 oh look at that I know their
names now yes I do actually have some
other speakers from LG so you cannot
subscribe make sure you are because I do
some other things that will be coming
pretty soon too I'm thinking about if I
should do the unboxing videos of those
so you can kind of see what's coming but
I'm not sure if I will but subscribe if
you're not subscribed thank you for
watching guys don't forget to let me
know what you want to see I'm out put
the links to these speakers it gets you
interested to see
what's up with LG's audio imma put the
links to them in the description section
below I'm going to leave you with a
sample of the two of the this three
speakers playing back and forth between
all of them so you can kind of have an
idea of how they sound like before we go
into the main sound battles if you guys
are interesting those are all yeah so
thanks for watching I love you all and I
will see you in the next one peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
