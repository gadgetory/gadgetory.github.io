ready for device connection Bluetooth
connected what's up YouTube
Wellington here back with a review of
the 1x1 supe LED dome light with a
Bluetooth speaker I've been playing
around with this light for about a week
now
and here's what I think about the light
starting with the positives generally
speaking if you are the kind of person
who likes throwing parties or do a lot
of karaoke be it for business or just
with friends or you are a wedding
reception DJ you are going to love this
thing it's only one chord away from
being Wireless which I really wish it
was it comes packed with six LED lights
to red one green one white one yellow
and one blue which gives you a lot of
light combinations to choose from you
pretty much have every holiday color
covered if you are using this for
holiday decorations this light also
gives you multiple mounting options you
can either mount it on the ceiling place
it on a tabletop or on the wall I
experimented all these options but
didn't notice any change in the
performance of the light in any of these
positions which to me it means the motor
is pretty good if it's able to handle
gravity in different directions if we
turn away from the aspect of light for a
minute here this light is a Bluetooth
speaker in itself if you are having a
small party at your house you can stream
music from your phone tablet or any
Bluetooth enabled music playing device
through this way pretty awesome huh and
you are not stuck with your phone to
skip to the next track control volume
play pause because the light comes with
a remote
that does all that and the same remote
is what you use to change to different
colors and effects as you can see here
the remote is clearly divided between
Bluetooth media streaming controls in
the light effects controls there are
just so many things you can love about
this light that I can't even think about
right now like nice design it really
looks pretty and premium nice and hard
plastic build with a metal mounting
plate you know etc but what could have
made this light even better if there was
an option to turn the motor off if all
you wanted is listen to music and no
lights it would have been awesome
because the motor is quite loud if you
are listening to love volume music so
one by one note that for the next model
the length of the power adapter cord
provided with the light is kind of
embarrassing with the option of mounting
the light up on the ceiling the 4 foot
power cord just ain't gonna make it you
would have to run a power strip up on a
cylinder to be able to power the way
which is annoying I feel like the
minimum length of the cord provider
should have been at least 10 feet but
anyways that's just me those might not
be your problems most especially if
you're using this just my table or on a
wall I also thought it would be cool if
the next model is rechargeable so we
don't have to deal with cords at all mmm
that's my dream right there oh and I
almost forgot this light has a
microphone right here and I believe is
supposed to help in sync in audio and
the light effects but I found this to
work only if I'm using the lights
Bluetooth speaker which means delay
effects would not sing to the audio
playing on my studios and I'm not sure
if the microphone is just weak or the
white was designed
only to sink - audio playing via
Bluetooth speaker but generally speaking
is an awesome light I'll live the link
to it in the description section below
as well as the link to the unboxing
video of the light do not forget to
subscribe and I will see you in the next
video peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
