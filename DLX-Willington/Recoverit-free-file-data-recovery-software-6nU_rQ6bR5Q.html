with a quick tutorial um so if you
accidentally format a card or delete
something off of a card um in your
camera your phone or on your computer
you just with a file only to realize
that you actually need it here is a
simple free way to recover it with ease
and that's using the free recovery
software from wondershare which you can
find the link to it in the description
section below so obviously the first
thing to do is launch the app and wait
for ok so this is the layout really
really easy and basic here which is
really nice and let's try to recover
something that was on a memory card and
we want to get it back and this is going
to be the same process for recovering
anything from any external device like a
flash drive digital camera camcorder mp3
player iPad whatever can connect to a
computer and it has storage you can
basically recover anything that was on
it that was deleted by mistake or
something like that so this is a really
really handy software to have around for
someone who works with files and cards
and phones and stuff like that so let's
get into it oh and you can probably see
right over here it says upgrade and
that's because the version that we are
using here is the free version you can
recover up to 100 megabytes free of
charge so that's really nice but if what
you're trying to recover is more than
100 megabytes you'll have to upgrade to
the pro version which gives you no limit
to however amount or size of file that
you're trying to recover anyways to
recover from a memory card would have to
go back here to external device recovery
right here click on that and it shows
you all things that you can recover from
so basically anything that has storage
on it and you can connect you to the
computer you're able to
our stuff back from it anyways we go
next and this is the card right here
like you can see it shows nothing oh man
and they can actually open it up here
for you so you can see this is the card
right here that I'm going to be
recovering if we open that up there's
nothing the folder is empty there's
nothing on there completely because I
deleted everything off of it
I'm from my camera and right here it
also shows nothing on there but we have
files on there that I maybe I forgot
that I needed them oh I thought it had
saved them but I actually didn't and I
want to recover them this is a way to
get those files back and that's the card
right there serenity and after selecting
it you know select it like that
you can go down here and say start the
program will start scanning the card and
the time it takes to scan the card it
depends on how big the card is and how
much recoverable stuff is on there but
if you're working with a big card you
don't have to wait for it to finish all
the way so if I know if I go here and I
search in here and I find that what I
want let's say some pictures
there's no there pictures here and I
find that this is the file that I want
on there I don't have to wait for it to
finish it has gives you a preview right
here to the side which is really really
nice you can actually preview pictures
just like that pretty nice so yes I said
that's the picture that I wanted to
recover I can just stay up here
stop are you sure you want to stop the
scanning say yes because you've really
found what you want so just stop it and
that way when it's done like that you
can actually preview it and right on
this page you can do recover it won't
let you recover when the scanning is
still going so and yeah so right here we
are these are the pictures that are on
this card the videos on here too and you
can see the sizes right over here but
your so let's go to the snow-day folder
here you can see all these pictures
not on the card like we looked at it
earlier if you look right here the card
is empty but it's showing that they are
here so it's just run the program
scanned everything that was deleted of
the card and these are all recoverable
stuff here so let's say this is the
picture I want to recover here I can
just either preview it and do recover or
if there are multiple pictures that you
wanted recover so they say that one I
select it and I say a look through look
through and maybe that's the other one I
wanted and then get selected right here
and then do recover down to the bottom
here but it's also one other nice
feature I wanted to show you up here if
you know the name of the picture that
you are looking for or the file you are
looking for instead of browsing through
just this old way like this you can just
type it up here with say mg and it will
appear and I select everything and do oh
I have to go back and unselect this in
order for this to work very well
sorry so if I go up here to the main the
main root of everything and say you do
snow see it will bring back that file
that's snow and then that folder right
there so instead of browsing through you
can just take the names out in here and
then you can just easily find the name
of the file or you can easily find the
file that you were trying to look for
all right so once you get in here like I
said you can select the files that you
wanted to recover so let's say that's
one of them and this is the other one
like I said I really like this preview
feature so if you don't know the names
of the files like these pictures you can
just preview it and nuts and just know
that oh yeah that's the one I wanted and
then Y is just like the files that you
want it
one more thing I wanted to show here you
can select up to the day that you wanted
to recover so if you do it something
today you can just select it here or in
the recent weeks you know stuff like
that you can customize the period that
you want to recover that things were
that were deleted in a certain period so
it's really really such a handy software
so anyways so go back down here after
selecting the files that I selected all
right so let's select those two files
now we can go back down here recover and
click on that and right here so the free
version like I told you will he'll let
you recover up to 100 megabytes but if
what you're trying to recover is more
than that you can use the pro version
here and that gives you unlimited
recovery file size so you can recover
however large the files are so that
would be nice but for our case here the
files I'm trying to recover as you can
see only four megabytes so this is three
megabytes so I'm not worried about that
so go ahead recover since this works for
me I just go evaluate evaluate and then
you have to select the path where you
want the files to be saved so I will go
to see I probably just dump it on my
desktop user Wellington and
right there select that and do recover
yep complete and it actually opens up
the folder so right there
yeah those are the two files that we
recovered all looking nice
these actually deleted them just because
they were blurry it took my pictures of
my kids outside and I don't like this
oh they're blurry but so yeah you can
actually just do like that and if I was
all recovered and actually right here
you see it created a folder up here that
has that stuff in it so that is pretty
sweet
but that's if your that's the same
method that you use if you're trying to
recover something that was on a memory
card or on the phone or anything like
that and then let's say let's say you
want to recover something that you
deleted off of off of the computer and
you want recover it was now in a memory
card the process is basically pretty
much the same for all of this it's
really really easy to use but let's say
let's go to deleted files it will ask
you for the hard drive what where the
file that you deleted was you select
that and then do the same thing start it
will do the scanning complete this is a
new drive so there's not much on there
and then you go find where the file that
you deleted was so maybe they changed
some markers so like we did not too long
ago so it will show me that so just go
ahead recover again it's smaller than
100 megabytes evaluate select where I
wanted to go
and yep done so that's why the song was
it keeps you it gives you the same what
do you call it
patch where the original file was where
it was deleted so so that's pretty sweet
so that is the song and all these other
all these other recovery modes or
whatever you want to call them these
mods here are basically that easy to use
it just going shows the driver or the
drive that you're trying to recover from
and it's just that easy to do and the
only one I want to talk about is maybe
the all-around recovery this one over
here for this one here it's basically
again kind of the same thing but what
this one does if you used any of these
methods out here and you did not see the
file that you're trying to recover what
all this all around does is it does a
deep search so it's it takes a lot
longer than the other methods you select
a hard drive that the file was on that
you're trying to find and then when you
start it will take a lot longer because
it does a very very deep scan you'll
find a lot more from a hard drive in
this way than the other the other
methods because it just goes way deeper
into stuff to find all those files so
but like I said this is free if you're
what you're trying to recover is under
100 megabytes but for anything bigger
than that you're gonna have to upgrade
to maybe the probe version so you can
get unlimited file size to recover I'll
put the link to this software in the
bottom there so you can check it out if
you're trying to recover a file it's
really really easy to use and you will
find it very useful so yes thank you for
watching I will see you in the next
video I wish you a quick recovery
get it see ya</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
