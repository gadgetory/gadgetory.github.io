quick um there's a jib blj arm pop in
here um I got it for my son but he
wanted to do the video about it so it's
only fair is his figure so he's going to
be doing most of the open to talking and
opening the box here and then after
looking at it and listening to it at the
end of the video I will personally tell
you I'm what I think about the speaker
and what I saw that JBL really missed
out on
hello people at home I am going to open
this package
I already got started so if you'd like
to still yo just put your phone top but
if you don't put thumbs down let's open
this okay
no I got it
whatever this is it's a little fake up
Oh laughs people now shall we get
started and open this become what's in
this a charging cable and hey no I need
that shall get started and open this
into a home never do that I just did
that in next time when you do this out
for help yes well this because you can
make it have faces yes the monster in
emoji stickers number and letter
stickers
think that you're just instruction to
use watching watch slowly yeah
so there is often on button um where is
it you can see it too often on but
simply tail and the plug-in and people
at home I just wait wow that's wrong
okay there's a low one and a high one to
make a be high and low yep
volume there's a son button I don't know
why
see just bite here it's mine mine oh my
it's mine yes
let's go schweinfurt wallah ah yes okay
so a real quick my opinion here this is
a really really nice looking speaker you
know for a kid I'm the kind of market
that this is marketed to they say ages
three plus so the only gripe that I have
with that is that this is a completely
Bluetooth speaker so know any other way
to play music through it except for
bluetooth and that would not be a
problem for someone who has a device
that has that but we're talking about
three ages plus those kids don't have
such things so I feel like they have the
missed opportunity here that JBL did is
not including a TF card reader the
parent could put some songs on the TF
card memory card micro card whatever you
want to call it so the kids can play
with it out there because they don't
have a phone bluetooth that requires
bluetooth and all that so that's the
only missed opportunity that I see that
gbo did here another mag everything else
is pretty pretty fun I mean the sound
the own end is not terrible we saw the
best sounding speaker but again for the
ages that this is marketed to it sounds
pretty good way better than just
listening to a phone I feel like would
have been better if they had included a
card reader in here somehow to put songs
on there for the child whatever they
like to listen to you know outside when
they are playing at least my kids go out
and play so that's the only least
opportunity other than that the speaker
is
really really good down my list it looks
like it looks pretty sturdy it's
completely waterproof so no crank that
everything else is good it's just that
they should have at least included the
TF card reader in there somehow so the
kid does not have to 100% rely on
bluetooth or having a different device
that is streaming music to their speaker
so that's what I think looks like
everything people on home time we will
are ending the video so the phones up if
you like that I will see you in the next
videos goodbye goodbye had to clean who
is going to clean up his</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
