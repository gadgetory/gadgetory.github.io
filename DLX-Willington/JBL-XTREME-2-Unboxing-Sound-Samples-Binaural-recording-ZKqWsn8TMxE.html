welcome to this long waited for JBL
extreme to unboxing video that's a long
name for the video but anyways so I've
been waiting for this beacon for a long
time well not this one specifically I
placed a pre-order on JBL's website as
soon as the speakers were on pre-order
but till today I'd now received the
speaker and just out of curiosity while
I was looking for other stuff too I went
to Best Buy and they had a stupid
speaker in stock but me who pre-ordered
my speaker I still haven't received it
from JBL so I don't understand how that
works
I didn't think that's how it works but
I'm not giving up so I can't even speak
to that but I finally went to Best Buy
and I picked this one up so we're going
to be unboxing it I might actually
cancel my order on the other side so if
you preorder your speaker and you've not
got it yet going to go shake on your
best day I'm pretty sure this by now if
all stores have them in stock but you
can do it like me just go on this
console well you have to check on the
store first and if they have them you
can just cancel your pre-order and get
your speaker right away crisps up right
now we don't really know when the
speaker will be will be shipped to me so
yeah that was kind of frustrating but
here we go I have the speaker and so
we're going to be unboxing it just so we
can get our first impressions of how the
speaker sounds like looks like
I mean what's new what's the difference
here just exciting exciting good stuff
so yeah there you go
just the typical gbos boxing and
definitely looks bigger than the older
and the JBL extreme dang thing is heavy
it is heavy that's for sure then in here
you have this is probably stuffing here
stuffing here we'll put this down
between the floor and let's open this
first see what they this is your your
charger right here
stupid pin charger I don't know why JBL
did not go that route but if you if
you've watched my video of the JBL I
mean the sony xba-40 one they still have
this but they give you an option of the
micro USB USB charging so GBO is still
sticking to the same same old stupid pin
charger not a fan of it I wish they
would switch over but either way and
then here you also have your user manual
and your power supply cord right in
there and into your speaker
so that's inside and see how I got this
in the blue color just because you know
my old one is black I wanted to try a
different color and just kind of mix up
stuff as you know it is damn this thing
is Pig holy crap
all right so let's see what we got here
I might have to zoom in here a little
bit other thing that's in focus okay so
it's the back here I think I have nails
to open this so this is um what a proof
like some of you already know probably
but here we have and you see you still
have your mum your audio in so they did
not dish that which is cool um yeah I
was like is that it micro USB charging
but it's only it looks like it's only
for service so we cannot use it to judge
the speaker it's just a service port and
then we still have our but we only have
one power output so for judging your
phone or anything that uses USB charging
and then the charging port right here
yeah so this is like usually like
usually should always make sure you have
this sealed off before you submerge the
speaker into water otherwise it might be
kaput but yeah it is a waterproof
speaker and as you guys can see it isn't
completely I mean let me let me grab my
older one so we can
correct in comparison oh okay so this is
the it should be our extreme so as we
can see this the difference is not
actually that much like as far as size
that is not like huge
at first the length here is almost the
same but it's the height or they
actually like round the circumference of
this is bigger than the older one but as
far as the weight but actually I
wouldn't say they're a lot like far far
different from each other I'm going to
be doing a far detailed review of videos
so you have to make sure you subscribe
this is just me opening the speaker to
show you and give you something to chew
on as I probably bet I'm you're watching
this video I'm probably working on it
on some shots and all that and I will be
posting a full-on review picking out
every single small difference between
the two speakers so you make sure you
subscribe so you do not miss out when I
put out that video but yeah as you can
see they changed the design on the
passive radiators the PRS you can see
there in a shot right there
and I am actually a fan of the
old-school style and I don't like how
they design the new ones here for some
reason they don't work as nice for me
put your headphones on and we will play
some tracks here for those of you who
just can't get enough i'm gonna be using
switching over to a binaural mind i'm
gonna be switching over to a binaural
microphone right now so switching over
right now probably
right now and you should have your
headphones on and we are gonna play some
jams here we start off for about 50%
with this track 50% vine
yeah
okay I think that's enough samples for
now yeah I think that's enough samples
for now obviously I'm going to be doing
a full review of the two JBL extreme
compared to JBL extreme too so if you're
not subscribed please make sure you do
subscribe so you do not miss out when I
do put out that video I'm also going to
be doing a lot of other sound battles
that you like you guys know I do a lot
of sound battles with these speakers so
if you want to let me know what speakers
that you'd like to see a battle against
the GFDL extreme to drop that down in
the comment section below and then I
will see which videos that requested the
most those are usually the long as I do
first and then I usually follow that up
with my just which honest I feel like I
should do but I do be doing videos that
I requested most first so please make
sure you do that if you're new here
don't forget to subscribe because I do a
lot of cool videos but I feel like
you're going to meet out if you don't
subscribe so it also helps me out come

follow me over on Twitter and what else
what else should I say I feel like I
don't have anything else to say I'm
