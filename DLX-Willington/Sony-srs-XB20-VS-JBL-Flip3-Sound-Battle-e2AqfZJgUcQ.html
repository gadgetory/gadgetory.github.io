welcome to another sound battle where
we'll have speakers speak for themselves
in the battlefield today we have the
sony srs XP 20 versus the JBL flip 3
some of you were asking about the XP 20
versus the flipfold battle but I did
that video a couple months ago so you
need to go to the channel and check that
one out and back to this video of the
first song we'll be playing with the
extra base off on the Sony and the rest
of the song will play with extra best
own and the speakers will be playing at
60 and 100 percent volume I'll be using
a high quality binaural microphone so
please use headphones for the best
experience with that said let's hear the
speaker's speak
yeah
you have to
okay so as far as loudness if you are
indoor you probably won't tell a
difference they both sound about equally
loud but outdoors in the open the XP 20
came out louder than the flip 3 when I
was testing not by much but noticeably
louder than the flip three and I believe
this is because the highs on the XP 20
are brighter than those on the flip 3
and you could clearly hear that in that
last song at 100% volume and as far as
best performance
there is no huge difference to me here
between these two and this is with
Sonny's extra base own honestly the
extra base on XP 20 doesn't do much here
in my opinion I think it does a good job
on the XP 40 and hit the XP 30 but on
here it just kind of bumps up the lower
mids and highs to give you an impression
of bass boost but even that is barely
noticeable here both speakers have a
very comparable sound output but as
volume goes up the Sony starts to sound
a little bit more powerful than the flip
3 if I were to pick one of the two I
would probably go with XP 20 just
because it's a little bit more powerful
and has a better outdoor performance but
that's just me and sound is so
subjective I'd like to hear what you
have to say about this too in the
comment section below and i should note
my judgment is based off of only the
sound quality so you might want to
consider some other features and price
before making your final decision
forgive me for my voice today kind of
borrowing something here don't forget to
subscribe if you're new here if you
haven't yet I love you all and I will
see you in the next one peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
