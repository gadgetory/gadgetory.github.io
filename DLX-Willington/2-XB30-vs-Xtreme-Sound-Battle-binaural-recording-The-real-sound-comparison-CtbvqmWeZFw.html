and welcome to another sound battle
well that speakers speak for themselves
in the battlefield today we have the JBL
extreme going up against two SRS xB 30s
playing in stereo mode in this battle
the speakers will be playing at 60%
volume and I will have extra base on on
the xB 30s I'll be using a high quality
binaural microphone so please use
headphones for the best experience with
that said let's hear the speaker's speak
Oh
Oh
Oh
Oh
Oh
Oh
the
okay if you use headphones you should
have heard some amazing sound coming out
of the two XP thirties and the stereo
separation is just amazing the two XP
theories are about as loud as the
extrema
maximum volume there is not a huge
difference in best performance but I
still like the highs on the extreme with
that said the overall sound of the two
XP series is unbeatable
so same as what I said in a previous
video the only reason I'll take the
extreme over to xB series is if
portability is an issue like you don't
want to carry around two speakers
instead of just one but if that's not an
issue to s be third is playing in stereo
mode are better than one extreme but
that's just me and sound is so
subjective I'd like to hear what you
have to say about these two in the
comment section below and also I don't
need two speakers of the same kind and
so I will be doing a giveaway of the XP
30 and maybe some other things as soon
as we hit 5k in subs so if you're new
here don't forget to subscribe so you
don't miss out on the upcoming videos
and the details on how to win when we
get to 5k subscribers thanks for
watching this one I will see you in the
next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
