welcome to another sound battle where we
let speakers speak for themselves
in the battlefield today we have the JBL
go busses the JBL clip - as requested if
there are speakers that you'd like to
see them value here leave them in the
comment section below and when you do
don't forget to subscribe because that's
the only way that you'll know when I
upload your requested video back to this
battle and the stickers of 5 feet away
from a high quality binder on microphone
and they'll be playing the 80% volume
for the best experience please put your
headphones on and let's hear the
speaker's speak
hold on down
wait yes good I've got the dentist a
souvenir so happy to make time you learn
you have to win all around I have to
bring me everyone see anger is misplaced
there is not a huge difference at the
sound of the two speakers like I was
anticipating honestly the highs are not
as sharp on the go but they are not bad
either and the meats are better on the
clip too and both speakers basically
have no space whatsoever
the go sounds warm and come while the
clip too on the other hand is bright and
vibrant and for outdoor purposes I would
probably go with it clip to over they go
yes because of its brighter music and
it's a little bit louder than the goal
otherwise it's not really a huge
difference between these two speakers I
feel like you're mainly paying more for
this for the clip too just because of
its waterproofness and ruggedness anyway
let me know what you think down below
that's great for today like it if you
liked it drop me a comment down below
and don't forget to subscribe thanks for
watching again I will see you in the
next one peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
