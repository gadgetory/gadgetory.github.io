here with a cinema 4d tutorial and I'm
going to show you how I was able to do
this now I used basic keyframes like
without using any kind of plugins or
anything so this is the scene right here
what I did everything I'm not really
going to go through how I made all these
you know like rotating stuff and stuff
like that cause that's basically the
same thing just keep framing you know
when you want this to be in and what you
want this to be a sudden plays a certain
time in a timeline so it's basically the
same thing you take me a long time to
just going through and showing you if
all the tips that I put in there but
what I'm going to show you that you know
is how I made these numbers count down
you know from five to zero so what I did
is I put all these numbers into the in
you know into the scene and I make sure
they are all in the same spot so what I
did is clear the first number that was a
five then I just duplicated that into
all these numbers and just changed what
they are to four three two one and zero
and then what I did my key framing I
went to the you know the first keyframe
that was a zero right there and I went
to five and I was like I want five to be
all one on zero so right here you can
see it's already I'm zeroed out so I
would like these ones right here the
visible and editor and visible in render
render is mostly what you want but I
like to be able to see what's happening
so I keep framed the visible in editor
to just so I can see what's happening
while I'm editing so I went ahead and
keyframed the zero here to be on and
then I went on to the thirtieth keyframe
and stored that to be off then
to be off at 30 so it's going to be on
through 0 to 30 which is basically about
about a second now depending on the
keyframe you're the frames per second
your project is and I'm usually doing 29
point something so right here the 5 is
off so then I go to the next number and
in that same spot at the 30 to the 30
frames I told this number to come on
which is the 4 right here so in right
here I'll turn it to on so I do that for
both of them just so I can see what's
happening like I said so the 4 is gonna
be on then but then I went back one
keyframe and told this to be off yes so
it's not on at the same time when the 5
is on so I turn that one off so the 5 is
on here and then fought tons on but 5
goes off so then go to 60 seconds
I tell the four to go off so I've got 60
seconds I told the four off and then I
keyframe that but then go to 5 I mean
two three and tell it to be on two so I
turn that one on and keyframe it but
then go back until 4:00 until three
sorry to be off a keyframe before he
turns on so that will ensure that all
the way back is been off it's been off
until when it comes in so 60 seconds we
have the four the three on and then 90
second in I mean 90 frames I tell it to
go off
and then I tell at the same keyframe I
tell to to be on so keyframe that but
then go back one keyframe and make sure
and turn it off
yes so it's not on all throughout the
time so I go back in and then 120 I
turned I tell you to go off tell the two
that I'm on to go off that keyframe and
then go back actually no go to one and
turn it on as you're turning they're off
I mean the two of you turn one off so I
mean two one on go back and tell it to
be off a keyframe before it turns on so
that one sure that it's not being all
know that time on then go to 150 and
then tell one to be off don't forget to
keyframe there but then turn zero on
keep flame it go back one keyframe and
tell us about to be off just right
before he turns on and then you can tell
it how long you want you to stay I go to
180 and then turn it off I mean it's the
last one so it doesn't really matter to
me you know just leave it as you can see
as I scrub through here actually if I
play this now you have those changing
numbers just like like that that's
easily how I did it so as you can see
the finished video everything looks
really smooth you'd have to go through
in and you know whichever animation
you're going for or whatever you're
trying to put around your animation your
numbers you know you can go ahead and do
that what I just wanted to show you is
to how to easily achieve the countdown
or count up to you know whatever you're
trying to do without you know using any
plugins or anything like that so thanks
for watching do not forget to subscribe

and questions in the comment section
below and I will get back to you as soon
as possible thanks for watching I will
see you in the next one peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
