today we are unboxing the all-night
color-changing led desk lamp reading
lamp and bedroom lamp with USB charging
port I just got this in the mail and as
usual I like to show you guys what comes
in everything good so let's see what
comes in this box now I'll be doing a
review for this lamp after using it for
a couple days if you're looking for a
review it will be somewhere on the
screen probably right there so you can
just click there and you can go check it
out and if you're looking to see the
review for it and this is the order and
as usual there's a box in a box so we
took it out of there and there is the
magic so it comes in here the box looks
pretty neat and awesome has a handle and
if you guys can see that ya can hold it
there pretty nice I wish I could go
shopping with this box oh yeah he's just
kidding but yeah I guess this is for
easy handling when you
I guess bite from getting in the shop or
something like that and then you want to
use it for storing your own stuff maybe
so I'm here to see what comes inside so
let's get to that
and there's another box I think no this
is the packaging oh yeah that's all
and I believe this is the manual right
there there's all the information about
it go back to the side and this is
everything that you're getting here oh
this is the bonus pencil pen holder for
your desk and put stuff in there on your
desk that's cool
so you get that if you don't have it you
just buy this lump and there you go just
kidding but yeah that's nice that you
you know they provide that for you and
what's in here
that's the charging so this is what goes
in a wall I'm guessing that and then
this goes in here and then into your
lamp
to cable that connects to the lamp
between this and the window so you get
that okay so if this was a human being
he would be complaining they really like
twist it in there try to make it fit in
a small box oh there it is
fancy-schmancy this supposed to be a
fancy tangle right
nice and moody no way bubble wrap
dang that looks nice
all right so that's the lamp right there
it's just like glass on top here no it's
some kind of plastic I really like you
can see through a maze like that kind of
bulb in there that kind of looks cool
but yeah um first impressions that looks
good all right I don't want to pull it
all the way up because you guys won't be
able to see it and they can do this but
yeah this is one pickle the flexible
neck and these are the up show like like
color-changing things according to the
picture so this is the power button
and it actually looks good this is where
your power cord goes so I right in there
and I'm going in Philly I should just
plug it in just so we can see Oh
my computer is right here so let me plug
in there
just to see if I could hear I can power
it yeah
testing testing that's cool it actually
does that's a song I know it works so
your computer can power this thing so
basically anything that you have will
like power it that's awesome I'm going
to be doing a review of that you know
playing with it and knowing actually how
it does and how it works so I will be
coming back with that but that's cool
I'm gonna try something else I'm gonna
see if your power bank and power this
thing up so let's say you're out there
somewhere and you you just have this you
can still still words
yeah so this is the source of the power
so I guess that's kind of nice this
supportable life and like that so you're
not stuck with a cordon you know like
most of the radio this is the own and
off thing for the actual light up here
so yeah that's awesome
so um yeah I'm going to be doing a
review for this I'm gonna put a run with
it thank you for watching I will be
leaving the link to this product and the
review video in the description section
below so make sure you check that out
and I will see you guys in the next
