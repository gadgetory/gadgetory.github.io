the unboxing video of the Dawkins nugget
pro scheme for the canon 60d DSLR or you
can also call it a case in camera case
like 60d case like for your phone
nothing cool on this box so we'll just
go right ahead and often inside and see
what really comes in the box when you
order the dell can snag posting for the
canon 60d in here as you can see it's
just a box another box actually of the
Snagit pro I'm pretty sure this is how
you would find it in a store if you were
to buy this in the store and nothing
else other than this bubble plastic
stuff to keep it safe on its way here
and nothing cool on the box of the
Snagit pro other than their word and
maybe showing you that this is for the
canon 60d so we'll go ahead and open
this baby and see what's inside there
and right when we get it out of the box
as you can see this is a rubber case if
i may say it's really really really
feels soft and it comes with two screen
protectors as you can see them right
there it feels really soft go to the
feel of the hand and i'm going to be
doing a review so make sure you check
that out but for this video i think we
are done don't forget to subscribe and
that will see you in the next video
