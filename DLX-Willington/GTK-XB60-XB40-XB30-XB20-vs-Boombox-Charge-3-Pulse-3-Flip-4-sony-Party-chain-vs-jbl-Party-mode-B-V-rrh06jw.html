Wilmington here and welcome to another
sound battle where we let speakers speak
for themselves in a battlefield today we
have four speakers from Sony
that's the jb g gk XP 60 the x before
exp 30 and 2x b 20 all this will be
going up against four speakers from JBL
that will be the boom box the charge
three the pulse three and the flip for
now I would have loved very much to see
the extreme replace or be in place for
the past three but unlike the charge
three the JBL extreme has not received
the Kinect plus update at least as of
recording this video yeah maybe in the
future but as of right now it cannot
connect to these other speakers that
have the newer Kinect plus connection so
kind of sad but that's where we're at
with that said as usual I'll be using a
high quality binaural microphone so for
the best experience please use
headphones and now let's hear the
speakers speak
to me
so what do you guys think
I feel like Sony is doing two things
better than JBL and gbos do two things
better than Sony so this might be a
tough one but so let's start with Sony
what Sony's set up doing better than
JBL's number one their highs the high
zone sunny set up a gear data bird on
JBL set up the thanks go to the XP 20
and the XP thoroughly because the other
ones kind of suck in that department
number two the mix occurred on the Sun
is set up for some reason
JBL setup is lacking needs to I thought
that maybe the charge 3 and the past 3
and fluid for my you know help boost
that department but it still kind of
sucks so Sony is doing a good job
well when it comes to the mids - so pros
to the Sony and there are two areas
where JBL side is doing better and one
of them being the best department you
can hear all the best coming out of the
GLS far far better than what Sony is
producing and I think thanks go to the
boombox it's doing a really really good
job and it doesn't matter if you in
indoor mode or outdoor mode is still
outperforming Sony's either extra bass
on or off so that is really really
really good and the second area what
synchronization of music between
speakers for some reason sunny was
having trouble with this this is very
evident in the last cup of songs that I
played in a sample music now this is
very very evident when you connect the X
B 60 to the X before e3 and the 20
things get messed up a little bit there
but if you only connect the X before T
30 and 20 just a three everything plays
perfectly in sync so this looks like
something is messed up here with the xB
Foley
I mean xB 60 connection to the others
that's because that's what messes up the
synchronization so I'm hoping this is
something that they can fix with a
software update
hope they do so otherwise you cannot
connect to the XP 62 the others without
having that issue you sometimes have to
like stop the track and start it again
it gets a little bit better or gets
worse so they need to do something about
it otherwise it's just not not good and
it was gonna be tough because as a base
level
I like the base that is coming out of
the boom box but also when you turn over
to Sonny's setup you kind of hear what
you're missing by listening to that the
good Meads and the good highs so it was
gonna be tough but with the issue of
synchronization that the XP 60 is adding
to the mix I'm gonna give the win here
to the JBL set up because I love the
best and everything syncs up perfectly
so that speak and also one more thing to
mention with Sonny's setup like that you
have to make the boom I mean the xB 60
the main speaker
it can give audio to the other ones but
you cannot use one of the other one of
the xB 20 or the 30 or the 40 to give to
give audio to the xB 64 some reason it
doesn't work that way
because I tried it but you the xB 60 has
to be the main speaker which is not the
case with JBL
we can use any to be the main speaker to
give audio to the rest of them so there
you have it that you have it that makes
the end of this video if you're new here
please subscribe if you haven't yet and
like the video if you liked it dislike
it if you didn't like it I just like to
get some kind of feedback from you
because you watch the video other than
that thanks for watching I love you all
and I will see you in the next one peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
