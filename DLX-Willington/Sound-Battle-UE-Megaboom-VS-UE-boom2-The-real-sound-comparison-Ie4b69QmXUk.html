sound battle where we'll have speakers
speak for themselves
in the battlefield today we have the UE
boom - going up against its bigger
brother the mega boom by a pianist the
mega boom looks like a blown-up version
of the boom - so let's find out if the
same goes for the sound the speakers are
5 feet away from the sound recorder and
they are playing at 80 percent volume
put your headphones on and let's hear
the speaker's speed
Oh God just me
I've got something to say oh I'm happy
to me down oh you have to win let's just
break it down to you and me uptown dance
another round and the disco ball pops
but I have to bring me and everyone can
see is this place
you
and there you have it let me know what
you think down below in the comment
section but from my testing with all
sorts of songs this is what I think of
the two speakers as you might have
guessed or heard at this point the mega
boom is louder than the boom to which we
kind of expected but when it comes to
lows the mega boom is definitely in the
lead and actually let me say this right
now as far as overall performance the
mega boom takes the lead here and that's
because it offers pretty much everything
the boom two offers with the addition of
bass which is missing in the boom too
but this does not end here the vocals on
the boom to sound way better and I
honestly haven't found a speaker in this
price range that has vocals as good as
what I find on the boom - so if you
value lyrics and like to hear them as
clear as possible and don't care about
the laws the boom - is great for that
but overall performance with everything
on the audio spectrum considered the
mega boom wins this battle let me know
what you think down below thanks for
watching I really hope you found this
video helpful if you did like the video
subscribe to the channel if you're new
here and don't forget to follow me on
Twitter thanks for watching again I will
see you in the next one peace
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
