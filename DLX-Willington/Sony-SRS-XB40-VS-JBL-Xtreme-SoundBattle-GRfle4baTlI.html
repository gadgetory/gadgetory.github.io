and welcome to another sound battle
well that speakers speak for themselves
in the battlefield today we have the
Sony SRS XP 40 going up against the jet
BL extreme now I apologize for this
video it's going to be a little bit
longer than normal here is what I'm
going to do first I'll be playing two
songs at seventy percent volume with the
extra bass off on the Sony then I'll
play two more songs like seventy percent
volume with extra bits on on the Sony
and then I will turn the volume down on
both speakers to 30% volume with the
extra bass on now I know that's a lot of
sample music for you guys to just sit
through but I would prefer for you guys
to hear what I'm talking about
then just tell you about it without
giving you a chance to listen in they
they agree or disagree with whatever I'm
talking about in the video so just kind
of bear with me in this one as usual
I'll be recording using a high quality
binaural microphone so put your
headphones on and let's hear the
speaker's speak are you listening
hold on girl now wait just a bit I've
got some dentists make you should read
oh happy to make down oh you see less
you have to witness break it down um
peacock down another round hell disco
ball park but I have to be me everyone
see anger is misplaced
don't
and I never tell
[Laughter]
Oh
and here I drop the volume down on both
speakers to 30% volume if you're using
headphones you should notice a huge
difference here most especially with the
XP 40 and also you might hear some
ambient noise in this recording because
I bumped up the volume the gain on the
microphone so we can clearly hear louder
even when they're playing quietly so
bear with me
if you couldn't tell the lower the
volume is on the XP Foley the more best
you get the higher you go the less you
get to the point that at higher volumes
the best almost feels not enough even
when you have the extra bass enabled on
the Sony in fact in some songs I
couldn't tell the difference between the
extra bass on and off at maximum volume
but when you bring the volume way down
like we did at 30 percent the best
almost feels a little bit too much it
takes over everything and it's at this
point that you can tell that the X
before it goes deeper in basis than the
extreme I have a short sample here to
show this and I want you to listen for
the bass line
you
you can pretty much hear all the notes
of the bass on the xba-40 but maybe just
the first notes on the extreme so it
definitely goes deeper in based on the
extreme which is good but what's funny
is that at higher volumes that bass
disappears now I know someone is going
to comment and say well all speakers
bring down the bass at maximum volume
and that's true but this seems a little
bit too much now listen my opinion the
speaker looks great but I feel like they
concentrated way too much on the lights
and forget about balancing things out I
hope this is something that can be fixed
with an update because as of right now
you will have to do some tweaking with
an EQ to get something good out of it
which I personally don't use DTS unless
I really have to
so in this battle I personally vote for
the extreme it produces somewhat more
constant sound quality at all volumes
and those tweeters really help with
making the highest more natural and
sharp but if those lights on the xba-40
are a game changer for you and you don't
mind tweaking around any view every time
you maximize or minimize the volume of
the xba-40 it could be a good buy for
you but that's just my opinion and sound
is so subjective I would like to hear
what you guys have to say about this -
down in the comment section below you
can agree or disagree
there is no judging here I'm pretty sure
you notice that speakers were plugged in
when I was playing samples I don't know
if it's a bug or it's something but Sony
intended to do to the speaker but at 50
percent battery life the speaker cuts
back the volume to fully or 30% volume
and no matter what I did it would not
rise the volume back up so I plugged
both speakers in no cheering now if this
is the reason Sony is claiming the 24
hour battery life just because they will
cut down your volume way down at half
percent battery life that is not cool
and straight out annoying
something has to be changed Sony but hey
this speaker has potential if Sony is
willing to come down and fix these
things if you found this video helpful
be the cool kid who subscribes and likes
the video that's what keeps me going and
I would really appreciate it thanks for
watching and I will see you in the next
one peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
