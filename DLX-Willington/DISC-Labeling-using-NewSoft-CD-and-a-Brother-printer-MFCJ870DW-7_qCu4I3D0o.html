I'm going to show you how to use a
brother printer to print on DVDs
blu-rays and CDs I'll be using a brother
printer MFC jh7 0dw
now the process for some models might be
a little bit different but the basics
are all pretty much the same I use
Neusoft CD level of software to design
my DVDs and blu-rays and it comes with a
printer so let's get started assuming
you've already installed the software on
your machine now let's go ahead and open
it click start program and here you will
see all these cool templates that you
can edit to your taste but I've always
used a blank template so I'm going to
select that and click apply the Edit
window will appear click level site
settings to configure the level sites
before you start your design process I
like to keep the outer diameter all the
way to the max in the inner diameter all
the way to the minimum and that's
because I like my DVD print covering the
entire DVD like this but not like this
one right here press ok and begin
designing your label now this software
has a really really easy layout so it's
not hard to figure out where stuff is so
I'm not going to go into details about
the designing process because I'm pretty
sure you can figure it out so when
you're done with the design process and
happy with the results click print
select your machines name from the drop
down menu in the dialog box and for the
paper size select 12 centimeter disk in
brackets 4.7 inch and click OK wait for
a second for the software to communicate
with your printer the machine will then
prompt you to make sure there is at
least 4 inches of space behind the
machine and that's because when you're
printing the print tray comes out the
back of the printer
at least 4 inches out so make sure there
is more than 4 inches behind your
machine and then click OK
so now we leave the computer and go to
the printer if the two are communicating
properly the printer should be saying
this on its display so if that's what
you have let's go ahead open the scanner
cover and remove the disk tray and
finally place the printable disk onto
the disc tray push and pull down the
disc guide to open it insert the disc
tray into the disc guide and make sure
to line up the triangular marks on the
disk tray and the disk guide and this is
serious do not push the disc tray all
the way into the disc guide if you do so
it will get stuck inside press ok and
the machine will start running and when
it's done I usually wait for about 30 to
60 seconds and then remove the disk from
the disk tray thanks for watching but I
would really love to hear from you guys
and what printer and updo you used to
print your CD labels leave your comments
