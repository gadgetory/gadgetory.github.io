with the review of the all-night
multi-color LED desk or night lamp using
the white is pretty easy according to
the manufacturer's instructions plug the
provided power adapter into an outlet
the provided cord into the adapter and
then the right turn on the light and you
are pretty much all set but is there
anything to love or not like about this
light compared to other lights out there
on the market well this is what I found
out
starting with what I liked about it it's
a pretty fun light at least for the
first week or so that you have it it's
going to be really fun like
experimenting with all these colors what
you like most or just the fun of having
it turned from this color to the other
and just enjoying that is it's really
fun the other thing I liked about it is
that it is small and bright if I compare
the same light to the one I was using
before there's a pretty significant
difference in size as you can see here
but the brightness is pretty much the
same the only difference is that and the
all-night light uses LED was the one I
had before is halogen so I'm saving
energy by using the on I'd which is
small in the same brightness so that's
good and I also liked the fact that it
uses USB adapter this means they not
stuck with a provided power adapter I
can use one for my phone and I'll still
do the job the provided power adapter
comes with two USB ports which means you
can plug in the lamp and use it as well
as using the other outlet to charge your
phone or tablet the three-level
brightness is kind of course if you are
in a situation where you're not
literally reading or you just want a
little bit of illumination in your room
but not bright light you can go to the
lowest setting or if you're actually
reading and you want
all right you can put it all the way up
so it's really handy it's also really
cool that you don't have to be stuck
with power cords everywhere
so this thing can plug right into your
USB port on your laptop and it will get
the power from your laptop this kind of
makes it portable if I may say that as
long as you're with your laptop you can
use that to power your life it also
works with power banks which means even
if you do not have a laptop but have a
power bank I use for your phone or
whatever you use it for you can bring
that with you and plug this bad boy in
and it was to work so which makes it
kind of ideal for camping and stuff like
that and also I think it's a cool design
it's not the best out there but it's
better than what I had before I like
that it comes with a pen pencil holder I
didn't know how much I needed one until
this one showed up see we have all our
pencils and pens and everything in there
and it looks pretty cool around here
but with all that mentioned this light
can still use some improvements the
first one being I would have loved it if
this was a mini USB input that way I can
use the cord for my phone or my tablet
to power this thing up other than using
a different cord
I was also finding that sometimes when
you press a different color the light
won't turn to that color so if that can
be fixed it was really rare like really
rare but I hate bugs but those are all
minor complaints which might not be an
issue to you generally speaking this is
an awesome light and anyone else can
pick it up and they will love it most
especially those beautiful colors you
know during night time you just want to
be in the mood aid of sleeping off but
that's been for this video please do not
forget to subscribe I'll leave the link
to this product in the description
section go check it out if you're
interested in it and I will see you in
the next video peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
