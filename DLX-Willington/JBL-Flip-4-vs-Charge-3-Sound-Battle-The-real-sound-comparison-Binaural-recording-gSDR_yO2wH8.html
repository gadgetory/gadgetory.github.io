and welcome to another sound battle
well that speakers speak for themselves
in the battlefield today we have the
flip for going up against the charge 3
on a side note if you're new here please
make sure you subscribe it really helps
out a lot in this battle the speakers of
five speeds are webform and high quality
by newell microphone and are playing at
the 80% volume for a more realistic
sound experience please put your
headphones on and let's hear the
speaker's speak
- oh yeah he is good and I can be why
isn't it enough every face and also be
the hit of the Polish Minister break it
down to you and me come down and all
around
Tilda - so all but I have to be me and
everyone dangerously and
in the missing edible
thank me
okay so the judge three is still the
best performer when it comes the best
Department where they sleep fourth
Rallos the base at high volumes the
charge three does not which makes its
best pretty consistent at all volume and
the Charter is also louder than the flip
for but I think that's so the judge
three does better than the flat four as
far as sound the overall sound of the
flip for most especially at about fifty
to sixty percent volume is cleaner and
well balanced than the charge three but
these speakers are four different kinds
of people the speakers are not meant to
be reversed to each other and that's why
you're going to find those differences
in their sound heavy bass levels the
judge three is still the go-to here
Alice size matters but if I were to
choose one based on sound quality the
flip phone would take my vote how about
you let me know what you think down
below if you were just passing by and
found this video please consider
subscribing and becoming part of what we
are doing here I hope you liked the
video if you did don't forget to give it
a like and feel free to share it thanks
for watching this one I will see you in
the next one peace
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
