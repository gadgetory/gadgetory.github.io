welcome to another sound battle where we
let speakers speak for themselves in the
battlefield we have the GPO boom box
going up against the GT KX p90 I knew a
lot of you have requested this video one
I have not been able to bring it as
quick as possible because of you know
money issues but I have it now and we're
going to be comparing it to the boombox
now I know some of you are going to
complain well the boombox is too small
compared to the XP 90 and I get it but
size does not always mean everything so
chill out anyways I'll be using a high
quality binaural microphone to record
this or for the best experience please
use headphones also the XP 90 gets so
loud like it's loud so for that matter
we will be doing the 60 percent volume
comparison in inside but when we get to
100% volume like loudness test or
whatever you want to call it I will move
the speakers outdoors they snore psych
but we will be outside for that because
they get so loud it's unbearable inside
so that's what we will be doing that
said let's hear the speakers speak
okay so like I said the XP 90 is loud
like in comparison to the boombox no
comparison like it gets loud so if
you're looking for which one is loudest
of the two and that's what will help you
decide which one you want to get
hands-down the XP 90 is louder than the
boombox by quite a bit and at the same
time it also sounds a lot more powerful
than the boombox at this higher volumes
but although the highs on the boombox
are not the best out there they sound
better than what's coming out of the XP
90 it reminds me a lot of the XP 60 I
think they have like identically the
same tuning things lacking the it lacks
highs pretty significantly in comparison
to the XPS to the boombox if you put
them next to each other it sounds almost
muffled just because X piece that the
boombox is putting out highs like not
the best but sharper highs well as the
XPS 90 is like there's no highs coming
out of it so in that department that the
boombox textile it there that means on
both speakers are a joke but most
especially on the boombox that made so I
could drowned out there's no mids at all
and also at maximum volume the XP 90 is
actually doing a better job they come
out a little bit better than what the
boombox is putting out where it's
lacking the meds moving on to a best
performance of the speakers this might
be hard for some of you to believe but
the boombox actually has a better best
performance than the xB and 90 that is
not everything but if you listen closely
to the first two sample songs you should
have heard that the boombox is actually
hitting lower notes by the X being 90
is struggles to hit or is not hitting
them at all and if that was not all the
word to you I have a low-frequency test
make sure using headphones because you
won't hear this on a tiny speaker so
make sure you're using headphones by
here is the love frequency test to give
you an idea of what I'm talking about
so like you heard the boom box goes a
lot lower than the xB and 90 with that
said though the XP 90 seems to be doing
a slightly better job outside at maximum
volume and this is because it gets a lot
louder and it punched out music a lot
more powerful than that of the boombox
so here's my conclusion as far as
overall sound the boombox takes the lead
for me just because it has better highs
which the XP 90 is complete completely
lacking and it has a better best
performance it hits lower notes that the
X p90 struggles or is not hitting at all
but the XP 9 Lee would be a better
choice if loudness is your main concern
that you want something as loud as you
can get it and if you plan on using this
on parties where a PA system might come
in handy I don't know why Sony did not
tune this speaker to its its cup
capacity or capabilities I wonder if
they should have used maybe smaller
tweeters other than their like 16
millimeter tweeters I don't know I feel
like if they had at least improved the
highs made them better even if they
didn't touch the best and the late left
it where it is it would have been a way
better sounding speakers speaker but
somehow they did not catch that all they
don't really care or that's what people
who buy that speakers like I I don't
know I don't understand it but yeah
that's been it for me I would like to
hear what you have to say about the two
speakers in the comment section below so
