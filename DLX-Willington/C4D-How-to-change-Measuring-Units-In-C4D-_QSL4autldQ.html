another quick c4d tutorial and in this
one I'm just going to show you how to
change these measurements that cinema4d
defaults to from centimeters to feet or
any other units that you prefer to work
with so I figured it out and this is how
you do it you're gonna have to go to the
Edit settings and then down to
preferences it's really easy when you
open preferences or start from right
here and when you go down here's the
units like I said it's really easy but
yeah so you go to this drop down menu
what is a unit display and they have a
bunch of them here kilometers meters
centimeters millimeters like all of that
stuff right in here so if you're like me
and you wanted to use feet then you just
select that and you all set just like
that you see here down here everything
changed into feet other thing I need I
like to do after that is going to the
Preferences on the project settings
right here and you can get there by
qualified control D you can still get
this display right here but yeah when I
usually after changing that you want to
go here and change your scale to to this
because if you live it I says
centimeters this is all messed up here
that grid spacing is still being shown
in centimeters and yet the project
itself the entire cinema fault is in
feet I usually like to make them the
same so I'll still go down here and turn
this to feet and then it shows me
everything in feet right here so that's
a really really quick and easy way I
hope this was helpful to you if it was
like the video and don't forget to
subscribe to my channel and I will see
you in the
the video piece</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
