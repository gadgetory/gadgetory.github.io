welcome to this unboxing and probably in
a sample video of showing this thing
working
this is dead test for robot vacuum
cleaner so as you guys know I have a few
speakers but every time I put them on
the shelf sometimes I get back to them
and they have some sort of dust on them
and I really really kind of hate that so
I've been wanting to get something that
I can kind of I can keep like you know
so I don't have to like vacuum every
single time but I want it to be
something that would be able to do it on
itself every time so to possibly get rid
of all the dust that might be in the
carpet in here so that's why I got in
touch with Tesla
so they sent me this here hi so back to
the site here and if you guys can see
that I think yeah they can see it yeah
you think so cool does I just kind of
the details about it the desk container
the dust container of this 600 mm yeah
it has auto clean so it can clean by
itself you can probably just time it or
whatever not entirely sure about yeah
here's the box we're going to open it
looks like there's a another box in a
box
a box inside a box I know
I don't know
this fur why can't you just have a box
instead of a box inside of a box and it
says dad box this box is inside that box
and that box is yours on a big box so
many boxes so you got your manual right
here your power brick you have a remote
that's beautiful
that's not even very heavy I'm guessing
this is for cleaning it Auto charging
dock Ashley feels pretty solid it's
pretty cool so they are a labor this is
left that's left to have l.l this is
another left one this is right for some
reason I guess they have to go they look
the same to me no they have an angle
maybe to it yeah they have an angle so
this the right one has to go in there
right our left left and they give you
two of each it's pretty cool maybe just
in case doesn't get stuck in something
okay yeah so yeah this is a tasteful
robot cleaner at the smart mapping
system has done up control it has Alexa
connective connectivity and I believe it
also works with Google
so that's pretty cool you just tell it
to stop cleaning and it will start
cleaning I'm the only thing that I
didn't realize but according to Amazon
it says it should be it's for mainly for
hard floors and faint carpet so I'm kind
of curious to see how it will do on my
carpet because this I wouldn't say it's
thin carpet they put in this on tap
yeah it also has a filter which is
pretty cool I think this is the second
one here that goes with it so yeah it
comes with two filters so that's pretty
sweet
close it up and then you put it in there
so yeah it has Wi-Fi connectivity so if
you want to use the app I believe you
have to connect it to your Wi-Fi you see
the on button yep on and off button
right there and I think this is if you
want to charge it manually just plug it
in there if it charges itself these
contacts right here will connect to this
yeah this contact cell will go right to
this here so so yeah it's features it's
a smart app and voice control its uses
Alex I could go home for his commands to
start and stop cleaning you can use the
app to check the real time cleaning
process or if you've already mapped out
your room or your house you can look at
the app and you stop to you can look at
the app and it will show you how it's
the progress of the cleaning process so
I would say it's a pretty pretty smart
smart cleaning robot so I'm excited to
start using it and I think I will I will
show you guys I'm gonna put some stuff
on my carpet and then Nate
here I will show you how it does
cleaning up stuff off of my nuts also
short carpet is pretty we'll see how it
does with my carpet but I'll show you
guys how that goes but let me just try
to turn it on here and see what happens
hi
this is a table so it can't like go
anywhere because there's stuff all over
the place it's pushing stuff but it
doesn't but it doesn't like fall off
because it knows if you takes the end of
the table anywhere it just moves but all
the small things will just push that was
that was interesting
he claimed my table actually did a
pretty good job so pretty cool so it is
really cool like it really detects the
edges of anything so it wasn't a table
here about you could go to the edge but
it doesn't follow up because then it
comes back like it would stay on here
but if you have small things like this
like this paper here all these things
they will just try to go over it and try
to suck it up obviously can't buy
anything small it will just go over it
but I do like that it's really thin so
for people who have like small like beds
now so so far off the ground it's able
to go under it and I'm pretty sure and
even on some couches this thing is able
to go under it because it's really
really thin like look at that that's
pretty thin
so yes so yeah that's it that's it
thanks for watching I'm gonna be trying
this out if anything goes wrong I'll let
you guys know
[Laughter]
