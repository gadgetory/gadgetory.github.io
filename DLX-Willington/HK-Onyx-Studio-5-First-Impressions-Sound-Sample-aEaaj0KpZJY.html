like you can see I do have the Harman
Kardon onyx studio 5 a lot of you guys
have been asking for this speaker and
finally I ordered it and we're going to
be right for now we're going to be
opening it finding out and get our first
impressions of the speaker
I will also be giving you a sound sample
at the end of the video so you can kind
of hear how it sounds and after that I
want you guys to let me know what
speakers that you'd like to see battle
against this speaker here I don't have
the studio for I don't have lines of
this video if you guys really want me to
compare it to the studio for I might end
up getting it just so we can kind of
compare it but I don't have it right now
so just let me know what speakers you
want me to compare this guy to and I
will get to work all right ok so let's
get into this thing here
okay goodnight looks like you have a
bunch of hardware probably not alright
so let's see what's in here for us how
do you open it
tell me oh no instructions and any
instructions talking about yeah it's a
bunch of stuff yep
that's the cord the cord
that's the cord this is a cool todrick
please applaud for every country here
that's kind of actually pretty cool I
know it is that's all there is in there
I feel like this should be like a manual
and all that maybe that in here
I know yeah that looks pretty yeah
that's pretty pretty and nothing in it I
feel like they use maybe thanks always
some things like these usually a manual
even if these small
that's everything and here we have the
beauty I guess so okay all all jokes
aside I feel like the design to me
personally it's not the coolest thing
yes I know people hated their feet that
they had on the studio for you got it
like that design but somehow I'm not a
big fan of how this thing looks like I
don't know but it is it is kind of cool
I know um beauty is in the hands of the
beholder so I know it's probably it
looks beautiful to some people I'm not
saying that is wrong okay personally I
think it's not the best-looking speaker
all right okay so what we have here
obviously you have your power plus -
play pose Bluetooth connection and in
the back here you do have your port your
your service for them to do the service
if they have to then you also have your
charging port break style and then you
also have an ox in I'm not a big thing
not a big fan of the way that looks
design wise but we are not all about
design we are about sound right so we
will be checking that out and see how it
sounds as far as sound wise you cannot
look like a bear did you think but yeah
I'm going to be doing a sound sample so
don't go away
listen to that and then let me know what
you think about this sound of it and
maybe after that you can let me know
what you would like to see battle
against this speaker right here but for
now enjoy I'm gonna be using a high
quality binaural microphone to record
this so for the best experience please
make sure you put your headphones on
okay let's hear the speaker speak I will
see you in the next video I'm happy to
have to</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
