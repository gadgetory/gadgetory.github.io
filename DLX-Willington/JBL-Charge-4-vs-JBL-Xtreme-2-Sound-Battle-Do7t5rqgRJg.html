welcome to another sound battle where we
let speakers speak for themselves in the
bar field like you can see we do have
the JBL extreme - going up against its
smaller little sibling the JBL charge
for as usual i will be using a high
quality binaural microphone so for the
best experience please use headphones
and with that said now let's hear the
speakers speak
down
and there you have it what did you think
surprised or not I would say for me
there was not a huge surprise the only
thing that kind of surprised me is how
good the charge Falls best performance
stacks up to the extreme - with the size
difference and maybe the price
difference between the two you don't
expect the charge for to do that good
like it's not better than the extreme
towards files based performance but it
is really good if you look at the size
difference between the two speakers so
kudos to the charge for otherwise
everything else I feel like the charge
they extreme - did a better job than the
extreme the charge for the stereo output
is really really good because this is a
mono speaker one giant speaker 50 by 90
millimeter in here well as this has to
you know woofers and - tweeters in there
and I know a lot of you said you don't
care about the mono or whatever but
personally I'm not going to bend over
for JBL and let them continue with the
speaker that the charge for being a mono
speaker I don't like it I do not like
that some people say they don't hear the
difference like when we did the charge
for versus the charge three people
didn't hear the difference wise I could
like hear the sound stage is way
different so that might be part of why
that sound coming up out of the extreme
- is way appealing to me than what's
coming out of the charge for but
otherwise I mean there are some good
things that you could get out of the
charge for so let's say if you are
looking for the smallest of the two this
is way more portable than the extreme if
you're looking for the cheapest of the
two the charge for is cheaper than the
extreme - any other thing if your phone
uses USB type-c this is USB type-c so
you don't
to carry around an extra cable you know
just to charge your speaker if you're
going somewhere so it's way more
portable than the extreme so then the
extreme tuba and those are really really
good reasons if that's what you are
looking for those are good reasons to go
with the charge for but if you're
strictly looking for which one sounds
better the extreme to it is so what do
you guys think I do think the extreme
two as far as sound will be the best
choice and the extreme and the child 4
is more of a portable speaker and I'm
not going to set off JBL go back to a
stereo speaker with a charge 5 or the
charge 4 plus whatever you come out with
I'm not a fan of the mono speaker it's
not bad it's not horrible it sounds good
but at the same time I feel like going
mono was a bad move please go back this
is not a rant video so excuse me for
that but just wanted to say that please
go back to Stevie oh all right that's
been it for this video thank you for
watching drop me a comment and let me
know what you think I'll have the links
to the speaker down in the description

use those links they do help the channel
out you know buying all these speakers I
know that so it does not cost you
anything if he owes if you use those
links they just tell Amazon that you I'm
the one who sent you there so they you
know give me something a little bit a
couple of cents or something like that
but yeah it does help out so for people
who do use those links thank you and if
you're not subscribed might not do it
