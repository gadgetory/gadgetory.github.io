welcome to another sound battle where we
let speakers speak for themselves in the
battlefield today we have the mega boom
going up against the charge three as
requested in this battle the speakers
are five feet away from the sound
recorder and they are playing at 80
percent volume put your headphones on
and let's hear the speaker's speak
I've got nothing to say oh I'm happy to
me down oh yes do you have to win let's
just break it down to you and me uptown
dance another round and the disco ball
pops but I have to Bing me and everyone
can see Inger is this place
you
oh man I feel like the shot three is a
better match to the mega boom rather
than the extreme do you guys agree let
me know in the comment section below and
now let's get down to what I think about
this two speakers so as far as which one
is louder the mega boom is louder than
the charge three and I say this because
people always ask me in the comments
station which one is louder so there you
have it guys the mids and highs a little
bit better on the mega boom which makes
its overall sound brighter than what
comes out of the charge three now when
we get into the lows that's where things
get a little bit interesting the shell
three being that is not as loud as the
mega boom it sounds like it's able to
maintain the richness of the bass better
than the mega boom this does not mean
that the bass on the mega boom is
terrible but for someone listening so
hard to find the difference between the
two speakers you are going to hear that
difference in the bass I feel like if
they had turned down the base of the
mega boom it would have sounded a little
bit better and I think it's something
that you might be able to achieve using
some kind of EQ up but not using the Yui
app because that doesn't really do much
so mega boom buses charge three hum I
honestly could not decide which one to
put on top of the ever they both have
their shortcomings the highs on the jug
three are not very good which makes it
sound a little bit muffled and the bass
on the mega boom is over amplified which
makes it spill into the mids and not as
tight this is a very close call but I
give this battle to the mega boom and
that's because it has a better sound
stage due to its 360 sound output
brighter music and you see no louder let
me know what you think down below thanks
for watching I really hope you found
this video helpful if you did like the
