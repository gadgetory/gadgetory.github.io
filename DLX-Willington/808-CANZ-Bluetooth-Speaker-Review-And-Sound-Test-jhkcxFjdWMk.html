the review of the 808 cans bluetooth
speaker this is going to be equipped
with you so let's get started
it comes in a nice plastic easy to open
box and in the box you get the bluetooth
speaker itself and aux cable a mini USB
charging cable and all the paperwork
stuff that you might need to refer to
out of the box the speaker feels a
little bit heavy which usually is a good
thing you know for this size of speaker
and around the speaker we find this 8 or
8 label which I think looks pretty cool
I kind of like it in down at the bottom
a charging indicator light a mini USB
charging port an aux input a bluetooth
pairing button and a Bluetooth indicator
light there isn't really much to say
about this speaker other than the fact
that it's a solid brushed metal
construction speaker which means it has
a solid build quality which is really
nice I personally like the design of the
speaker and it really does feel and look
compact connecting this guy is also
really easy just turn it on go to your
phone and start forward and that's it
you are connected for the sound test I
have the speaker 7 feet are well for my
audio recording device but as usual I
will first play the music for my phone
so you can listen to it and have
something to compare the sound of the
speaker to and here we go
that's the LG g3
and now the cans
I personally think that for the price of
this speaker the sound quality is not
bad at all
what do you guys think you can leave
your answer down below but I also found
that the grippers on the bottom of this
speaker are not the best so in most
cases you also might want to keep an eye
on your speaker as it tends to move
around on some surfaces if you play
songs with high bass conclusion I think
the speaker is worth the price if you
are looking for something small and
simple to carry around but at same time
get some reasonable music out of it
I think this speaker is worth it thanks
for watching and if you have any
Bluetooth speaker in your mind that you
would like to see me review over here on
my channel leave it down below in the
comment section and I will get to it as
soon as possible thanks for watching
again don't forget to subscribe to my
channel like the video and I will see
you in the next one peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
