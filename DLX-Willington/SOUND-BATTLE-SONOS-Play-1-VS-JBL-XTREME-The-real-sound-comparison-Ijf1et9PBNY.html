welcome to another sound battle where we
let speakers speak for themselves in the
battlefield today we have this Sonos
play:1 going up against the JBL Xtreme
after the play one dominating the charge
3 as far as loudness in the previous
video
plus some requested to see this battle
as usual the speakers are 6 feet away
from the sound recorder and they are
playing at 75 percent volume put your
headphones on and let's hear the
speaker's speak you have to admit
let's just break it down to you and me
uptown dancin on the round and the disco
ball pops but I have to be me don't tell
me
you
and there you have it guys the speakers
are both about the same when it comes to
loudness but as far as sound quality
there are some notable differences that
you guys might have heard when it comes
to the lows the extreme handles the bass
better down the play one as you might
have noticed the play ones bass spills
into the mids in some songs and sounds
strained compared to the extremes bass
which sounds rich comfortable and more
natural in my opinion that means a
little bit more pronounced on the play
one but the highs a little bit more
pronounced only extreme so when it comes
to mids and highs the speakers are about
the same but before my final judgement I
have an announcement to make
if you were a subscriber I really really
encourage you to follow me on Twitter
when I get new speakers I'll be sharing
them there and ask you guys which
speakers you would like to see agonist
which have a new speaker I have in the
house and if you're not a subscriber
please subscribe to the channel for more
awesome videos it really really helps a
lot but as far as this battle the JBL
Xtreme is a clear winner because of its
reach out base and overall a better
sound balance so if sound quality is the
deciding factor for you between the two
speakers there you have it the JBL
extreme but if you're looking for an
entire home system and you plan on
buying more of the Sonos home system
speakers you will be better off with a
play one and all its other sister and
brother speakers like the video
subscribe to the channel if you're new
here and don't forget to follow me on
Twitter thanks for watching and I will
see you in the next one peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
