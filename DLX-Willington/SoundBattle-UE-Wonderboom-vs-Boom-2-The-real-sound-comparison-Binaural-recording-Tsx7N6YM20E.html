and welcome to another sound battle
well that speakers speak for themselves
in the battlefield today we have the UE
wonder boom going up against its older
sibling the UE boom - if you new here
please consider subscribing it helps out
the channel a lot and it also ensures
that you don't miss out on the upcoming
videos in this battle the speakers will
be playing at 70% volume and I'll be
using a high quality binaural microphone
so please put your headphones own for
the best experience without said let's
hear the speaker's speak oh happy to
have to
every would be anger is misplaced
you
so as far as I can tell you II did some
pretty good improvements here and for
those wondering if the Wonder boom is
wondering louder than the boom - the
answer is no the boom - is actually a
louder but both speakers at maximum
volume the Wonder boom is actually
sounding better it does not have as much
distortion as the boom to the boom - has
not been my go-to speaker just because
of the way it handles the lows the only
thing I've always loved about it though
is how clean and clear its vocals are
and I was honestly kind of expecting the
same kind of performance when I got the
Wonder boom only to be surprised the
best response you get from the one of
them is far better than what's coming
out of the boom - it's actually real
love this I mean there's a little bit of
discussion with bass heavy music but I
think the Wonder boom has wandered its
way to the top of the boom - its overall
sound it's cleaner and it has a wider
dynamic range most especially in the low
end of the spectrum so if you're
debating between these two which one you
should buy I would honestly go with the
one of them at least loudness is the
deciding factor for you then the blue
material would be it so I personally
think the one of them won this battle
but sound is so subjective and I would
like to hear what you guys have to say
about these two speakers in the comment
section below if you're new here don't
forget to subscribe so you don't miss
out on the up come
videos thanks for watching don't forget
to leave like and now see you in the
next one peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
