and night together we're will be
unboxing the 12 by 12 inch white balance
18% gray gray difference reflector card
collapsible foldable with a smaller
zippered carry bag those are many words
but I got will be unboxing it as we see
what comes in here right on here there's
nothing really fancy on top of here so
I'll just go ahead as usual and open it
up I don't know what's the best way to
open it
maybe this arrow is saying that open
here I don't really want to cut it not
be good
see I've been looking for a card two
years for my exposure and white balance
mainly and I wanted something big so I
can just use Cree
okay let's quit talking I'm gonna get it
out yeah
yeah what's left in here nothing throw
that away
and here's the thing Ashley looks it's
really small and it looks pretty it's 10
minutes to life of photo is fairly small
as you can see in comparison to my hand
I have really kind of small hands that's
it let's go ahead and open it so that's
the case right there pretty fancy huh
and here's the card itself sorry for the
noise this bag is already noisy but
there
look at that I think he's 12 by 12
invest what they made
just plain white here
way to the target
I think I'm gonna have fun with this I
don't know if this matters
kind of explain here
yeah I think is fair let me see if I can
easily collapse it yeah this is hon Bob
oh I can handle this it's fairly easy
back in and you are good
easy folds up easy and then collapses up
like that
I mean opens up that's a good good good
thing I think I'm gonna love this
