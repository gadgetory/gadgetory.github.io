with another unboxing video today we are
unboxing an LG 16 speed blu-ray disc
writer and this model is the w edge 16
NS 40 I saw this on Amazon and there
were great reviews about it but when I
come to YouTube it doesn't look like
people really got so much into it and
doing videos about it so I decided to do
one myself
after ordering it so yeah let's unbox it
and see what comes inside and you know I
will open this we obviously find all
this good stuff in here
holy crap this is one heck of a huge box
which is these few things I got I
thought that maybe these comes in
another box you know so like it's not
look at that and this is the other stuff
that I got memory cards 32 gigs each and
these are the LP batteries that I got
LPS 6 for my 60 and 780 that's not the
topic for this so yeah this is the thing
right here there's not much of a review
on or unboxing for that matter but yeah
let's look at it so this comes in a
plastic bag I'm not sure if I feel like
there should be another box in a
stuff maybe because they just thought it
was the same order so they just put
everything right in the same but it's
kind of strained it's just like that in
a box I hope it works so so this is the
warranty information and that's how it
looks like not too bad
there's the injection bottle right there
so it's not really anything fancy to
look at on this thing you wanna see the
back it's a subtle connection right
there that's how it gets the data and
stuff so yeah thanks for watching I will
be doing an installation and I will show
you guys how I did that and I will see
you in the next video peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
