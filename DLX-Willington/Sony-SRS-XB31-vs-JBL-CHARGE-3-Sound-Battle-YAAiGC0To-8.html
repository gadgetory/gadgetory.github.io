welcome to another sound battle where we
let speakers speak for themselves in the
battlefield today we have the all-new xB
31 versus our view load the charge 3 and
for those of you interested in knowing
the chart 3 is running the connect plus
firmware as usual I'll be using a high
quality by neuro microphone so for the
best experience please use headphones
with that said well let's hear the
speakers speak
I could do something crazy we should try
to run away it's been so long since I've
been myself I'm going to forget so fast
how to live exactly
I don't you
okay so as far as loudness the SRS XP 31
is a tiny bit louder than the charge 3
both speakers are not terrible but they
sound a little bit different from each
other the charge 3 actually sounds quite
a bit different from when it was first
released and this is because JBL has
sent out a few fun wear updates which
kind of fixed the poor highs it had when
it was first released which is good but
while the highs are better compared to
then they're still not perfect they
sound a little bit silly if the so hurt
and almost too sharp at maximum volume
on the other hand the highs on the XP 31
could use a little bit of boost to maybe
where they were on the XP 30 Sony but
they are not unbearable most especially
at maximum volume the mids are okay on
both speakers but the xp3 one does a
little bit better than the judge 3 most
especially in live sound mode and the XP
31 also has better best performance as
you heard in the low-frequency response
test it goes quite a bit deeper than the
judge 3 which will translate into being
able to reproduce those low notes of the
baseline okay so it's a close call but
while the high zone XP 31 could use some
improvements I think the judge 3 loses
this one not because it's terrible or
because it's old but just because Sony
gives you different sound settings to
customize your listening experience
right out of the box so it's going to be
more appealing to more people with
different listening experiences so if
you don't like the word sounds in this
mode you can turn to the other mode
which is good and I also think the XP 31
looks pretty good but specifically in
this color I love it what do you guys
