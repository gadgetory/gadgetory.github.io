my channel is willington here with
another unboxing video of the geforce
gtx 760 graphics card right away we'll
start with the bugs on side of on the
outside of the front there's nothing
really cool they're just as you can see
other than a really huge logo of the
EVGA a doing a video here that's my son
don't mind him um on it on top here the
top corners you can see just tells you
is a 2gb gddr5 and the GPU boost to
point or it savvy EVGA and that's about
it on the front and in the back there's
a small window there to kind of show you
how it looks like i don't know you can
really see i don't know why they put
that there about whatever that's there
it is and it shows you all the outputs
it has the displayport hdmi DVI I dvi-d
all that on there and it's from nvidia
geforce gtx 760 nothing fun on the
outside here really but you know the
idea is this unboxing video so you can
see anything that you want or wanted to
see about it but i'm excited for what's
inside so let's go ahead and see all
this baby looks like okay there's a seal
right here just go ahead I don't care Oh
cut it if I can figure out how to open
this will be fine looks really cool okay
there we go
yeah and pull it up okay taking off the
seal and here there's another sale okay
here we go and just see what's in the
box here that's it this is on empty box
and whoa what's this cool look at that
now how much like a picture of this
because you guys can't see it fully
looks like a 2 by 3 feet poster which
says innovation inspiration this I don't
know and if you can see that art of the
game but yeah plus there if you like it
kind of cool and here is the hdmi
adapter for your graphics card and
here's the manuals and believe these are
the drivers for the graphics graphics
card and attention thing there this is
just a bunch of user manuals and things
you need to know about your graphics
card put that away we have some cables
here for your card and more cables there
and here is the baby here's the beasts
right there double fans the reason why I
went with this is because it's rated
cool like it's not so loud and I believe
so and it's cool looking to look at that
look at that baby I don't know I'm not
ready because i have a bunch of video on
stuff I'm unboxing so for now this
should be it I'm not going to take it
out of here just because well I'm not
ready for it so I would just show you
that's it that's all that comes in the
box so if you were curious to see that's
all that comes with a box manuals
installation dvds for all your drivers
and cables that you'll need hdmi adapter
and that's it thanks for watching please
