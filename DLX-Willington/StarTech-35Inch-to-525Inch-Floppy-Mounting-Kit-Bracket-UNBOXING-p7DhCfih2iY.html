the unboxing of this project 3.5 inch 25
point 25 inch floppy mounting kit
bracket that's a lot of words so I must
mention that I got two other items into
the sandbox that's why it's already open
so probably if you're planning on
getting this it's going to be in a
different size of box because this had
three items in it so just to make sure
you understand that so I'll just get it
out because the box is definitely going
to be different from yours when you get
this because I mean I had free stuff in
the same box so but this is it right
here this is how it came in a box I have
not opened it yet I'm as excited as you
are to see what's in there so this is it
just the top of the bugs I got this for
my card reader internal card reader that
I love a lot I just build a new computer
and it doesn't have a floppy drive bay
so this was the days that i have on
there a five and a quarter and this
cannot fit in any of them so i decided
to get this and try it out and see and
still use my card video cause i love it
a lot it works pretty sweet so I just
thought that's why I decided to get this
and he just came in ml so that's why I'm
unboxing it is not a lot on top here
like I said this is the name of the the
product and startech.com hard to find
made easy so that's really about on the
outside of the box when we go inside to
see how the actual gonna say converter
comes is just like that this is the day
well not a whole lot comes in the box
but this is what we want it feels fairly
solid and I'm finished with you try hard
you can break it but it's going to be
inside and I don't think I I'm going to
break it or anything I just wanted
something you know for my to hold my
card reader and it comes with four
screwed right screws to mount this baby
in here and let me just go ahead and try
it out this does not come with it so
don't think you're going to get a card
reader with it and if it's pretty sweet
go just go ahead and shoot it's going to
be hard to screw this in here though I
wish it was like a quick release and to
listing because I have to put the screws
in here like I don't I keep see this
maybe that's why they pulled this whole
is here you put in a screw yeah I think
that's it so I'll get a screw throw it
in here and here and here and hold it in
place they align out pretty sweet um
they I can see it really lightens up
well and then here's flash so I think
it's going to walk up pretty good so
yeah that's it that's been the unboxing
of this please go ahead and subscribe to
my channel and like the video it helps
out a lot and yep that's it and I will
see you in the next video peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
