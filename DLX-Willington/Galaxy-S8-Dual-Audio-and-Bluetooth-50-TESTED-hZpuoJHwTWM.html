is the Galaxy s8 plus a very beautiful
phone if you ask me but the reason we
have it here today is because it's the
only phone on the market as of making
this video that has Bluetooth 5.0 2
times the speed of the previous version
which is four point to four times the
range of 4.2 and eight times the data of
4.2 now as a Bluetooth speaker addict I
was mostly excited about the improved
range and the duo audio feature that
Samsung was able to get out of the added
speed and added delicate abilities of
5.0 and those are the main things I'm
going to be talking about here so I was
excited to hear about the 4 x range
because that would mean would get 40
meters or 120 feet range out of a
Bluetooth speaker which is great news
for someone like me so the next day
after getting my a say I took a couple
speakers out to the field to test this
out only to be disappointed the range I
got out of the s8 plus running 5.0 was
the same as what I got out of my older
phone running 4.2 but I'm not going to
call this a lie because that would be a
pretty big fight my guess is you'll be
able to achieve this if both devices are
running five point or least I hope so
I'll have to do more testing when a
Bluetooth speaker running 5.0 gets the
market so make sure you subscribe so you
don't miss out on that now let's talk
about what Samsung is calling dual audio
if you're familiar with be two speakers
you know that most of them at least the
popular ones you can pair them up like
multiple speakers to play the same song
at the same time in sync and the way
they work is one connects to your phone
via bluetooth and then it sends the
audio signal to however many other
speakers that you're trying to connect
and they play in saying for a bigger
sound or
cereal sound experience but it should
come into this is the speakers have to
be the same brand and sometimes they
have to be the same model for this to
work but what gummy excited about this
duo audio is that it would be
eliminating this shortcoming you can
connect to bluetooth speakers or
headphones to play the same thing or
song even if they are from two different
manufacturers now that is awesome
but not quite there yet at this stage in
life it's only good with headphones
mainly because you'll be immersed in
your headphones and you won't hear the
other person is headphones but with
Bluetooth speakers it's not quite there
yet for me as you will hear in the
sample about to play for you the thing
between the speakers is not perfect
there's a millisecond delay between the
audio of the two speakers alright so
this is you the finer microphone that's
how you're hearing and those are the two
speakers that we are going to be using
to try this out this is the very pole
and that is the wonderful so this is
where you are so you should be able to
hear both the sides of the speaker when
they're playing um that's the flip clock
lane so right when you're into your
audio settings here
right here I can just start it on and
there you have it so I'm going to go I'm
gonna move around so there's a little
delay between the sound it's not like
think very well don't you guys can tell
but yeah it smells really really well
and when I move around I'm gonna move
around and I think you get the point but
I wonder if both speakers were running
Bluetooth Python or if that would fix
the problem I don't know I guess we'll
have to test that when five point all
Bluetooth speakers come out but I still
like the feature I think they are
pointing in the right direction and it's
perfect if you're just using headphones
just sharing music between headphones
I'm sure Samsung and whichever companies
decide to pick up on this will be
improving this feature as we go along
I hope 5.0 Bluetooth speakers come out
soon so we can test and experience the
full length of this but as of right now
if you're new here don't forget to
subscribe so you don't miss out on those
upcoming videos thanks for watching this
one don't forget to leave it alike and
I'll see you in the next one peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
