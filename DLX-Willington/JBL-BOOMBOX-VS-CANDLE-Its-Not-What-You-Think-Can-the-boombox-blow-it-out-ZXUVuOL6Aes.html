the JBL boombox with its massive passive
radiators blow out this candle guy right
here I don't know so we're not being
serious here today we're just doing just
a fun little video so if you think
you'll be entertaining to figure out
what's you know what happened is stay
tuned if you think it's just so silly
for you to watch
it's okay you can watch another video
but yeah for those of you who are
interested in watching what happens here
let's do this okay so and the speaker is
already on I'm going to turn this little
guy on there we have some fire kids do
not play with fire you have to have a
parent around when you do that all right
so I'm going to play some songs and
pretty sure this will require some sort
of bass heavy music in order to achieve
what we're trying to get here so I'm
gonna find a song here that has some
good burst to it so this is about 60%
volume now let's play this
I forgot to mention the speaker is in
outdoor mode let's see how that feels
feels like language will switch over to
indoor mode and see what's differences
okay I'm gonna turn it into a indoor
mode because I feel like it has more
best in indoor mode like all of you know
so let's try that and see what the
difference is
that is so close to like blowing it out
but it's still not really doing it so um
but I feel like my furnace just kicked
on so it's a little louder near now but
bear with it we're not really testing
for sound quality so that noise can be
fine
but anyway so indoor mode really does
give out more bass in this candle can
also show you that a lot more than the
outdoor mode can do so but I feel like
it requires a little bit of suss to eat
the best can sustain longer like a
little bit longer than it is I feel like
you'll blow it out so here's what I'm
gonna do I'm gonna go to my frequency
generator here and just generate the
frequency and just have it play and
maybe us do a 50 50 Hertz 50 Hertz
frequency generator here and see what it
does today
to the candle
I feel like it's gonna boil it out
that is not really let's try maybe lower
and lower frequency that's 45
and I feel like he's so close but it's
too II just can't quite do it if it went
longer I would probably blow it all
how about lower maybe forty Hertz
no it loses this strength over there so
45 is about the best the best I think
let's just move this little bit closer
because I they still room there so
just gonna move it a little bit
really
that's so close
like he's gonna broaden my speaker here
I'm gonna go back to that song with it
being that close and see what will
happen so it's still not blowing it out
but I do like the fact that they speak
that the candle the light just dances
with the beat it's really really fun to
watch okay so I just let it run for like
a minute but it still didn't blow out
but I feel like this is more material
candle wax left on this side so maybe
that's blocking the pressure from the
speed from the particular radiator from
blowing it up so my plan is maybe if I
switch this around like this maybe that
will help it to be blown out let's try
that and see I want to do a game there
45 Hertz with a frequency generator
oh that's so close by I feel like he's
burning my speaker do what do it is the
class they were do it do it do it do you
see that that's so close it's gonna it's
gonna blow out it is going it's going
it's going
oh my goodness
scandal I feel like that's a lot but
it's still like holding on
I just want to help it like blow it but
I want that speaker to blow that town
Wow
really how long is it gonna take all
right so it's not easy I'm for it - boy
it out but it did it admit it I did not
help it out and it was able to blow that
sucker up so yes there you have it um
initially I was going to use all the JBL
speakers there extreme to flip for
charge four times three all of them I
was gonna put them on here and try to
blow this sucker out but it was hard for
me to sit them up and you know wind them
up nicely so I just decided to use this
but it still did it so you can blow a
candle out with your passive radiators
on the gpo boombox but it's not really
easy to do so yes that was fun thank you
for watching I'll be coming back with an
actual full serious review video so wait
for that but for this one thanks for
watching I will see you in the next one
