and welcome to this video today we have
the CNP
m2 I've been listening to the speaker
for quite some time it came around the
time I was planning on taking up time
off YouTube so I've had over over a
month of listening to the speaker and
today I thought I would come and tell
you guys about on the M to the N boxing
the experience to start with is now bad
in the Box you get there it comes with a
case and also you get the accessories in
here the charging cable the user menu
but I feel like they're the coolest
things to me is the case here that it
comes in it's pretty pretty such a hard
shell so you can't just break the
speaker it's cold kept safe but maybe
the most interesting thing about the
speaker is the fact that it's a word
speaker which is hand made now that kind
of makes it a speaker that is not for
everybody because I feel like not
everybody's into wood speakers on the
back here is where you have all your
power in a 5 volt USB charging output
for charging your device's we also have
an aux input here in the back your
volume button and finally the power
button
instead so you're starting voices and
they also have an LED indicator back
here for you know you're judging the
speaker and connectivity and all that
but yeah so this is the speaker it comes
in three three kinds of wood this is the
lightest of all of them but it is it is
a good speaker but it's not that speaker
for everybody that is me being honest
it's it sounds good
like I will give you some samples at
where the end of the video and the
speaker does sound good it's well
balanced it's not the louder speaker but
that's one of the things I'm talking
about when I say it's not for everyone
so if you're the kind of person who is
looking for a speaker that you're going
to be using for like parting and
bringing outside and blasting music this
is not the kind of speaker for you and
also it's kind of on the expensive side
which is kind of justifiable considering
the fact that this is a wood speaker and
it's handcrafted so they are made by
hand someone actually gets the tools and
you know works the speaker is not being
run through some kind of machine to do
all the machining and making the spigots
handcrafted it has to be ours
bottom line top here it has all these
drips down here that kind of help it
oops I kind of stay up to the today to
the table pretty pretty grippy but yeah
as far as what I think and also its it
has NFC so that's pretty cool that's
something that we usually see on on some
new speakers but you know they do have
the NFC only here so that's pretty cool
I think it has like 12 hours of play
time yeah close to 12 hours of play time
if you are the kind of person who likes
wood speakers this classic mixed with
more than kind of
because it is a good speaker and it
really does sound good it's not as loud
like I said but it does sound pretty
balanced so they personally recommend to
use this kind of speaker is someone who
is getting a speaker you just to use on
their work table just a longer you know
bedside you know the bedside table
because it sounds really good at low
volumes it sounds really good that you
know the highest it gets but it does not
get super loud like the charge three or
the I don't know the XP 3031
maybe the xp3 but it does sound it
better than all those papers just way
vanished if this is not base heavy and
it's not treble heavy it's just you know
pretty pretty good I think they did a
pretty good job so if you want to pick
one up I put a link in the description
section below but that's my thoughts
about the speaker I'll leave you with
some sound samples to other in there so
you can kind of get a feel of how it
sounds like but like personally I've
been using it quite a few times like if
I'm in a house and working on something
and I just want some sort of background
music it really does sound pretty good
so yeah this is the first speaker that I
got from a CMP cilia and parer
so so far it's a good experience I might
get more into I think they do have some
other speakers they have they think they
have something if you have done this one
so I don't know what do you guys think
are you into wood speakers I mean tell
me something what do you think about a
sewer and pair em - I probably I
personally do like it but like I said
it's not for everybody it's a little bit
on the price see end but if you're into
Bluetooth speakers would you probably
know
because anything more than handmade is
going to be a little bit more expensive
that all the other the plastic stuff
that we use to like JBL's and the XP
line of speakers and all that so yes
does the rest less my thought about the
speaker okay I'm done rambling I'll
leave you with a sound sample of how the
speaker sounds like if you're so much
interest in it and you want me to
compare it to some other speaker let me
know in the comment section below
otherwise enjoy and I will see you in
the next video peace
you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
