flick for is here and in this video
we're going to be looking at the key
differences between the clips 3 and the
new flip for and this it's worth it to
upgrade alright so the only strip 3 the
unboxing experience is going to be
familiar the only differences are just
the size of the box and that the
accessories you get are individually
packaged to this time as far as design
there is not really a huge difference
here I actually would have preferred to
get this in the black version but they
look so alike that I thought it would be
easier for me and you guys to tell which
is which if I got a different color
because as far as design they look a lot
like they're the same I mean they did
some tiny design changes and the flip
phone is actually a tiny bit bigger than
the quick 3 and they also changed the
design of the passive radiators which I
kind of prefer the older ones but you
know they change that alright that's
enough of the exterior let's look into
the interior and see what exactly they
have changed with a 3/4 compared to the
first 3 they update the Bluetooth
version from 4.1 to 4.2 I mean we're
just filming music you probably won't
tell a huge difference but they did and
the speaker also gave some weights from
450 grams on a flip three to five
hundred and fifteen grams on the new
Swift 4 which is honestly not that much
the 3/4 is to rocking a 3000 milliamp
battery like a flip 3 but instead of the
10 hours of playtime they claimed on the
flip 3 they are claiming 12 hours on the
flip for now those are great
improvements by the next three are the
biggest in my opinion number one of the
three being with the same polynomial
drivers like the flick three the three
four now has the lower frequency
response of 17 Hertz
which is good compared to the scripts
tree that only went as well as a five
you can actually hear the difference in
the best and let's take a listen I
recorded this using a high quality
binaural microphone so I advise you to
use headphones as you listen to this for
the best experience and we'll start with
the sample the low frequency response
tests to see which one performs better
we can appeal thing with a trail thing
when I can feel this house familial type
juice reminiscing with buddy yet in the
best epic new bands owned by UNESCO
let's do you cream money all around me
I'm a girl be defined be rich and as you
could hear these quite an improvement in
the loads on the speaker
for more detailed test I'll be uploading
a sound battle of the flip 3 and a flip
for which focuses mainly on how the two
speakers compare sound wise so make sure
you subscribe I'll put the link to that
video as soon as it goes up in a couple
of days if you want to check that out
for more detailed sound comparison in
I'm using different songs welcome to
number two of my three big changes to to
the 3/4 is the ipx7 rating unless the
flip 3 which is only splash proof the
flicks 4 is completely waterproof which
means you can submerge it into water and
it will be fine now the flip 3 was the
huge rival and still is a huge rival to
the UE boom - but its downfall or it's
losing point was that it's not
waterproof like their like the UE boom -
so I believe this is the answer to that
from JBL I'm excited to see and
anxiously waiting to see why you it does
with a boom line speakers and
when they come out with a new OS pretty
soon but let's come back to this video
lastly but not least JBL Kinect Plus
this is good news and bad news
here's the bad JBL Kinect plus is not
backward-compatible at least as of right
now
what this means is that new speakers
with JBL Kinect plus cannot connect with
the older speakers that have JBL connect
that's where you may get a say but
here's the good news with the new JBL
connect plus you're able apparently to
connect over 100 speakers to play at the
same time and that's really all connect
plus enabled speakers that's insane I
would honestly love to try that out but
I don't think I will because I don't
really have $10,000 to spend on that
theory so it's they're lying
I don't know never know it's not from me
so those are the notable differences
between the foot 3 and the new flips for
now the big question is is it worth it
to upgrade from the slips for you to the
flips for that's a trig equation but
this is what I think the improvements to
the flips for from the foot we are not
really that huge in my opinion and the
only reason I recommend someone to
upgrade if they already own a foot 3 is
if the waterproofness of the flip for is
something that you really need or you
really like every bit that you can get
out of the speaker because there's a
little bit of improvement as you heard -
the foot 4 in the Loews department so if
that's something that you crave and want
to have it if you can have it in a small
speaker like this there you have it you
can go ahead and upgrade and maybe also
if you think you'll be using the new
Kinect Plus features but it's not about
means that much to you you're fine with
your flip screen but for the first time
buyers unless you only really really
test budget I would straight out goal
for the wave for because it's obviously
an improvement to the flip 3 and it's
also still a good price for the kind of
sound quality that you get from this
speaker so yeah subscribe to the channel
if you haven't yet I will put a link to
the sound Battle of these 2 speakers as
soon as the video goes live in a couple
days so it picks up check down in the
description section below the link will
be down there so you can check out that
video for a more detailed version of
sound comparison of the two speakers
thanks for watching again again
subscribe and I'll see you in the next
