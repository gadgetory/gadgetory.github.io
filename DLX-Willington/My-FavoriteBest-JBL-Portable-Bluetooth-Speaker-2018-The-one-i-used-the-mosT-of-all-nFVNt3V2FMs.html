welcome to these somewhat different
video for all the others but first of
all my kids are close by there so you
can hear them and I'm sorry about that
but they just keys so don't don't mind
him just listen to me okay I've always
wanted to do a video of this kind of so
like at the end of the year kind of
talking about which speakers I know that
and this is my first attempt to do that
so if you liked it let me know and maybe
I will do some other videos first of all
before I tell you which one is my
favorite speaker from JBL
20:18 I actually just wanted to point
out that this was actually released in
2017 as well as this and as well as this
title says 2018 but the reason is these
are the current speakers in their lines
so in the extreme line this is the
current one in the pulse line this is
the current one in which flip and flip
line this is the current one that's why
that all included in this video here so
yeah just so you understand but anyway
so first of all out of all of these this
takes the lead for the most beautiful
speaker I think I think actually out of
all the speakers I think it like like
all the speakers I own I like the look
of the white xp3 one looks pretty good
but I still think this looks way better
like oh I want to also to say all these
are made for different reasons for
different areas to be used so they will
have their own capabilities over the
other like as far as play time like you
can use this outdoors it has an outdoor
mode and all that well as all these
don't so they all have their own
bitterness too you know as far as what I
made
so which one was my most used best
speaker from JBL all of these one is
here
can you guess boom box click - I mean
quick 300 now Oh actually yeah this
right here the JBL extreme 2 has been my
favorite my most go-to speaker to use
out of all of this and I know it's a
little bit bigger it's a little bit on
the big side but if you put it next to
this it's actually not that big and it
comes with a lanyard that you can strap
around your shoulder to hold it but I
really do think JBL did a pretty good
job with the GBO
extreme - I feel like the extreme has
some advantages over the extreme - and
mainly the loudness
I wish the extreme - was that loud it
would have been a perfect speaker and a
perfect replacement for the popular
extreme but at at same time they did a
pretty good job balancing this thing out
it has better bass performance and I
found myself bringing it outside a lot
of times more than any of these other
speakers out here just listen to it and
use it most of the time they definitely
could have done better like a roadie
mentioned but I still think it's a
pretty good speaker in comparison to all
of this I used it way more it sounds way
better the boombox here has some issues
with the mids they're too low and it has
its own failures if I'm going to be
outside for quite some time
working all over the place like
something like that I would use it more
than any of these and that's because of
how loud it gets I can just put it
somewhere further away and work on stuff
and I could still hear it and that's
also like maybe the only time I would
use it though like like when I'm outside
or if I'm just going to be without him
inside and outside is also nice because
I don't leave so close to neighbors so
I'm okay I can get away with that
without disturbing anybody and you know
being loud so I can use it outside and
that's mainly where I was using it but
if I don't need that loudness I always
use the extreme two and then all of
these runners here on the church for is
kind of new but I don't expect to use it
as much as in like this speaker right
here the flip phone I used it a couple
of times but again not as much and then
these two here I feel like the only time
that I have used any of these is mainly
just to test them and do videos other
than that I honestly just leave them in
their packages and they just sit there I
haven't it's kind of bad but that's I
don't really use those smaller speakers
very much I like the flip fold that is
really really portable you can take it
places but this video is mainly just to
tell you guys what I use the most and
what my favorite speaker has been as far
as JBL's line-up of speakers and yep
that's it do you guys have something
different would you have chosen a
different speaker out of all this yes I
think that makes the end of this video I
really would like to hear back from you
I'll leave the links to all of these
speakers down in the description section
below so if you wanna check out one
please feel free I'll leave the links
down there it also helps me out a little
bit but yeah thanks for watching happy
holidays and Happy New Year
coming up pretty soon I will see you in
the next video peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
