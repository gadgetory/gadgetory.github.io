welcome to another sound battle where we
let speakers speak for themselves in the
battlefield so that we have the sony SRS
XP 31 going up against its bigger
brother the XP 41 those of you who have
been wondering if there's a sound
difference between these two at all and
this one is for you as usual I'll be
using a high quality binaural microphone
so for the best experience please use
headphones with that said let's hear the
speakers speak
something crazy so long
any club like Proust is gonna say put
your gas that now watch your watch
pick a charge Apple my flow ready free
okay so obviously the XP 41 is quite a
bit louder than the XP 31 so if that's
your purchasing deciding factor that's
an easy one
the XP 41 handles best better than the
XP 31 and this is mainly because of its
bigger drivers its housing and while
both speakers are rated to go as low as
20 Hertz the usable frequency on the XP
31 is around forty three thirty five
Hertz or so while the XP 41 sounds
pretty legit even lower as we heard in
the low-frequency response test earlier
but that's all the XP 41 has to offer
loudness and best but if you're looking
for an overall better balanced better
sounding speaker of the two the XP 31
takes the cake
both meats and highs on an XP 41 a week
which makes it sound a little bit
muffled against the XP 31 which has
better makes better highs good balance
between Meads bass and highs it sounds
brighter open-end well better and yes
you can use the EQ in the app and make
things a little bit better on the XP 41
but people tend to forget that what you
get using an EQ depends on what you have
to start with so there is that and yes
the live sound mode is better on the XP
31 for those of you who've been asking
me but I personally think it has to do
with the overall sound of the XP 41 and
not necessarily that the future was
implemented differently on the XP 41 in
comparison to how it was done on the XP
31 but yes it is different and I think
it sounds better on the XP 31 in
conclusion if you're looking for a
better sounding speaker the XP 31 is a
better buy here not to mention the fact
that it's actually cheaper so there is
that I do have my Amazon affiliate links
down below for an up-to-date pricing on
these speakers and if you use them you
are also supporting the channel which I
would really appreciate a
large drop me a comment down the law
likes really help out if you liked the
video but if you didn't like it feel
free to dislike it all I want is some
sort of feedback from you just because
you watched a video don't forget to
subscribe if you haven't yet thanks for
watching this one I will see you in the
next one peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
