Wellington here and welcome to this
video like you've already probably seen
that the title of the video we do have
that okay ninety nine in the house it's
a huge speaker that's why we kind of
needed to have some sort of a I'm a
bigger room than normal so here we go um
yeah like I took you in the previous
video I do have some audio from LG so
we're going to be checking that out and
then next few videos oh so this is going
to be just a boxing video so just
checking it out of there looking at it
and see how it looks like and maybe get
a sound sample or something like that
and then I'll be coming back with a full
own detailed review because it sounds
like it has a ton of features that I'd
actually want to try out and test them
out before I actually you know come back
with a full-on review explaining what
they all do or what I actually think
about the audio of the thing and all of
that so today let's unbox it see our
first impressions the thing is huge I'm
not sure it's with with that angle you
can actually tell how big the box is so
and it's heavy look at that this is a
huge huge box you can decide here it has
the the picture bit of the speaker right
there
you see it this thing is huge look look
at that so yeah it's a huge huge speak
above its food bucks and see you can't
really see much from there can you and
they should let's see this I can give
you guys another angle there's the box
right there and right to the side here
the box you start finding your
accessories I'm not sure what's in there
right here power is huge it's still
pushing let's get this thing out of here
but it does look sweet if you would
sweet sweet sweet look at those wheels
easy to move that's the ACM so your
power supply right there oh wow
that's the font but it looks clean I
actually like the way it looks
this thing is looks sweet I feel like a
like oh come on this is facing now I
feel like if you're going to be mixing
some music it has to face this way let
me get this camera so I can show you
what I mean see that these are looks
like you're supposed to stand to stand
on this side here which to me it feels
like I'm supposed to be this way if I'm
going to be mixing music for somebody
know what I mean
because if I stand here and I mixing he
was sick and then I'm blocking the sound
from here if that makes any sense but I
guess this is just it's not supposed to
be like professional DJ kind of
experience it's just to give you some
sort of professionalism I'm guessing so
but yeah I do like the way it looks
though man like I said I'm going to be
doing a full on review after figuring
out all these things here
I do kind of like the way it looks you
have to do microphone inputs right here
and then I IR blaster here for probably
the remote I know that really I have a
disc here you can use a CD when you have
two handles in about in the sights here
- this thing on this side - yup
this is a handle here to name is the
handle back here it's just a one where I
will make it easy for you to just pull
it you know just leaning back gets on
its wheels then you can just pull it
it's pretty pretty handy actually a knee
back here is a lift right Roxanna oh
that's the other court is sewing they're
releasing that yeah for the FM radio and
then the optical I'm gonna try that one
out because my TV has an optical out so
I'm probably gonna be trying it out I'm
gonna try to do karaoke with this thing
- so definitely stick around for there
for the full review if you're not
subscribed yet you might want to do that
because I'm gonna be really putting this
thing to the test with all the things I
says it does but man I do like the way
it looks
this looks like pretty here sweet
pretty sweet use a manual and I'm
guessing this is the antenna yep so have
batteries for the remote man this is the
probably the warranty card okay so these
are batteries in here that go into the
remote looks like you can do quite a few
things in here is see all those
functions and then what's in here what's
in this box
oh wow I didn't think that microphone
was included we they actually give you a
microphone yes it comes with a
microphone yeah hey don't be on my video
pants know what is does come with a
microphone it doesn't feel like a pretty
awesome microphone but I wasn't
expecting any at all so even just
getting this that's pretty sweet
so you get a microphone you get the
remote you give them antenna and you get
the power
so yes so let's plug the speaker in
right there so now I'm feeling power I'm
right there power it's interesting it
has it fan right here to help things
cool up probably because it has an amp
in man that's gonna be working depending
on how you used in it it's so hard then
it's gonna be working hard all right I'm
gonna be turning it on here
look at that hallo it has a screen
that's a screen right that is pretty
sweet pretty pretty sweet
alright good there's a light look cool I
think it's cool okay
all right how do we I feel like we need
to do play something
when I feel like a DJ right now he's
feeling this I think is pretty cool
feels like something like the audio is
clipping so I might not sound that great
but I think generally it is pretty
really cool I actually want to try new
the microphone a little bit and see if
that works right away okay so I turned
you off there the echo and now the
microphone sounds not echoey so that is
pretty cool I think it is yeah I don't
know the audio doesn't sound terrible
like from the microphone I think is
pretty pretty decent but so far are you
actually pretty impressed by the thing I
think it's pretty sweet oh this is the
mic volume here and this is the actual
yes I'm going to be doing a lot more
bullets right here okay guys so as far
as unboxing I feel like that's enough
I'm definitely blown away the only thing
is that this is not a portable speaker
it has to be plugged into the wall in
order to get sound from it but as far as
just the actual speaker and all the
features everything that I've seen so
far it's something that I'm interested
in exploring I feel like it's a good
speaker that anybody can enjoy to have
most people who have some sort of like
parties like house parties I know that
but I'm going to be doing a full-on
review like after looking through each
and everything about this speaker and
