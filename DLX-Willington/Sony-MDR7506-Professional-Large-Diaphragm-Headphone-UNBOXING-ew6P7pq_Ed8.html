unboxing the sony MDR 7 5 or 6
professional headphones now I must
mention that the Box might be different
from the one I have right here just
because I have two more items that I got
with this headphones so I got this and
this so they should be all in here so
your box might be different shipping
from amazon but let's go ahead
it's back to this this is how the
headphones come they look pretty nicely
packed in here looks cool let's get rid
of this get it out of the way and come
back to this well let's get this out of
the way too so here looks kind of open
but I don't think that's a problem now
the bulk of the box is nothing really
interesting let's just go ahead and open
it here on top here just says you know
Sony headphones then top it seven five
or six the back is nothing really let's
go ahead and open it right get it out
that's here on here just parts how its
assembled or different parts are
indicated on here and this one here is
just a warranty card so we'll skip that
comes with a film covering it and right
here I've been guys hmmm looks kind of
neat here it's like covered in this
sudden quote feels so soft and here's
the heady jog this is a cloth feels
really soft soft it's kind of cool we'll
get rid of that and here's the pan it
comes with this adapter right here go
ahead and put it on scrolls right on
sweet right here is the pouch like case
for it for the headphones I guess when
you're carrying them somewhere they give
you a case here kind of a pouch for them
and let's see how long this cable is
just gonna wrap it off and take this off
hope I don't break anything
I think I'll grab a knife and just
cut this off it's kind of being stubborn
hmm okay got it
right see here it is they feel nice I
like them this ear cups feel really
really nice and they are I would say
comfortable yeah
they feel comfortable but I'll do a
review and tell you guys how they
actually feel you know after using them
for some time and this is the code that
comes with it it's pretty long
actually it's pretty long but this is
just an bucks thing they fold up here
then you can yell put them on the Polish
and see right there and I would say they
fit so now we get the cord and put it in
here too and you're good to go this is
just on the boxing so I'm gonna go ahead
and get done with it please subscribe to
my channel for more unboxing videos and
review videos and yeah I think I will
see you in the next video peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
