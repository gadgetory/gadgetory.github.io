knock knock who's there
watch achoo gesundheit
hey yo what's up YouTube
Wellington here and welcome to this
video now every once in a while one of
you will ask me what's because you
should be using with your Amazon echo
dot and I usually don't really have a
straight up answer and that's because
while I have so many speakers Bluetooth
speakers that I could recommend all of
them they sound good but after a certain
period usually about 45 minutes of no
Bluetooth activity they go into battery
saving mode and they just turn off if
you plug the speakers in constantly they
usually that usually would ruin the
battery of your speaker I know this
firsthand because I was using my echo
dot with the Vavoom 20 I believe 20 or
21 not sure what is cold but I was using
it for about six to eight months or so
so I out have it plugged in 24/7 that
worked for the first mmm well well for
the time I was using it until I started
noticing that the sound of the speakers
like terrible and then when I unplugged
it just to see what's going on
it stopped like working so light up when
you have it plugged in but they wouldn't
hold a charge and it just said
astounding really really bad so I
retired that but that's that's the thing
that's the thing like if you can't just
have a speaker plug in the entire time
because they would usually that usually
would ruin the battery of a Bluetooth
speaker but today I'm making this video
because I found something that I can
finally
recommend to you guys who have the
Amazon echo dot under the second
generation and what I have here is Bongo
this is called Bongo this is this is
this is a game changer for someone who
has the Amazon equity the second
generation first off it kind of looks
cool so we can talk about that it has
this the fabric which feels nice but
it's also a pretty lasagna I kind of
don't like that but it does feel feel
nice it has this handle here it looks
more than I feel like it can work nice
anywhere that you want to put it but the
magic to it is how its able to transform
your tiny little Amazon and cord at the
second generation into this bigger
speaker that sounds a lot better I mean
they if you're using the Amazon echo dot
just by itself is good for talking like
just fog war responses that you get from
it but if you want to listen to any sort
of serious music it doesn't really cut
it for me so I've been using different
stuff to do that but this is like the
game changer here I haven't had any
anything that's specifically designed
for it the Amazon echo is in there it
looks like it fits like you can't even
tell that this is a separate unit and
putting it in there this is how you do
it just twist and left it has two
speakers in here
they said 360 sound I don't really
country to that but yeah the speakers
are kind of targeted off of axis so you
have a wider area of communication and
then
in the back here you also have my PR a
passing radiator which is also which
also enhances them the best performance
of the speaker you just put your thing
back on here the cover you see that blue
strip here that matches that blue strip
that you can see right in there and then
as you match them up that tells us why
he's supposed to be sliding just like
that then you twist and it's locked in
place this is really really nice like
you can see I'm one of them the things
that we'll have about it is that the
ability to go wireless
like this is it is no cord attached to
it I can so I can take it outside if I I
need to listen to music from outdoors or
use Alexa
outdoors with no and there she is so I
can go outside without having to worry
about plugging it in on unplugging if I
was using just this and I can listen to
music basically anywhere using my ear
cut that so that is the first thing and
it actually has two batteries in there
like you see here it does have a USB air
output here for charging your device or
phone or anything like that and when you
use that it does not take away from the
F chord ad so it has its separate
battery that is powering it so this is
put there specifically for you to use
for charging your battery unlike most of
the Bluetooth speakers when you usually
will get this output here all those
speakers but what they do they actually
drain the battery of the speaker itself
so it's performance is being taken away
as you charge your phone or the gadget
that you're trying to charge it's a
power bank and a speaker which is made
to work with your Amazon
echo dot second-generation so it's not
like going to sound like the greatest
speak like that I had but it's a hundred
times better than just Amazon echo dot
so yes for people who've been asked
asking me this is what are you using
right now I like the way it works it
does look good blend singing a lot of
like places you'll have to worry about
changing the the way stuff look like
anywhere you put it I feel like it just
looks good and the other thing too it's
easy like if I if you only have one of
these and run a living room but you want
to go upstairs to the infant room but
you want to bring the music that you
were playing on it with the echo dot you
would have to unplug it and it would die
then you go upstairs then plug in
restart and all that but this just pick
it up and take it upstairs and keep
listening to the music that you were
playing on it so it's really really
really handy in that way anyways so yeah
that said if you have any questions let
me know but definitely if you only the
second generation of the echo dot and
you're looking for something to use this
is something I would recommend I've been
using it for about two months two to
three months or so and it's awesome like
honestly I have only this one and
sometimes I'm upstairs
sometimes I'm downstairs if I'm playing
some music for some reason and I need to
bring it up I can just like carry it
like right now I just put it up here to
do this video and it's still working the
battery does last for some time I
haven't actually tried that out to see
how long you would last before dying so
sorry about that but it's it's something
that I would recommend to any
anybody looking for a speaker to use
with your Amazon echo dot hey Alexa what
is Bongo Bongo is usually defined as a
small drum played with the hands or
alternatively large forest antelope of
Central Africa having the reddish brown
coat with white stripes and spiral horns
okay that is not the bongo we're talking
about talking about this bottle here but
it kind of looks like it right anyways
thanks for watching this one I'll leave
the link to this bond go down in the
description section below if you want to
pick up one for yourself go ahead and do
that
I am so sweaty right now I have to end
this video I'll see you the next one oh
and thanks to Bongo or the makers of
Bongo for sending me this lovely thing
I've been loving it
I appreciate it a lot thank you guys by
this time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
