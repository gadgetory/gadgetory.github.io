and welcome to another sound battle
well that speakers speak for themselves
in the battlefield today we have the
Soundlink mini - going up against the
charge 3 on a side note if you're new
here please make sure you subscribe it
really helps out a lot in this battle
the speakers are 5 feet away from a high
quality binaural microphone and they'll
be playing at 70 percent volume for a
more realistic sound experience please
put your headphones on and let's hear
the speaker's speak
Oh
Oh
so if wellness is the deciding factor
for you between this two stop watching
right now subscribe and go get yourself
a charge the week it's the loudest of
the two and for those of you who are
still here
this is my opinion on these two both
these two speakers are pretty known for
their performance when it comes to best
and as you've heard they both do a
pretty crappy job okay
maybe that's a joke but in all
seriousness both speakers performed
pretty good but I do prefer the bass
that is coming out of the charge to read
the mini to seems to struggle a little
bit and you can hear some discussions in
some bass-heavy songs which the judge
three is able to handle with a little
bit more comfort and this becomes a lot
obvious at max volume coming to the mids
both speakers could use a little bit of
uplift in the upper mids because they
both sound a little bit drowned in most
songs in my opinion I also found that in
some songs the charge 3 has more details
in the highs compared to the mini - I
mean like the high hats are more defined
um this is what I mean listen for the
high hats in this song and let me know
what you think in the comment section
below
so if I were to choose between these two
judging by how they sound they charged
we would be it and that's just my
opinion sound is so subjective and I
would like to hear what you think about
these two speakers in the comment
section below
if you were just passing by and found
this video please consider subscribing
and becoming part of what we are doing
here I hope you liked the video if you
did don't forget to give it a like and
feel free to share it thanks for
watching this one I will see you in the
next one peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
