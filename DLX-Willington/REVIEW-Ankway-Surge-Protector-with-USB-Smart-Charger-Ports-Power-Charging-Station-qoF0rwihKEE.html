review of the anchor wave power charging
station which comes with two AC outlets
and five USB smart charger ports now
before I give my personal pros and cons
of this product I should say that this
is one of those things that you will
never know how useful they are until you
own one of them being able to plug in
your electronics for charging on top of
the desk as compared to going under the
desk is both a back and time saver okay
so with that said these are my personal
pros of the anchor a power charging
station the packaging of this product is
quite impressive if you consider the
price you're paying for it you can tell
that they are really trying to give you
a full experience of their product
starting with the packaging and out of
the box it feels and looks nicely
constructed it's made out of a fireproof
ABS plastic for a durable design with
damage resistant housing it comes with a
four and a half foot long cable which
for me it was long enough to go from the
floor underneath my desk to the top of
the desk where I wanted to place it on
the desk it's an 18-gauge power cord
with a PVC insulation and copper wires
another thing I liked about it is how it
comes with three prong outlets this
means you can pretty much plug anything
into this power station this unit also
has an overcharging and overheating
protection the judging will be
automatically stopped when batteries for
which is nice I also liked the feature
of the dark being able to dock your
phone or tablet right there as you
charge it is kind of awesome and the
fact that all the five USB ports are all
smart ports that's really awesome too
and I also like how they have all these
ports facing up it helps a lot saving
room are
the unit and the disc itself I also like
that it has an on and off switch it's
really really hand if you're not using
the unit just turn it off like you know
overnight or something like that and
yeah it's off so that's really nice it
also has an on and off indicator light
but to me it's more of the con and here
is why it's really hard to see and it's
located in the USB ports yes inside the
USB ports so if you have all those USB
ports filled you are not going to be
able to see the way at all and that is
my number one corner of this product
another thing is that I would have loved
to see different color options that you
can get in this product at least black
most of my gadgets that i own a
ninety-five percent black so if I have
that option of getting a black one I
probably would have gotten that so angry
if that's something that can change we
would love to see a different color of
this product a detachable power cord
would have met this thing a little bit
more portable and easy to move around
the desk so I'm hoping for that in the
next model the other thing is the dark
is kind of small with my LG g3 if I take
the case off it will fit in the dark if
I put it on it's too big to fit into the
dark so I kind of have to lean it on two
different stuff around it so yeah my
point is it would have been useful to
make this a little bit bigger just a
touch bigger just so it accommodates a
wider range of sizes of phones and
tablets with all that said this is an
awesome power charging station that
everyone will appreciate having on their
desk I personally would give it a 4 out
of 5 just because there's something that
would have been better like I mentioned
above i'll leave the link to this
product in the description section below
so you can check it out on amazon and
maybe read more about it over there
and see what other people are saying
about it and please do not forget to
subscribe to my channel and I will see
you in the next video peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
