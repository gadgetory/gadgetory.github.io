have always thought that the GBO extreme
is an extremely big speaker you might
want to rethink that because this is the
JBL boombox a lot bigger than the
extreme coming in with about eleven and
a half pounds it's the newest addition
to JBL swine portable bluetooth speakers
hey what's up tube Willington here and
welcome to another video now my son is
downstairs running around so if you hear
something in the background of a little
kid just kind of ignore that finally I
have my hands on the JBL boombox I've
been waiting for a long time and it's
taken forever to get my my speaker in
but I finally have it we're going to be
taking a close look at it see what
features we get with it
listen to some sound samples to get a
little feel of how it sounds like
starting with the appearance or design
of the speaker it looks a lot like a
blown-up version of the JBL extreme same
shape same fabric too huge PRS and both
sides of the speaker with just an
addition of a handle it looks a lot like
the designers were lazy too lazy to come
up with a new design of the speaker so
unless they're trying to tell us that
this is what's replacing the JBL extreme
which I would not be a big fan of that
because I feel like we do need at least
something in between the chart three and
this new big boom box so that should be
something in between there you cannot
get rid of the extreme of dust you're
thinking and also I want to ask you the
same thing would you be fine with JBL
getting rid of their on the extreme just
to go from charge three to the boom box
or a year with me here let me know what
you think in a comment section below so
just like with the extreme this is a
directional speaker which means being in
front of it will
you the best sound experience the
boombox also has an IP x7 rating which
means it's completely waterproof you can
submerge it into water and that will
cause no harm to the speaker at all and
in addition to that it can float so if
you aren't about on a lake or something
like that in a pool and it dropped it
dropped in it won't be going to the
bottom so you won't have to dive down to
the bottom to get it it will stay
floating on top so that's always a nice
touch in front of the speaker at the
very bottom we find the battery
indicator lights above that the JBL logo
just like on all their other speakers
and just above that are the control
buttons your bluetooth pairing button
volume rockers the power button the
connect plus button and at last the play
pause skip button and right around the
corner at the back is where you will
find your new button that you will be
using to switch between the indoor and
outdoor mode hiding behind this flap is
your audio jack two five USB ports for
charging your power-hungry devices and
right in between them is a service port
which you probably won't be using it for
anything except for JBL or whoever
services your speaker and lastly at the
very end is a 20 volt charging port for
recharging your speaker and before you
put this thing into water expose it to
water you should always make sure this
flap is sealed tight if you didn't know
that you are welcome inside the speaker
is running bluetooth 4.2 has two four
inch woofers and two 20 millimeter
tweeters with a total power output of
sixty watts the boom box also has an F R
rating that goes as low as 50 Hertz
which is really really good although I
was kind of expecting something a little
bit lower than that and all of this has
been powered by a 20,000 mAh
rechargeable battery that is huge it
takes about six and a half hours to
fully recharge if it's fully drained and
depending on how you use it you can get
up to 24 hours of playtime now the
Xtreme had so many proud
when it came to charging like the
judging system had had so many problems
so I'm hoping that they fixed all of
that with this boombox because I will
not be happy but time always tells so
let's give some time so it's just like
the flip for in the palace 3 the JBL
boombox is also connected plus enabled
you can amplify your listening
experience by wirelessly connecting more
than 100 GB I'll connect plus enabled
speakers you can connect them using the
button here or using the JBL up speaking
of the app with a boombox when you go
into the app you have an option to
disable those annoying startup tones
finally we can do that if they can only
allow that to be done to all their other
speakers they will have a lot of happy
customers but it's JBL they probably
don't even care you can also use the app
to switch between indoor and outdoor
mode if the speaker is far away from you
which is kind of nice speaking of which
how about we play some sample music I
think we should I'll be switching in
between indoor and outdoor mode and then
depending on the weather outside we can
go outside and listen to a couple of
songs play in the outdoors I'll be using
a high quality buy neuro microphone to
record it's all for the best experience
please use headphones
around everyone
I'm surprised on its face smile for a
break with the MSHA you I'm gonna get
inside
seems to me everything has been so far
he was like I need your help
okay guys so I've been wanting to film
this video for the past two days and
every time I get out the weather gets
pretty bad in right now right up to
setting up and getting ready to start
the rain just started raining and it's
really really windy so I don't know I
mean I could probably do it in the rain
so you guys can kind of experience that
and hear how it sounds like but the
weather has turned around again on me so
I don't know let's play one song maybe
let's just listen to one song with this
kind of wind and kind of rainy and hear
how that sounds in the outdoor mode that
maybe in the next couple of videos that
I will be doing maybe comparing it to
other speakers we can listen to it and
actually hear how it sounds like I'm
outside in a more calm weather so I'm
really sorry but I can't I can't control
the weather so we're gonna have to bear
with me in this one stay tuned
I gotta say I'm really really really
sorry guys about that outdoor shot um
the weather has not been good for the
past pretty much the entire week so and
I've been putting off the videos for the
past two days just so I can get the
outdoor shots but I just couldn't push
put putting off the video so I just had
to go with that and I'm hoping but it at
least gives you an idea of how the
speaker sounds despite of all the noise
and a little bit of rain and a lot of
wind so at least hope that at least give
you an idea of how the speaker sounds
like outdoors anyways coming back to the
indoors this thing is pretty loud so I
don't really see anybody playing this at
100% volume inside unless you are
actually having an you know a party
inside and your needs you know something
loud to go to dance to but outside I can
see it going to 100% by inside yeah like
I said unless you having a party I don't
think you'll ever crank it up to 100%
it gets pretty loud as far as sound
quality you're not getting a flat sound
the best you get when playing an indoor
mode goes deeper like it's slower on the
frequency curve but it's not as loud but
when you turn on the outdoor mode you
get a loud bass but that's because they
have boosted the upper base there so
it's louder it feels like it's a lot
louder but it's actually not doesn't go
as deep as the indoor mode does go and
you can hear this if you go back and
listen to those samples that we played
and just listen to the kicks in those
song selling I don't know a couple of
songs when you listen to the kicks you
can actually hear that you're hearing a
deeper bass when the kick drops but when
you're when you go today outdoor mode is
the bass is louder but it's just the
upper bits and you don't hear that heavy
heavy best when you're playing in
outdoor mode the needs are a little bit
suppressed in both modes and the up
heis a little bit they sound a little
bit weird like they're suppressed or
something like that not very not very
right but it's not something that's so
so noticeable so for a regular listener
they probably won't even tell that
difference at all if you ask me the
overall sound is not mind-blowing but
it's not bad
I might have also set my expectations a
little bit too high considering the
price and the size of the thing so I was
expecting a little bit more than that if
you're best lover and you only care
about the best you're probably not going
to be disappointed but if you're someone
looking for clean balanced music you
might have to play around with the EQ in
order to achieve what you're looking for
Sony and most of other manufacturers
will usually lower the best as the
volume of the speaker goes up and do the
opposite as the volume goes down but JBL
is doing next to none of that which
means even maximum volume you're going
to be getting a significant amount of
bass coming out of the speaker now this
is also kind of bad because those highs
get even harsher when you are at maximum
volume most especially if you are
indoors but also when you're listening
to low low volume the speaker still
doesn't boost the best so you'll still
be listening it does not sound like a
big speaker sound like any other tiny
speaker that's playing so I feel like
they should have at least lifted up the
bass a little bit as the volume went
down at least in their thirties 30%
volume or something like that otherwise
it sounds small when your volume is
blowing one is volume is all the way up
it sounds like a big speaker so I don't
know okay so I think I've covered
everything if there's anything that
you'd like to know about the boombox
well just let me know down in the
comment section there and I know you
guys probably really really want to see
this against the JBL extreme and yes I'm
gonna be working on that video but if
there is any other speakers that you
would like to see battle again
