and welcome to this update video so as
you guys know I've been away for quite
some time now and I'm making this video
just to update you guys on what's been
going on and you know what's new was
coming and all that good stuff now first
things first I'm not in my studio that's
why you're seeing that artwork behind me
I mean the boys room doing this
recording for some reasons you know okay
the reason is I do have a baby girl now
I have a baby girl which is really
really awesome you guys have seen my
boys here on my channel a few times in
some videos and now we do have another
addition to the family
and that's the main reason I took some
time off just to spend some time with a
new baby and the family and just get
used to you know a larger larger family
and it's been great I'm hanging out with
my family and I don't know just getting
used to the - having a girl and having
the bigger family that what's been the
norm you know what I'm saying so it's
been good it's been great I have the
time I've been doing that but I wanted
to let you guys know that I am back that
thinks might not be still the same like
I'm not sure if I'll be able to pump out
as many videos as usual like two three
videos a week but I'm gonna be trying as
much as possible as you guys I
understand having another addition to
the family kind of needs juggling some
things here and there so it might not be
as often as many videos but I'm gonna be
trying my best to put out videos as
quick as many as I can my goal is to be
able to keep it going as it's being but
if not going the same way I just want
you guys to understand it's gonna be
taking me some time to add just to that
cuz you know babies do have some
necessities you know things that need to
happen and they can be fussy too so that
happens too but anyways and i also for
those of you while I've been away
I did I was kind of following some
speaking names just cuz you know it's
kind of an addiction but anyways so when
I was away just for you guys who don't
know yet the GBO charge for was
announced I think it's about two weeks
ago when that happened so that speaker
make sure you subscribed and following
and all that just so because as soon as
it drops on to the market
I'm gonna be getting it and it will be
in the studio I'm really excited mainly
because they do have USB type-c on that
speaker the design doesn't seem to have
changed that much mama looks almost the
same like the same as the charge 3 but
nevertheless it's something like the
drivers I've been updated a little bit I
don't know but I'm really really excited
when I saw that when it was announced I
was not expecting it this year honestly
I was thinking about I was expecting it
to be something like maybe this is funny
um Bigsby heard me and he's trying to
types type stuff I don't know I did not
mention in a big spiel on anything but
it's strange whatever he's typing
understand smart smartest things that
was weird but anyway so yeah so I'm
really really excited for the JBL charge
for well we'll see how it really does
compared to the charge 3 and maybe the
XP 30 XP 31 whatever I'm really really
excited for that
um sony also did
announcer speaker that I'm interested in
and that's the one that has I think
Google assistant yeah it's a xB o or one
G something like that I don't remember
but so that's one I'm interested in it
looks kind of funny but I'm interested
in trying it out so I might get that
speaker to to the channel here thumbs up
if you want me to get that into the
studio and also the other one that I was
really excited about is the UE boom 3
and the mega boom the week and know you
did not miss out on the mega boom -
apparently they just decided to skip the
mega bull to name just so the mega boom
3 matches up with a boom 3 you know so
the naming is kind of like makes sense
because they come out at the same time
so yeah we do have those it looks like
they did move the judging ports to
better to a better place like to the
side instead of like down where you
couldn't charge it and the other thing
that I liked about it is that they
aren't able to connect with the older
speakers so you can connect the mega
boom 3 and the boom 3 to play together
with the boom - and to play together
with the boom like a boom boom - like
they can connect with those speakers the
older speakers in the same line so that
is really really awesome it's like that
it's not the same as JBL where they
introduced a new technology which is not
backward-compatible - like the other
speakers so that was really annoying but
I really I really really like what what
you has done here like allowing those
speakers to connect with the older
speakers even as far back as the boom
that's amazing but yeah that's really
really cool we will be getting all those
speakers excuse me we will be getting
all those speakers into the studio and
we will be trying them out as soon as
they come out I actually already have
but boom the the makeup on 3 and the
boom
already on an order so as soon as the
ship out get here we'll be taking a look
at that so if you're not subscribed make
sure you are subscribed so we can you
can be one among the first people to see
when those videos when the speakers get
here and the videos go live so yes this
has just been an update videos I do also
have other speakers that I haven't
mentioned here but I've been waiting to
do videos on because I've been taking
some time off and I do have all the
speakers coming in and I do have a lot
but and when I try to go through them as
quick as possible and you know cuz I it
like hurts my brain having all these
things I have to do right don't have
time to do it and just so many just
bothers me so I try to go through
speakers as quick as possible and then
level stopped out so we can get to the
newer stuff as quick as possible
anyways I'm sorry if I've been rumbling
a lot I didn't have a script or anything
for this video but if you're new here
please subscribe if you're not you
cannot you you a subscriber so you are
cool and that's awesome
and thank you for watching I will see
you in the next video
okay I will see you in the next video um
let me know if you have any questions
down below about anything about the new
speakers I've actually been seeing you
guys asking me about the new firmware
for for the extreme - I have not updated
my speaker like I said I've been kind of
blind try to stay away from work you
need to work as much as possible so I'm
gonna be looking into that and see if
there's anything different at all with a
new farmer i I'm not sure yet so but
I'll be trying that out and yeah okay I
think I'm done yeah this is my boy's
room
looks pretty sweet back there okay
thanks for watching I'll see you in the
next one Pete</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
