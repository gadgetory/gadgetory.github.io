and welcome to another sound battle well
that speakers speak for themselves so
sunny has what it goes wireless party
chain where you can connect up to 10
speakers and synchronize the music and
lights for a bigger sound but this is
only available with the newly released
speakers that's the XP 40 30 and 20 and
also a lot of you wanted to know if the
xp3 can connect with any of the speakers
I just mentioned above and the answer is
no I'm not sure son is working on fixing
this but as of right now the answer is a
big no you cannot connect xb3 to any of
the newly released speakers on the other
hand JBL has what it calls JBL connect
it's being replaced by JBL connect plus
but as of right now the only speaker out
as of making this video that has JBL
connect plus is the flip phone and it's
not backward compatible why do I have
only two speakers on JBL side you asked
the reason is with JBL connect you can
only connect two speakers and I choose
to shut three over the flip three
because the extreme already has
Twitter's which sound great so the just
we qualified to be here here is where it
gets crazy
on the JBL side the named speaker is the
extreme and both speakers are playing at
60 percent volume on the other side
however the main speaker is the xB 40 in
displaying a 60 percent volume the xB 30
and the xB 20 volumes are set at maximum
on the speaker which means since the xB
40 is receiving only 60 percent from the
phone the xB 30 and the
v20 are also playing at 60%
get it what I'm trying to say is
everything here is playing at 60% volume
I made sure that why 60% you asked well
setting up speakers like this means you
want a bigger sound experience so I
don't see someone setting up all these
speakers just listen to really really
low volumes but at the same time if you
have so many speakers that you set up
like this maybe you want to need the
maximum volume after all since there are
so many speakers so with all that
considered 60 percent was the sweet spot
I found plus based on the sony sucks at
maximum volume and it's almost too much
and really really low volume souls 60
seems to be kind of like in-between
I feel like I've been talking for ages
and I need a pause I'll be using a high
quality binaural microphone during this
recording so please use headphones for
the best experience
I'm gonna wait I've got comes in to st.
Lucia McCullough how did you make that
you have to win it let's just break it
down to you and me just go home and I
have to beat me and everyone see anger
is misplaced
pushing off my sneaker to the ground I
do not jump I move the earth down and
witness to the genius of my town born at
the bottom but now I'm not pal wholly
unlike when I'm fit call me Father
give it up the king I take liquid water
work one don't cry baby no side then
that sucks be smoke the bees defenses he
quite possibly the best of all time
he'll be doin what they say
and there you have it so what do you
guys think before I share my opinion
please be sure to subscribe if you're
new here so you don't miss out on the
upcoming videos so I was honestly
surprised by the outcome here sony
limits based way too much as volumes go
up but I didn't think that JBL would do
a better job at 60% volume in this kind
of setup but my surprise JBL is doing
better in the bass department now if
you've watched the sound barrel of XB
foley and the extreme you know that at
low volumes sony's bass is way better
than the extreme but they cut it way too
much as soon as you start raising the
volume over 50%
at 60% volume JBL is leading in the bass
Department the highs are pretty good on
DB outside of the set up compared to son
inside and this is because the extreme
has treaters while there's none of that
on sunny side they all have full range
drivers but I should say though that I
found the mix to be better on the Sony
setup and unlike JBL you can control the
volume of all speakers individually with
the Sun is set up which could work kind
of like an EQ if you look at it that way
so those are my opinions sound is so
subjective and I would like to hear what
you guys have to say about these two
setups which one would you prefer and
again don't forget to hit subscribe if
you haven't yet it really helps out a
lot if the fuel that keeps me pushing
pixels thanks for watching this one and
I will see you in the next one peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
