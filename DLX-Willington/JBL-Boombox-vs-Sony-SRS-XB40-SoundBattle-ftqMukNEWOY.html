welcome to another sound battle well we
let speakers speak for themselves in the
battlefield today we have the JBL
boombox going up against the sony srs xB
Foley now I know there's quite a size
and price difference between the two but
it's a video that you guys have
requested and I'm kind of curious how
this the Foley of XP 40 holds up to the
boombox so let's get it on as usual I'll
be using a high quality binaural
microphone to record this so for the
best experience please use headphones
with that said let's hear the speaker's
speak
let's just break it down
don't tell me
so if you've watched my video of the
boombox versus the JBL extreme you
should kind of tell or at least get a
feeling that the results are kind of
similar here to the boombox is louder as
expected considering its size and the
mids and highs and both speakers are
less than geared but I prefer the mates
on this Sony and I prefer the highs on
the boombox so it's kind of a draw there
but when it comes to the lows the
boombox is doing a better job here now
the xba-40 boosts its bass quite a bit
at low volumes I mean as volumes go down
the base goes down the bid the bass goes
up too so I wanted to see how the two
compare had extremely low volume so I
play them at 30% volume for you
and surprisingly the base on the Sony
does a good job keeping up with that of
the boombox at these extremely low
volumes the only thing that sucks with a
Sony at this volume is the crappy highs
you're not going to get any sort of
balanced music without using some sort
of EQ with any of these two because they
are both tuned bass heavy for fish
lovers but generally speaking I
personally do like what is coming out of
the boombox because of that better best
performance and loudness about you what
do you think let me know what you think
in a comment section below and if you
liked the video leave it away if you
didn't like it leave it a dislike I just
want to know what you think about the
video negative oh good
and if you're new here please subscribe
so you don't miss out on the new
upcoming videos thanks for watching this
one I love you all and I will see you in
the next one peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
