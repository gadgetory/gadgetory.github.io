welcome to another sound battle where
will it speakers speak for themselves in
the battlefield today we have the UE
boom - going up against the charge 3 as
requested by Abraham if you have a new
speakers that you would like to see them
battle here leave them in a comment
section below and when you do do not
forget to subscribe because that's the
only way that you will know when I
upload your requested video as usual the
speakers are 6 feet away from the sound
recorder and they are playing at 80
percent volume put your headphones on
and let's hear the speaker's speak
hold on oh damn it I've got something to
say I'm happy tune it down Feliz
you have to win me let's just break it
down to you with me uptown around me
just go Oh pops but I have to be me and
everyone can see anger is misplaced
don't tell me
you
you
so there you have it the boom - is a
touch louder and it's better at
representing highs and as you guys might
know I really will have the vocals that
come out of the boom - on the other hand
the child 3 is way better at Lowe's this
makes its music sound rich and for for
the kind of music I listen to the chugs
3 takes the lead it feels like JBL put
up down better at the highs and youi
could have done better at the lows but
overall I like the sound I get from the
charge 3 what do you think and by the
way Herrmann the company where JBL comes
from is being acquired by Samsung and
this kind of excites me just to see what
might change if anything happens at all
as far as JBL bluetooth speakers leave
me a comment down below like the video
if you liked it don't forget to
subscribe if you're not a subscriber yet
thanks for watching and I will see you
in the next one peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
