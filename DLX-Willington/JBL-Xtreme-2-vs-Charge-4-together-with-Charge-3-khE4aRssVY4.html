women here and welcome to another sound
battle where we let speakers speak for
themselves today in the battlefield we
do have the GBO extreme to going up
against the charge three in the charge
for playing together and we're trying to
see if you own the charge three in the
judge for if you basically have the same
sound as someone who has the JBL accent
or even better I don't know and we're
trying to find out um as usual I will be
using a high quality binaural microphone
so for the best experience please use
headphones and with that said well let's
hear the speakers speak
in town and everyone
don't tell me
stop alone
and there you have it so yes if you only
the judge three in the charge for here
are the advantages you have over someone
who has the extreme to loudness just
because they are two speakers you can
pray you can place them down sideways
like this there will be more room
filling than just the extent to which is
only facing one directional and all that
so the other advantage is just that the
way I told you that you can place the
speaker's sideways so they can give you
almost 360 sound experience and also
highs and mids are better with the two
speakers um the only thing that I see
that the extreme two is performing
better is the best performance out of
the extreme two is better than that
coming out of the two the judge three
and they charge for but yeah the only
thing you won't be able to deal with the
2x2 the two speakers is they cannot play
in stereo mode so left right Channel
no they have to play in party mode and
yeah that's the only downfall to that
just because they are two different
models of speakers they usually don't
make them play into your mode let me
know what you think in the comment
section below thank you for watching
this I'll leave the links to all these
speakers in the comment section below

little bit but if you like the video
