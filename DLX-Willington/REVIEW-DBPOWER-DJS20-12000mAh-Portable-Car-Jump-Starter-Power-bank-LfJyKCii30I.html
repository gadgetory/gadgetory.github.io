review of the DB power portable car jump
starter this is the DJ as 20 model and
right off the bat I should say that this
is one of those things that I feel like
every vehicle owner should have in their
emergency kit in their car it trust me
at some point you will be grateful you
have it now the unboxing experience of
this product is a full-on experience as
it comes nicely packaged in a box that's
easy to open and out of the box is a
nice hard carrying case big enough to
hold all the provided accessories and
speaking of that DB power gives you all
the accessories you need to use all the
features of this thing and that includes
a car charger an AC power adapter a
micro USB cable different user manuals
in different languages including English
smart jumpstart Eclipse a universal
laptop charging cord with eight
different heads my first impression of
this unit was how small and compact it
is I honestly expected something a
little bit bigger than this I go into
the pictures on Amazon but I was
surprised and at the same time it looks
and feels really solid and did I mention
it looks really awesome just look at it
just like a tough guy ready to rescue
someone mmm
anyway so did big power claims this
should charge your laptop your phone and
jumpstart your car I was able to test
all of these and these were my results
starting with a jump starter using my
old 2005 town &amp;amp; country van I
disconnected the red clamp from the
battery and connected the jump starter
just to see if it will start the van and
this is what he did
I was impressed by this small unit small
as it looks he was able to jumpstart my
van awesome right I also tested with a
fun and it worked on to judging the
laptop this is where I got some problems
I was not able to charge my laptop even
after doing whatever the menu was
telling me to do in order to use that
port it couldn't work so at some point I
thought maybe is the power because it
shows us giving up the 12 output but
either way there is no way to change it
I looked in the menu and they don't say
anything about changing the voltage that
port puts out so laptop charging did not
work for me DV power that's something
that you might wanna look into but
anyways this is honestly a good unit I
don't think I would throw you away just
because it's not judging my laptop I
can't even think of when I actually
really need to charge my laptop using
this but I just thought how to throw it
out there for you guys if that's
something you're looking forward to so
other than that I couldn't really find
anything else bad about this unit the
flashlight works it's really bright the
emergency light works although you might
want to check with where you live about
the legality of having red and blue
flashing on your car so make sure you
check on that before you actually use it
but it works ok so um thank you very
