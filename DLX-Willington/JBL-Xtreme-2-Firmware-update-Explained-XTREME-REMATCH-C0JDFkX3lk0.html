welcome to this video now a lot of you
have been asking me about what I think
about the new firmware on the GPL
extreme - generally I think that's a
good thing because usually when someone
sent somewhere the aid of fixing
something or making it better
so yeah it's still really a good thing
I've been wanting to do this video ever
since I saw the firmware update but I
didn't want to update it if I don't have
time to be able to record some things
and do some comparisons here and there
so today is a day we're going to be
taking a closer look and analyze on the
new firmware in comparison to the old
firmware on our new charge I mean I wish
there was a new choice 3 but to do to
our new grbl extreme - now I'm going to
be using DC mode and AC mode a lot in
this video so for those of you who don't
know what that means when I say DC mode
I'm basically meaning that the speaker
is playing off of its battery so nothing
it's not getting any current it's not
being charged while it's playing ok but
when I say AC mode I basically mean the
speaker is plugged in and it's getting
power to it so it's charging while
playing that is the AC mode DC mode you
might see a cord still attached to it
during my test but it doesn't mean that
it's actually being charged I'm gonna be
turning off the switch down to to the
cord that brings it power because during
this test the speaker has to stay in the
same place as I do all the recordings so
I don't want to plug it in and unplug it
stuff like that cuz that might move the
speaker a little bit which will
interfere with the measurements that I'm
trying to take and the sound that we try
to record and so it's not getting power
even though you might see the chord it's
that clear okay so as the reminder
here is our first test we're going to
remind ourselves the difference between
the AC mode and DC mode on the old
firmware
okay so there's been the old firmware
without any updates hit just reminding
us of what the difference was with the
old family there's about four DB
difference in sound loudness between the
two modes on the old firmware it's a
huge huge gap and that's why people were
freaking out including me about why JBL
decided to go that route okay so now
that we remember that how did the
extreme to compare to the JBL extreme
before this firmware update so we're
going to be taking a Wilson again to the
extreme to versus the JBL extreme before
the firmware update only JBL extreme to
take a listen
and you get the point the extreme is
louder than the JBL extreme to both
speakers running in DC mode on the old
firmware okay so we got that now how
about we go ahead and do the update to
the JBL extreme - and see what the
difference will be now if you've never
done an update on your speaker when you
open the JBL up it will usually show you
a little little something that would
basically show you that there's an
update that you need to be doing to your
speaker basically all you have to do is
make sure it's plugged in you stop dated
and that's it it's pretty easy to do an
update on JBL speakers um just make sure
you don't close the app like it says
only up right there so well after we do
that I have not moved the speaker at all
I did not move the speaker I did not
touch anything at all and I went ahead
and did some more recordings now with a
new firmware let's find out what the
difference is between the AC mode and DC
mode on the GFDL extreme to LC versus DC
with the new firmware take a listen
okay and that sounds like good news
because we now have two DB difference
between the AC mode and DC mode so yeah
it looks like it's an improvement it's
not all the way as loud as the AC mode
but it's a little bit better a little
bit louder than when it was we on the
old phone we're actually how about we go
ahead and compare the old firmware
playing in DC mode against the new
firmware playing in DC mode and see how
much of an improvement is there between
the two modes old firmware versus new
firmware speakers when the speaker is
playing in DC mode both times let's
check that out
and that sounds about right
and the new firmware is about 2 DVS
louder than the old firmware in deceived
mode so yes there is an improvement and
actually really really happy that JBL
listened now we're going to be looking
and comparing the JBL extreme extreme to
to the JBL extreme so we're going to be
comparing the extreme to to the JBL
extreme this one is running the new
firmware and this one well it's old and
it's running it's old thing so but yeah
we're going to be comparing the two new
firmware against the JBL extreme again
cuz you really did that video but this
was this was running the old firmware so
it's not going to be like a really
really long sample I'm going to be using
basically the same songs because I did
not record a ton this was a lot of
recording involved but we're going to be
at least getting a small sample of the
extreme tube against extreme to running
second the new firmware oh my gosh I
can't speak sometimes I mean it's a lot
of words I'm trying to throw out here
but yes how about we go into it I think
you get what I mean take a listen
I know it's not as many songs as I
usually do but that's because of what
I'm trying to do I did not have to move
the speaker and I could I want recorded
a few songs as it took me forever doing
all this recording but anyways from the
few samples that you've heard what what
do you think according to my DB meter
which I did not move ever since I
started recording before we found where
and after the fun where I did not move
the DB meter I did not move the
microphone I did not move the speaker
everything was stationary throughout the
recording that's why I was waiting for a
day when I have ample time on my hands
to not move anything as I do this video
and that's what happened but according
to my DB meter with the new firmware the
speaker only gives about 2 DB louder
than old firmware so in comparison to
the GBO extreme to which I'm also
mentioned in the same exact spot in my
update the JBL extreme 2 is still not as
loud as the GFDL extreme now do not get
me wrong I'm not saying that the update
is not a good a knife or anything like
that because I do believe it is good and
the speaker is improved definitely
improved I mean has a little bit of
bitter best performance not like a ton
like not so so noticeable but it is a
little bit better um the highs have been
also tamed a little bit so it sounds
better than the JBL extreme the old guy
but as far as loudness as far as
loudness between these two speakers they
extreme is still a louder speaker it's
not huge I'm very very happy that JBL
went ahead and sent out a firmware
update that quick like that was quick I
mean we've been complaining and hoping
that they would send out a firmware but
I didn't think it was gonna be like this
quick because they usually would take
forever you know we have to work it out
with our engineers blah blah blah and
that but this was relatively quick I
don't think they just noticed that yeah
this is pretty bad
and one thing I also noticed I don't
know before before we did not really
talk about this because the difference
is not that very big but with the JBL
extreme there is also a sound difference
between the two modes when you're in NC
mode versus DC mode but this difference
was so settled that you know nobody
complained about it it just makes a
little bit of sense that way the
difference from measuring it I had about
one DB difference between the AC and DC
mode well as with the old fun well on
the JBL extreme two was four DB
difference that is going to be so
noticeable and people were really really
mad about it including me so the extreme
also does the same thing it's just it's
just a little bit too subtle to be
noticed as it was as it was noticeable
with the old firmware on the JBL extreme
- now I still would have hoped for the
speaker to be a little bit louder than
that I think my main thing maybe is at
least for the speaker to be as loud as
the GBO extreme or a little bit louder
because it is bigger you know what I
mean so I was hoping like when I got the
Speaker of the
first time I was hoping for it to be
louder than the old extreme that's not
the case it's still not the case at
least in my case it's not still the case
with the new firmware but it is better I
want to make sure you guys are
understanding that it's better the new
firmware it is better but it still does
not make the speaker louder than the
charge I mean they keep saying charge
you still not as loud as the old extreme
in my case but generally I do like the
new firmware it sounds better and it
gets louder than the old firmware which
is something I'm really really thankful
for I still wouldn't take the church I
mean the extreme over the extreme - I
think they assume - is - a better
speaker it's new work it's waterproof
its really really good sounding compared
to the old speaker most especially at
maximum volume
it sounds a lot nicer then when you
compare it to the old speaker playing at
maximum volume - that's all I have to
say about this new firmware I don't know
how long this video is gonna be I feel
like I've rambled a lot and I'm sorry
for that but I feel like I had to say so
many things that he ended up going and
going and going and going so yeah I'm
sorry
but anyways I put the links to this vide
- these speakers if you wanna go check
it out if you've been holding off but I
think I'm down the video thanks for
watching I will see you in the next one
awfully really soon
is it so probably thanks for watching
