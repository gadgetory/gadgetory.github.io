Willington here and welcome to another
sound battles where we'll live speakers
speak for themselves in a better field
that we have the fugu tuff versus the
GBL charge 3 as requested
and if there's a speaker that you'd like
to see battle here leave them in a
comment section below and when you do
don't forget to subscribe because that's
the only way that you'll know when I
upload your requested videos back to
this battle
the speakers are 5 feet away from a high
quality binaural microphone and they are
playing that 80% volume I repeat the
full girl will be playing at 80% volume
and the check we will be playing at 80%
volume you'll find out sometimes say
that 2 times for the best experience
please put your headphones on and let's
hear the speaker's speak
I've got some business a boutonniere so
you have to with me
okay so if you play the fugu at 80%
volume it sounds like the child read at
45% of volume the fugu is still quiet
compared to the charge three and
actually the flip three is louder than
the fugu but you know that's not sound
quality that we're looking for if we
focus on sound quality the fugu is
actually well balanced than the charge
three if you lower the volume of the
check three until it's as loud as the
fugu you will hear what I'm talking
about let's take a listen
ha
the sound of the Pogo is brighter and
more open than that of the charged wheel
if you could tell the only disappointing
thing about the fugu is just how quiet
it is like we are talking it I can
compare its loudness to that of the GPL
go like I'm not even kidding but again
if we only consider sound quality which
one is more balanced I would go with the
fugu but in reality unless I really
really need the ruggedness of the fugu I
would go with a charge 3 I'm just
because I like how loud it gets anyways
let me know what you think down below
like the video if you liked it drop me a
comment down below and don't forget to
subscribe if you're new here thanks for
watching I will see you in the next one
peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
