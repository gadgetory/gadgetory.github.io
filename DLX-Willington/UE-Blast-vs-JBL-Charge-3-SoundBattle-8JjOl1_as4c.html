welcome to another sound battle where we
let speakers speak for themselves in the
battlefield today we have the newly
released Yui blasts going up against the
old guy the charge three I'll be using a
high quality binaural microphone so for
the best experience
please use headphones with that said
grab some popcorn sit back relax and I
will see you on the other side I'm so
funny
you have to win
I gotta know about this day it seems to
me that everything has gone so fast
it feels like I've made like oh please
come away I will
I think it's time to get out of my
everyday
okay so if you are looking for the
loudest of the two the judge three
barely takes the lead here with the
speaker's about five feet away from the
DB meter I was able to get a max DB read
of 92 on the blast and 94 on the charge
three but because they blasted 360 sound
experience it's going to be more room
filling than the judge 3 which is only
directional and as expected the best
performance of the charge 3 is better
than that of the blast the judge 3 goes
deeper well as what you get on the blast
is only a purpose but as we all know by
now that you is focus is on the mids and
highs and honestly they do a pretty good
job with the mids and highs well as JBL
tends to ignore the mids but me
personally I prefer the sound from the
charge 3 just because it's more of a
fuller package than the blast and if you
listen mainly to podcasts or movies or
you listen with the intent of clear
lyrics and Alexa means quite a lot to
you the blast might be your best choice
here anyways for this battle the win
goes to the charge 3 although you don't
get Alexa wear that it's a lot cheaper
it has an aux input and a charging port
so what do you think let me know what
you have to say about the two in the
comment section below if you're new here
please don't forget to subscribe so you
don't miss out on the upcoming videos I
wish you guys a terrific new year thanks
for watching this one I will catch you
in the next one peace yeah it's done the
video is done I mean it bye
really there's nothing more I'm out here</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
