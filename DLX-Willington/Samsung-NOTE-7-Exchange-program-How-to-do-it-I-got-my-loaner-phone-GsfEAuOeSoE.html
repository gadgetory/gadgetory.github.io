with another video now if you are like
me and you already own a galaxy note 7
that you pre-ordered or went to the
store as soon as they came out and then
here is funds exploding and stuff like
that you are probably confused about
what to do like I ones there is not a
lot of good information out there about
the process of how to do the exchange or
to get something to use as you wait for
the new phones to come out so I was able
to go and exchange out my phone at a
verizon store this is the galaxy s7 edge
that i'm using right now as i wait for
the new node 7s to come to stock in the
verizon store so i can still get the no7
that the purpose of this video is
basically just to to tell you guys how i
went about getting the exchange done at
the verizon store just so you guys have
an idea of what to do and where to go
and stuff like that just kind of a help
our kind of videos so i hope you guys I
hope it's helpful to someone out there
okay so i went to the verizon store
after getting the an email from samsung
the day before telling me how I should
shut down my phone and have it exchanged
but in the email they also have a link
to this site here that I'll probably put
on the screen too and now put the link
to this in the description section below
you guys can read it about the process
how it should be to exchange out for a
new phone I'm so anyways when I went to
the store the guy was a nice guy that I
was talking to but he had no idea of
what was going on about the phones for
the exchange program so it was nice that
I had to link to the samsung website
that was talking about this that's why
I'm going to put it down below to help
you guys if you don't have it if you
didn't sign up
all on the same side account and you're
not receiving these things but anyways
when I showed him that he went through
it and it he went to the store's manager
at the verizon store and they talked
about it to a couple of minutes or so
and then he comes back out and well he
told me he understands what I'm talking
about now and that the process that they
are having right now is you get a new
phone like whichever phone you want to
choose to use if you if that's if you're
keeping your note 7 if you still want to
note 7 so they give you a different
phone to use as you wait for the new
better phones with a replaced batteries
to come out into stock and then that's
when you will return the phone that
you're given to use whichever one you
choose i have the s7 edge and then the
price they'll swap you back to the note
7 but here's what's interesting your
payments are not going to be the same
you are basically going to buy by the
galaxy s seven if that's what you choose
or whichever phone issues and then you
get back the money the amount that you
paid for the taxes in the amount
basically all the difference between
these two phones price-wise you get back
and then when you go back two up to get
back to the note 7 I don't know if you
guys are following if you go back to get
the note 7 you are basically buying that
phone again so the money that you get
you got back in order to get the phone
that you're using right now as you wait
you're going to have to pay that money
back to them and then you will receive
the note 7 that's how I understood it
that's how they explained it so in this
video what I'm basically saying is that
you will need if the store that you go
to has no idea you will need this
information here that's what I used I
show them that they were able to figure
out and they
gave me a new phone to use so it is
possible you can go to the verizon store
and you can get a different phone to use
as we wait for the new node sevens to
come out so we can have our precious
phones back so this video is basically
just telling you that go to the verizon
store show them that the email if you
have an email or if you have the galaxy
the Samsung website what is saying
telling us to do now the only thing that
this site says here that I didn't I
forgot to ask about it did not get is on
the side here it says we know this
exchange is an inconvenience so you will
also receive a $25 gift card in store
credit or dual credit from select career
retail outlets when participating in the
u.s. not save an exchange program now I
honestly forgot about that part so I did
not ask them about it but I didn't get
any gift cards or any in store credit or
bill credit so i don't know that's
something you guys should ask about and
if you already did that and you talked
to them about it feel free to leave your
comments down below and tell me what you
did or how the exchange program went for
you and if you have any more information
to help out other people who are going
through the same struggle feel free to
leave your comments down below and
people have questions and if you have a
question again leave your comments down
below i'll be reading this video's
comments all day long whenever I get a
comment and if I have any answers for
your questions I will answer it if I
don't other people's you can also read
through the comments and let's make this
as easy for other people as possible
let's be helpful to the no7 community
that you know we're having these
problems so i hope this video was
helpful and it gives you an idea of what
to do and how to go about exchanging and
you're not seven and avoid the risk of
having explode or causing trouble to you
and have something else to use as you
wait
the new approved not sevens to come out
so like the video if you don't like it
you can dislike it if you have a
questions again you post them down below
and I can answer them as much as I can
if this anything I didn't cover that you
feel like I should have and subscribe to
my channel and I'll see you in the next
video stay safe and peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
