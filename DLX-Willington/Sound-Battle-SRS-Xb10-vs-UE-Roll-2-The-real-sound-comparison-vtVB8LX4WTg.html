and welcome to another sound battle
well that speakers speak for themselves
in the battlefield today we have the SB
10 versus the UE roll to the speaker's
will be playing at 60 and 100 percent
volume I'll be using a high quality
binaural microphone so please use
headphones for the best experience with
that said put your headphones on and
let's hear the speaker's speak
hold on girl now ways to learn God and
especially right now I'm happy to make
now you have to admit down another round
miss dokgo I have to bring these and
every one finger in this place
I'm just
Oh
and
and there you have it just like with a
clip to battle the XP tent does better
with the lower frequencies here too if
your decision is determined by which one
has better best performance the XV 10 is
your guy here but like I said before
that best distorts pretty easily most
especially at maximum volume the highs
and mids are again better on the road
too and the overall sound quality is
also better same thing here if your best
lever but not in the market for a bigger
speaker and don't mind losing some highs
and mids the xB 10 is great if you keep
the volume under 70% but if you're the
kind looking for an overall cleaner
sound and don't mind having minimum bass
in your music you can't go wrong with
the roll - which one is louder you ask
if that's your deciding point you have
it quite easy and the road 2 is
definitely louder than the XP 10 so
there you have it being a heavy best
listener it's kind of a toss-up between
these two but if I had to choose one I
would take the Yui ro 2 but again that's
just me and sound is so subjective I
would like to hear what you have to say
about these two in the comment section
below don't forget to subscribe if
you're new here love you all and I will
see you in the next one peace
and one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
