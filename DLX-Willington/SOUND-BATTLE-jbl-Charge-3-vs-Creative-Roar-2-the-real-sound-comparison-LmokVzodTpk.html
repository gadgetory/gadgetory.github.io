another sound battle in the battlefield
today we have the charge three going up
against the roar - I've had a couple
people request the roar - and yes I
finally have my hands on one I hope you
enjoyed this video as you wait for the
full review that will be coming pretty
soon okay so the roar - has an inbuilt
equalizer with three sound settings but
for the sound comparison I recorded the
speaker in the tera bass or bass boost
mode because that's what's comparable to
the charge 3 I have the speaker's set 6
feet away from the audio recorder and
they will both be playing at 98% loud
basically one notch down on a volume
rocker without said put your headphones
on and let the battle begin
No
oh no no way Joslyn I've got something
to say oh I'm happy to make time
fearless if you have to win me let's
just break it down to you and me uptown
dancing on the round all ops but I have
to be me everyone see anger is this
place
and I you know
Oh
Oh
are you listening
he's a good friend
the second there
I know it's never gonna
just be a good friend
these two guys are definitely right
there on each other's back
I'm the chat we handled the lows a
little bit better but the raw two
handles the highs a little bit better if
you were to ask me which one I would
take out set it right we but that's
because I am a bass driven kind of guy
but the raw two is not too far from the
jug three and the fact that it has
different sound settings it's going to
accommodate a lot of people's sound
preferences it has a ton of features
which the charge to it is not but it's
not waterproof which the charge three is
so that so many things that these guys
are you know running up against each
other anyways I get my part and I would
love to hear from you guys which of the
two speakers do you prefer
leave me a comment down below if you're
not a subscriber a subscriber I invite
you to join us and support me by
subscribing I would really appreciate
that and don't forget to suggest which
speakers you'd love to see them battle
here and I will see you in the next
video peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
