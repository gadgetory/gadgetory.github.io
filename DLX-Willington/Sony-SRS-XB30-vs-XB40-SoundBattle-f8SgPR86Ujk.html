Willington here and welcome to another
sound battle
well that speakers speak for themselves
in the battlefield today we have the
sony SRS XP 30 buses the xB Foley for
those of you who have been wondering how
it is to compare next to each other this
video is for you in this battle the
speakers will be playing a 70% volume
the first song I will have the extra
bass off but the rest of the songs I
will have it on I'll be using a high
quality binaural microphone so please
put your headphones on for the best
experience
let's hear the speaker's speak hold on
girl now wait a minute I've got
something to say oh happy to make time
oh you see there you have two with me oh
let's just break it down and you and me
uptown another round till the disco ball
but I have to be
everyone should be anger element please
donate
so as you might have guessed beforehand
and the XP Foley is louder than the XP
30 the XP 40 also has better best
performance and I'm pretty sure this is
due to the bigger drivers it has the
best is not necessarily deeper though it
just comes out louder and a little bit
more powerful than it does on the XP 30
but its loudness in best performance and
not what you're looking for the XP 30
might be what you want it has an overall
better sound in my opinion both mids and
highs are a little bit weak on XP 40
while the XP 30 might not be perfect
it sounds cleaner and brighter with
better mids and highs the only reason
out Gold X before II is mainly loudness
and a little bit of better best
performance other than that this big 30
sounds better but that's just me and
sound is so subjective I would like to
hear what you guys have to say about
this too in the comment section below
don't forget to subscribe if you haven't

watching this one and I will see you in
the next one peace
