introducing the sony SRS XP 41 of the
new speakers the sony just released and
mind you we're going to be unpacking all
those speakers here in the next set of
videos so make sure you subscribe so you
don't miss out on those videos when they
go live
alright so out of the box you don't get
really a ton of stuff you just get your
speaker a wall adapter which looks the
same as the sony the one that comes with
a sony SRX xp3 and some paperwork stuff
and that's it
the structure design of the speaker will
look familiar to you if you've seen or
owned to the xp3 with slight changes at
the grill for reasons I'll be talking
about shortly it features two full range
six to one millimeter drivers and APR in
the center which according to Sony
they're able to give you a frequency
response that goes as low as 20 Hertz
it features NFC for is occurring but
bluetooth is getting so better every day
I feel like this is becoming more of a
marketing feature on these speakers and
speaking of Bluetooth it's rocking
bluetooth 4.2 and you will get a range
of 10 meters or 32 feet before any
interruptions and collapsing audio Sony
promises about 24 hours of playtime on a
single charge but I'm pretty sure this
is if you're listening at about half the
volume I'll come back with my findings
on that in the upcoming videos the
speaker has an IP X 5 rating which means
it can take a splash at a pool but do
not submerge it it it's not to be
submerged in water they changed the
layout of the buttons on top here if you
compare it to the XP 3 which I
personally think it looks better all
these buttons on here are pretty
self-explanatory the only ones that
might be new to some people at the add
button which is used for adding more
speakers to play in sync and those two
LED lights above it are to help guide in
doing so and also using the play button
you
play pause skip to the next stroke with
a double tap and with a triple tap you
can go back to the previous track the
other button that might be new to some
people is the extra base button this
will boost the lower frequencies for a
more boosted bass sound experience but
the same button will also turn on off
the right which lets you ask well JBL
has been leading their light up speaker
kind of stuff with their pals line of
speakers and Sony now once in the XD
Foley has been advertised as a party
speaker and that's because of these LED
lights you have so control of the light
that wrap around the grill using the
Fiesta app which works in conjunction
with Sony Music Center / song pal app by
this I mean you have to get the Sony
Music Center app first and once you're
in that app you'll have the choice to
download the Fiesta Bowl app and that's
where the magic happens
you can set the lights to go with the
music you're playing or just customize
them however you like it and whatever
colors you want and I gotta say that app
is really responsive interactive and
well designed I wish - Bo could learn
something here because their app really
sucks anyways I like the fact that I can
turn those lights off if I don't want
them because I'm pretty sure you're
using some juice using those lights so
your battery will not last as long as
when you don't have them on behind the
speaker hiding under this flap you'll
find a USB DC outlet for charging a
power-hungry device a 9.5 volt DC in
Jack for recharging your speaker a reset
button and lastly an audio jack I'll
play some sound samples for you guys
here but before that let me know what
speakers you'd like to see battle
against this speaker in the sound battle
video series in this sample the speaker
will be playing a 70 percent volume take
a lesson
and
Oh hold on go now wait a minute
I've got don't dare to say you shave it
oh I'm happy to make now
oh yeah you have to picnic oh let's just
break it down do you let me look down
and all around
hilda disco ball that I have to be me
never would see anger is misplaced
don't hurt me
we planned
Oh
okay so I'm not a big fan of the extra
base on the sony SRS xp3 but I feel like
they improved it here but this feature
is mainly for best heavier listeners
because it tends to drown the mids and
highs with this boosted bass for bass
levels pretty sure they should be okay
but for people looking for cleaner
balanced music you are going to sleep
with a plane mode it's more balanced and
brighter and you can still hear the best
pretty well the speaker gets pretty loud
it's definitely up there with a JBL
extreme the I roar the mega boom and
speakers that fall in that category
we'll have to see how it stacks up those
speakers so if you're not subscribed
make sure you do so you don't miss out
on those videos when they go live all in
all I think the speaker is mainly
balanced for enhanced best listening and
if you're the kind who does not like
boosted bass and that's not listen to
bass heavy music this is probably not
for you but that's just my opinion and I
know sound is so subjective I would like
to hear what you guys have to say about
the all-new XP 40 will you get it just
because of all these new lights or you
don't even care about the light I'd like
to hear what you think about the lights
so drop me a comment down below don't
forget to subscribe if you haven't yet
and don't forget to suggest a speaker
that you'd like to see go up against the
xba-40 thanks for watching this one I
will see you the next one peace
