video I'm going to show you how to use
the all-night universal battery charger
after unpackaging the charger and you
are ready for your first use please take
a look at your battery that you are
going to be charging there should be two
contacts that are marked positive and
negative as you can see here in this
example after finding out which is which
and where they are located place your
battery into the charger pushing down
the spring-loaded bottom piece of the
charger to accommodate the size of your
battery once the battery is in place I'd
adjust the charger prongs to match the
positive and negative contacts of the
battery please note that as the positive
and negative are automatically
recognized by the charger it doesn't
matter which prong connects the negative
or the positive so after the prongs of
the charger and the contacts of the
battery are lined up push your battery
in further so there is contact between
the prongs and the contacts the light on
the charger should turn on to blue which
means your battery is connected and
ready to be charged finally plug the
charger into a power outlet the light
should turn to a pink purple color which
indicates that the battery is charging
when the light turns to blue again that
indicates the battery is fully charged
please note the on eight universal
charger is suitable only for batteries
with terminals on the top or bottom it's
not suitable for batteries with
terminals on the front or back thanks
