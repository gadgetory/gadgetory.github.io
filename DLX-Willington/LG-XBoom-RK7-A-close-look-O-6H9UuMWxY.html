today we are taking a close look at the
LG X boom arc and seven I've had it for
about two months or something like that
and this is everything you need to know
about it okay so in the box you'll find
the power cord and remote in its
batteries and antenna the paperwork
stuff and lastly the speaker itself and
looking at the speaker it reminds me a
lot of the smaller portable guys most
especially their PK 5 and the PK 7 and I
feel like the mainly difference is just
the size and maybe this control panel
right here if you place the speaker
vertical it will play in mono but if you
place it vertical like it is right here
it will play in history or mode but if
you want to place it vertical but also
have it's to play in stereo you can just
press the play pause button on top there
and it will go back to studio the
speaker has its handles up here for easy
lifting and just above that is the
control panel right here and on here is
where you will find your power button
the door and multi-link button is for
connecting more speakers to it um your
volume rockers the function button for
selecting the input source the media
control buttons the auto DJ button which
will basically play this next song
before the current one is complete just
so there's no silence in between songs
and sound effects is for choosing which
sounds preset you want to listen to user
eq is kind of self-explanatory and just
below that is the light button for
turning off the lights changing to
different light effects that you prefer
to see right at the front there but
that's not all the speaker can do
remember we also have a remote that came
with it and as you can see there's quite
a few functions or
here but I'm going to just point out a
few things I actually found interesting
or I actually enjoyed using first is the
karaoke function now the speaker has a
mic input so it can be used as a PA
system but it can also be used as a
karaoke machine which is something I'm
starting to love about LG as I explore
their speakers but maybe the best part
of the karaoke function is the ability
to remove vocals out of any song and
turn it into a curio Keys soundtrack
that you can sing over this only works
when you're playing over a Bluetooth or
USB but it's really cool what it does is
it suppresses the vocal frequencies of
the song living behind instruments and
some backup vocals
now just because of the way it works it
also is also better in some songs and
not as good in other songs but overall I
do like the feature and I've used it
more than once with some of my friends
also the key changer here is pretty cool
I'm if the song you're trying to sing to
has a higher key for you or low key for
you you can either make it higher or
lower so there's no excuse for not
singing to any song you really want they
also included built-in sound enhancing
voice filters which are also pretty fun
to play with the only downside here is
that it doesn't come with a microphone
which would have been a nice touch so
everybody would enjoy it but there is no
reason to not have karaoke parties at
your house the other feature I've been
using quite a bit is the LG sound sync
and what that is is if you have an LG TV
you can connect them wirelessly so the
sound that's coming out of the TV will
play from here but there is no lag
between the video and the speaker like
most and bluetooth speakers are and
that's pretty amazing but the best part
is the remote of the TV can increase the
volume and decrease the volume of this
speaker
also when you turn off the TV the
speaker turns off and when you turn the
tv back on the speaker also turns back
on so that's some pretty amazing
synchronization right there
and yeah I've been using that quite a
bit I've actually used a speaker for the
past month I've been using it connected
to my TV so that's pretty amazing and I
don't remember if I already mentioned
that but the speaker does not 100%
depend on just bluetooth I'm back here
if you have a USB stick you can play
music off of your USB stick and they
have an optical in back here which is
mostly found on TVs so it has that input
back there and it also has an aux in
back here and an aux out in case you
have a different speaker that you want
to you know get from here tap from here
to another speaker they also have backed
that back here but also if all of that
fails you can connect the antenna in Jam
to your favorite radio station and
speaking of jamming how does it sound
like well how about I give you a sound
sample and for those of you who are new
here I will be using a high quality
binaural microphone to record this so
for the best experience please use
headphones with that said let's hear the
speaker speak
all right there you have it okay so as
you might have noticed I dropped in the
XP 60 every now and then and that's just
so you guys have something that you are
kind of familiar with to compare the
sound of the X boom erich87 to so and I
know it's not as big as this but it's
the only thing that I had with me right
now that is comparable in size to this
guy here and also while it was playing
it was plugged in so it was on its
maximum power output anyway stay rk7
is generally a nice sounding speaker
it's got a nice amount of best some good
meds but the highs are the only area
where I found them to be a little bit
teeny not like not quite rich enough for
me I mean if you compare it their highs
to that of the XP 60 this is still way
better but they're not quite in that
suit spot for me they still lack a
little bit but since they give you the
option of the user EQ right here I would
go into that and go to the treble and
dial that up a little bit and that
should give you an even better sounding
X boom erich87 the speaker also does get
pretty loud with it playing at maximum
volume with my DB meter about 4 feet
away from it I was able to get 110 point
5 decibels and compare that to 105 point
3 that I got with their XP 60 in the
same spot also playing at maximum volume
so it does get quite a bit loud and I
don't think anybody who is going to
using this in a normal room in a house
he's gonna want it to go all the way to
maximum volume I I mean I guess if I
could but it get it gets pretty loud
okay so while I do love the speaker
there's only one thing that I kind of
found inconvenient from the way the
speaker was designed and the way it
looks I feel like it should be a
portable speaker with all the other
manufacturers like JBL and Sony making
even bigger speakers that are actually
very powered I feel like LG needs to
give us something of some sort now this
is a high-power
speaker so it does sound good and it's
probably because it's getting power
right out of the wall and it doesn't
have to compensate for battery and we
know that's how long it will last know
that and back I that's good that's good
but I feel like and I really hope that
LG is working on something that is in
this category like something bu-but
battery-powered because I feel like
everybody nowadays is going you know
berry powered because people like to go
outside and party but yeah I do love the
speaker I do like all the features that
they offer in this thing
I couldn't cover all of them because
this video is kind of getting belong and
also actually I did not talk about
lighting but LG is doing a very very
interesting and good job with lights
way better than Sony I can easily say
that their lights when you're playing
music they actually come to the beat
like you don't like with Sony I usually
turn off their lights just because the
beat drops but it's like not synced
right with these guys I can leave it on
and it's actually on the beat like that
doing something really good with the
lighting like as far as you know
dropping by the beat it's really really
good I really do
appreciate that about them and that's
basically on all their speakers even the
smaller guys that pique by that pk7 and
other bigger speakers that I have from
them they do really good with lights I
just wanted to mention that so this is
an easy easy speakers recommend to
someone who is working for a party
speaker kind of sucks that you can't
take it outside
but if you're running inside which most
people do it's a good speaker you can
pick up two of them link them up if you
want a bigger sound anyways the video is
getting a little bit too long I want to
say thank you to LG for sending out this
review unit and I want to say thank you
to he'll who is watching this for
watching my videos and supporting my
channel I'm if you liked the video leave
your like if you do you like it
leave a dislike I just want to get some
sort of feedback from you because you
watch the video
can you hear subscribe why not I'll
leave the links to the speaker down
there if you want to know more details
about it I'll leave the link down there
but yeah thanks for watching I will see
you in the next video peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
