welcome to this video today we're going
to be taking a close look at sony's XB
950 and one headphones we will be
checking out all its features we'll be
doing a sound or noise cancellation test
and I will also let you listen to it so
you can kind of get a feel of how they
sound like so you can kind of make an
informed decision in case you're
planning on picking up this for that and
more stay tuned so these are over ear
headphones they come with a storage
pouch and micro USB cord and audio cable
and the paperwork stuff they are mostly
plastic with a metal headband for added
durability and flexibility and they
future a foldable design for portability
the design of the headphones is not bad
depending on who you ask but they are
definitely on the bulky side depending
on how often you rest your headphones
around your neck this might be an
uncomfortable experience but over your
ears over your head they are pretty
comfortable I would say more comfortable
than sin Isis 450s the ear cups are
covered with synthetic leather and they
are really really soft they are not the
widest but they are wide enough for a
comfortable experience for most ears
they might feel a little bit tight when
you first put them on but after a few
minutes you start getting used to them
the headband also has some cushion here
and to some people that might mean more
comfort but I said to some people
because for me as long as there's
something there and it's not bare metal
or bare plastic I usually don't really
notice very much of a difference the
only thing that really matters to me is
how soft the ear cups are and how much
tension the headphones themselves
squishing against my head other than
that I don't really care much of
what they put here am I the only one
just me really and this could take up to
seven hours to fully charge a fully
drained battery which is kind of long
but you get about 22 hours of playtime
and that's if you're using Bluetooth you
have a noise cancellation on and you
have extra base on which means if you
turn extra bass off and you Stern noise
cancellation off you get even more time
which is kind of good and also speaking
about charging this can if if they will
run out of battery you cannot just use
them and then plug them in and still
listen no it doesn't work that way you
have to to take them off and charge them
the only way you can use them as they
are charging is if you're using the hard
wired music by using the provided cord
to listen to hardwired music but not
bluetooth I'm not sure if it's a safety
feature like just in case dead batteries
overheat and explode on your ear or
something like that I have no idea but
that's just how it is I thought you
might want to know that so on the right
ear cup we find what sony is calling the
jog switch and this controls various
call and playback functions and right
below it is a volume rocker with a
tactile dot on the plus side to help
with blind operations moving on to the
left ear cup we find the indented power
button the best effect button the
charging port wired audio input the
noise cancellation button which sticks
out a little bit to help distinguish it
from the power button and lastly on the
on this cup you will find the NFC panel
if you look closely all these buttons
look and feel differently which means if
you use these headphones for long enough
time you will get so used to all these
buttons and know what each function
button feels like so you won't have to
take your headphones off in order to
switch stuff around and you won't be
yeah
pressing buttons that you were not
intending to so that is really nice I
really really like the way they laid out
their buttons here each ear cup is
housing and microphone and when you make
a phone call both microphones are used
and they are also used during noise
cancellation and speaking of noise
cancellation here is a taste of that but
for the best experience please please
use headphones otherwise you won't hear
you won't hear the difference at all
okay so this is how the room sounds like
right now I do have some music playing
in the background and I also have a fan
on going in the background just so we
can get some sort of ambient noise so
yes this is how it sounds like now I'm
going to put the microphone into the
headphones so we can hear how it sounds
like with the noise cancellation off
and now we're going to turn and noise
translation on know if canceling on know
if canceling off
and there you have it it will not
completely block out people talking
around you all of that soft music
playing in a background but it will
definitely cut out all the low-frequency
ambient noise now if you're listening to
music you probably won't hear people
talking around you it's good like if you
if the headphones are playing something
you definitely won't be hearing all that
noise around you but even with you know
not playing music or anything like that
you still it still does a pretty good
job at blocking out their low frequency
noise and muffling up all the other kind
of sounds around you with that said how
good is the sound quality well I will
let you listen to them but keep in mind
my microphone you tube compression and
the headphones that you are using to
listen to this I'm not going to make it
possible for you to get exactly and hear
exactly the way these headphones sound
like but it should give you a good idea
of how they sound like with that said
please make sure you're using headphones
because if you don't you won't be
getting the full on 3d sound because
I'll be using a high quality binaural
microphone to record this and with that
said
I'm happy to make time oh yes do you
have to admit
excuse me
so we will be still going with this
sample but I wanted to say that that's
all you can do with the headphone
controls as far as sound control goes
but if you get the sony headphone music
up you can do a lot more let's see what
we can do with the up
know if canceling off know if canceling
on
and like I said what you've just heard
is not exactly the way these headphones
sound like if you were to put them on
your head but it should give you a good
idea on how they sound like in fact if
your headphones that you're using and
not within the range of this frequency
respond all larger you probably didn't
hear some things that these headphones
were producing with that said these are
called extra bass for a very good reason
lots of this now I don't own a ton of
headphones but of the few that I own and
the ones that I tried before there's
nothing that compares to the kind of
music or the kind of best that they
things are able to pump out it's just
incredible if you are a best head you
cannot go wrong with Biz with a sound
sound sound so best heavy and you get
some kind of a somewhat of a balanced
music if you turn the extra bits off but
the carve still wins heavy on the best
side so if the best is too too much for
you you can always go into the app and
dial it down I feel like it would have
been kind of nice if we were able to
dial up or down admit and their highs
but Sony was not really focused on those
two things as far as these headphones
they are for best lovers if you're
listening to balanced music if you're
looking for balanced headphones these
are not yours but again you can dial
down the best if it's too much for you
in the app so I'm happy with them
anyways that's being me with these
headphones that's my experience and I
hope you've got some kind of inside
understanding of these headphones if you
like the video aim the headphone videos
that I do here please
like and if the headphones that you'd
like me to check out nest drop them in
the comment section below so I can see
if I can get my hands of them otherwise
if you're not subscribed please
subscribe if you liked the video leave
your like if you didn't like it
leave a dislike I just like to hear some
kind of feedback from you guys
you know because you watch the video
thanks for watching this one I love you
all and I will see you in the next one
