this is a video that a lot of you have
been asking ever since I uploaded my
previous video the boombox versus the
JBL extreme now I'm like a lot of uqe
assets out there I was also a little bit
curious on how to gob extremes might
handle the battle against one JBL
boombox so for that matter welcome to
another sound battle okay so the two
extremes will be playing in stereo mode
and then the boom box I'll play some
songs in outdoor mode and then other
songs in indoor mode and like always
I'll be using a high quality binaural
microphone so for the best experience
most especially with the two extremes
playing stereo mode you might wanna use
headphones for the best experience with
that said let's hear the speaker's speak
yeah can I borrow for a minute ride on I
got this lady rolling like a night storm
forever win and don't you ever get in my
way mr. pallazzo more piles up in your
face teamwork it hold my feet in the
dirty extreme through the surge of
adrenaline burst my knees hurt please
don't let the medicine work so I can get
in there professionals go better get
them running a headache each time
Canabalt for a minute let's go without
this where your mouth is you're hurt
right that the heard it's mine for a
break with the emeishan you know I'm
gonna get it every time
man oh man so I don't know about you but
I love stereo sound and what's coming
out of the two extremes is just amazing
straightforward there's only one area
where the boombox
is doing a better job and that's in the
best department when you set the boombox
to endo mode it goes a lot deeper in the
best performance like you're able to
hear deeper bass notes like I'm
frequency like lower frequencies which
is good but the stereo sound that is
coming out of the two extremes is way
too good like it makes me feel like I'm
missing something on the boombox to the
point that I don't really care about a
little bit better best performance on
the boombox that's a lot of bees what
I'm trying to say is yes the boombox
does a better job in best performance in
indoor mode but this the sound and the
studio sound experience from two
extremes mix that up for me big-time
and as far as loudness the difference is
next to nothing um with a sound meter
about one and a half meters or five feet
away from the speakers I was able to get
a maximum reading of 102 for the two JBL
extremes and I'm 104 for the JBL boombox
which is not really that who you have a
difference and here's the thing with two
JBL extremes one is going to be placed
on one side of the room and the other is
going to be placed on the other side of
the room that going to be way more room
filling than the boombox in the same
size of room two extremes on the
opposite sides of the room sound way
better than one JBL boombox so house
party people you know what to do the
only gripe I have with the GBO extremes
is their battery issues so like a lot of
people have complained on an Internet my
old JBL extreme so they're doing the
same thing too like he tells you it
needs to be charged you plug it in it
blinks - all night like all night long
like with no birds or anything at all
sometime we will show it will show it's
full and then you look a little bit late
you look at it later and it shows its
eyes like two bears or sometimes it will
say it needs to be charged you plug it
in and it shows it's full and it's just
annoying like make up your mind make up
your charging mind you probably replace
the beep with the wrong word gotcha
anyways what do you think about this
battle I'd like to hear so drop me a
comment down below and if you liked the
video please leave a like if you didn't
like it feel free to leave it this way I
just want to know what you think about
