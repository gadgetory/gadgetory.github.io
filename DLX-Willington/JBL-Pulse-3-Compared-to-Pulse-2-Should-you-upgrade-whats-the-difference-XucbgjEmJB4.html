welcome to this video the long awaited
post 3 is here and in this video we're
going to be taking a close look at it
and see how it compares to the now older
pulse
- stay tuned first things first the
unboxing experience is going to feel a
lot like the positive or should I say
exactly like the pulse 2 the only
difference here is going to be the size
of the box and that's because the post 3
is a little bit bigger than the positive
you will get the same accessories in
microUSB cable a power brick and the
paperwork stuff and once you get a
speaker out of the box the first thing
you will notice is this drastic change
in design compared to the pulse 2 I
don't know about you but I really dig in
love the way this looks if it's just
beautiful so they got rid of this mesh
grille and replaced it with a durable at
the bottom of the fabric and the fabric
we've like on the charge 3 at the flip
fold at flip 3 and all those speakers
and at a bar at the top here they added
this durable plastic that feels and
sounds kind of like glass but it's
actually plastic as far as I know but it
looks really really good
now I tend to tell you right now how
this will hold up to scratches over time
but I get some hotel but the only thing
I can tell you though that it is a
fingerprint magnet but they can only be
noticed well it's like notice pretty
good when the lights are off but when
the light is on you can't really tell
that it's just it's bright enough to
where you can't really see the
fingerprints so that is a good thing so
they kept
all the controls from the past 2 to the
power 3 except for one thing they don't
have the color picker that's on a
positive on here they ditched that I'm
personally going to kind of mix it
because that's so many times that I find
myself that I don't want to go into my
app and change colors and just use this
use this point into the color I want and
get that but now the only option that
you will have is going into your app and
actually choosing the color you want
from there they get a little bit of an
improvement to the app you can actually
use the phone to point at the colors
that you want and select it that way so
that is cool but I'm still kind of kind
of going to miss it overall I'm
impressed by the design I think they did
a great job I really love the speaker
the fabric grille kind of makes it blend
in better with all the other JBL
speakers that have the same fabric they
charge through the extreme the flips all
of that so that was really really a nice
touch
so that's everything you need to know
only outside what's new in the inside
well they updated the Bluetooth version
for 4.1 to 4.2 but with listening just
to music you probably won't tell that
much of a difference
the speaker also gains some weight from
27 ounces on the pulse 2 to 34 ounces on
the new pulse 3 which is not really huge
it's really really comparable and the
other thing is they claimed up to 10
hours of play time on their policy -
with the battery capacity of 6,000 mhm
and with the same battery capacity in
here back in here that claiming up to 12
hours of play time so that's a good
improvement but we'll see how that
actually plays out but all those are
minor changes here are the big changes
in my opinion we now have 340
full-range drivers in the past three
with a total output of 20 watts that's
more compared to the 245 luminaire
drivers that we had on the pulse - with
the total output power of 16 watts but
even though we have smaller drivers on
the +3 they're actually claiming a lower
frequency response of 65 Hertz that is
better compared to the 85 Hertz that
they claimed on the older pulse to here
the short test to see if they differ at
all starting with a lower frequency
response test take a lesson
okay was done 85 Hertz right there
so many five Hertz
and now 65 Hertz
now wait just a minute I can't come down
to Spain to hear it oh how did you make
time for dinner you have to win me
let me come down another round
he'll be disco ball I have to windy
everyone should be anger is misplaced
I personally do hear a huge difference
in bass performance honestly there is a
lot less distortion on the pulse tree
compared to the pulse - and you could
clearly hear this
during the lower frequency response test
but as far as deeper or louder bass I
couldn't really hear a huge difference
here I'll be doing a more detailed sound
comparison of these two so make sure you
subscribe so you don't miss out on that
I mean fact 1 that video goes alive I
will put a link to it under this video
in the description section below so
depending on when you're watching this
you can check down there the video might
be live another big change is they moved
from directional sound to 360 sound so
it should be more room filling and no
matter where you are around the speaker
you should have the same sound
experience so directional 360 if you're
interested in that there it is and
unlike the pulse 2 this is waterproof
this was splash proof this is water
proof it's completely submerged able
into water up to 3 feet for about 30
minutes so it's that something you need
there you have it now when JBL
introduced the platform they also
introduced a new technology of
connection what they called JBL connect
Plus which was replacing the GB of
connect which you find on older speakers
now this is cooler and you're able to
connect up to 100 plus speakers with one
speaker serving all the other 99 or more
they actually got a Guinness world
record for it Guinness world record for
it so it is pretty cool but it has a
downside to it as of right now I cannot
connect this with this because this has
JBL connect and this has JBL connect
plus
they are not this is not
backward-compatible and this is not
forward word compatible anyways these
cannot be connected that is a bummer
JBL that really sucks
now JBL promised before that they will
be releasing an update so we are able to
connect the JBL connect speakers to JBL
connect flash speakers but up to today
it's been months and nothing has been
sent out yet to be able to do that so I
don't know if they're failing or what
but it's really annoying I wish you guys
can figure that out because it'll be
nice if I can connect that list and I
mean these are all pulses but I can't
even connect them come on those are the
notable differences between these two
speakers now the big question is should
you upgrade to the power three if you
already own the pulse two that's usually
a hard question to answer but here is
what I think the 360 sound on the pulse
3 and the waterproofness on the past
three those are all great improvements I
love them but the main reason I would
upgrade to the past three from the past
two is the new design I love the way
this works I think it looks it looks
amazing I just can't resist it but if
you don't care about the waterproofness
if you're not concerned about
waterproofness and you don't really care
about the 360 sound and in addition to
that you do not love the new design you
don't like the water looks compared to
this there is not really any big reasons
to upgrade to the pulse three if those
three things if those three things don't
matter to you you don't like the way it
looks
360 sound is not a big deal to you and
waterproofness
not a concern to you there is honestly
not a huge reason to upgrade to the new
post 3 but if you need to these speakers
and you don't own any of them when
you're just trying to see which one to
get
I would honestly just shoot straight for
the pulse 3 just because of you know all
those added features that you will
already have so you won't so the need
next year maybe to upgrade when the
pulse 4 comes out if you own this one
you buy now this is really a pulse 3
next year or the following year they
come up with a pulse fold and your idea
I'm a couple of generations behind so it
would just make sense for me to just go
to the power three if I don't own this
one here but that's just me that's it
please subscribe if you haven't yet it
really helps out a lot and also if there
are some if your speakers that you'd
like to see or hear them battle against
the new pulse 3 let me know down in the
comment section below so we can do we
can get those sounded battles ready
thanks for watching this one I really
appreciate you guys always coming back
subscribe if you're new um I love you
all and I will see you in the next one
peace cut cut cut
