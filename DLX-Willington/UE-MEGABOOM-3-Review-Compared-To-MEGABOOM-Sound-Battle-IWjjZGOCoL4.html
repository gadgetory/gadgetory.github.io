welcome to this video um today we're
going to be taking a close look at the
UE Mehta boom tree and see how it
compares to the out-going mega boom and
that's feature wise and sound wise if
there's something you're interested in
stay tuned okay so starting off the
presentation of the speaker is pretty
good
I think Yui does a pretty good job at
that and in the box you also find a USB
cable a power brake and the paperwork
stuff and looking at the speaker there
are only minor changes in comparison to
the mega boom the placement of the
buttons has changed as you can tell
there but also this strap is also really
thin compared to this and maybe the
other thing is that the weave is a lot
tighter on this and the mega boom flea
in comparison to the older one this
gives you a lot of grip like in your
hand well as this here you still get
some sort of grip to it but this feels a
lot more secure in the hand compared to
this tight lip here and I think this
also looks better I don't know
that's in the hands of the beholder but
I don't know I feel like I like the
weave that's on here compared to this
but try it or Lose they are all still
completely i'm ipx7 rated so it's
completely waterproof you can submerge
it into water for up to a minute I mean
30 minutes and it will be completely
fine that's if you're in a meter of
water
the only other change they see here as
far as physical changes is the magic
button like this is what Yui is calling
the magic button I feel like it's kind
of overhyped personally because all it
does is it can play pause and skipped
next truck I'm the only other thing that
maybe that's why they are pulling it the
magic button is if you use the Apple
music or Deezer if you use Android you
can program it to where you won't press
this button here and it will come it
will automatically start your and
playlist if you have it set up in diesel
or Apple music which is I guess kind of
cool but I personally don't use both
those apps so it still doesn't really
mean that much to me so maybe it's a big
deal to some people out there but I
still think it's being overhyped the
magic button you do have this new hook
no nautical like a strap where you can
hang the speaker if you want to hang it
somewhere the main main thing that I
love that they really did change is the
placement of the charging port right
here I really like that they were able
to change that from what they used to
have on here it was a pain in the butt
if you had to change this to charge this
thing when it's playing because you'd
have to place it like this which is fine
but at the same time it just doesn't
seem right I'm kind of disappointed that
is not USBC but at the same time I'm
happy that they moved it
but anyway so yes as far as physically
those are the only notable things I see
and maybe at the back here as you can
tell you now have like what they had on
the mega blast and the blaster speakers
you do have the same thing here so if
you actually have it right here if you
have one of these from UE this is a
charging dock so you can just place it
down and place the speaker on there and
it will start charging and you can use
it as you want that's not something they
had on the previous mega Bob so that's
another new thing which I kind of
appreciate but I don't like that you do
have to buy this separately
I guess convenience can get expensive
you know the speaker still has the same
battery rating which is about 20 hours
of playtime is still a 360 sound and
also the same drivers the only
difference here is only that this one is
rated to go as long as 60 Hertz it's a
little bit lower frequency response
compared to the mega boom and we will
see how that you know stacks up as far
as sound comparison between the two if
it pays off at all and speaking about
sound comparison maybe we should get
into that before we talk about sound as
usual I'll be using a high quality
binaural microphone to record this so
for the best experience please use
headphones and with that said well let's
hear the speaker's speak
that's pretty much nothing this day
seems to me everything feels like
you have it I'm not sure about you but I
feel like there is almost no difference
as far as sound it's completely the same
sound signature if you judge by the low
frequency response test you can tell
that the mega boom 3 has a little bit of
better bass performance in comparison to
the mid of them but it's not like a lot
like it's not like a lot better at this
than the mega boom I feel like it's
still rocking that abyss and not
completely the deep bass that we've come
to expect from speakers that about its
size and you know in that price range I
feel like that still I know other people
who do like the way the speaker sounds
like how much best you get out of it but
personally I still feel a little bit
disappointed um I was hoping for
something a little bit better than that
as far as best performance I'm the meat
so okay the pies okay it's just the best
department where I always feel let down
by the Yui speakers I don't know what do
you guys think as far as someone who
might want to upgrade the speaker if you
if you you really need maybe the easy
charging the magic button if there's
something that you're really into you
really like that or the slightly new
design I'm not sure but if you're basing
this completely off of how they sound
you really don't have to upgrade if you
already have the mega boom I feel like
the only reason that you would upgrade
is if you really need those new features
that they might have or they have on
their mega boom free but not for the
reason of how it sounds
yeah I forgot to mention they are about
the same loudness this is not louder
than the megaphone that all about the
same of loudness so nothing has changed
there so yeah let me know what you guys
have to say about the two speakers in
the comment section below and if you're
new here and you've not yet subscribed
please do so I really do appreciate that
I'll put the links down below to these
speakers if you want to pick one up if
you use those links they do help out the
channel and I really do appreciate it if
you like the video give it a like if you
didn't like it leave a dislike
I just want to get some sort of feedback
from you because you did watch the video
with that said thanks for watching and I
will see you guys in the next video
peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
