you are welcome to my channel in this
video I'm going to show you just like
the title says how to use your GeForce
experience shuttle play to record your
screen just like what I'm doing right
here we'll get started just got your
GeForce experience shortcut if you have
it on the desktop and open it or you can
go down here GeForce open NVIDIA GeForce
experience and that will still open it
for you it doesn't matter how you open
it I just have to open it whichever way
you do that so right when we get here
I'll show you the system I'm running I
have a geforce gtx 760 i7 4 7 7 0 k CPU
is not overclocked 16 gigs of ram 1920
by 12 by 1200 resolution of my monitor
and i have the current version as of
today of the drivers of the geforce
experience so just make sure you always
have those up-to-date I'm running
Windows 8.1 just as you can see here
just make sure you always go here and
you always want your GeForce drivers
up-to-date just like their these are the
current versions as of today so we'll
get started
how do you record your screen if you're
not a gamer like me like I have no games
at all I just use my system for video
and animations and 3d stuff so usually
you would have to use shadowplay
only when you up in a game but i don't
do that so it was useless for me and I
so much wanted to use it what I'm Scott
you know capturing my screen and finally
I can and I
going to show you how you can do that
most important you want to turn it on
just go right here shadowplay open it
and turn it on right here once you turn
it on you want to go to the Preferences
shadowplay and tweak around these guys
if you have a webcam attached and you
want to record it this is how you do
that camera and you have to turn it on
right here and who LM
I mean wags medium and small that's just
how what big you want your your webcam
to appear here but I don't have that so
that's just wanted to show you those
settings you can do that too the most
important thing that we want for this
video is this right here allow this crop
capture you have to check that on that's
how you have to do it if you don't
enable that then it goes back to just
in-game recording only so right down
here you want to change if you have to I
just leave mine in the default that's
where all my seven videos go but if you
want to change them to go somewhere else
this is how you do that just go change
to each other location you want and I
have some settings right here that I
have to mention like when you get to the
shadow play right here when you open it
you have settings here that can only be
done when you're recording if I turn it
off this will be disabled you can't do
anything here same as here you have to
turn it on before you can change any
settings so the settings I wanted just
give you a quick review about right here
this gives you a quick open to your
files wherever your that being said he
just gives you a quick access to that
and this just brings you to these
settings right here
and this one here is your audio when I'm
not going to
click these settings just because once I
do that my timing starts right then like
if I say I change any settings the video
when I go to save it or start right when
I change I click this setting so I'm not
going to do that I'm just going to give
you an idea of what's in these settings
right here so in audio you have three
options I think as of today might have
changed whichever time you're watching
this video but as of today it has three
settings in here you can either turn it
off like you don't want any audio being
recorded or you can record just what the
computer is playing that's if you are in
a game and you just want to game sound
only not in a sound from the microphone
or you can put it away I have it right
now in game and microphone so if I play
anything on a computer
and now it would end it also records my
my voice on from the microphone so
that's mainly what the settings that you
have and then equality it gives you
custom which is what I'm using right now
1080p and 30 frames per second it goes
up to 1080p and I think 50 frames per
second and it has some more settings in
that you can see those and then what I
wanted to say do is a shadow time the
shadow time is how many minutes you want
to be saved when you hit out f10 which
is the way you save your files after
switching around and doing whatever
you're doing I have about 20 so every
time I hit out f10 it will save the last
20 minutes this I mean if you have been
recording for 30 minutes and you have it
set to 20 minutes it will save the last
20 minutes of those 30 minutes you've
been recording so that means the first
10 minutes
you've not got them you've missed them
so just make sure you know how long
you're going to go all watch for
whichever minutes you've said I think it
goes down to about 5 minutes I'm not
sure but 20 is the highest can go out so
today okay so after you are done with
all those settings just close it and go
get work do whatever you are doing and
once you are done heat out f10 and your
file will be saved
wherever you're you directly to be saved
so after you're done with everything and
by the way you don't have to have this
open when you're hitting if 10 out of 10
you just hit out of 10 and your file
will be saved wherever you want it to be
saved and just go there and open it
so that's that pretty much concludes
