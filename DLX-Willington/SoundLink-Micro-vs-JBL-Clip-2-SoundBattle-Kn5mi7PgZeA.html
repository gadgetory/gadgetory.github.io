welcome to another sound battle while
we'll have speakers speak for themselves
in the battlefield today we have the
Soundlink microbe going up against the
JBL club - this has been one of the
videos that you guys have been requested
have been requesting the most so here
you have it I'll be using a high quality
binaural microphone to record this so
please use headphones for the best
experience without said let's hear the
speaker's speak
Mother's Day it means to me that
everything has gone so fast is like I'm
please come away I will
so I'm pretty sure the winner is clear
here but here are my thoughts anyways
considering the size of these two
speakers and what's coming out the
Soundlink
micro I think JBL needs to step up their
game in these little speakers cuz they
are losing pretty big here if you
couldn't tell the micro is louder than
the clip the sound of the Sun linked
micro is a lot richer it's able to go a
lot lower on the frequency curve
compared to what this is able to do and
the clip 2 is not a bad speaker on its
own but if you put it next to the Sun
link micro it really has no chance of
winning at all honestly if you put the
clip next to the Soundlink micro it
sounds a lot like the kind of speaker
you would use to listen to podcasts or
news or TV shows you know what I mean
because it sounds a lot like that and it
sounds like something that will actually
give you music that's enjoyable the only
deal-breaker here is the price the sound
link micro is a little bit overpriced in
my opinion so it makes it harder for
some people it's just out of reach for
some people to be able to get it so in
that case you can stick with this guy
here it's waterproof it has an audio
connection for hardwiring which this one
does not so it has a little bit of good
stuff this is what I proved too by the
way but if you have the money the sound
link micro is your best choice here
that's been it from me I would really
really love to hear what you guys have
to say about these two in the comment
section below leave me a like if you
liked the video if you're new here
please subscribe so you don't miss out
on the upcoming videos I love you all
thanks for watching and I will see you
in the next one peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
