Willington here and welcome to another
sound battle where we let speakers speak
for themselves in a better field today
we have the Soundlink mini two buses the
I roar go the go has more than one sound
selling but during this comparison I
will have the roar turned on if you
would like to hear how each setting
sounds like set to the end of this video
I will play a song switching between
flat mode the roar mode and the
equalizer mode so you guys can get a
feel of how they all compare to each
other but there will be at the end of
this video and if you're new here please
consider subscribing to the channel so
you get notified when I put up new
videos and it really helps out the
channel a lot and thank you in advance
in this battle the speakers of five feet
away from a high equality by neuro
microphone and they'll be playing at 70%
volume for more realistic sound
experience put your headphones on and
let's hear the speaker's speak
in the in the
you
so if loveness is the deciding factor
for you stop watching right now
subscribe and don't get yourself the eye
roar go so starting with the low
frequencies or the bass both speakers
perform very well but the many two is
losing a little bit because of the
distortions in its best in some songs
you can hear what I'm talking about here
in this sample so as you could hopes we
hear the mini to was destroying the
bassline that the goal was able to
reproduce without any distortions roll
the go has a better soundstage in my
opinion and the mids and not as ground
like the mini 2 so as much as they think
that the mini 2 is a good speaker the
goal wins this battle in my opinion and
the fact that you have more than one
sound setting just at the push of a
button makes it even better the sound is
so subjective and I would like to hear
what you think about this 2 speakers in
the comment section below but before the
sample I promised you at the beginning
of this video I would like to remind you
that if you new here please subscribe it
really helps out a lot
we'll say with a trail plane without and
they'll help me I'll take you to the
next thing with the money yet in the bed
Saturday so which of these modes sounded
the best for you let me know down below
with that said thanks for watching this
one and I will see you in the next one
and sorry for my voice it's been kind of
horrible on this video but I'll be
getting better I believe thanks for
watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
