the review of the second gen 10,000 mil
amp power bank from ez s easy
AK easy SCC however you want to say that
so the packaging was small and simple
like you would expect from this kind of
product and out of the box you get the
power bank the charging cable and the
user menu I've been using and testing
this product for over two weeks now and
I will start off with you what the good
things I found or I have to say about it
and just so you know this is not my
first power bank to own in fact I have
way more than what you guys are looking
at here but on the other hand this is my
second smart power bank to own now my
first impression was the color and
design although you can get it in
different color options this black and
yellowish orange accent really caught my
eyes and it's really thin compared to
most power banks on the market and the
build quality does not feel cheap it has
two smart ports it's able to communicate
with your device and give her the
appropriate amount of amps it requires
up to the maximum of two point four amps
for fast charging it also has a
flashlight like almost all the other
battery puffs on the market right now
and it's not the brightest but comes in
handy if you're in total darkness with
nothing else
I mean you could it it lights up so you
could use it it also teaches LED lights
which will show you how much juice you
have left on your battery and will also
show you the progress while charging air
he took about six hours to recharge this
battery during my testing and on a full
charge I was able to charge my LG g3
which has a 3000 milliamp battery to
halftimes from a 15-percent Church which
means you are bound to get at least
three and a half charges out of it if
you own an iPhone 6 and that's because
it has a smaller battery I also like
that it comes with a fairly short cable
it keeps everything looking clean and
need and eliminates the hassle of
dealing with long coats on it go my only
complaint is the fact that you don't get
a carrying case with this I don't know
how they missed it but almost everyone
gives you a carrying case with their
power banks except for this one really
guys I feel like this is made for travel
and you know being portable so a
protection should have been something
that you guys put into consideration but
apparently it doesn't really matter but
with that said this is an awesome
product and as of today it's my second
favorite power bank amongst all the ones
right Ohman OS 4 for now until I get
another one because I know I'll get
another one
at some point but I'll leave the link to
this product in the description section
below so you can check it out on eBay if
you are interested leave your comments
and questions in this comment section
below and I'll get back to you as soon
as I can
