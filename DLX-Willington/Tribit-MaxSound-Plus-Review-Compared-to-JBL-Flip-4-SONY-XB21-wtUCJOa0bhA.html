today we're going to be taking a close
look at the Tri bet max sound plus a new
speaker
I'm from tri bit I'm also going to be
comparing it to the more expensive I'm
flip for in the srs XP 21 just because
they are pretty much the same size so
yes if you're interested in that let's
get into it okay so once you get inside
the box you will find an audio cable and
micro USB charging cord the paperwork
stuff and the speaker itself and the
speaker is a little bit bigger than the
X sound goal that we looked at last year
but it's basically the same design I
mean you'll find all your basic control
buttons on top here but this time we'll
also have the extra base feature like
the one you find on the Sony speakers
and right around the back here is where
you will find all your charging ports
and micro USB charging port and the
auxiliary input for people who like hard
wired music the speaker is also ipx7
rated which is why you have that flap
right there to cover up those pores
before you expose the speaker to water
it's running Bluetooth 4.2 has 245
millimeter drivers 12 watts each two PRS
who are in the front here and one in the
back here I'm tribe it claims up to 20
hours of play time but this is probably
at moderate volumes and it also depends
on the kind of music you're listening to
so if you have the extra bits on
blasting at high volumes you're probably
looking at a lot less hours of play time
we know as far as my experience goes
okay so I think that's enough about the
speaker how does it sound
well I'm going to be giving you guys a
sound sample but like I promised I will
be throwing in these two so they can
kind of play as this place to so we can
kind of they give us a reference of how
the speaker sounds because I feel like
most people know
these guys here so as usual I'll be
using a high quality binaural microphone
so for the best experience please make
sure you're using headphones with that
said let's hear the speaker speak
and there you have it guys I was really
really surprised by how good the sounded
quality of the mock sound plus is in
comparison to the more expensive
speakers here really really good I'm the
best performance across the board is
pretty good this is not bad any worse
than any of this
the best is really really good the area
where the max sound plus is actually
doing a way way better job is in their
highs and around 70% volume the highs on
here start to sound very very unnatural
and the highs on here I just mashed up
like a mush of highs just mushed up
together no definition no nothing at all
just terrible but this guy here even at
maximum volume like you heard is still
able to maintain the definition of the
highs
they sound really really good and
overall everything is just still sounds
good even at maximum volume so the
volume also it's not any less loud than
any of this day maybe the flip phone is
a little bit louder just a little bit
louder but across the board they are all
pretty much about the same when it comes
to loudness so personally I'm really
really happy and you know impressed by
how good the max sound plus sounds and
how that even able to still keep the
price you know that low that's really
really you know interesting so if you're
someone looking for a speaker that is
$50 or less there's no any other option
that is better than this guy here it
sounds really good for that price that
is just really good unless maybe the
sound that I mean the size matters to
what you're looking for in that price
range
you're looking for something smaller
maybe but if just $50 or less this is
the guy to go with here even compared to
this more expensive speakers here so
really really impressed I'm hoping they
keep the sound Equality up like that
because I know sometimes companies will
come up with a good sounding speaker
then the next model just sounds like
crap so I'm hoping that's not the case
here
and they keep up this good sound quality
with this speaker here with their next
version maybe they should come up with a
something that competes against the
charge for or something that competes
against the extreme two and the XP 41 I
don't know you guys are doing a good job
here so I'm really really really happy
yes I'll put the links the speakers in

pick up one so use those links it helps
