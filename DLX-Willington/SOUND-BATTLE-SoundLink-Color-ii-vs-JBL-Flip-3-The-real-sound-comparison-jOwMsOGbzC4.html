welcome to 2017 I hope you guys had a
fantastic holiday season I myself
haven't been feeling very well this
season so excuse me for my voice but CES
2017 is this week and I'm so excited to
see what the world of Bluetooth speakers
has to offer this year but let's get
back to this video in the battlefield
today we have the flip three going up
against the sound link color to the
speakers are 5 feet away from the sound
recorder and they are both playing at 80
percent volume put your headphones on
and let's hear the speaker's speak
go go now I've got something to say oh
I'm happy to meet I'm oh you think this
do you have to win me oh let's just
break it down to you and me uptown
dancing all around til the disco ball
pops but I have to pin me and everyone
can see
Jaeger is this place
you
you
and that is it surprisingly the speakers
about the same when it comes to loudness
and also the mids and highs on both
speakers are almost identical I say
almost because when you listen closely
the highs on the Soundlink are a little
bit sharper than the highs on the flip
tweak but like I said you have to listen
closely moving on to the lows the flip 3
is a good speaker and it handles the
lows pretty good for its size but in
this battle the sound link is performing
better the gap between the two speakers
is not very big but you can definitely
hear a richer sound coming out of the
boats so the winner of this battle is
the Soundlink color - but the flip 3 is
honestly not very far behind it let me

happy new year and expect a lot to come
