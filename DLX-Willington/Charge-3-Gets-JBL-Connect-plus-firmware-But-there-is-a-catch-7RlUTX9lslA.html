and welcome to this short video and the
purpose for this is to let you guys know
that finally JBL has released a firmware
update firmware update for the JBL
charge 3 and what that will do is it
will legend it will let you it's
basically turning the chart 3 into a JBL
connect plus enabled speaker and what
that means is you will be able to
connect the charge 3 to play together
with all the the JBL connect plus
enabled speakers which is as of right
now the JBL flip for the JBL pulse 3 and
the JBL boom box so there you have it
there's only one drawback though if you
go ahead with the firmware you will not
be able to connect to the new to the
older speakers that so we using the JBL
connect so if you own the older speakers
that's the extreme the pulse to the flip
3 if you own those speakers and you
don't have the newer ones you don't want
this up this firmware update you don't
want this update if you own the older
speakers the only reason that you want
the firmware is if you have the newer
speakers that have JBL connect plus you
get it that's really important because
as soon as you go ahead with the
firmware this will not be able to
connect this guy here they charge 3 so
really really really big be careful
before you do it just make sure that's
why you want to do before you actually
go ahead and do it now that is really
cool it's kind of I kind of happy that
JBL went through with it which is really
really nice but I haven't personally
done it yet and that's because I'm
planning well I'm working on a video I
haven't filmed it yet which involves
connecting them the extreme the charge 3
the pass to and the flip 3
until I do record that video which is
probably going to be before the end of
the week I will be I won't be updating
so as soon as I'm done with that though
I'm going to be updating my speaker too
to the GB to the GBO Connect class so
that will be nice but the purpose of
this video was just let you guys know
that yes
it's out right now and you can go ahead
and do it and yes you can connect your
charge 3 to the flip 4 to the power 3
and to the boombox yes it was just a
quick update for you guys um I wish all
the American fans out there I wish you
guys a happy Thanksgiving happy turkey
day I know I'm gonna eat a lot of it so
thanks for watching this one I love you
all and I will see you in the next one
peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
