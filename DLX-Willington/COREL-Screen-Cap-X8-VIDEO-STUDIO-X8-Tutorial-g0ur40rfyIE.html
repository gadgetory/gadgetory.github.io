here and today we are learning how to
use the Corl screencap x8 on Windows 10
okay let's go so first thing you want to
do is open it up I do have it on my tray
right here but you can just open it
using the shortcut on your desktop or
wherever you have it either way open it
anyway so when you open it this is what
comes up and the blue lines I'm not sure
if my screen cup I'm using is showing
them but those blue lines all around
your screen just show you the territory
that's going to be recorded as soon as
you hit this is clean this with quad
button so and that's the default once
you open it up it defaults to the size
of your screen so like my screen is a
1920 by 1200 pixels and that's why it
defaults to because it's on full screen
right here this is why you can change
the resolution of your video
the resolution your video is going to be
so you can go in here and make it custom
and that way you just decide yourself
you can either just type in so like I
can live in 1920 by maybe like 1080 and
now makes it that size so that was just
custom because you just typed in
whatever you want it to do and the cool
thing also is that you can just drag
these and make make it whichever size
you want it to be just by dragging it
and it will update itself like you can
see here as I drag it it updates to the
resolution it will be so that's really
cool most of the time I leave mine at
full screen so most of sometimes I also
gets to a 1080 here yet so I don't have
to do any post-production when
so that time but there's this button
right here lets you draw where you want
it to record so if you don't want to
just drag it like I showed you before
when you hit this it lets you draw where
you want it to record so like when I hit
it like that I can just make my mark
right here and it will create his spot
so that's really cool it's this is this
is really cool so down here father this
is a record button right here and this
is a stop button if you're recording or
you can just hit f10 on your keyboard
and it will stop recording and when we
go right down into more settings right
here the first one is the file name this
is what you want your video to be called
whatever you're recording so let's say
test and that's what the video is going
to be named when I'm done recording it's
gonna be it's gonna save it save it as
test and here is save to this is the
folder where you want your videos to be
saved after being recorded or after that
time that you had recalled the default
folder is created by Corel VideoStudio
Pro and it's called 18-point oh so
that's the folder
excuse me that's the folder where all
your videos are going to be thrown by
default but you can change it to
whichever place you want it to be I'm
fine with that so all my videos are
found right in there because I know why
it is so that's what that does and the
next one is the format I only have WMV
x' but I don't know if some people get
more than that
and why we have a drop menu but only one
option but that's what it is and I'm
okay with it works for me so I don't
know if you might have more options than
I do here but yeah that's just a format
of the video that you know the program
output and the frame rate is right here
you can choose from 15 to 30 most of the
times always sometimes I would use a 25
but almost all the time I'm using using
30 frames per second and the voice we
call voice here this is the audio
settings and voice is basically enabling
you to record from the microphone so if
you have a microphone attached to your
computer which I don't you can turn this
on and that way everything you pick
through your microphone will be recorded
too as we call the video if you don't
have it it will give you this mmm sounds
so awesome but yeah no voice detected
please make sure this is enabled in your
computer and try again so I don't have
any microphones attached to it so
because I just recalled its turn away
onto a voice recorder
but yeah if you have a microphone
connected like with your headsets or
something like that
you can enable a neighbor that and then
you can speak into it and it'll be
recorded on to the video
and then the other thing next under that
is the system audio and this is
basically whatever will be playing on
your video whatever will be playing on
your computer is going to be recorded
too so if you're playing music while
recording that music will be played or
any sounds that computer makes like you
know that word
you'll be recorded too but if I don't
have it on if I do that you probably
didn't hear anything but no wait Mike
okay maybe my audio recorder recorded it
because it's right here but yeah you
wouldn't hear anything with that turned
off the cool thing about it though is
that you have like Lister your audio is
set all the way up to 100 and you want
the recorder not recorded all the way to
the high you have a volume control right
here so you can determine how high the
volume is with and the audio is recorded
so right here which is a really really
really cool feature I think it's genius
that they did that but that's cool and
then you have control settings right
here now this is the beauty of it you
cannot not have this jet just have it
checked it's cool so you know how you
press something you could never click
somewhere you know an animation or cars
I'll make sure I show you the video of
that like I can actually do it right now
let's see I'll start recording and yeah
it does that
really
so if I started recording and I click
this click this click this and then hit
f10 and save it so let's watch the video
here real quick and see so you should
you should walk right here where I click
so we can stay animation that see that's
what I'm talking about so if you enable
that that's what that does it's really
really really cool you should enable it
and this is just to enabling enable the
shortcuts instead of going to the tray
and bringing it up and stopping and if
it's recording you can just use f10 or
f11 for pause and unpause or we start
recording that's why that does so I
usually leave that on because it's easy
to use that shortcut just hit f10
instead of going down and bringing it up
and stop here to stop so and then down
here is the monitor settings if you have
more than one monitor they will all show
up here I only have one connected right
now so but you can choose which monitor
you want to be recording from so like
mine is the primary monitor right now so
that's because it's the only one that I
have connected but if you have more than
one you can select which monitor will be
recorded now I'm not sure if you can
record more than two like we called two
of them at the same time I don't know
it might be possible but I haven't tried
that yet please I only have one monitor
right now so
yeah I think it might be possible but
I'm not so positive about that but yeah
this is just for selecting the monitor
that you want to be recorded but I think
that is all about the coral screen
capture x8 now there's one thing that I
haven't actually told you about see
right here all these things right here
you can record a single program and I
think this is where coral is really
genius about this you can choose which
program to record so let's say I don't
have the prettiest background my my
desktop right here and I don't want it
to be seen in a video that I'm recording
maybe you know some kind of weird I
don't want anybody to see when I'm
making my tutorial or whatever I'm
making I can say okay I'm going to be
working in Premiere Pro I have a
tutorial to do in Premiere Pro so I will
tell the choral exit screen capture that
only record Premiere Pro so as soon as I
press it and hit record it will only
record a fight in Premiere Pro like you
which of our programming issues so right
now it's recording if I minimize that
it's not as you can see here it's
supposed that's the sign showing it's
paused so you if I hit this and bring it
back that's when you stop and then you
hit you know start recording obviously
and then we start recording so it
doesn't record anything until until it's
the window is open you know I'm not
school to like when it's done you can
just hit this and you open the program
up for you so you know it's working and
then you can keep doing your thing in
your program whatever you're editing or
whatever you're trying to show and the
other cool thing about it too is that
once you hit the record button it starts
counting down so it lets you know and
gives you time to record you know to get
prepared and know that okay now in life
now I'm recording and the other cool
thing is as soon as you hit the the stop
button it opens up where the file has
been saved in the name of it so the name
I gave it you know is test and just
keeps adding numbers to whatever name
you put in here so which is really cool
that's the fuel on change it every time
you open it if you wanted to be named
different you have to come in here and
name it if you don't it will just keep
adding numbers with every file that you
make but I hope that was valuable to you
guys and hope you enjoy the video please
