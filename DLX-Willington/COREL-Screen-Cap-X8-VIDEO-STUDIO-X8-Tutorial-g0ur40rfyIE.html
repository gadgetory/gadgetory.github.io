and today we are learning how to use the
coral screencap x8 on Windows 10 okay
let's go so first thing you want to do
is open it up I do have it on my tray
right here but you can just open it
using the on the shortcut on your
desktop or wherever you have it either
way open it anyway so when you open it
um this is what comes up and the blue
lines i'm not sure if my screen clap i'm
using is showing them but those blue
lines all around your screen just show
you the territory that's going to be
recorded as soon as you hit this Queen
this with quad bottom so and that's the
default once you open it up it defaults
to the size of your screen so like my
screen is 1920 x 1200 pixels and that's
why it defaults to because it's on full
screen right here this is why you can
change the resolution of your video the
resolution your video is going to be so
you can go in here and make it custom
and not where you just decide yourself
you can either just type in so like I
can live in 1920 by maybe like ten
eighty and now makes it that size so
that was just custom because you just
typed in whatever you want it to do and
the cool thing also is that you can just
drag these and make make it whichever
size you want it to be just by dragging
it and it will update itself like you
can see here as I drag it make updates
to the resolution it will be so that's
really cool most of the time I live my
not full screen so most of sometimes I
also gets through a 1080 here yet so I
don't have to do any post production
when
so that time but there's this button
right here lets you draw where you want
it to record so if you don't want to
just drag it like I showed you before
when you hit this it lets you draw where
you wanted to record so like when I hit
it like that I can just make my mug
right here and it will create his spot
so that's really cool it's this is this
is really cool so downhill further this
is a record button right here and this
is a stop button if you're recording or
you can just hit f10 on your keyboard
and it will stop recording and when we
go right down into more settings right
here the first one is the file name this
is what you want your video to be cold
whatever you're recording so let's say
test and that's why the video is going
to be named when I'm done recording is
going to be it's going to save it save
that as test and here is saved to this
is the folder where you want your video
is to be saved after being recorded or
after that time that you have recalled
the default folder is created by coral
videostudio pro and it's called 18-point
oh so that's the folder
excuse me that's the folder where all
your videos are going to be thrown by
default but you can change it to
whichever place you want it to be I'm
fighting with that so all my videos that
phone right in there because I know why
it is so that's what that does and the
next one is the format I only have WMV s
but I don't know if some people get more
than that I don't know why we have a
drop menu but only one option but that's
what it is and I'm okay with it works
for me so I don't know if you might have
more options than I do here but yeah
that's just a format of the video that
you know the program output and the
frame rate is right here you can choose
from 15 to 30 like most of the times
always sometimes I would use a 25 but
almost all the time I'm using using 30
frames per second and the voice record
voice here this is the audio settings
and voice is basically enabling you to
record from the microphone so if you
have a microphone attached to your
computer which I don't you can turn this
on and that way everything used to pick
for your microphone will be recorded to
as we call the video if you don't have
it will give you this mmm sounds so
awesome but yeah no voice detected
please make sure that this is enabled in
your computer and try again so I don't
have any microphones attached to it so
because I just recalled externally onto
a voice recorder
but yeah if you have a microphone
connected like with your headsets or
something like that you can enable a
neighbor that and then you can speak
into it and will be recorded onto the
video and then the other thing next
under that is the system audio and this
is basically whatever will be playing on
your video whatever will be playing on
your computer is going to be recorded
too so if you're playing music while
recording that music will be played or
any sense the computer makes like you
know that word you'll be recorded to but
if I don't have it on if I do it you
probably didn't hear anything but not
wait my ok maybe my audio recorder
recorded it because it's right here but
yeah you wouldn't hear anything without
turned off the cool thing about it
though is that you have like listeria
audio is set all the way up to 100 and
you want the reporter not recorded all
the way to the high you have a volume
control right here so you can determine
how high the volume is with on the audio
is recorded so right here which is a
really really really cool feature I
think it's genius that they did that but
that's cool and then you have control
settings right here now this is the
beauty of it you cannot not have this
jet just have it checked it's cool so
you know how you press something you
could never you click somewhere you know
an animation or cars i'll make sure i
show you a video of that like I can
actually do it right now let's see I'll
start recording and yeah it does that
really cool so if I started recording
I click this click this click this and
then hit f10 and save it so let's watch
the video here real quick and see so if
you should walk right here where I click
so we can stand mention that see that's
what I'm talking about so if you enable
that that's what that does it's really
really really cool you should enable it
and this is just to enabling enable the
short cards instead of going to the tray
and bringing it up and stopping if it's
recording you can just use f10 or f11
for pause and unpause or we start
recording that's why that does so i
usually leave that on it cause it's easy
to use the shortcut just hit f10 instead
of going down and bringing it up and
stuff here to stop so and then down here
is the monitor settings if you have more
than one monitor they will all show up
here I only have one connected right now
so but you can choose which monitor you
want to be recording from so like mine
is the primary monitor right now so
that's because it's the only one that i
have connected but if you have more than
one you can select which monitor will be
recorded now i'm not sure if you can be
called more than to like record two of
them at the same time I don't know it
might be possible but I haven't tried
that yet please only have one monitor
right now so yeah I think it might be
possible but I'm not so positive about
that but yeah this is just for selecting
the monitor that you want to be recorded
but I think that is all about the coral
screen capture x8 now this one thing
that I haven't actually told you about
see right here all these things right
here you can record a single program and
I think this is where coral is really
genius about this you can choose which
programs recall so let's say I don't
have the prettiest background my mice
desktop right here and I don't want it
to be seen a video that I'm recording
maybe you know some kind of weird photo
that i have on there that I don't want
anybody to see when I'm making my
tutorial or whatever i'm making i can
say okay I'm going to be working in
Premiere Pro I have a tutorial to do in
Premiere Pro so I will tell the coral
exit screen capture that only record
premiere pro so as soon as I press it
and hit record it will only record a
fine in Premiere Pro like you which of
our program you choose so right now it's
recording if I minimize that it's not as
you can see here it's supposed that's
the sign showing exposed so you if I hit
this and bring it back that's when you
start and then you hit you know start
recording obviously and then we start
recording so it doesn't record anything
until until it's the window is open you
know I'm not school to like when it's
done you can just hit this and you open
the program up for you so you know it's
working and then you can keep doing your
thing in your program whatever you're
editing or whatever you're trying to
show and the other cool thing about it
too is that once you hit the record
button it starts counting down so it
lets you know and gives you time to
record you know to get prepared and know
that okay now in life now i am recording
and the other cool thing is as soon as
you hit the
the start button it opens up where the
file has been saved in the name of it so
the name I gave it in all his tests and
just keeps adding numbers to watch ever
name you'll put in here so which is
really cool that's if you don't change
it every time you open it if you wanted
to be named different you have to come
in here and name it if you don't it will
just keep adding numbers to that with
every file that you make but I hope that
was valuable to you guys and hope you
enjoy the video please make sure to
