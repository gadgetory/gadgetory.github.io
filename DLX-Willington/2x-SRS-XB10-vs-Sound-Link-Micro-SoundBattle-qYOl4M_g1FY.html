welcome to another found battle where we
let speakers speak for themselves in the
battlefield today we have two SRS XP
teams playing in stereo mode going up
against the Soundlink micro I'll be
using a high quality binaural microphone
so for the best experience please use
headphones with that said let's hear the
speakers speak
disco ball but I have to be
the bill say with a paper trail a house
in the hills to my next play with the
money yet in the new me
okay so the sound link is a little bit
louder than the 2x p10 is combined so if
you're looking at the 2 x beat ends just
because you think they would be louder
no is the answer but it's not really by
much the micro also seems to show more
strain and sound at maximum volumes so
that's something else to keep in mind
obviously this to your separation coming
out of the 2 X be tens mix for a wider
soundstage and a pleasing listening
experience because who does not love
some stereo sound at lower volumes the
best on the micro is a little bit better
but maximum volume the micro dials down
with its best a little bit to the point
where the 2 XP tens are almost doing
better the mids and highs on both
speakers are about equally good with the
scale leaning a little towards the micro
in conclusion the Soundlink micro still
packs a great sound for its size and I
would still give this win to it if
portability is on top of your list you
just can't go wrong with it but if price
and stereo sound are what you're looking
for out of the 2x beat ends I'm still go
for it the only thing that you are
sacrificing by taking that route is
mainly portability what do you guys
think about you know the comparison I'd
like to hear what you have to say in the
comment section down below
please let me know what you think if you
liked the video leave it a like if you
didn't like it drop it a dislike I just
want to get some sort of feedback from
you because you watch the videos so why
not if you're new here please subscribe
so you don't miss out on the upcoming
videos thanks for watching
I love you all and I will see you in the
next one
ah I think I'm gonna need a knee massage
if that's even a thing
because who does not love stevia sound
love stevia sound love stevia sound</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
