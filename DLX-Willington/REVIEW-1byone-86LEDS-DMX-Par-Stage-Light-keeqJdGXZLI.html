we are taking a look at this led DMX
stage light met by one by one made by
one by one by one by one now this is the
kind of light that you'd find in a disco
on a performance stage wedding reception
areas and you know all that kind of
stuff but there's a couple cool things
about this particular one and number one
being it's an LED light and it comes
packed with 86 l it is which make it
bright but mainly it doesn't heat up and
saves you on power this light can also
be controlled using a four-channel
dmx512 controller but if you don't own
one you have a lot of pre-programmed
kite fix that you can control using
these controllers on the back of the
light it also has different sound
activated programs and I was actually
really impressed by how sensitive it is
to sound like right here I am just
speaking
it came with an instruction manual which
tells you about and how to achieve all
different color effects using the
controls on the back of the unit which
is good the build quality is pretty good
this is a solid all-metal construction
except for that clear plastic on the
front covering the LED wise the only
problem I had is these knobs that are
supposed to go all the way down and hold
the handle in place did not work for me
so I don't know if my knobs all the
holes they aren't going in a kind of
defective or not the same size or what
but it just didn't work for me I tried
as hard as I could but they would not go
in all the way to hold that handle in
place so now I know I can hack it and
you know figure out something and make
it work pretty easy but yeah I feel like
it should work without having to hack it
or something anyways general is picking
this is an awesome product i will leave
the link to it in the description
section below if you want to go check it
out on amazon and please do not forget
to comment like share and most
especially subscribe to my channel and I
will see you in the next video peace
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
