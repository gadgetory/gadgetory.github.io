the unboxing video of the Canon EF 50
millimeter f 1.8 2 standard autofocus
lens and nothing cool on the box as you
guys see we'll go ahead and just open it
and see what's in here it looks like a
bubble wrap the lens is wrapped up in a
bubble wrap what's this this is just I
think Manuel like probably how to care
for it and how to use it but the cool
stuff is this will go ahead and open it
take that off and never bag check this
one off too and there it is is plastic
you can you know definitely fill it but
it kind of feels pretty solid comes with
a front cop it comes with a back lens
cap to you know to protect it which is a
good thing looks pretty nice and you
know made of plastic it has an auto
focus on and off and it sounds like it
has a little bit of a rod oh let me take
this off and take this one off too maybe
yeah this is just a little bit of a
rattle in there but you can definitely
hear it but it's not like so big so I
don't think you'll be a problem and you
know focusing works pretty well mix some
sound but know that bad is something
that you can deal with you know for the
price you can't really complain if you
want something super high-end you can
always you know goodbye another on that
