welcome to another sound battle where we
let speakers speak for themselves in the
battlefield today we have the UE boom -
going up against the JBL flip 3 both
these two speakers are really really
good speakers with tons and tons of
features and it's always hard for people
to decide between these two speakers
which one to go with but with all that
features put it aside
how do they compare sound wise that's
why we're here to find out and don't
forget if you have a new speakers that
you'd like to see them battle here leave
them in the comment section below and
don't forget to subscribe because that's
the only way that you know when I upload
your requested video as usual the
speakers are six feet away from the
sound recorder and they are playing at
80 percent volume so without wasting any
more of your precious time put your
headphone his own and let the speaker's
speak
okay so the speakers have spoken my ears
have heard this is by judgment if you're
looking for the loudest of the two the
boom - is crazy loud like the flip three
does not come any closer to it and it
also has more pronounced myths compared
to the flip three but when it comes to
the highs I think both speakers handle
them pretty well in the lows however is
where the flip three shines I think this
is what JBL sacrificed the loudness for
if you listen to bass driven kind of
music the flip three is definitely what
you want of the two speakers it handles
the bass really really well compared to
the boom - and I like how the highs and
lows are separated pretty well for a
cleaner sound so as a base lover I would
go to the flip three what do you think
leave your comments down below and I'll
like if you liked the video and also I
want to say thank you to all my awesome
awesome subscribers thank you I really
really appreciate it and if you're not a
subscriber I invite you to subscribe to
my channel for your support thank you
for watching this one and I will see you
in the next one peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
