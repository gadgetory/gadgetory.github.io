welcome to another sound battle where we
let speakers speak for themselves in the
battlefield today we have the GT kxb 60
versus two SRS xB 30s playing in stereo
mode I'll be using a high quality
binaural microphone so for the best
experience please use headphones with
that said let's hear the speaker's speak
surprise surprise okay so the XP 60 is
louder than the two SRS XP 30s combined
and most especially at maximum volume it
sounds a lot more powerful than the two
XP 30s and that's it everything else as
far as sound the two SRS XP 30s are
doing a way better job they have better
highs which the XP 60 is horribly
missing and the myths are pronounced and
way better and the best oh my gosh it
makes you hate the XP 60 at least its
size while the XP 60 is pumping out up a
bitch like your business
I'm the - XP tourists are pumping out
real thick deep best it gets even better
if you play the speakers that lower
volume like 40 percent my say the XP 60
will sound like a cheap box radio well
as the two XP 30s will flood you with
mind-blowing best here's a sample of
that I moved the mic closer to the
speakers and recorded them playing at 40
percent volume take a listen
embarrassing right I feel like they
should have used the DSP on the XP 60 to
lift up the best a little bit at these
low volumes but apparently that was not
necessary for this battle the clear
winner is the two XV 30s they sound way
better not to mention the fantastic
stereo sound that you can only get with
two speakers
the only reason to take the XP 60 over
the two XP thirties is if your only
concern is loudness or you are planning
on using it I mean the XP 60 as a PA
system but if those are not your main
concerns get the two XP thirties they
are even more portable than the XP 60
what do you think I'd like to hear what
you have to say in the comment section
