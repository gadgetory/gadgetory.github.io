yeah so this is my studio it's kind of
boring right I have a lot of things I
want to do and improve in here but I
haven't gotten to them yet just because
we just haven't really been here for
that long and I have a lot of other
projects around the house that need to
need more attention and that kind of
taking priority but I wanted to start
working on something so today I just
kind of want to show you cuz I kind of
started working on that and I wanted to
show you yeah
the progress so welcome well I have
carpet in here which helps a little bit
with sound the walls are a little bit
too naked which encourage yourself to
just bounce right off of them and right
back into the recording microphone which
is not a good catalyst for the good
quality of recording so I'm trying to
take care of that a little bit step by
step now the plan is not to cover the
entire walls with acoustic foam and turn
the entire room into a sound booth and
no and the purpose here is to reduce the
amount of balanced sound that might be
contaminating the recordings that we do
in here due to how baggage and empty the
studio is in comparison to a regular
furnished room I'll be covering the
biggest percentage of each wall but not
the entire wall luckily when I was
looking on options of what I want to put
in here in which foam I should be
getting and what design and how I should
put it up there our resume offered to
help me out and they sent me acoustic
foam free of charge so thanks guys now
if you didn't know who they are they are
makers of all sorts of sound treatments
I'll put a link to their site so you can
check out their collection they have a
bunch of different colors and styles and
sizes if you do in a sort of recording I
recommend you go check them out they
actually have free acoustic foam towel
samples right now so go look at them
maybe order yourself some samples and
see if you like them I got red and black
pyramid design here and I'm going to be
putting up on these wall I'm gonna be
framing the foam here just because I
think it looks better than just a bare
foam border but this is not something
that you have to do but if you decide to
do something like this - as you make
your measurements make sure you account
for a little bit of size variation some
of my black tiles were about a quarter
inch bigger than the red ones and I know
the foam needs at least 48 hours to
fully get back to its size but these
have been given at least over a week so
I don't think that's the issue here and
it's not a huge deal but I thought I
would put it out there just so you know
and if you have to make in a sort of
cards I just use the miter saw and it
worked like a charm
um you can probably use scissors too but
I feel like it would be hard to get this
clean straight card with with scissors
straight cut straight card straight cut
straight cut yeah that's the word cut
straight cut when time to put up the
tailor's came which was the next day
after framing I used their sticky tape
to install most of the tiles onto the
wall and it seems to be holding pretty
well so far for the rest of the house I
used regular double-sided tape from the
store and it seems to be holding pretty
well to the form is fire retardant I put
it to a test and this was the outcome
for comparison I have this regular foam
here and as you can see here as soon as
the flame touches it it burns like whew
oh but on the other hand the acoustic
foam does not burn as easily it burns
but not as easily discouraged is fire
from spreading as fast as it does on the
regular foam so yes it is fire retardant
anyways with everything hanging up
secure this is how it turned out
I'm happy with the outcome and I'm
excited for how the room will look like
and sound when I get all the walls done
so go to this side check out what they
have and see what you might like and if
you decide you want something for
yourself use this code at check out and
you will get 10% of your total order
thanks for watching this one I will see
you in the next one peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
