today we're going to be taking a close
look at the new ether tea from habit and
they make quite a few other speakers but
this is their newest and my first from
them so we'll be taking a close look at
it and see what they are all about ok so
the packaging is not bad I think they
have a pretty good presentation of their
product
everything looks secure neat and not
cheap and once you get inside the box
you will find an audio cable a charging
cord a carabiner the paperwork stuff and
lastly the speaker itself and for size
differences in between the boom 3 and
the charge 3 coming in at just over 700
grams and looking around the speaker at
the front here is where you will find
all your basic control buttons as well
as the EQ of bass boost button the
speaker is also NFC compatible for easy
pairing and right at the front here is
also where you will find your NFC pad
and looking around the back here behind
this flap is where you will find a
microUSB port for charging the speaker a
USB type a port for charging your
power-hungry devices which is kind of
nice and you also find an auxiliary
input for people who like hard wired
music this is an IP x7 writer speaker
it's completely waterproof you can
submerge it into water and it will be
fine but as usual before you expose the
speaker to water always make sure this
flap is completely sealed off before you
do so otherwise water will get in there
and your speaker will go kaput you're
welcome the e30 is a 360 speaker running
2 55 minute drive errs it's ready to go
as low as 80 Hertz and it has a max
power output of
wacks it's running bluetooth 4.2 and you
can get up to 12 hours of playtime out
of it if you're poisoning at moderate
volumes but maximum volume with the
extra bass or best boost on your looking
probably at about 4 to 5 hours of
playtime and it will take you about four
hours to recharge a completely drained
battery a long press at the play button
here will launch Google or Siri
depending on what you use which is kind
of nice and using the same button if you
double tap that you can pair up to two
of them if you have another one and they
will play in stereo for a bigger more
engaging sound speaking of sound how
does it sound
how about I give you a sound sample I
will play one of them at first and then
I'll mix in all also connect to the
other the second speaker so we can hear
how they sound both of them in stereo
I love stereo so we will hear that as
usual I will be using a high quality
binaural microphone to record this so
for the best sound experience please use
headphones and with that said let's hear
the speakers speak
let's just break it down if you and me
Oh
and there you have it have it the sound
quality is not bad
it has good highs and good means and the
bass is also okay
am I saying okay because once I saw the
speaker its size I was expecting it to
sound at least like I'm talking about
best I was extremely the best to be kind
of like the charge 3 but it turns out
the charge 3 actually does a little bit
of a better performance in the best
Department and I know it's a little bit
boosted on there but at the same time it
goes deeper than this guy here can now
that does not mean that the speaker the
bass is horrible on here no in fact the
bass is not as deep as the charge 3 but
it's way better than the more expensive
boom 3 so it is a good sounding speaker
and also the stereo oh my gosh that
sounds so good when you have 2 of these
if you're planning on getting these and
you have money getting 2 would be my
choice putting two of these on the side
one on each side of your work desk or
something like that this would sound
amazing you can get two colors these are
the only colors you can get and
basically the only thing that changes
color is this flap right on here so yes
but they are good sounding speakers let
me know what you think about the sound
of the e30 in the comment section below
thank you very much for watching and I
want to say I want to shout out to have
it of sending me these guys here if you
liked the video leave a like if you
didn't like it leave a dislike I just
want to get some sort of feedback from
you because you watched the video thank
you again for watching I will see you in
the next video peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
