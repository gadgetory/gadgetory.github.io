another unboxing today we are unboxing
the fire TV stick so that's the front of
the box it's nothing on this side
there's a couple words a little bit of
specs about it right there and nothing
on that side on here it's you know like
that like that and they will show you or
the supported streaming apps all of that
come you know pre-loaded on that I like
this the design of the box and right
here is the seal we break that this is
how the box looks like and we'll go
ahead and open it Wow look at that
that looks cool i like the d'box angle
this let's go emotes right there three
Chinese this in your hand dell logo
right there amazon and here's a strike
itself it's the power this is what goes
into your TV so also fairly small right
down in here what else we have does your
menu i believe and more information
about your new thing boy this is the
cable the power cable for this guy right
here and this is an hdmi extension so i
say your TV's right on the wall the hdmi
port is on the wall they give you this
extension so you can plug it in and you
know do that all you know where ever i
might be convenient for you to give that
to you so you can use it and this is the
wall charger plug into the wall then you
plug this USB to mini USB to micro USB
into your charging just like you're fun
and you're given two batteries I think
these are for your remote so I think
that will laid out nice they did a good
job at this
I think that's all of it actually plus
all that comes with it so we have all
that and this really filming this is a
battle to okay okay right there but it's
not labeled or anything no what's on
there so you just you fair way I like it
to have that label right there amazon so
