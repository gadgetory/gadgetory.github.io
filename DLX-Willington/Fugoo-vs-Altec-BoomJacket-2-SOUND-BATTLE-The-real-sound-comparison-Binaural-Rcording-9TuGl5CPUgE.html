welcome to another found battle where
will it speakers speak for themselves in
the Butterfield's - do we have the
sugeun task versus the outtake boom
jacket - remember if there are speakers
that you'd like to see them battle here
leave them in the comment section below
and I will get to them as soon as
possible
and when you do that don't forget to
subscribe because that's the only way
that you will know when I upload your
requested videos anyways the speakers of
5 feet away from a high quality binaural
microphone and they are playing at 80
percent volume for the best experience
here
right off the bat as far as sound
quality I like what I get from the food
it's a well balanced speaker overall it
has a lower frequency response compared
to the boom jacket - which means you'll
be able to hear deeper bass notes which
is which is good the boom jacket - has
slightly better meat and it's a lot
louder the most disappointing thing
about the fugu is how quiet it is
compared to the speakers in its size
range
like honestly Isuzu is about as loud as
this JBL go a tiny speaker like I'm not
kidding
the speaker itself sounds good like as
far as sound quality it's better than
the boom jacket - it's a well balanced
speaker but I just can't seem to get
past how quiet it is
I've actually wondered if it's a
defective speaker or something if you
are a lot of volume listen and you plan
on being mostly indoors the fugu will
work for you it actually sounds pretty
good but if you are the opposite of that
go with the boom jacket - that's just
what I would do like it if you liked it
drop me a comment down below and don't
forget to subscribe if you're new here
I'm thanks for watching I will see you
in the next one peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
