another review and today we are looking
at a rough power a power bank from the
turbo plus series with most smartphones
losing removable battery future and at
the same times phones needing much much
more power than ever before the only
solution is to have some extra power
around if you plan on spending a night
away from home or somewhere where an
outlet might be a problem to find now
depending on your needs capacity judging
speed and durability of things you
always want to consider while buying one
of these guys this guy we're looking at
today here has a capacity of two hundred
thousand one hundred mill amp and has
quick search 3.0 technology which can
charge a quick shut 3.0 capable device
up to 80% in 30 minutes now that's fast
this technology was released in the last
quarter of 2015 by Qualcomm and is the
latest fastest charging speed as of
today depending on when you're watching
this the unboxing experience was as
expected everything came contained and
rubbed pretty well and in the box you
get the paperwork stuff two microUSB
cables one short and one long they
coming back which by the way feels nice
and cushioning and finally the power
bank the first thing you will notice
right out of the box is that this guy is
pretty big and heavy it's thirteen point
two ounces or 375 grams but that might
be expected considering the capacity of
the bank now I saw the pictures on
Amazon before placing my order but I was
hoping that it would look a little bit
better in person but I was a little bit
disappointed by the design of the power
bank that's just me from the feel of it
the build quality throws ok I know they
are trying to keep the cost of the
product
whoa but I still think the direct
service batteries feel a lot beefier now
don't get me wrong this still feels
solid but if you have both of these you
will definitely feel the difference
right away
now with all my disappointments out of
the way this is still my favorite
battery pack it's the only one of its
kind on the market right now as I make
this video there's only one button on
here and the only thing I've used it is
to see how much juice is left on the
battery and that's it and right next to
the button you find the battery
indicator LED lights they are four and
each represents 25% of the battery and
around the corner we find an isolate
port capable of fast charging up to 2.4
amps
a quick Church 3.0 port which is
backward compatible with quick charge
2.0 and this same port also works as an
eye smart port nice next to this is the
USB type-c port which is both an input
and output port if you are using USB
type-c and lastly a microUSB port for
charging the battery using quick charge
3.0 charger or a regular charger and it
looks like there was no room for a
flashlight this time sorry flashlight
lovers I was able to recharge my LG g3
which has a 3,000 buried for over six
times using this power bank and using
the regular speed to recharge the
battery you took about nine hours to be
back to 100%
rough power claims it should only take
four and a half hours to recharge the
battery fully if you use a quick charge
3.0 charger but I have years to test it
that I don't own a quick charge 3.0
charger but I have one on the way so I
will put my findings somewhere on the
screen and in the description section
once I test it out anyways this is a
competitively priced power bank
besides the cheap plastic fails yes it
is plastic and it feels like it this is
a good future proof high capacity power
pack
that I would recommend to anyone who
travels a lot plays a lot of games on
tablets and phones and anyone who goes
camping leave your thoughts down below
suggest the power bank or Bluetooth
speaker that you would like to see me
review and don't forget is support by
subscribing liking my facebook page
liking this video and I will see you in
the next one peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
