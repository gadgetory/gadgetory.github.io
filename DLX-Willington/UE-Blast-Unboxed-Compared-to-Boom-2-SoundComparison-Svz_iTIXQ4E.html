welcome to this unboxing I don't think
I've done any unboxing in 2017 so before
the year ends once I received this thing
it just came in today I was like well
maybe I should share this and be my my
first video in 2017 of unboxing except
for this time we'll be doing and it
sounds simple and also kind of comparing
it to the UE boom - now I'm not sure I
can't say for sure about I don't think
that is going to be a boom 3 I think
this is what's replacing the UE or
rather successor of the boom - but as
far as I know that's still making them
so I don't know maybe we'll see a boom 3
but I don't I don't think so I don't
know II don't think so so we're gonna be
going ahead and opening this up
we all know UE
is really really good at packaging their
speakers they do a really really good
job so far I feel like I feel like that
the best in all the speakers the way
they package them they look they package
them so nice sometimes you find plastic
in there like nice colorful pretty
colorful and they're like I said look at
that it's not the best I think I like
the way they package their the boom the
boom - and the mega blast no the mega
boom I like that better than this but
still look at that packaging everything
just fits fits pretty good and I got ya
I got this color the white
I don't remember is it white I think
thing that yeah it is white all you have
lifting here is the charging brick micro
USB cord paperwork stuff in there and I
feel like there should be more paperwork
that's like tiny yep right there so
right off the bat I feel like I kind of
like the way they design this like
they've taken away the bezels that were
on the older speaker they Boone I think
I should grab this so we can okay so I
found it I mean I still have the
container or the packaging this is how
the boom to was packaged did you like
that this is a lot better than what they
did we did with the blast but that was
too good but look at this this is really
cool it's plastic and then you just open
it like that
so this is the boom - right here take it
out but look at that packaging I still
have I never used this I usually just
leave all the power Briggs and the cords
and everything I usually just leave them
because I have so many of them laying
around
unless something like the Sony speakers
I hate those because they don't have
they don't use they don't use the
regular cords so you have to use the
coasts that come with them so and every
time I have to charge them I have to get
them out and I hate them for that if
they could only change to micro USB or
USB see that will be cool anyways the
blast is a little bit bigger than the
boom - and if you can see but it is a
little bit bigger
and then the height to it is a little
bit taller I don't know if you can see
that very well but yeah so but I think I
like the the design of this how it's
just like square and now like bit off
but it's basically the same design
though the other difference here is this
one has the out met ears logo right
there well as on these ones here they
only did the Yui right there and the top
looks like that the bottom is basically
the same - yeah what you find on here
basically not much you'll find a
indicator light right there and the
power button the volume rockers here
plus and sounds promising
and then down here like I said this is
where you'll find your charging port
micro USB and then this is you can hook
it up to stuff like to hang it places so
I think the main thing here that we're
going to be trying to see what the
difference is is sound quality between
the two or how good and how bad it is
so I I'll probably shake out the exiting
but probably not in this video
because I don't want to go through the
setup I just want to hear how they sound
like so let's get a sample of that
and there you have it now as far as
sound there is not really a huge
difference in sound performance between
these two speakers there's a little bit
of better performance of better best
performance mainly on the blasts here
compared to the boom - but it's not like
really really big it's really really
small best database performance on this
guy here and maybe the highs - a little
bit better if you compare them to the
boom - but that's basically it
the difference is really really small I
feel like the main main difference
between these two speakers is Alexa
that's the main difference the voice I'm
the Alex voice control that's the main
main difference between the two and also
not to mention that they are promising
new 15 hours of play time on this guy
but only 12 hours of play time on this
bigger speaker so I think they just had
to make room for Alexa components
whatever I don't know and I also am also
heard that there's a little bit of a
better studio separation on this speaker
I'm not sure why because I feel like
they have the same driver layout but for
some reason I was hearing it better
severe separation on this one compared
to the boom - so that's another thing
the boom - is a little bit louder than
the blast by about 2 dB but at maximum
volume the boom - is way more distorted
than the blast so yeah if you guys want
a more detailed sound comparison between
the two hit me up in the comment section
below and let me know otherwise tell me
what speakers you would like to see the
blast battle against I'm planning on
picking up there that the boom blast the
bigger one - this one I almost got it
but things away expenses that I didn't
have the money at the moment so in about
a couple weeks or so I'll be peaking
that
up to so we can take a look at it I
don't expect much from it after hearing
this I feel like it's going to sound
close to the boom today which one mega
blast no the mega boom the mega boom I
feel like this that mega blast is going
to sound close to the mega boom so I
think that's what it's gonna be but let
me know which speakers you'd like to see
the blasts go up against in the comment
section below
thanks for watching if you haven't
subscribed yet please go ahead and do
that do that like the video if you liked
it dislike it if you didn't like it
I just want to get some kind of feedback
from you guys this kind of helps me
learn and know what I'm doing right
anyway I don't know
so yeah that's been it for this video
thanks for watching again I will see you
in the next video peace those are my
kids
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
