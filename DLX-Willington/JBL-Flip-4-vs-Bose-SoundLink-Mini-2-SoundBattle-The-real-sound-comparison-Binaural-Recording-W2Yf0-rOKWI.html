and welcome to another sound battle
well that speakers speak for themselves
in the battlefield today we have one of
the most requested videos in the first
couple weeks and that's the flip for
going up against the Soundlink mini - on
a side note if you're new here please
make sure you subscribe it really helps
out a lot in this battle the speakers of
five feet are webform and high quality
by new of microphone and are playing at
80% volume for a more realistic sound
experience please put your headphones on
and let's hear the speaker's speak hold
on girl now wait a minute I've got some
dendiface oh oh I'm happy to make down
oh yeah you have to win me
oh but I have to be me never once the
anger in this place
now I don't know about you guys but this
is a tight one both speakers sound
pretty good but like some people
mentioned or point out in the comment
sections of my previous videos the highs
on a flip for a little bit on the harsh
side the highest on and we need to
actually sound better on the other hand
this might be hard for you guys to
notice but with a bunch of songs that I
listen to in preparation for this video
I noticed that there is a little bit of
vibration going on with the Mini 2 in
the bass department if you listen
closely but it's not something an
average consumer will really care about
or even notice what I said I do like how
both speakers sound the difference is
not really that much the highs on the
flip fold can easily be fixed with an EQ
but for this battle I'll give you two
the Mini 2 just because you won't need
an EQ to get decent highs out of it the
speakers are about the same when it
comes to loudness but I still let the
main deciding factor between these two
if you're trying to get one is going to
be price and features which one would
you take of this two and why let me know
down below if you are just passing by
and found this video please consider
subscribing and becoming part of what we
are doing here
I hope you liked the video if you did
don't forget to give it a like and feel
free to share it thanks for watching
this one I will see you in the next one
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
