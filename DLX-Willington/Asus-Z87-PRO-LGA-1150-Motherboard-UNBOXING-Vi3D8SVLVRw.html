research on what I want to build I
decided to go with a z87 pro series
motherboard and since I have it now
let's go ahead and unbox it and see what
comes inside at the bag they just have a
picture of the motherboard is soft right
there just to show you ports and
different stuff that you know the matter
but oh how the mother but looks like
just in case you in the store just
looking at it you know to give you a
glimpse of it maybe we'll make you buy I
don't know but then here they say seht
dool intelligent processors 444 with
4-way optimization Wi-Fi go and a little
bit about it USB bios flash back and a
little bit about it and USB 3.1 and a
little bit about it and on the sides
just not really much going on here other
than their big huge logo or the name of
the the motherboard itself so I'm more
interested in what's inside so why don't
we go ahead and open this baby and see
what comes inside a motherboard so
that's it right there that's the mother
boat that we expecting to see so let's
go ahead just a very first thing on top
and that's it right there hmm that looks
cool all right let's pull this out aside
for a moment go ahead and see what's
inside here it's just a box
garbage all right here z87 pro user
guide so you have a huge box book right
here to wait and see and one about your
motherboard right here you have the
cover for the back of your CPU the case
where the motherboard sticks out so this
is like the cover for it and this is the
Wi-Fi ego thing and a couple solid
cables so I cables this is the intel z87
chipset support DVD so and it looks like
on here is the same one for z87 deal XD
87 expert and z87 pro so anyone who buys
that you're going to get the same
deviate too that's cool on the SOI
connector and some pins here not sure
what this arm but i'm pretty sure why
i'm going to find out this is my first
time building a pc i forget what they
are cold by hey there they are and you
have a z87 series exclusive exclusive
features so i think this is going to be
telling you specifically about the dual
intelligent processor for Wi-Fi go card
and Wi-Fi go user guide and there it is
and the box is empty hmm that's cool so
this is the baby right here yep that's
what comes in the box go ahead and see
all subscribe to my channel and watch
all the other stuff that I've already
unboxed and you know everything that is
going to be going into this computer you
can find it on my channel and watch all
my unboxing so go ahead and
subscribe to my channel go through my
channel and look at what I have there
you might find some stuff interesting
