let's see soon oh nothing okay no what
is this B and O clinic
it seems nice thank you do you play p6 I
suppose disease I'm toaster so let's
open this as you know meters above the
off key so let's try opening this box
here like this yeah typical for Bengals
and very elegant toaster shock Murphy
took my toaster
so it looks a little bit like some
toaster or I'm not quite sure maybe in
black not so much but it's also
available in silver I hope we can listen
you are listening through a binaural
artificial head so you should listen
headphones do this let's try connecting
here the Macondo sandy toast notice 299
thumb comes Valero's let's see if it's
here not yet so now pairing mode so
Dominique Mia hi here it is and then
recurs to leave it so far yeah there is
not much on the net let's try to read
from princess freesia and focus on a
sunset city
as a music toaster
so obviously yeah it's an election
sticker all this exterior see fit the
clothes Evers maybe not that exciting
but not feel locked in either so problem
with Benghazi's yeah that their products
are pretty pricey so 399 the same price
of the FIFA Elson key although we can
get it for much cheaper current I think
meanwhile even 270 so a little bit
smaller maybe but also better price
like this
place what was recorded while some
tricks
I'm not sure
mom Hani's bicha just let shadow me stop
now all the Chinese economy is legally
no Claire
sound situation but also the same sound
from area was
some hockey
here is some basic Jackson says no one
ever more pain pathetic mass-produced
name written quickly in something for
that
so I think for a first impression yeah I
was hoping it would be a bit more true
to the original song it's nice
definitely great sounding speaker but
$3.99 a bit a bit rickety here just
offsets to the him the eruption has done
Doncaster Aveda so I think for 399 it's
a bit overpriced also not sure about the
battery life this has to be tested
someone claim that it's better than from
the a1 or a2 I also think it sounds
better than the a tool without this
artificial tuning it with the strange
honking it's classical music was
something completely artificial so this
one sounds quite natural particular
against the FIFA it was still not there
it's brilliant high levels where the
FIFA keeps all dynamics all transients
there is some house walls it has some
bass reduction that ESP obviously tries
to hear to not come into distortion
while the FIFA can't is thought of
course so then you would have to put it
to neutral mode I played it in later
late night now so it's quite nice
speaker below one kilogram so I think
similar weights to the boss I think the
boss is he was slightly heavier but I'm
not that impressed let's say I mean not
hundred percent I would hope I would
have hoped it to offer a more true sound
also dynamically and it was base
reduction became quite obvious also
treble was pushed too much but yeah stay
tuned for a full review thanks a lot for
watching and see you the next have a
nice time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
