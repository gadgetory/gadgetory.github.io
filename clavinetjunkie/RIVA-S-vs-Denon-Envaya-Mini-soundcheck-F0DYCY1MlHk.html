like to check out how the Reba s
compares against the denim and via mini
some were already asking for this
comparison and I had lots of praise for
this speaker last year I still think
it's really great especially regarding
its size and price the Rio s is quite a
bit more expensive but unlike many
others because like the Bose Soundlink
me know that JBL charge - these two are
more tuned for hi-fi I mean these are
for more for purists while the other
ones are probably more for kiddies who
like bass and treble and yeah pumping
sound so I think these two are pretty
comparable and I thought we will check
them out how they sound I will put them
up like this to really sit centered that
denim is famous for its great soundstage
for its stereo effects and so on it uses
some psycho acoustic stellar processing
from Max audio the River s has its own
trillium processing and as always I am
of course using binaural microphones so
please listen with headphones otherwise
you won't get really true results I set
them at slightly above half volume so my
voice appears a bit louder than this
because in reality please keep that in
mind I will start with the river s first
and then switch over to the Denon in
Miami let's have a listen
you
yes okay I think you can hear that the
den on still has a slightly more open
sound but it's also more directional I
will I will go off slightly and the
river remains well more solid sounding
while the entire mini loses quite a bit
treble also if I stand more to the site
or two behind
yeah it still sounds okay while there
and buy a mini simply became dual you
have to sit inside the sweet spot to get
the best sound
let's visit another crack and I will
reduce volume to simulate more well
lower listening situation
yet despite some differences in overall
frequency response they sound both
pretty full-bodied and on Miami no
maybe we can fry this around here it
also opens the sound more I will
increase volume again
and now the reverse also has some kind
of ambience with the serum Oh
Oh
yeah many people complain that I don't
play anything classical well I'm not
that classic type of listener I prefer
jazz but I thought we will play a kind
of mix let's have a listen to this again
Riva is first
your upright bass is pretty hard to
render for such small speakers let's see
what is now the denominators it comes
with Masha the bass is missing this
definition from the river
here you can hear every note clean I
will turn off surround again for the
river
yeah it's more closed now
has already mentioned the special of the
demo Remi is the sound stage you get
let's listen to this to the next song
which is a riff from from an LP which
has lots of stereo effects left right
you can maybe hear the drums more to the
right and so on but this effect is much
more pronounced with a denim you'll hear
the drums somewhere here this is pretty
impressive
yeah this is more focused in sadness
around maybe
but this effect collapses if I move my
head slightly out of you hear the drums
went from the right
and now they are again inside the
speaker while when I sit here I can hear
them somewhere here so you really have
to sit inside the sweet spot while with
the revised doesn't make much difference
how are you seated simply yeah although
that staring effect is not as pronounced
as you can hear
we can try it again with Pink Floyd's
money which has really extreme left
right this is the Riva s now and the
same with the demo later there is left
the other one this is at the right
but now let's have a listen to the me it
is more pronounced
but again as soon as you move the head
out of the axis this effect disappears
you really have to sit inside the sweet
spot for it to notice yeah
let's listen to a jazz version of the
same song again lots of bass
not a denim they are also my sound stage
but again as soon yeah it collapses
inside the speaker
with some songs the surround really
works wonders in this case the river is
also more open I would say this is the
demo
without Sarang
this isn't enough
what I like with the realize that it
also sounds great sorry this was the
table of my son also from of exes
while then denim becomes quite a bit
tool you really have to stand in yeah
like this you hear that the sound
changes a lot when I move my head not a
river
this is our Santa hanging there
yeah
also slightly from behind
while the denim becomes really do let's
try something else again here you can
hear it the sound simple changes you
relieve this up to focus drivers and you
get some some face problems even the
reward remains completely stable again I
think this was also the reason why CAF
decided to go for mono with the muir
because two drivers
always have some face problems with high
frequencies very wise different it has
two drivers to the sides on here and
there is no cancellation nothing no
interference
let's try no something more loose rock
or something
and
you can also hear that bass has more
power on that realize it's simply deeper
let's listen to well something more
electronic and I will start to increase
volume later on to maximum
there you can already hear that down on
slightly struggling and I will increase
volume off
Bopha plymouth maximum Oh
the denim becomes a bikini the amount of
advances really obvious
let's listen to some kind of fusion also
hope at maximum
yeah I hope this was clear and could
give you a first idea about these two
speakers um that Ellen is still great I
mean it doesn't make it a bad speaker
but the battery is much better on the
river it also has more features I mean
you can pair it with another one for
stereo you can charge external devices
and so on I measured the River s with
our five hours at maximum which you see
a pretty solid the Denon will play for
about two hours maybe two thirty was the
maximum I was able to squeeze out of it
it's still a very decent speaker and
it's 100 bucks cheaper than the US but I
think the revised is also in the class
of its own on its own of its own I think
here again this cover protector here and
now you can take it to the beach or
something and yeah have fun so yeah
thanks for watching I don't know maybe
we'll go compare the river against the
JBL church to next time maybe also
another comparison against a post
something media otherwise I think we are
we are through it and yeah I hope you
liked it and yeah see us in the next
video have a nice time and bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
