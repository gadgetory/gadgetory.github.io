JBL pulse tool and I already regretted
that I haven't presented it before my
wife and my son both fell in love with
the speaker my wife even claimed that
this is the best speaker I've owned so
far and I really owned many more than
hundred she also claimed that this is
the only speaker she would have ever
bought it's not only because of the
sound quality but particularly because
of the nice light effects it has if we
look at the packaging this is already
pretty unique it has some kind of
lenticular effect if you tilt the box
you'll you see that there are some
moving effect so really nicely done and
this the special of that pulse is of
course it's light show let's turn it on
and I will darken the room slightly so
that we can see this better so what you
see here is the fire effect the effects
can of course be changed directly
through the speaker with this light
button here this is the Stars effect or
the speaker of course comes with an own
app the JBL connect app which is also
used for all the other JBL speakers I
hope it's visible and here we have the
JBL pulse tool and we can switch between
different effects for example fire again
you also have different options for each
effect I can make it larger this is the
large version we can make that fire even
smaller and some effects come with an
own sound effect as well here is the
fire effect it sounds like that yeah if
we turn on volume turn up volume or down
you can see it shows you the correct
loudness level then we have of course
rain
also with different effects this is
light rain medium rain or heavy rain we
have how is this column English
fireflies yeah what here we can paint
them then we have stars and I think it's
really pretty nice you can use the
speaker simply as some kind of ambient
light or something you can also I think
what can be done here here meet yours
what we have the fireworks this comes
without sound of course what's nice
about the fireworks effect is that you
can if you do more two more you can see
a heart appearing yeah you can see it
here or there is a scent clock yeah this
is not that impressive but you can even
hasn't a timer we have five meter I
don't know what happens after five
minutes if it turns off or something
then we have traffic and an on canvas
where you can
well paint but it doesn't work that well
because the resolution of the of these
LED lights is not but you can see if we
try painting across it should appear
more or less as cross well it doesn't
look that well and after some time it
disappears again but let's try let's try
again maybe a heart it's not that easy
come on yeah
let's see if we it's not that visible or
you cannot recognize it as hard and of
course all these effects don't are not
synchronized with music they simply play
back like that but of course we have
also an equalize effect and this of
course works well with music I mean it
is more or less sync in sync also here
we can make it either small or large
there is a wave effect as well which is
also in sync with the music more or less
so the effects are really really nice
and as I already said my wife tends to
use it simply as an ambient light
without any music and I think it works
really well
it can glow for several hours like this
there is another gadget it can it can
pick up colors it has an on camera here
it also has some kind of motion sensor
if I if I shake it the effect becomes
different we can try this with for
example with fire you see the effect
Changez let's see what happens with rain
this is heavy rain I think no this is
light rain no let's shake it again and
we get some kind of thunderstorm maybe I
don't know but the problem of the
speaker is like with some other JBL
products my wife already complained that
this is the lowest volume step and yeah
now it's off and the lowest volume step
is simply too loud she wanted to use it
for relaxing after Sona but it didn't
work for her she she complained that it
was simply too loud and she used another
speaker and also of course the turn on
turn off tones I mean if you want to use
this as a light at night it's it's it's
too loud I mean you cannot turn it on
because this tribum is simply yeah too
loud and too distracting I would at
least have wished some option within the
app to turn off to be able to disable
these stones because they are
unnecessary but JBL seems not to care a
lot about customer wishes so this these
are the only complaints about this
speaker that the lowest volume step is
not low enough and the welcome tones are
simply too loud
I will lighten the room slightly again
and the most interesting part of course
is how it sounds and I thought will
compare the pulse tool against the JBL
charge tool and against the JBL flip 3
all of the same family and to tell the
truth I was surprised how natural the
JBL pulse sounds especially compared
against the JBL charge to if we have a
look at the frequency response
measurement you can see that it measures
nearly like a flatline there is no
artificial base emphasis while base
which is even slightly deeper than on
the JBL charge tool and there is no
stronger treble peak but the treble can
appear sometimes a bit wheeled I think
this is because of the LEDs that are
probably in front of the drivers and
also there is probably some some
some material that you can actually see
them glow so the treble may appear
sometimes a bit will especially at low
levels but as soon as you crank them a
little bit higher the treble is there
it's also louder than the JBL charge
tool with more bass or let's say not
more bass but with less compression and
simply a more natural sound therefore as
always I will be using my binaural
microphones and the head cam so we can
listen to them live please listen with
headphones and yeah let's check them out
first let's have a look at the JBL pulse
2 in the JBL charge tool although both
are probably based on exactly the same
drivers in the same design I simply
think that the JBL charge 2 is more
tuned for bass and treble and this extra
punch while the JBL pass 2 is more meant
for a natural and flatter frequency
response that JBL judge 2 can be placed
like this or vertically while the pulse
2 should rather be placed vertically it
has its center of gravity below so it
shouldn't wobble around but the sound
will be emitted upwards only so I will
place it like this and the JBL charge 2
like that let's have a listen to some
songs starting with the JBL pulse tool
JB a charge tool yes you can hear some
extra punch with the bass and more
treble but apart from that bass sounds
pretty similar but you can already hear
compression starting with the charge
tool it tries to keep pace always loud
making the whole song software
and the pulse remains more politic
this isn't another song sole persona he
had more trouble more bills and also a
bit more compression dynamic profession
you can see what happens if we increase
volume slightly I will go up two notches
here and two notches on the chart as
well
the
Hey
yeah let's try another song also from
savasana the charge tool you can already
hear the sound phase quite a bit I mean
the bass is still there and but the
dynamics is already screwed up slightly
you found all the space heavy but this
song remains simply more natural like
listen to this and I will increase
volume even more we have two notches
below maximum
the touch too as well
you can already hear the song times
maybe let's try some rock
and I will increase both to maximum
the church too as well
you can hear the difference pretty
welliton
and
we cannot quite keep up with the pace
and everything let's try another song
you can also have a look how good both
he spares the sound to the sides with
this saw the difference now this is not
bad that's strong we can try another
house track JB attached to here you can
hear more punch also probably due to the
strong dynamics processing which tries
so
to keep some base from pick
now let's try the JBL flip 3 instead and
you will probably notice that both
sounds still pretty similar although the
pulse tool has a fuller and a bit more
mature sound I will play a kind of jazzy
bossa nova track starting with the pulse
tool so please have a listen
let's try something else and I will
again increase volume to maximum both we
have the flip phrase louder but loses or
in space start something else
I will try mixing bowl which means
lowering the volume of the clip three
slightly so both but the Astros still
sounds polar action
so here everyone who likes the JBL flip
3 sofa will also love the JBL pass - as
it sounds a bit fuller and more mature
not so sure about all the JBL charge -
lovers as the pulse - misses this extra
punch from their charge tool but it has
a more natural sound I think and doesn't
distort or compress and even at high
levels it sounds still pretty convincing
so yeah I hope this could give you a
first idea about the pulse - I think
it's a great speaker this overall
package including this lightning effects
it's pretty convincing I mean you can
also link more of them and make some
light show
not sure if many will really buy several
of these because but already one is
pretty pretty nice I think my wife and
my son both love it and use it all the
time
the battery is great although due to the
Lightning of course it drains a bit
faster I think you should get around 8
to 10 hours at normal listening levels
its maximum probably much less so I hope
you like this video not sure about the
next one I thought about doing the GG mm
m4 speaker test but I wanted to go
outside for this but currently it's so
horrible wet and cold so I will probably
have to wait until then have a nice time
and bye bye
you
now let's try the
bleep three instead and you will
probably notice that the JBL pulse to
catch a strike now let's try the JBL
flip three instead and you will probably
notice that the JBL pulse - sounds
pretty similar although a bit fuller and
more mature I will start playing with
some kind of jay-z
bossa nova track again starting with the
JBL pulse - so let's have a listen
what attentively done I will start
playing some kind of Jesse bossa nova
track starting with the JBL pass stool
so please have a listen psychosis media
now let's try the JBL flip three instead
and you will probably notice that the
pulse 2 and flick 3 sound pretty similar
although the pulse tool has a bit more
made Mukesh has dragged now let's try
the JBL flip 3 instead and you will
probably notice that the pulse 2 and
flip 3 sound pretty similar although the
pulse 2 has a fuller and a bit more
mature sound I will start playing some
kind of jazzy bossa nova track starting
with the pulse 2 so please have a listen
Psicosis meet the visage busto next ohoo
and peacock shosanna now let's try the
JBL flip 3 instead and you will probably
notice that their flip 3 and pulse to

nova track starting with the pulse tool
so please have a listen
ok fuzzy stand or by horses now let's
try the JBL flip 3 instead and you will
