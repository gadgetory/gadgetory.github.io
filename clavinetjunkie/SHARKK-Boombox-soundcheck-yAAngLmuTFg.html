boombox boombox speaker this is a little
speaker with lots of hype around it if
looking at Amazon there are 2,500
customer reviews and nearly all of them
are positive I mean but with with
ratings like this you can't beat the
volume functionality awesome speak up
full range and tremendous price well you
expect something really outstanding
I mean it's built like a tank that's
true it looks a bit like a jam box I
mean this grid pattern is outdated what
I would call it but sound quality wise
well I was not impressed I mean it's
it's not bad but it's just like all the
other average speakers you can get for
30 40 $50 nowhere close to the
higher-end models so I thought we should
have a listen how it compares for
example against that JBL flip umm the
JBL flip flip is not a bass heavy
speaker
but I mean it it wipes the floor with
the shock let's have a listen I will
start with the shark boombox
this is about 2/3 volume another flip
give you a fuller sound
for this we can see how long they play
at maximum I will turn it to the maximum
another flip
yeah a shark was louder but it was also
more distorted but has already said the
flip is not a very bass heavy speaker
it's not rather balanced so let's have a
listen how it compares against well one
of them maybe best speakers with this
size and price range the JBL charge tool
and let's try this track
let's try something smoother this is a
more high quality recording unlike all
those electronic well weird stuff that I
play just for these crazy guys who
really listen to that kind of music
but you can hear every instrument a
recording is top-notch not a charge to
again well there is its meat meat fork
you know bass especially if you turn
down volume a little bit let's listen it
well close to half level it becomes
really thin sounding
so meanwhile you can get it I think for
50 maybe 60 dollars that's not much but
I think there are so many other speakers
out there that the shark
boom box doesn't deserve all this hype I
mean it's not bad but here it's written
frequency frequency response 60 to 20
kilohertz but that's not really it
cannot play 60 I mean it's already rolls
off below 100 so all these ratings are a
bit well back I mean it's not a bad
speaker but it's not this little wonder
all the others are trying to make you
think it is so I hope this was helpful
yeah thanks for watching see you in the
next video and bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
