impatient about me to compare the JB and
sleep four against the JBL charge three
but I think they are not quite meant to
be compared look at the size difference
the charge case definitely twice as
because even bigger than the flipfold
and also found is quite a bit different
that flip for maybe you could already
hear it from my previous videos has some
bias towards clarity it's really some
really detailed playing speaker while
the charge 3 has some bias toward space
I think they would really play great
together when connected unfortunately so
far connected glass is not compatible
with the old Kinect but the JDL
translation should get an update phone I
hope I have no info when this will come
but hopefully we can listen to them also
at once but yet before having a listen
maybe let's check out some frequency
response measurement and you can see
they flip for again and this measurement
is exactly on axis with the drivers
while this measurement is with the
drivers aiming upward so many degrees
off-axis
it's still pretty clear although there
is some travelers it's still clearer
than a Bose Soundlink mini - for example
you can see it here and if we overlay
the JBL charge screen here you can see
that where the charge tree has some deep
the flip force has a boost here so the
difference in trouble between these two
is really pretty severe when looking at
the base you consider that it's actually
which is quite a bit deeper also more
boosted base more upper base and it also
manages to keep the base for quite a bit
longer so at high levels you get much
more base while they sleep for the
juices or start to use base already at
half volume game now of course we would
like to know how they sound so as always
yet please listen headphones is I'm
using binaural microphones the head cam
should give you a kind of first
impression and I will start with the
flipfold first volume is around half
maybe
and as Jesse blues on strike or
something the touchscreen I think you
can hear that simply much clearer and
their tracks free but the case is not as
little powerful or the punch is similar
let's try an outright is a bit more
treble heavy recording
but as I told you we can aim they sleep
for upwards and it will still sound
quite clear so if you small also more
Assam election on now
so they are really more compelling on
what we could also do is maybe place it
completely backward and I think it's
different okay compared to the chat
$3,000,000 track focus on are they
laying backwards now you can hear much
fuller base of a deeper base here at the
treble is you can feel slightly clearer
on all of the street force playing Equus
bus is static sound right there is
nothing wrong with the trailer so I will
again any more upwards because there
could be ended tables but it stops by
thousands now
yes now the track really comes from acid
again if an effect from focus on and you
can hear it with such recordings that
leave for definitely has an edge this
starting right on right the base is
quarter but all the way down terrific
training like this it might be slightly
to revelry and difference becomes really
obvious here
come on track it depends a lot what kind
of music you listen to if you like also
analytic electronica heavy bass in front
the chattery is crazy method choice but
for normal music that we produce feel
more balanced and city to clarity all
three
it appears very very detailed while
still having an update will come from
dancing but not a solar cell has
look I think it's also great for
occasion hopefully
Etruscan you can hear this no I'm not a
Filipino
so here's a Decker base of the trustees
not an advantage but I would say the
clarity of that report if you can better
result is this there is some punch but
not as strong as with a charge we listen
to the face from here and here maybe
increase voting slightly I will walk
around but also listen here from behind
the sleep for still sound okay while
again this is not quite reasonable
so let's look at volume and yeah this is
the level whether sleep for all the
stocks reduce plays so you will hear
that only mid and treble becomes boosted
while the Jayce is kept at the same
volume the charge rate is able to
reclaim all based
in fact I've produced around like here
it's impressively wasting a little bit
more into mixing now you can hear this
volume because volume is not as big but
the luxuries in become folders it's also
much bigger with probably beer drivers
and so on you can also hear some customs
of intermodulation area let's join our
track check there's an effect
perfect then some love bread
you
and
yeah apart from the listen ray I would
say that their support confident is
better imagine both playing together
come on trick you learn what their
weight more than the last noise it rest
I think this is a noisy record
he has such recording the clarity simply
too high this is already so boosted
we're recording but it doesn't sound
great at maximum on both the flip for it
is simply tool details and the charge
stream already introduces some
intimation but I think if both could be
connected together this would be really
a killer combo just you know I don't
know put some some paper on them and you
have some really great speaker system
but it's still quite portable so they
are really I think also meant for
different purposes this is already for
really heavy bass you know the see pop
kind of music and animal and this is for
rather for all the details
music novels with really great recording
quality where you have way also will
hear all the details recorded I am quite
impressed with it for me the bass is
enough although of course at higher
levels it gets reduced and reduced but
it still sounds fuller and better than a
UE boom for example by the way UE boom I
grabbed this one um yeah this will be
our next comparison it's already some
desk compare it against a weeble to
distill boom - and it still sounds great
really I am so impressed or depressed
that it didn't manage to improve the
sound a lot and need slightly better
than the one pint still honky hello MSE
it sounds horrible but we were using the
in the next video stay tuned I'll have
to do some measurements of the UE boom -
I also measure the UE boom the old one
so we can maybe do some comparisons and
I will of course also edit to the
database
yes what does to say about the truss
tree and they flip for I think in both
are great for their own kind of year
greatness they trust we definitely say
bass King in this size and class
it's rugged for travel because of inter
modulation and just because the travel
is tuned so strange next leap for is the
clarity King I would say it's one of the
clearest because I've heard also because
it's all boosted Italy some slight boost
in the presence region similar to what
both stuff but both usually rolls off
them after this boost Chuck's there is
there is no travel anymore and this
still has some upper trail you could see
it from the measurement yes I will show
you again here sleep for in black and
something me too in green and you can
see that that is hardly any travel above
10 kilo that's why they sleep for has
enough enough treble to to to still
sound convincing so yeah I think this
was enough I hope you like this it's not
easy to to find a better one it's both
are grateful for on their own but just
different and I think both together if
connected would really be a great system
so maybe it this was made the intention
of JBL to tune one more towards travel
the other one towards base so that all
has to buy both to have the best sound
but I think it's not there is not much
possible out of this size you could
maybe squeeze out some bit more bass but
here with lots of compression or
Distortion till I think it's quite
impressive and I really like it $400 one
of the best in this class also one of
the best all around us because he is
completely waterproof again by the way
it doesn't float it doesn't draw neither
but the drivers I tried it they are not
above water level so inside water you
won't hear anything therefore just maybe
a security feature if it falls inside it
won't damage but you cannot use it
inside water for listening to music as
it will get from slightly below the
waterline yeah I hope this was it let me
reduce volume here again on the on the
charge three as it's completely boosted
the only thing for low levels both do
not a boost bass I will play a track
maybe from from super fever
this is TechSoup for and it hasn't from
teeny but it hasn't gone busted to hide
it you can hear the Treasury is the same
what based doesn't boost any base for
low level so let's do some better
because of more clarity and everything
but if you like to have bass heavy music
for low levels you will be better off
with some Sony HD one or both something
meaning or even I think the ice on bass
from fuller at low levels will come a
bit closer you can hear this just when I
really increase volume to around half
maybe it gets the fullness
and one thing I didn't mention is it's
not perfectly controlled just like the
charge 3 where you can really put the
heaviest track there he is kicks and it
does not distort this their flip phone
has some slight twist or not really
distortion but you can hear that the
drivers are slightly over over push
let's say with some particular tracks
not with everything but with analog from
so persona and he was in our video you
will hear that that based on is not as
clean and for example on the charge free
or on the current play and so on so
there is some very slight bitterness but
I think it's still way better than many
others because so it's still under
control but not as well controlled as on
the charge way they obviously really
push the limits or are playing at the
limits here yeah it became longer than I
expected too much talking but I hope you
liked it anyhow and I hope I could give
you a better idea about the or flip for
I really love it
I already think it's one of my favorite
in this class and size way better than
the live button of Libra tone to which I
also own and I use it for pot abuse but
this one sounds also because then we can
check this again because there the sound
Tremont really quite details even
effects if you can hear this
so even when food upwards you get a more
omnidirectional sound and it still
sounds okay you know maybe even meant to
be used like this you can hear the arm
doesn't change as much and I switch over
to the charge free again I would say
that they flip forward with the drivers
upward still sounds better let alone a
both something tinny which is even worse
twelve in the chart three so this sounds
definitely better without this boost for
low levels in at normal levels so it has
volume they sleep for definitely wipe
the floor with the ball so let's
disclose this to distortion distortion a
much more punchy sound cleaner sound
clearer sound so I think this is a much
better deal especially with all the
features you get so yeah oh but now I
think I'm finished as already told you
where's that boom boom crap
this will be next I just had a very
short listen I will have to recharge it
also check battery life it does still
some fanboys who tell me that this place
for 12 hours of maximum I heard
differently so we will see and we can
compare them at normal levels at maximum
and see which one is louder which one
sounds better and so on so stay tuned of
the patient and see you in the next
video
very nice Thailand bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
