thought I will present you some of the
best portable Bluetooth speakers for
summer 2016 in all different classes the
Bluetooth speaker market is evolving so
quickly now that one speaker which was
great two three months ago can already
be dated today therefore this little
video to give you an insight which one
is best
but if you are rather into low budget
stuff or if you think that you make a
bomb sounds great please don't continue
any further is these are much more
higher class speakers which also cost a
little bit more but I would like to
introduce you to each of them tell you
what is great what's not so great
starting with the smallest one that
banged off some do play one this is
definitely the best sounding small
portable speaker I've heard it gives you
only directional sound nice deep bass
not boosted but yeah really really
mature
you can tether it to some rucksack or
something and although you see the
design is great it's also more prone to
scratches because of this aluminum
finish definitely not as rugged as the
more fabric stuff like the JBL charge 3
biggest problem of the biotoxin is
definitely battery life at levels below
half you can maybe get the 24 hours
stated by Ben Wolfson but cranky little
bit higher and it will die after 3-4
hours also one problem is at higher
levels especially deeper house kicks and
so on start to sound a little bit
strange you don't get this typical punch
but it starts to sound a little bit well
weird the same you had the same with the
a to bang with awesome fix this later on
but on the a1 it's still there so
definitely not the best speaker for
electronica house stuff and so on this
is where the JBL charge 3 comes in it's
not as refined sounding as the a1 a but
for house electronica this is definitely
much better speaker also at maximum
volume get this punch
it doesn't lose any any Drive and it's
completely waterproof you can toss it
into water and it will swim and of
course battery life is much much better
at maximum volume we will get more than
six hours why this will die after 2
hours and 15 minutes
yeah what's not so great is treble
response here the treble is there it
doesn't sound muffled but you get the
impression as if you were listening to
some kind of badly encoded mp3 still one
of the best all-rounders also very loud
about this loudest a Huey mega boom as
we've heard but better sounding with
better bass deeper bass yeah one of my
very favorites the FIFA Helsinki sounds
definitely better than these two or so
louder but it needs a nap for some
tuning with the stock neutral tuning it
sounds a little bit flat so you should
change it to late night but the app is
not very stable but still with late
night very great hi fight us and no
artificial boosts really nice dynamic
bass there is some slight stereo
separation better than on the charge
three or so on the a1 which is a mono
speaker but battery life is not that
great either
you will get maybe three hours at
maximum at lower levels about eight nine
hours here is the bigger brother that
via Oslo cost a bit more depends where
you live but currently the German Amazon
store has both for exactly the same
price for 329 euros the Oslo sounds
definitely better more punchy more
mature than the Helsinki but it's also
bigger and heavier I wanted to include
it as it's really a very nice hi-5
speaker you don't get much stereo
separation here the V file sync is
better but yeah you would need a second
one unfortunately
FIFA doesn't support stereo wireless
pairing here comes the next one the new
Harman Kardon go and play this is the
model from 2016 and definitely one of
the
most impressive portable speakers it's
not high five so if you rather prefer
flat and boosted sound you should go for
either the Oslo the Helsinki this is
more a boombox but really Tunes
perfectly well with nice deep punchy
bass nice try but also great stereo
separation this is a kind of speaker
that you hear and you fell in love
immediately it sounds better than our
bigger speakers like the IVA XS 9 clip
came see but AM C 3 but it doesn't play
as loud so it could definitely get along
with a bit more loudness also battery
life is not as great at maximum volume
you will get maybe two hours two and a
half at lower levels eight nine hours so
all of them except the truth free are
not battery kings where the mini ryx 2.1
come in it has the greatest battery life
of all of these at maximum you get more
than 20 hours I think the sub should
still play for six seven hours at
maximum and this is really loud louder
than they go and play although there is
some bass reduction at maximum it still
sounds great much better than the JBL
extreme or comparables because so one
single mini doesn't quite compete with
the Bang &amp;amp; Olufsen but at the sub and
you get a very mature sounding system
comparable to the Harman Kardon go and
play but of course you have three parts
to carry around the weakness of the
Maneri is may be that it's designed to
be a more only directional speaker just
like the a1 but it sounds definitely
better if you aim it directly at you
otherwise you will loose travel quite a
bit and you of course have to carry
three parts around also the sub has to
be tethered with a wire to one of them
in weeks
the mean uruk's themselves attached
wirelessly to each other for stereo you
can also add a second sub which will
make the whole package even more
powerful more punchy but also more
expensive still one of the greatest
sounding systems if you want to keep it
small but still get their loudness and
power full sound so low budget I haven't
found that much I still have the Denon
via
mini
which for around hundred dollars I would
still call is one of the best you get
nice stereo separation with this very
nice portable format to carry around but
also here battery life is not that great
some even reported that it died after
some months mine still does great I have
it for more than I think one and a half
years and it still works pretty well but
then we have also the JBL flip three
maybe not as great sounding as the denim
via mini but louder
so overall maybe they're better on
rounder not as bass heavy as the charge
3 but also smaller nice battery life
more rugged than the devil via mini
maybe there are other speakers like the
anchor premium which sound better at low
levels due to more bass boost but this
is definitely a better one rounder it
sounds it has it gives you a more pure
sound also nice you can tether it to the
rocks are just like the a1 and thanks to
this fabric finish it's also much more
durable it already fell onto ground once
and I don't even see who wear any kind
of scratch so yeah I think currently
these are definitely the best of course
there are alternatives to the JBL charge
3 like the sony xperia heard already but
overall I definitely prefer the chart 3
you can of course get for the same
amount the IVA XS 9 instead of the gold
play but I think that gold play sounds
better the Ivor is much bigger nearly
twice as heavy so yeah for my personal
use I would call these ones the best if
I would have to select a single one this
is really tough I would maybe go for the
go and play it's not as small but it
sounds so great I don't know everyone
who heard it fell in love and it's
really a speaker which which gives you
this this kind of magic which some
others cannot quite give if I have to
select two I would
probably go for the a1 and comment play
for lower levels day 1 sounds really
really great you have the impression of
you if you are listening to a bigger
speaker then if you want higher levels
that go and play takes over
yeah the Helsinki still great but I
would rather decide between these two
maybe not cheap but well this is our
hobby so yeah we have to spend money to
be happy I hope this could give you an
idea about the current market maybe in 2
3 months everything will change again
who knows I hope you will have a nice
summer
yeah bye bye and have a nice time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
