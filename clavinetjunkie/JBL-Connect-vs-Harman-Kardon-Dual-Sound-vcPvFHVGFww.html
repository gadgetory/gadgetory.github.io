connect against Harman Kardon dual sound
what is this this is some kind of
proprietary Bluetooth protocol which
allows two speakers to play
simultaneously there are plans to
include iva-mos because then too but
currently only two are supported in case
of JBL connect if you have two equals
because you can either set them for
stereo so when we play the left the
other one the right channel so wireless
stereo or what they call party mode
where both will play the same Harman
Kardon dual sound only supports this
party mode so there is no option for
left and right but when while I was
playing around with JBL connect also
including the JBL extreme or the pulse 2
I noticed that the reach was not very
far after 3-4 meters they already
started to stutter while when playing
around with the go and play here I
noticed that the reach was much valid I
would like to demonstrate you this I
will walk around with both playing in
JBL connect and with dual sound mode so
that you get an idea how far you can get
and set them apart please put up your
headphones and let's check this out
first let's try JBL connect I will use
the JBL charge free and the JBL
free--free for demonstration is both a
difference because they only work with
party mode just like the Harman Kardon
here and the JBL charge 3 will remain
here as master and I will take the Flip
3 with me to see how far we can get
without losing connection yeah then
connected now and let's start playback
all should be playing yeah and let's see
how far we can get
yeah already breaking up yeah this was
the problem I always had with to flip
three playing in stereo I couldn't even
put them here although now it seems to
work but not very stable let's try
getting farther a bit you can hear it
already cuts out maybe if I held it up
well no not really I think we won't
manage to get even any father yeah does
it work
so Maximus maybe ten meters with
breakups but not very far you can see
it always taught us a bit
so let's try JBL
I mean Harman Kardon a dual sound no
again this will be the master this one
will be our slave for taking with us
yeah they are connected now and we can
start again
playback yet over playing and let's see
how far we can get now
yeah no problem so far I can put it here
with both playing yeah no problems here
as well so let's see if we can get
farther now yeah I think these are now
20 meters the other one is standing over
there we don't even see it it's there so
20 meters maybe let's see if we can get
even a bit further okay now it starts
stuttering but you can see it stands on
the floor and still works
okay here but it still works
I mean there is no line of sight anymore
maybe 30 meters
Hank it still works of course the other
one plays as well I can show you we will
leave this one here
yeah I think you can hear it already so
both are really playing in sync
unfortunately not in stereo but anyhow
of course in this case it would have
been helpful to be able to control
volume separately for one and the other
I mean they are not playing in stereo so
as a kind of wannabe multi-room system
it would be a first grade to be able to
reduce volume on this one
while the other one should continue
playing with high volume I don't know
there is still some work to do for
Harman Kardon they should release an app
which enables you some option especially
connecting them for stereo also to
disable volume sync for both so they can
really make one softer while the other
one plays with higher volume but tread
controls are working well I think let's
see not quite
this is our slave so obviously it only
reacts for four volume changes but I
cannot quite control preg changes or
even stop and pause music obviously
anyhow the reach is really impressive I
think 30 maybe even 40 meters with
line-of-sight should be possible so not
sure if Harman Kardon uses another
protocol than JBL I mean this is the
same company so it should be the same or
if simple the the antenna is so much
better in the going to play speakers
yeah this was it I hope this could give
you an idea how far you can set the
speakers apart I mean with the Harman
Kardon going play it's very impressive I
could set them at the edges of my garden
and still have sound maybe it's just
better antenna design I don't know but
the JBL extreme which is nearly as large
should also have better connection while
in reality the JBL charged three
together two three three have a wider
reach so the only thing missing with
dual sound is now of course an own
stereo mode I don't know if it will come
if it's also technically possible but I
would wish an app where you can switch
between other either party or stereo
also of course this abling volume sync
would be great and the next step would
be to include more speakers than two not
sure if it is technically possible but
let's hope so thanks a lot for watching
have a nice time and bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
