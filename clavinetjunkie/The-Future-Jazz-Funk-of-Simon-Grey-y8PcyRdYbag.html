all the skills here I didn't have time
to tidy it up anymore it's quite late
past midnight 1:30 a.m. so I should have
gone to bed already but I have this in
my heart I wanted to do this already
earlier but postponed it again and again
but now I decided to do the
spontaneously it's again music related
or related to a particular musician
called Simon gray many probably don't
know Simon gray but for me he's the
Godfather of synthesizer based jazz funk
new funk funk funk house or however you
would like to call this and he never
released any own album that was just one
release available as Japan import so I
ordered this from Japan for I think $50
or $60 so quite expensive this was a
serious started by Rasmus Faber also a
great house musician and he presented
some really outstanding artists like
opal opal was also a CD with compiled
tracks from Richard Earnshaw and this
one is from Simon gray with some of his
own tracks that you could only hear on
yeah some EPS so he'll find really some
great tracks like a lactic acid this was
a really great dance track new jazz kind
with this let's call it maybe yeah girl
hectic sound so very very Spacey sound
also some remixes he did for I don't
know real people MIG will mix and so on
and he had this particular style I was
always loved with this mook bass lines
really very very organic great grooves
most tracks were house related because
Rasmus Faber is a house musician but
some had this offbeat kind of breakbeat
stuff like like sweet and sour which is
a remix from from the Crusaders and
Simon gray some time ago I think a month
ago started an own pledge campaign to
release his own first real album
yeah the track you can hear in the
background is already an unreleased
track which will appear on this album
called what's the name of this track
Akuma and you can see he already reached
74% and 15 days are still available and
I would of course laugh if he manages
the hundred percent which is necessary
to make the album living if you if you
like if you are if you love this really
new jazz kind of electric just let's
call it future Jes he calls it inst
himself jazz fusion but really modern
jazz is not this type you know from the
foetal Chick Corea or something which
are more classic type of fusion this is
really electronic based with heavy use
of Moog synthesizers analog stuff and so
on with real drums and so on and so on
really it's hard to describe but you you
know maybe Galactica suit which I'm
playing now in the background so these
this is the kind of music that when I
still did music years ago I mean I'm
talking about an area 20 years ago and
I'm not as talented as him I mean he's
he's a God of keyboards of synthesizers
and so on I was just some hobby musician
but this was the kind of music I would
have loved to create music like he
currently does or did ten years ago and
yeah if you pledge an album for download
costs fifteen dollars a CD will cost $32
there are of course other options a
studio day with him for way more I don't
know for $7,700 Simon gray key session
whose album downloads here acoustic
house concert blues album for $2,400 so
if we have someone who has the money to
afford something like this yeah but I
think it would be enough if many of you
who like this kind of music I often
played tracks from him the this this
great house music
I think it's definitely worth pledging
for this musician we can have a look at
some of his you get of course access to
some videos for example here we have
some of his new home sessions for the
upcoming album
you hear the vocoder like Harry Hancock
did in the 70s so it's a little bit
retro with its retro touch with with
heritage of all the great funk fusion
experimental jazz musicians from that
period of course with modern sound but
even this here you can see some home
synthesizer yes an original clarinet
erodes his he's talking about chord
progressions also quite interesting so
for all musicians among us I don't call
myself musician but yeah I mean he shows
some really tricky stuff here let's
listen to this
an unusual interval may be minor food
what the health some he talks about the
sound of the Fender Rhodes I think he's
using a Mac tool
and of course you also get some access
to unreleased tracks some remixes he did
for or real people he here is the
salary's track I'm playing the
background takuma so I think it's really
worth pledging for this album as this
will be an outstanding revolutionary
kind of music which is not really heard
in the piece times get this dance crap
which is based on some loops I don't
know with this not sure but this
primitive stuff I mean this is real he's
a real musician he's coming from jazz
and putting all together electronica
breakbeat and so on and so on so for all
those music lovers I would beg you to
pledge as well just take the digital
album which costs fifteen dollars or
something and you have access to
download it when it's coming released in
one two months or something but I I'm
sure it's really worth it I love his
music and I'm so glad he's doing this
pledge campaign so we can finally I can
finally have a full album with with his
tracks not only some remixes but I'm
still loving this alone although it was
released I'm not sure I think 2000
something
2007 so 10 years ago but they the tracks
are still fresh when you listen to them
today
so guys if you love music if you like
Harry Hancock hello Chick Corea Jeff
Laura all those Punk Fusion musicians
from the 70s and if you love modern
house and New Jersey as a nova
being filled whatever
Kyoto of just massive and so on and so
on this guy puts this all together and
creates his own thing and I would laugh
if some of you could support this
elements well and I hope we will reach
the hundred percent within the 15 days I
don't know how many pledges we have 173
pledges so let's add 50 of you I have
nearly 60,000 subscribers I'm sure we
find many who love this kind of music
not only Metallica or ac/dc or I don't
know I mean him but I mean read music
which is coming from real musicians yeah
so wanted to share this with you Simon
Gray is definitely worth pledging for
this album
I don't know him in person I just once
called him some years ago wanted to talk
with him if I could use some of his
tracks or some unreleased demos he he
had for my purposes also for the
database we had a nice talk but he back
then he was not quite satisfied with the
idea he said he wants to yeah to cut to
make some cut and leave all this period
behind although I still think this music
he did then back then is still great and
wonderful of course this what he doesn't
know is way more sophisticated that same
so maybe with most of the tracks on this
album are rather I would say he had
based on sample sent and also more
sequencer type of music while here he
works with real musicians especially on
drums and so on and of course at his
book bass lines everything and then yeah
so yeah I just wanted to share with you
before this campaign stops in 15 days so
when I post this video it will be
probably 14 days yeah please I beg you
let's find enough pledges to let him
reach the 100% I think it's really worth
it and you will definitely not regret
hearing this album just listen to the
music in the background and you will
hear this is something completely yeah
wonderful I don't know how to call it
Extra Ordinary vagin whatever whatever
so yeah I think I'm finished of course
if I was a great musician I would have
probably made it music like him yeah but
unfortunately I'm not so I have to to
hope he will finish and he will reach
this goal to finish this album and so we
can all enjoy it I will maybe try
contacted him contacting him again if he
allows me to play some of his samples
I'm not sure if this will be released
under label or if he released s-- if you
will release it under his own name he
has an old label I think which is called
nasty productions yeah but check it out
check the pledge campaign it's the link
is in my video description have a look
if you are interested there are some
track samples also so yeah but 15
dollars is nothing for a really great
Ossining album and you are a part of all
this so yeah thank you for your
attention but just as a musician or
former or pseudo musician I have to
support guys like him whom makes this
yeah without any support from any stupid
big Sony BMG labels or something I mean
he creates this with his own energy
money and so on and we can support him
so yeah I finished I could go to bed now
just edit this video so you can watch it
later I hope you enjoyed it anyhow and
of course lots of new interesting stuff
is coming like this thank you to evil or
s the new version of that ravallo which
is small one and lots of surprises are
coming so be patient a bit one week two
weeks and you will see lots of surprises
on this channel but again please please
pledge for this great musician Simon
grey one of the greatest in my opinion
just funk and you jazz future jazz
fusion musicians currently here yeah
yeah this was it
if you Simon watch this here please even
if you don't reach the goal please make
this album yeah we will try to find some
other donators some other pleasures
somehow currently 173 I mean must be
more people around just spread the word
I'm sure there are many of you who like
this kind of music yeah
finished otherwise my ever I will stop
again thanks again for your attention
and have a good night bye-bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
