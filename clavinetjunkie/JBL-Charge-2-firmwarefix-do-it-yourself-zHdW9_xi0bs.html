video for all those frustrated JBL
charge to owners who still fight with
some old firmware and are taking for
fools by JBL support in some countries
who claims that there is no firmware
update that everything told on internet
is a lie and so on so a firmware file an
original one from JBL was posted by
someone some time ago but there was no
way to update it because we have no
software but in the meantime some
unknown anonymous user from probably
russia found a way how to update the
device he provided download links for
the firmware file an installation guide
and also the software necessary which is
some csr blue i don't know you can have
a look at my blog where all the links
are posted you can also find the links
in the description of the video of
course I cannot warrant you that you
brick your device so please apply this
on your own risk but I think it's better
to have an ability to update the device
on your own then not being able because
JBL support is is unable to I don't know
so I hope this will find you well and
you will be able to update your device I
mean in the meantime there is the JBL
charge to plus but I mean the JB the old
JBL charge to is not worse because of
this you just need to have the latest
firmware the one for one to have all
bugs and and sound issues fixed
regarding another problem because some
people are still asking the issues I
found with the JBL flip 3 I'm still on
it I'm still doing some research all I
can say now the blue unit doesn't have
these issues while the black one if put
into the Sun becomes the passive
radiators sticking out
the problem is they also sound different
but I think the black one sounds better
so I'm trying to get my hands on another
black unit to see and do some
measurements what's going on here all I
can say is also that the JBL extreme so
far did not have any issues I put it
into the Sun for an hour and it still
sounded great
just like the yellow one so it still
might be a problem
with production I don't know or maybe
this only this unit is affected so still
please be patient until I have well done
my research I hope you can apply the
latest firmware on your own if you
haven't found any way so far I hope you
find this helpful if he has thumbs up if
no thumbs down yeah thanks for watching
and bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
