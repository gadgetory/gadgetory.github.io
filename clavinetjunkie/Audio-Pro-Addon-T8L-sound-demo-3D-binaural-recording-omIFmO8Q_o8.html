and let you listen to the audio project
on t8l it's a new version of the ot8
which was also tested by what I find I'm
not quite sure what the differences are
maybe this looks a little bit better and
more modern but from what I heard it
will also be discontinued soon so soon
you won't be able to get it there for a
great one also to be able to compare it
against some others because we already
tested like test ages in a street and
the NS one and the most interesting part
is that it's hardly bigger than n then
the LS one here but small compared to
the big industry therefore I thought
this might interest you as well
first let's have a look at the speaker
yeah one is active and passive like
usual nothing special here USB port for
charging auxiliary it also has optical
in support I think 2 times 30 watts of
power I'm not quite sure about the
stages in history this is definitely
more powerful but yeah here the wire
port and I've got sure what the exact
term is for this yet the holes are
really small so if you want to use some
monster cable with one centimeter
thickness it won't fit in a pattern that
yet also comes with a remote control
it has tone controls you can adjust
travel in bass in 6 steps I wasn't down
here this has four steps and about from
that nothing that's special I like it
because it's white and yeah let's
compare these two I will leave this this
or this
it doesn't make sense to compare it but
we will compare the 58l against the nh3
you are listening through by Nolan ears
so I'm sitting around maybe one and a
half meters away from you you should set
the loudness to such a level that you
really hear me realistically of course
you should listen with headphones it's a
binaural recording those require
headphones for optimum optimal optimal
results they don't work well through
speakers therefore please put up your
headphones and let's try them out I set
them up like this so one above the other
and of course aware that this may have
some negative influence on the sound
this version also an effect on the final
sound but for my mother not so
scientific approach I think it should
still do the trick also make it easier
to compare the soundstage the imaging is
it'll be different the same effect we
had from the NS 1 @ NS screen both are
playing with the neutral settings now
and I'm stuck with the audio first
the stages heavier on elusive resolution
different
- really agrees that the patient - who
do some practice
the base is some of westrom origin from
the students
you also listen to the drums
maybe some boxing and more keep morning
you sweet baby I do most everything else
a little good and I hope you feel the
same way
don't buy you
I hope this could give you some idea
about the sound of the audio Pro head on
PA they'll also compare against the
stages in s3 currently I don't have any
other comparables because like this but
they are both included within my
database so in future when I get more
systems like this you can of course
always compare them out from there I
think it's mostly a matter of taste also
what kind of music you listen to with
some songs I prefer the stages while
with others the author presented better
to me also keep in mind the price these
are a little bit more expensive so 280
290 years versus 230 euros but what I
like about the audio Pro is that treble
and bass adjustment is much more
reasonable so the high shelf for base
stats at 200 Hertz while here at 1 kilo
Hertz so when you start boosting bass
you also boost this upper base they
don't have such as from upper bass boost
and also in boosting treble you rather
only post upper treble which is of
course nice because at low levels both
sound a little food especially when I
place them close to a wall so when
they're really standing there at the TV
set at low loads they sound remebers
which I would like to demonstrate you
against Damon here this from simply
clearing with vocals
then on you hear the vocals much better
of course we can try posting treble
I think that problem with this madness
is that they have some slight deep at
starting at around two kilohertz you can
sit here from a measurement with neutral
settings for bass and treble that the
area between two sixty Hertz is slightly
used
apart from that quite a natural response
also deep bass you can try boosting bass
or using bass boosting treble or
reducing treble so Trevor at maximum
would fill out this gap between two sick
students but it boosts the upper treble
of course way too much yeah I think I
really like them I like them maybe more
than the studies because I can adjust
the sound at low levels to such a degree
that they sound quite appealing compared
well maybe to attend on why would the
status I didn't quite manage when I
boosted bass they became boo me when I
boosted travel yeah they became even
harsher they are already a little bit
too hard for me have this the spotlight
effect for children I'm not quite sure
what it is because it's not that visible
from the measurement only slightly so in
future of course way most because like
this are coming I already get some from
a company I also ordered some others a
friend of mine will borrow me his but
this will be a surprise so stay tuned I
hope you liked this video anyhow mmm I
like the audio Pro and not quite sure if
I will keep them yeah I have to see I
have to wait until the others so that
they arrive so that I can compare them
all but so far I really like them and
yeah I would probably recommend them
just don't yet not for a party but for a
nice everyday listening they are really
great so thanks a lot for watching and
see you in the next video have a nice
time it bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
