the comments from my JBL sleep folios so
far but it seems most of you are quite
tribal shine I read lots of complaints
like well too much forever or why does
it need to have so much well this is
indeed slightly on the brighter side but
I think it's still ok especially if you
don't listen second on axis usually you
do with a portable speaker place it
somewhere walk around and the sound will
be still okay also placing it upwards
like this for a more omnidirectional
sound the treble becomes slightly used
which is of course nice another solution
would be to use some equalizer here I
have mine which is called EQ 10 I use a
high shelf filter starting at around 3
key notes reducing by 3.5 DB and the
result is a bit better we can have a
listen
with the queue without the queue and
ready queue but maybe many don't want to
use any kind of eqf which I quite
understand as I usually also don't use
it you just for demonstrating but we
could maybe try covering it by something
some material so let me take this yes my
stock we will cover it and maybe let's
have a listen again
you could probably hear it becomes quite
a bit better count by a sock this is
fresh by the way I was just joking and
you can maybe have a look at some
frequency response measurement with and
without shock here you can see the
original frequency response uncovered
and now here with socks so you can see
the shock also seems to work like some
kind of natural high shelf filter but
maybe with a bit too much reduction we
could try to be some other material here
I have a bag kind of well that material
we will cover it again and have a listen
you could view it way too strong for
adduction although the material is
pretty thin trouble become swallowed
nearly completely we can have again and
look at some frequency response
measurement and you can see production
with the desert material is much too
strong also follow this village with the
stock so maybe let's try another
material here I have some kind of flash
or please cover low color the speaker
and listen again I think it was much
better like this although quite a thick
material it seems to have exactly the
correct amount of treble filtering we
can have again a look at some frequency
response measurement and you can see
Trevor reduction is not as strong as
with the stock and still quite linear so
we could maybe yet try opening the
speaker cutting some parts out of this
cover here and stuffing it inside
let's see if this improves the sound is
more you have to be careful with opening
it but once you know how it's quite easy
again speaker Tony helped me and gave me
some hints how to do this you need some
screwdriver just put it in gently where
the buttons are and you will be able to
pull it off slightly then try putting in
your finger and remove it completely
yeah it's not the busy but I think
everyone should manage here you can see
the drivers yet quite small but really
great deal quality so impressive that
they managed to pump out this amount of
base but now let's take the cover and
cut some pieces out of it we will try to
fix them behind the grille in front of
the drivers I'm pretty sure my wife will
kill me if she sees this so I will have
to hide this somewhere but yeah here are
the pieces we will simply put them in
here and snap the cover back in again
and maybe excuse me again I will also
use the sleep tree as reference so we
can hear how the trailer has changed so
yeah please have a listen
I would have said quite an improvement
comparable thrill to the JD sp3 maybe
still a little bit better but also with
better bass and so on so we can maybe
again have a look what's going on here
with some frequency response measurement
and as you can see overall quite a
surprise the frequency response has
nearly flattened much better than before
you can see this deep at 3q hat says
disappeared also those strange humps at
7:18 are completely gone also base seems
to be quite a bit better than before so
this is really close to hi-fi which I'm
really impressed such a simple mode just
5 minutes 10 minutes and the speaker
becomes more of a studio monitor and now
I'd like to know from you if I should
continue using the flip for with my mode
here for all my future tests I wanted to
make a general comparison against the
denim by a mini the Sony HG one also the
u.s. maybe the creative eye or goal or
if I should remove them out and use it
naked
also ordered another one in grey so we
can really compare the model one with
the unloaded one directly and yet please
tell me should I continue for my future
tests the model fit for or should I use
it completely naked yes if you want a
high-five sound apply simple module some
plush cover yeah it figures that just be
careful with removing the cover I
meanwhile did it three four times so you
might maybe see some some slight damage
here but if you are really careful it
should you know it could work easily we
hope to help you for all those 12 shy
guys how to improve travel simply yet
cover it with some material or if you
want to make a mod invert some material
and it will become even better I'm quite
impressed with it
again we will maybe compare it with this
mod also against the onyx mini I hope
you like this I hope yeah this could
help you if you are really intending to
buy it but you are unsure because of the
hash table yeah it's like some modern
tits perfect better than anything else
we will maybe hear this in my future
tests against the river down on the
diamine II and so on or in the same
class I think the JBL flip phone
performs best especially now with the
mote on axis you get a really perfect on
yes nothing else to say to say and show
you I hope you like this thanks for
watching and see you in the next video
bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
