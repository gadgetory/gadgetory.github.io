I would like to compare that best bottom
speaker from 2017 against the best one
from 2016 better in Vilas FIFA Oslo yeah
I know this is only my personal rating
still I think these are the very best
you can get within that class so not
really meant to be compared but when I
was looking at some frequency response
measurements of the denim I also check
their FIFA Oslo you can see that then on
black and the FIFA with its neutral
joining in gray and they look quite
similar there based on the FIFA which is
a little bit deeper but it also has some
deep around 200 300 Hertz that then on
seems to have more treble boost but this
product comes only from next audio
processing so according to the
measurement they should sound indeed
quite Cielo which would be surprising
given the size difference of course
loudness wise that they don't can't
compete I think it's best to listen by
ourselves in judge later on you can of
course also check them out through my
database compare that then on against a
Oslo with late night with neutral or any
other speaker but now let's compare them
directly as always I will use my burner
microphones also head cam you wrote of
course listen with headphones for the
most realistic result so please put them
on and let's have a listen the thief
also I said to its neutral mode is this
result in a flatter tuning and makes the
more comparable and the demo will be
playing first and is around two thirds
if you effect
the FIFA the Free File swing around half
now you can mental this is already quite
a lot of volume as you can hear from my
work so they are already drowning me
away here
something else
Infinity's they brought some speech here
the FIFA
you can also hear that beep as somehow
more it there you know no one says a
thing wisely they go to sleep after so
much time if you get more washed out
still quite impressive for this size
Christian
understand is the shape that the
elephant it also here's some nice area
which remains more stable when you move
your head
the fever the different first
anything on its own either one or the
other some sweaters over here with more
boxy that I know it's something else and
more acoustic just some and you can hear
a really broad soundstage you are having
here in front of you
if you fur
it simply onvo something great there is
hardly any stereo
so I mean for a normal user that Helen
is probably even overkill if many are
satisfied with a Huey boom or some other
UN's angle crap
but I'm really impressed what the small
demo achieves here
also here you can really hear the
positions of the musicians here
positions of the musicians although
maybe not as precise as their default
and you this an optional air between all
the instruments and all
and the denim melts them slightly
together but still I'm remaining blown
away still so handsome
also my acoustic so here you should get
some really nice stereo with with with
with
and overall very natural human soul not
exaggerated in bass treble or something
a fever
it's really as if you were sitting in
front of two speakers like now so one is
playing the left the other one the right
channel not a song also very proud
recording it to come here I think that
best distance is around one and a half
meters
you can hear nothing of this stellar
here maybe let's check the classic so
it's the song so listen how it manages
to play this kick here many speakers
including the creative algo were already
distorting the modus level but this of
course is still way more power so you
can really feel the woofer here these
are just two tiny drivers
so still very very controlled with
hardly any dynamic processing which is
quite impressive
I mean dia already a little bit louder
so if we reduce volume to something like
that the differences will become really
even lower
somehow song let's leave it at around
half slightly below half you can hear
something that FIFA has hardly any
advantage anymore
despite being as huge it would probably
need to set it to late nights now
it's more smokiness from you can really
feel the kick
but then on country produced a strong
neck
stated simply race will marrow anything
this opens that song completely
something else while our metal and hard
rock lovers
maybe some been switched
it's extreme that soundstage I'm hearing
here
a pulse way more speak now because the
demo already struggles with these tiny
drivers live in the festival has this
huge water inside to your first wanted
to fall on at the dead
the gentleman says you cannot compete
here anymore
it's listed at some angle making here
this kick his CP and I think he tries
really nicely it does a great job name
so let's check what happens economies
maximum
a few far
respect father because it becomes
allowed
so of course it cannot compete in more
let's try another crack it still does a
great job in role not being extremely
loud let's try to keep our every step
back again and volatility
comes naturally better like this
also stronger debates but again here the
addendum becomes ridiculous no some
something loud from remedy
they can you know
we also reduce volume to get a cleaner
sound
I was try to match them again it is big
pizza you can hear the default part
sounds like you know
we made great job I think you could hear
it as well I for my part I'm quite
impressed as the dinner is really not
that far off
of course the FIFA is still more precise
more detailed has more attack more
dynamic somehow but as long as you keep
volume at a reasonable level the denon
can compete quite well here also with a
better stereo imaging the FIFA is rather
mono while here you get some really nice
on stage if you sit directly in front of
the speaker
both are directional so they have a
sweet spot sitting directly in front but
I'm quite quite impressed how well the
Denon English size can compete against a
much larger FIFA of course yeah it's
more than twice as loud also a little
bit more true maybe to the original
recording this moutains out a little bit
all all the details but still very very
nice very detailed speaker at low levels
really nice so I think it deserves the
best speaker 2017 just like that before
slow deserved it for 2016 it's still
great but I think overall winner for me
is the Devon because of the size and
also price so for $200 yeah a winner
yeah I hope this could give you an idea
also a better understanding about the
Denon by it's not perfect because of
some slight backs and flows here with
volume control but overall the sound is
simply amazing so on a similar level as
the FIFA also of course not meant to be
cranked to 100 DB or something still the
sound is kept always at a really high
level without any artificial I don't
know compression and so on just some
slight limiting so when it gets when
some stronger parts come in you can hear
some slides volume reduction if you
crank it to higher levels but apart from
that it's it remains really very
faithful to the original recording which
I'm really impressed by with whatever so
thanks all for watching and see you in
the next video have a nice
bye-bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
