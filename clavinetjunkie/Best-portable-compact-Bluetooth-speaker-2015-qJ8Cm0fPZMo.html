portable speaker I always get questions
like what is the best portable to speak
I can buy or is the JBL Xtreme still the
best speaker around well to tell the
truth it's not and it never was we've
already heard that they're mini Erik's
together with the mini rex up already
outperformed the JBL extreme while being
smaller and lighter but you have to
carry around two or three parts and they
are quite a bit more expensive I was
always a big fan of the Denon via mini
it's really a nice decent sounding
speaker but it doesn't even reach the
loudness for really serious listening
especially outdoors another example a
very popular German test magazine called
Tipton van taste tested lots of
different Bluetooth speakers last year
in summer and they selected the Bang &amp;amp;
Olufsen bill play is being best followed
by the Bowers &amp;amp; Wilkins t7 which is
surprising because they rated the sound
quite badly but it still got second
place third place was the JBL charge -
as far as I can remember and Delaware
Mini followed on place 13 even worse
than the small beats pill which got
placed 12 so yeah I don't want to
question their ratings but after having
heard really many many speakers I think
that the best one I've heard so far is
the FIFA Helsinki I mean I wouldn't call
the IVA XS 9 portable it's a huge
speaker that you can carry around but
you probably wouldn't this speaker is
below one and a half kilogram
it's still small enough that you can put
it into some jacket pocket
I mean it's smaller than the JBL extreme
but simply sounds like high-end it is as
loud has deeper bass no bass boost the
frequency response is very smooth I
already showed you a frequency response
graph of the FIFA Helsinki before
in the meantime FIFA added some new
tunings to the speaker for example there
is a new late-night mode and if we have
a look at the frequency response
measurement you can see that before it
measured already pretty nice but with
late night you see it measures like a
straight flat line which is really
impressive for a speaker as small like
this the
base which is below 55 Hertz and it can
really play loud so it's enough for some
party but is it the perfect speaker no
it's not but it's the best portable
small speaker like this I have heard so
far and I really have heard many
including all the models from bang on
Dawson Bowers and Wilkins dissonance or
it plays louder than the pure lead 15
while you see how small it is I mean the
really 15 is as huge as a breadbox so of
course I thought we will check the FIFA
Helsinki out do some further listening
also try out the new late-night mode
first I thought we'll compare it again
against the JBL extreme just to show you
the difference in sound I mean the JBL
extreme is more tuned for a boosted
boomy dance kind of sound while the fee
financing is really more a smooth
high-end sound you will probably notice
that the JBL extreme starts sounding
muffled why the FIFA I think he remains
very detailed which is really impressive
so as always I do of course using
binaural microphones
you really should listen with headphones
because binaural recording recordings
don't work well through when listen
through speakers so everyone who still
comments leaves comments like I listened
to this for my JBL charge - yeah you
listened wrong because you have to
listen with headphones to really hear
the most realistic sound so let's check
them out please put up your headphones
and yeah let's have a listen first let's
have a listen to the new late night
tuning but man starting at the neutral
tuning first and the song from soul
persona
you can switch between different tunings
from within the pivot there are two
humans currently late light and neutral
so let's try late night and I think you
can hear the difference beautiful again
it sounds flatter with neutral while
late night gives a little bit of the
bass and treble balls link that again
this works pretty well slightly about
half volume but for higher levels I
would revert to a neutral tuning to
avoid any distortion but knowledge right
how it compares against the jvm extreme
I will put it like always want aside the
other and let's increase volume a little
bit
trivial extreme I think her differences
pretty obvious let's try another crack
and the FIFA makes the table extreme
sound really muffled it sounds as if it
was playing backwards or something
yeah this is a night and day difference
let's try another trick you get extreme
I mean this is really high-end high
price sounds like messenger
yeah maybe we should put them a little
bit farther away
this will increase bass for both so
let's have a listen how they sound then
the FIFA Helsinki will definitely
benefit from a placement closer to a
wall as this will boost bass which is
simply pretty flat compared especially
against the JBL extreme I increased
volume on both and let's have a listen
to another track
JBL
that's
JBL host assault there is quite a bit
depending on where I spend inside the
room but I think you can hear the bass
better here and also more dynamic over a
sound let's check another crest this is
pretty interesting here there are two
bass notes not extreme you can hardly
hear the lower note
it's barely there why the opposite
effect
and I will stop increasing volume
JBL again
I hope I could convince you of the
qualities of the FIFA L sinky I mean
it's definitely the most impressive
portable speaker I've heard so far the
JBL extreme while being a great outdoor
act portable unit on sound alone simply
cannot compete with the FIFA the FIFA
gives you this high-end HiFi sound while
the JBL is a little bit boomy covered
yeah it sounds really muffled compared
against the vive also quite a bit of
strange dynamics processing at high
levels while the FIFA plays the song
like it was recorded the only speaker
that comes to my mind which can compete
with the vive also price-wise are the
mini Eric's 2.1 but yeah you have three
parts while this is still smaller and
only one parts to carry around maybe the
design is not everyone's taste
but I think this understatement you know
it doesn't show you how powerful it is
this is really great one of my favorites
because definitely one of the best I've
heard so I hope this could give you an
idea about the FIFA also make your safe
to buy one in future there is no
comparable one no not from dengan Veloz
not from Bowers &amp;amp; Wilkins there is
nothing on the market which could
compete with the FIFA currently so I
hope you liked it so far we will of
course do more comparisons stay tuned
until then have a nice time and bye bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
