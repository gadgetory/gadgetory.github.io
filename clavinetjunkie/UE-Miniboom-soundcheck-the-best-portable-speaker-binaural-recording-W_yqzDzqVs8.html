portable speaker the Yui MIDI boom
well yes according to the wire cutter
the Yui mini boom is the best portable
Bluetooth speaker they have tested 48
markets top rated speakers and they
claim that the Yui mini boom despite
being small plays louder sounds fuller
and more natural than most of its
competitors including many larger models
also Amazon reviews are quite positive
we have 666 reviews and nearly most of
them are five-star reviews with claims
like sound on this big thing or sound of
this thing is amazing extremely small it
can fill up a room also Logitech claims
unexpectedly huge sound crystal-clear
highs deep bass powerful punch I have my
denim and buy a mini both cost
originally the same that then on 99
euros and the original price for the
e-mini boom was also 99 meanwhile it can
be for much less well don't ask me why
we will have a listen to both I'm
wearing binaural microphones so when
listen through headphones you should get
a quite realistic impression of how both
sound - in reality
I'll start with the mini boom then
switch over to the Denon they can forth
and then you can hopefully judge if the
UE mini boom is really that great let's
start
that's it just wreck
they turn on you hear the piano the
depth of it the minimum is a mono
speaker
maybe let's try some rock
okay I will turn both to the maximum now
and then we will see how loud they can
play I will put them up here and go to
the other end of the room so let's see
how both compare at maximum volume I
start again with the UE mini boom
I think it was pretty obvious that the
mini bomb could play a bit louder but
both didn't sound really convincing at
the top volume still the demon had more
bass and a more restrained sound but I
wouldn't use both for really feeling a
room I have a smaller and cheaper
TDK mini track than a 12 and I thought
we will see how these both compare I'll
start again with the mini boom
there are some equalizer settings for
the mini boom but I think they don't
really improve the sound I saw
I'm not sure if that anyone really
sunset better okay I let it up to you
if the mini boom is really the best
portable speaker I don't think so
piece of junk</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
