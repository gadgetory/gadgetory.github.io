well actually it's not just the simple
bluetooth speakers it's also equipped
with Wi-Fi so at home you can use it in
a module room set up with other speakers
from ggmm like the m3 but the m4 has
also a battery built-in which is pretty
decent as you get several hours at
mixing volume it's a bit larger but
hardly heavier than the JBL Xtreme I
have here so it could be a nice
alternative for all those who are still
seeking for something cheaper
I thought we'll check it out outdoors if
it can compete with the JBL Xtreme
loudest wise also sound wise of course
as always I will be using binaural
microphones so you should listen with
headphones I don't tell this as a joke
by Noah's binaural recordings really
require headphones for the best results
so please put them up I will take my
head cam and we'll check it out
maybe you can see that the ggmm m4 has
an own base button first let's check out
what this does I will play a funky
theelement and switch it on and off this
is without bass law
yeah you get quite a bit more punch and
I think all us face heads will probably
prefer leaving it all like that I will
switch over to the extreme oh yeah
always takes a bit of time switching to
the extreme
but if you can hear that the extreme
sounds clearer the m4 gives a bit of a
wheeled impression
but the punch is definitely there
let's check a lot of prep now some
hip-hop
yeah nice a punch I suppose whether I
should show our bill but it still seems
to wander bro I mean it's really nice
people base how to get here feel the
bounce in the ground I lost my focus
when I put things together when it all
I will turn on the JBL extreme to
maximum
yeah that's pretty loud
then for also for maximum
we are not as loud but the JDL
stratification
you can still hear the whole base which
is pretty nice
let's try another quick they are both of
mixing volume mo Zhi Bao Zhi is louder I
will step back a bit father yeah it gets
a little bit lost also because of the
missing treble maybe but what you can
still hear the bass the deep bass which
is really nice JBL again
yeah let's run out of it I'll come
closer again JBL it's loud but it
doesn't sound that convincing
it simply noisy while here you get
really nice space and punch trivial
again over process although the a
loudness wise not quite from comparable
this cool let's try again another track
this is a pretty punchy recording and I
think you can hear that the bass is
really nice so JBL again
yeah totally pop pop pop pop I hope
another prick
maybe let's try a bit from the side
the JBL
you know the difference in loudness
decrease the bishop in the school
but here you can feel the punch it's
really nice
to yell again
another quick last one also from no
copyright sounds
JBL yes 15 years is trying to push it
too hard already
QG mmm
tray
yeah we are also in a noisy environment
here
so yeah for all those seeking the
highest possible loudness the gg mmm
format B not the best solution but I
think we've heard that the sound was
less processed than on the JBL extreme
the bass reached quite a bit lower also
had more punch but of course it could
get along with a bit more treble still I
think it's a pretty nice device also
built for it is nice here with this
carrying handle well yeah
499 definitely recommend it I hope this
could give you an idea about the GG mm
m4 if it's a worthy alternative to the
JBL extreme which is still the king of
portables because for many i hope you
liked this video see you in the next one
have a nice time and bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
