look what is arrived yesterday this is
the bangle doll of some video play a one
I didn't quite have time to play with it
yet so I thought I will bring it with me
into the car and listen to some music
during driving I thought you might be
interested as well and I share this
experience with you by wearing binaural
microphones and the head cam of course
this video will probably become a bit
boring simply listening to some music
during driving but maybe you're
interested anyhow so we will check out
how this sounds the acoustics in the car
is pretty tricky so it's not easy to
make a portable speaker sound good yeah
let's check it out put up your
headphones and let's drive as you can
see I put some kind of rubber mat here
this is simply to avoid the speaker to
slide around and let's start with some
drums
usually
because sound quite funny when placed at
the windscreen
but I think this sounds pretty married
the game of my record is pretty low
we will be getting really high levels
here and I wanted to avoid distortion
let's generate a higher
maybe let's see some Jess
you also meet much higher levels for
in-car listening I tried it with
difference because the Bose Soundlink
mini I started with the jam box and it
was simply not loud enough but the you
play one is pretty loud as you can hear
it drones my voice easily this is salt
Astana you can do album it becomes I
also have fast
I think the difference is pretty obvious
I was founded in impermissible
and I
it's a game
laced with the side team playing at
maximum and I think you can hear it that
way
a one is much more powerful he wants to
feel the green really was a little
sounds a bit lost here therefore in the
car to the sound level the noise is
already so high that you will simply
need other speakers in order to read
befriend Roxanna - everything going
Africa say you gonna trip 50,000 others
on the try to struggle and fight
what's kind of all you get is mixing in
the rocks cheat you bring your asses in
front you and if they're believers with
you they killed the brother standing
next to you so what you gonna do what
what you gonna say
break it off say what you gonna do what
what you gonna say what you gonna do
do something about much fear Oh
this is ma front of us I'm not sure if
you can see through the camera bar yet
we are at Roche in Vienna
the acting the difference is pretty
obvious between his toes you can see the
diamond sounds broken here
for connection on the down
member
we're taking pears you filled my lungs
it's always asking for another
you
of course those terror simulations a
mostly done
playing a Texan
I think it is definitely nice use it as
a small portable card
hi-five system maybe these two of them
for stereo
much larger much zero
I will put it again beside me as a fan
Boca Mexico
along
beep lighter
although you can hear sometimes I have
the impression as if the a one with the
same all power sounds like the a - of
course not as pronounced but I sometimes
get impression as if it was there as
well this is the demo playing at maximum
because this is a big advantage of being
an omnidirectional speaker also not that
you can see the treble hardly becomes
worse yes I'm a traffic jam then so yeah
let's stop
I hope you liked it and I'm pretty
impressed by this of course not true yet
what kind of battery life I will be
getting especially at high levels but I
will test this out of course and
hopefully for my next test I will or I
will be able to give you some more
details so yeah this was it thanks for
watching and we will see us another real
test and video have a nice time and bye
bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
