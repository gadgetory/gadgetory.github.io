some unboxing of this monster cube MC 53
here already released what kind of junk
disease but before closing this topic I
thought I will add some fat effects it
all started with this review on the
German Amazon store for the X power B
t-28s
so comparable to that little F for a
pretty decent speaker but this guy
writes about it where is the base where
is the base that many youtubers are
describing I compared it with a
thirty-year-old cheaper speaker monster
cube MC 53 with electronic music that
bedrock music and I was very
disappointed with the performance of
this X power the MC 53 has only one peso
flavor but sounds much better and even
it even the flip 3 cannot compete and
was surprised how great the speaker
sound because of this video I bought it
and I thought it's really decent but the
reality is that it's crap it's really
one of the worst feelings because I
heard it's pretty loud but also pretty
distorted before having a listen again I
thought it will check out some frequency
response measurement and you can see the
frequency response is completely off no
bass no treble
so the usable range is maybe from 300
Hertz up to 3 kilohertz this is rather
AM radio or even phone quality you can
see there is some treble
enteries some bass even at 80 Hertz but
pretty soft so not quite usable it would
definitely need some equalizing at low
levels and at higher levels the
frequency response remains exactly the
same and although the speaker can play
pretty lot it's also pretty distorted
then we could maybe try if you can
improve the sound with some EQ here I
have my app which is equal 10 and you
can see there is some heavy adjustment
what I did is removing needs completely
I boosted hundred Hertz and with some
high shelf I also boost the treble
starting at around 3 kilohertz we can
have a listen to a track from Saltair
freesia
starting without EQ first and then we
will turn on EQ as always amusing
binaural microphones therefore you
should listen to headphones
you can wind sound like some AM radio
million
I will turn on this you know again
without it can't start for them at least
at low levels there should be some
dynamic adjustments improve the sound
let's bounce expected to a little person
and home both of this so the list some
potential is if you can play so loud
it could definitely take some stronger
adjustment different order
yeah and funny thing about the monster
cube is that it looks a little bit like
a pure play a to another speaker is the
FIFA heading it long from jake i JK are
sorry and this could be found for I
think below $10 or $15 or even half the
price of the month I cubed I think this
one sounds better so we have two clones
if you play a to clone against the FIFA
Helsinki clone I will start again with
the master cube so they do play a two
and all this is a moment because you
will hear shall come failure here well
Jake I are bound to better endure often
of the great public we have got better
than this junk for this kind of play
applause and will be for the higher
level mother freak
you can also hear it's always cut off
the very first second or challenge
when there is silence this one so
someone complains that is not usable for
for talks and and animal with classical
music people always cuddle as a silent
part
the j k KR pump really special here so
the argument that this is cheaper is or
that is not an argument efficiency
factor from program
come on track with all this trouble so
we roll out the month of you can play we
okay j/k our health to be flown already
a platform
the mantra cube not replay volume curve
not much to happen too
if you on okay but it's over
let's write again they have the loudness
like they're not move around and also
this part what we could try it maybe
comparing it against the taotronics part
X which is the same price range also a
bit smaller so even the adamant that
this is small does not count is it's not
that small anymore so there's no excuse
for that sound yeah let's check another
phone let's see the Optronics is all I
have to turn off this first grade I yeah
goodbye and let's connect to the laptop
tronics pulse X probably yeah here it is
and this will probably move again if you
increase volume slightly let's see if
this is you know volume is at maximum
and let's try another track
hypnotic pre-boarding self is an
excellent business to find like a
decorated patient
on trips and verification became really
here on the Speaker Boehner then in my
business comparable although the park
exit not perfected like the floor is an
oxygen
yes dragon high-level because of the
strong me emphasis on lack of parentage
they marketed simply found posh and
helped quite a bit
increasing volume commitment exceed the
hostage and compete
Oh
Oh
they must be disliked in all of us the
murder story should be shelter it
definitely is one of the the largest
piece of in this privately
of the Optronics kind of completion
overall being quite a lot together but
the volume curve is really strange and
you can hear this is the very first
volume step or let's say where is it I
disappeared funny okay what happened
just it cannot play any softer which is
of course unusable I mean at high levels
if you thought it cannot play soft and
sound harder so just to conclude all
this about the mask you can see 53 years
I will definitely return it it's a chunk
it's pure junk with some tools there
would be potential but yeah you've heard
or you're seeing the heavy adjustment it
needs yeah nothing else to say about the
master cube I would definitely avoid it
by all means
yeah just nice design and a copy of the
FIFA like this
FIFA Helsinki copy so this tries to
simulate a bit later and this if if I
think it both of course no wear clothes
not even comparable but this still
sounds better than this although cannot
play as long okay thanks a lot for
watching I hope this was helpful a bit
to make you avoid buying this junk and
compare it against some others from my
speaker audio database and you will hear
that it's pretty loud but all this just
yeah it's not in leverage it's it's it's
pretty horrible so I'm not sure what the
reviewer here really thinks he tries to
sell the speaker his box a plate or wipe
the floor with his JBL flip 3 I mean
come on this is what is incomparable
this is yeah so thanks again and see you
in the next video
have a nice time it bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
