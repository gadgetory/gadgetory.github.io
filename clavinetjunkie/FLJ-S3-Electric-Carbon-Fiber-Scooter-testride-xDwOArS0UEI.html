outside and getting a bit bored with all
these indoor speaker test videos
measurement and so on therefore today to
something completely different
I bought this electric scooter from
Aliexpress for 380 euros including
shipping import fees taxes and so on
and I think it's really worth mentioning
especially considering the price
originally I bought it for my wife so
when I go riding with my son she can
keep up with us but in the mean time I
use it much more often by myself is it
so much fun before taking write together
some facts about it this is a carbon
fiber scooter so pretty light and it can
also be folded for a more complex design
and like this you can easily carry it
around and it also fits into a smaller
car trunk so for the town if you have to
cover shunt some shorter distances it's
pretty nice
this model has a pen empar spittle
inside there is also a smaller cheaper
model but the do one should give you
according to the manufacturer around 35
kilometers mixing which with my weight
around hundred kilograms I doubt it will
give me half the weight from what I have
tested now
I still haven't fully discharged it yet
but we will do this maybe in the next
video
yeah apart from that you also have a
nice light here you can see so you can
even use it at night there is some
backlight here which is activated when
there is a movement pretty funny and
yeah let's take a ride together I will
get my head cam and we will do some two
kilometers maybe I'm standing here in
alarms this is April 12 and awake which
goes to hiding clothes and later on to
batten but we will probably stop at
Milan as the way is not that great from
there so I will grab my head cam also
below and microphone so you get a better
first-person view
I hope it's quite immersive for you and
let's take a ride to accelerate here is
the throttle at the right to brake at
the left I will put in their foot and we
can start with the first gear
so this is the top speeds you can
achieve with the first gear and my
weight we are 10 km/h maybe so let's
switch over to second gear
it's already a big better
according to the display we are 18 km/h
now
already quite nice headgear
so to give us around
24:23 km/h in our
and I think is already really nice nice
kids who still feel quite secure but
also manage longer distances
I hope you enjoy the landscape here
and you should also here for my binaural
microphones how loud the coder is
and it's pretty silent
my son is also an electric scooter a
very cheap one
extremely not so this one is really
nicely
silence so let's see again 24 hours 24
km/h I think the post you can achieve
with my weight not sure if it can become
much faster
with a lighter driver and now let's
check out the brakes here is a slight
downhill part yeah full brake is not
possible but it breaks nicely also not
sure if this braking is regenerative or
something if it can recharge the
batteries again if you brake
I think not maybe not that advanced
I also think that the battery is needed
for 35 kilometers maximum distance I
taught meet with my weight I hardly will
get even half the distance I still don't
have any real value but a photo will do
this next time and check out how far I
can get open also no idea if this could
all become slower bit by bit or if it
will simply stop then when the battery
becomes an entity not sure now you can
see it's really nice so the feeling you
get is if you are driving or if you were
riding a bicycle not so fast
it's too fast you can always slow down
to second gear when it when it becomes a
bit more crowded maybe or first gear
likely experience that's pretty slow no
well according to the 14 km/h so let's
do again third gear
this is a nice flat part here but
people Park the scooter has some
problems with my weight so
really higher slopes are hard to make
I think we should test around 1
kilometer maybe one of the house now
and three shows will have two bars have
disappeared but this battery display is
also very dynamic so it changes all the
time if you accelerate the display goes
down then again when you stop it becomes
fully charged so you really cannot trust
it much so here is some dirt access
street
I will slow down yeah the brake is nice
you can also adjust the amount of brake
there are some hidden settings
I also adjusted the speed display a
little bit because it was way over
stated in the original statement there
is some video on YouTube it's nice today
there is some video YouTube from us from
another guy who gives you the correct
setting for a better and more correct
speed display so currently we are riding
around 23 km/h and again this is quite
nice much faster with the scooter it
would become a very big dangerous
although there is a front suspension at
the front wheel yes you can hear it
not not executing some stone or some
other obstacle is lying around
so we are torching piling in front of us
you can already see snow smiling over
there
I think the dripping photo should be
around 2 kilometers maybe slightly north
I hope you enjoy little bit
and we are arriving at the end let's see
if I can make the people part over there
so let's speed up now I should
definitely do it but you can hear how it
straddles every bit so we are here I
think there's lots of fun I hope you
enjoyed it as well a little bit although
I shouldn't use it that often because it
comes really addictive and I will become
even better
so I think it's really a nice scooter
especially for the price 380 OS is not
much also top speed is great 25 km/h
even with my weight but deeper parts can
be a bit tricky I also cannot quite
trust that better indicator is it moves
around all the time during the right we
already lost two or three bars currently
it still shows full so I really cannot
believe their maximum reach of 35
kilometers so I thought we will do
another test well well I will ride the
scooter until the battery becomes empty
and to make it not so boring
I bought this nice bottle holder here
that I can mount the front and I will
put the Bose Soundlink revolves inside
the Bose Soundlink evolves became
something like my favorite portable
speaker currently because of the great
only directional sound nice battery life
great sound overall so I will put it
here inside and we can listen to some
music during the ride
apart from that yeah only thing that's a
bit annoying is maybe the display which
is hardly visible in bright light so
also from a low angle it's better than
if you stand on the scooter you'll
hardly see anything yeah I hope you like
this scooter is definitely really nice I
enjoyed a lot but I really shouldn't
write it that often so stay tuned for
another test
I hope it's interesting for you if not
yeah don't watch it but this can become
maybe a bit longer I doubt it will be 35
kilometers maybe 15 with good luck with
my weight hundred kilograms
I cannot imagine if it will give me 17
or 18 kilometers so thanks a lot for
watching and see you in the next video
has a nice time bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
