you something I was working on during
the last couple of weeks it's still
working progress but I think it might
become quite a useful tool for comparing
speakers so let me introduce my
interactive audio comparison tool I'm
still not quite sure about the name I
thought about interactive speaker
comparison pool or interactive speaker
database whatever if you have a better
name let me know just let me show the
basic functionality quickly explain the
tool consists of two separate players
where you can add different videos just
for testing I have three videos and i
can add both to the first player and
then on to the second one and then we
can start playing and do some live
switching this is the ghost plane and
now you can hear the denim we have
different drawings for example funk or
house you can also add another speaker
to the first player now it's the JBL
charge and switch between both
the volume is in sync between both my
programmer is currently working on a
kind of real volume switch where you can
really hear this because with their
original volume my programmer also added
a search field because if we have let's
say 50 different speakers one would like
to filter for both and then it only
shows all both speakers as you can see
the basics are already finished my
program is still working on some
features improving of sync and so on I
also contacted lots of musicians if they
would like to contribute with their
songs for this tool I already got an
exclusive smooth jazz strike from
constant English Ronnie also soul
persona allowed me to use some of his
tracks for this tool I'm still looking
for the right house track for some jazz
maybe some rock I really want to have
many different genres covered when
everything is finished I will put it
online so that everyone can use this
tool and enjoy it until then please be
patient and have a nice time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
