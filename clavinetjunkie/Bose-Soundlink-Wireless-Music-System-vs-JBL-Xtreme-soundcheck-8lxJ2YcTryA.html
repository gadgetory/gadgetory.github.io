about my Bose Soundlink wireless music
system this is a kind of old timer in
the mean time and although I like the
speaker quite a lot I'm going to sell it
in my case it was replaced by the JBL
Xtreme not that the Xtreme is sounding
that much better in reality even that
Bose is a bit more balanced despite
being a boss but the JBL is simply more
racked it has a better battery and so on
but still impressive that the speaker
six-year-old can keep up with a very
actual and new design it's even based on
an older design on the bose sound TOC
portable that was released eight years
ago and it took other companies quite a
time to release something comparable
still the bose can play quite a bit
louder than the extreme but it doesn't
sound that great at maximum volume if I
match both so that the JBL is playing at
maximum and the bose with a comparable
volume i still think that the JBL sounds
a bit better because the bose is already
starting to lose a bit of punch and
dynamics and i thought as the last video
we should do some auto sound check to
see how they sound how they compare and
later on we will also go indoors and
check them at normal listening levels
the JBL is still a bit more bass heavy
which is surprising because they're both
is not a slouch or on bass so I'm
wearing binaural microphones as always
please put up your headphones and have a
listen as you can see I tried building a
kind of primitive natural shelf and put
them closer to the floor as you might
know this increases bass response quite
a bit I will turn both on now they're
both needs a remote control to be turned
on and the JBL is playing at maximum
volume while the bose is matched to the
volume of the JBL extreme and later on
we will increase volume on both as well
but first let's start with metronome for
both I'm starting with the boss it's a
little bit windy so yeah I cannot avoid
it let's have a listen
I mean they are comparable in a volume
of sound and and bass response and so on
but the both can play much louder of
course over with quite a bit of
compression of distortion let's turn on
the bows for maximum now
you can hear that it's a bit struggling
but if you want to make noise
well it's noisy of course JBL mm oh yeah
this is quite a difference but GBL still
sounds well normal I will reduce volume
again to match them and let's try not a
threat
I would like to see how they sound from
from an ale how much thread of lost air
is the pose well they are quite similar
but let's try increase volume again on
the clothes yeah this is nearly well
twice as loud but of course not as
restrained as the JDL now there's lots
of distortion of ecology I would use
volume again let's write out a track and
let's see how far I can go away until
bluetooth connection connection breaks
up
yeah I'm in the Sun now in the JBL I
mean they are not extremely loud this is
not a speaker for or the whole village
like the Hiva XS 9 but it's loud enough
to make some small events of small party
with friends
now the boss again but between may be
here they are matched volume-wise but
the boss sounds a bit more forced
already with this song while the JBL
still sounds pretty good
there is still the sponge and everything
missing from the polls let's try a song
from
nocopyrightsounds these are mustard
really fat I mean they have already they
contain lots of compression already so
most speakers cannot compress much more
let's have a listen how both sound with
this
the JBL appeals at this lower volume but
I think this on the better more function
although I can increase volume again on
the post that's why
the result is not very convincing the
video is simply not pushed as far by the
engineers who filmed it although I think
it could be made even a bit louder with
more DSP processing more compression and
so on the boss I cannot let you me
they're very noisy very distorted okay
let's go indoors now now let's check out
why they compared at normal listing
levels I will be playing them it
slightly above half volume and starting
with the boss
let's try not a trick
became something else
Oh
or something like that
yeah the extreme sounds a bit booming
with this trend
there are some first hints of distortion
away
yeah it's definitely an impressive
speaker for that age that it has I mean
both discontinued it of some years ago
already like the boss Sontag potable as
well the Soundlink air and the only
speaker which still has the same
acoustics is the suntouch 20 I think but
there is no portable speaker with this
with this acoustic core it's a bit a
pity because it's really it has lots of
potential I mean both simply took away
the dock part here and left it empty
they could have maybe even integrated
the battery inside so it would be even
smaller yeah if you can get one on eBay
cheaply I would definitely recommend it
because it's still a very very decent
speaker and I think it sounds a little
bit more balanced there is some
harshness in the treble of the post but
otherwise the bass which is deeper and
it's not as booming as the JBL with some
tracks the JBL already starts distorting
slightly above half especially
especially bass drums becoming a getting
this dirtiness which the bose is rather
missing and it's it plays very very loud
as we have heard so yeah this was my
last test of the post something while
it's music system it's going to another
owner now and yeah thanks for watching I
hope this was helpful for anyone still
interested in this vintage speaker I
think it's great it was great it's still
great and competes with speakers which
are well now currently on the market
thanks a lot for watching and see you in
the next video bye-bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
