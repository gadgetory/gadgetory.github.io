club's gig after we've heard the cheaper
ANCA premium speaker last time I think
the club's gig is another interesting
low budget solution currently I already
had this because some time ago and
tested it but was not too impressed I
mean but back then it costs $200.00
meanwhile it can be found for about 70
80 dollars maybe even lower in Germany
it was sold for 59 euros some days ago
so for that for that price it's really
an impressive speaker if we have a look
at the frequency response you can see
that it's really flat and neutral you
have impressive bass response down to 60
Hertz and also impressive treble
extension with some peak at 19 kilohertz
but despite this nice measurement I
nevertheless think that it sounds a bit
boring so having a neutral and flat
frequency response doesn't automatically
mean that the speaker sounds great I
think it's missing a bit Sparkle a bit
excitement it's simply a flat we
neutralized ending speaker so for every
audio purist he will definitely like the
clip a gig but I thought we will compare
it with some other speakers like the JBL
charge 2 also some from balls like the
Soundlink color here and I would also
like to compare it with the denim in via
mini which costs a bit more but we will
see how this compares design-wise yeah
it's not bad it has a kind of premium
look you get also the strange stand I
don't know why it's for you can use it
like this standing upright or simply
like that so as always I will be using
my binaural microphones for the
recording please put up your headphones
and we will have a short listen I
thought we will start comparing the gig
against the JBL charge - you have to
clear away the stand to turn it on and
unlike most other speakers
the gig does not automatically connect
with Bluetooth you always have to select
it from the Bluetooth list maybe it
works better with NFC but well I don't
have any see on my iPhone
this is the confirmation tone and I will
start playing a track starting with the
gig first kind of 80s retro disco listen
to the bass
yes sounds much more mid focus but in
reality the geek is the speaker with
more truth frequency response the charge
sounds a bit harsh and you may be heard
it when this came in the treble started
to go away there is already some
compression going on although we don't
play them very very loud let's try the
JBL flip 3 of course it's not as bass
heavy as the gig but yeah we will have a
listen again geek playing first
yeah the gig sounds of course more
Maitre but the treble is a bit nicer on
the JBL flip three let's try the anchor
which is maybe even a bit cheaper than
the gig and have a listen to both it has
to connect first yeah no and again clip
first
typically and my hindrance
now tell me get to pick their your
pitches and textures
this was so bad she and
yeah the geek has this kind of a bit
boxy sound I think this is because of
the and there is some hump at 200 250
Hertz let's see if we can fix this with
a bit of EQ and also add some well some
sparkle to the treble which for my taste
is simply missing I will start playing I
prepared an equaliser already
I hope it's visible i boosted 250 or I
took away 250 Hertz about 60 B and I
boosted 12 kilo Hertz for 5 dB
let's have a listen this is without EQ
first and then I will turn on EQ so that
you hear the difference yet without the
Q and now I will turn on a comb
I took away this drowning of the bass
and edits a little bit of sparkle to the
treble maybe you hear it again with all
the bass has this boxy character
so yeah it's possible to fix the sound a
bit it sounds not present with Epicure
let's try how it compares against some
speakers from from Bose I have the
Soundlink color here definitely not a
bad speaker for $100 or something but
the clip geek has what I think more
major sound or more natural let's let's
call it like that
I'm starting out with the geek in this
case I definitely prefer the geek
the pace has more punch and the mix are
not as harsh as with the Bose Wave which
tends to sound a bit I don't know cheap
if it's sizzling
but without real treble definition let's
try the Bose Soundlink mini what I
didn't mention yet is that the gig
doesn't apply any loudness compensation
so at low level so you won't get this
crazy bass boosters from the Bose it
sounds thinner not as meaty not as fat
but the next track we will have a listen
at high levels it's quite a bass heavy
recordings and we will see how both
manage I'm starting again with the gig
first both speakers are already
struggling a bit with bass bass from the
10th a bit to distort let's have a
listen
there is some drowning from the base but
the boss is not that much better
it's that base the rounds everything
else away let's listen to another track
which is even more extreme I think the
base is not clean
still I think the gig is a bit better
but I thought we will have a listen for
the Denon environment which of course is
not as place heavy but maybe it manages
to perform it better here it is and
again the same track but with the gig
playing first
this drowning is simply missing
it sounds cleaner open I mean very broad
compared to the gig
I think this is quite a difference let's
listen to another track where you should
hear the difference in in stereo
separation in imaging and so on
again geek first it sounds like a huge
speaker of course not as bass heavy but
very nature is very restrained
yeah I think the difference is pretty
obvious well last but not least I
thought we will have a listen
maybe the JBL chat or let's have a
listen to the anchor again and I will
play both at maximum but we'll put them
away more towards the wall back here and
we will try a house track the anchor is
not connected let's see why because I'm
still connected with the denim so anchor
I will turn both to maximum and let's
have a listen to - well yeah a house
track from nocopyrightsounds maybe not
house but small dance let's see how both
perform which one distorts more and so
on which one is louder yeah
this is the key
I think I would like to know how both
performs with the same song both
sometimes does really funny effects so
let's have a listen again
at maximum volume and the geek playing
first again
this is both sound here yeah I think
with the current price tag this is
really a highly recommended speaker I
mean I wouldn't have bought it for 200
but for 70 $80 it's it's one of the
better speakers it depends which you
like more the anchor is not bad either
I think the clip is a little bit more
solid more neutral sounding also more
natural you can add a little bit of
sparkle with EQ as we have heard the
anchor has more dips and and hills
regarding frequency response but both
are great speakers for that price simply
outperforming all other contenders like
the shark boombox I don't I really don't
understand how it can get such high
ratings it's simply a teeny well toy
sounding speaker this is completely
different so yeah I in some regards it
even sounds better than the Bose as
we've heard that mixing bottom the post
sounded like like some some special
effect or something so yeah I hope I
could give you a little bit of an
insight about the clip geek
one year ago when I tested it the first
time I was not that impressed but I
tried comparing it with the Bose which
was simply bass heavy and so on the clip
is not as bass heavy but it's simply not
boosted the bass is there it's deep it's
even I think deeper than the post but
it's not it doesn't have this artificial
boosts therefore the clip sounds more
true yeah I hope this was helpful I hope
you liked it somehow and some other low
budget surprises will be coming up so
stay tuned for the next video until then
had a nice time and bye bye
so at low levels it will definitely
sound thinner that Bose has a very
boosted sound well okay I say</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
