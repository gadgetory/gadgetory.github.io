you some first and quick impressions
about what the pros new speakers from
the own mighty room lined up the drum
fire and the portable air on c3 I'm
recording this with an artificial head
so he was headphones for the most
immersive interesting sound impression
around three meters away use my voice as
an honest reference and trace the volume
to such a degree that you hear me
realistically as if you'd be standing to
there with me in this room yet first
some facts about the speaker this is the
drone fire it consists of two separate
parts is a stationary unit so it has to
be attached remains but the main part
can be also used whether star over but
then we have to reattach it completely
then it was switched to wear for much
more than say today with that sound the
sound is very thick very meaty so if you
like to listen to such kind of music
it's not the right speaker for you but
now this is the main part playing
already switched anymore so early
Twitter's food travels do not pay that
much base
beautiful
equipped with Wi-Fi just like that
vampire now I'm connected through
bluetooth wait and this is that some of
the c3 also with default settings the
same problem here it's very warm
oh I meant increased rattles lightly
when impressed with this idea both are
equipped with Wi-Fi so you can use them
set them up as a module system even as a
stereo pair and what I like there are
four preset buttons I set it up with
some radio stations so first one is
launch FM from Austin and you don't need
any phone just press the button wakes up
of course also same some negatives here
and I think that you can of course set
up differently so they see if we will
play other stations like this and you
can of course connect them together let
me try
play some music from mine from from here
mmm you have lots of options from
Spotify these are whatever I will play
it from a music what the it doesn't
offer you is connection to your drive
your network drive I hope this will come
so I would simply play some songs from
from my phone
it's right underwater laugh from so
compasses future which I cannot
if you take the left channel the other
one the right one or if they play in
separate rooms and the problem
Oh
is not perfectly
so it's not so nice thing is of course
there's a c3 is portable with great
battery life I had it playing in my
garden from Wi-Fi internet radio for the
whole day and it still hit 60% lives so
audio proclaims 9 hours at the mixin
volume which would be really impressive
of course over Wi-Fi it will be probably
a bit less then over Bluetooth as Wi-Fi
needs more energy but I think the sounds
of the series already quite make sure
enough to really enjoy it I like it at
low levels I like it at high levels and
the ability to have a very easy to setup
marketing system is also nice I will
drag this c3 again below something will
become separate
the drum file stomping only direction so
I have to change this again
stop it sometime I will switch over to
blue to the game and some other songs
so I will try to add both to my database
I think the c3 means morale boost let me
try another song again what I have here
without it sounds a little bit too too
too warm for me not muddy space like
this yeah this was helpful to do some
very impression man unboxing was a bit
rushed
we just came back and I saw the huge
packages I had to open them and set the
camera up now I used a bit more I love
them a lot although as a main system
much were it's a bit mono you would need
a second one which of course will become
a bit pricey so I prefer using my t 20s
instead they don't take any Wi-Fi
functions but you can I could add this
only Pro connect there is some something
400 euros to also add the same maximum
function so I could connect them all
together yeah I will get try to attend
to my database the C 3 maker with
default settings and with some purpose
as I think it will compare better with
rebels and drawn fire with default
settings although I'm not sure how to
said that the some of us will get
correct sound let's say I think both
laugh so twelve O'Clock should be okay
yeah thanks for watching and coming up
some further videos we could compare
them against the t twenties which cost
what is the same
but don't have these Wi-Fi functions
also of course a full review of the
audio Pro I don't see three which I like
a lot definitely currently my favorite
speaker because the Sun is so nice with
some Protestants also because of the
functions just press a button and you
should play a radio station they can
launch a fan that's probably it was said
to so the volume it has three separate
volumes one is the Wi-Fi volume 1 is the
bluetooth volume and one is probably
from auxilary the problem is not instant
except with Wi-Fi if I change volume
here it will be changed here as well but
for Bluetooth they are separate so I
usually set it to maximum then I control
it from my iPhone
what I miss our track controls on both
the cannot switch tracks directly from
the speaker yeah I think I covered all
thanks for watching and see you then bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
