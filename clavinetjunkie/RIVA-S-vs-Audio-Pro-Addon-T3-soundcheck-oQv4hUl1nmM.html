s compares against some bigger and more
serious because like for example the
audio pro I don't III I have here I
thought I would play some songs to give
you an idea as always using binaural
microphones for the recording so please
listen with headphones for the best
results please keep in mind the
difference in size between both
price-wise they should be more or less
the same the Riva s $250 why I already
saw the t-34 260 euros and as you can
see I set them up both a one above the
other so that we sit in the center to
hear their stereo separation if there is
any otherwise you hear always want to
become more to the left more to the
right but in this case we will hear them
exactly centered and what I didn't show
you is how you can remotely control the
speaker from the app it's in off or
let's say standby mode and I can turn it
on remotely from the app the same you
can do with here with Ultimate Ears mega
boom I can also turn it off again and I
thought we will check out some some
songs now
this is the t3
you don't get any kind of well
spaciousness it's all there while with
the river because of the side drivers
probably fills the whole room with sound
we can also turn off this surround again
of course I can do this from their app
as well
turning on surround or off
you
again another song you can see surround
is still on it depends on the song
sometimes it doesn't sound that good but
with some songs it's really impressive I
can really hear it some sound stage in
front of me
more than two three
it's not that impressive let's say I
mean it sounds good and decent frequency
response but
I will turn off surround again
and let's try another song some rock or
something
Hey
me
it gives something else this song I
always use well at the very beginning
which I liked quite a lot
the t3 simply misses this openness
the reverse sounds simply broader and
larger I mean it doesn't have that
strong base of the t3 you'll give this
with another song in this case it's even
comparable
let's try surround again
got some salt asana 12:1 one of my
favorites you can hear much more bass
but is some still full body funny it
doesn't something in any way let's try
this and I will start increasing volume
to maximum slowly to show you simply the
difference in overall loudness between
these two
so the rear ice is at maximum now
another degree
but I think we can hear that the t3
boosts treble quite a lot at higher
levels so it doesn't sound true anymore
I will try to match them so River is
playing at maximum while the t3 smashed
volume life
yeah the small Rivas simply cannot
compete anymore at higher levels but
yeah has already said look at the
difference in size between both I mean
the reverse would probably go four or
five times inside so for this it's
really impressive I think it's not a
party speaker but neither is the t3 it
struggles a bit at higher levels you
will need others because but for
travelling I think this is really really
interesting and serious sounding speaker
um yeah
to conclude I will turn it off again
through the app and yeah thanks for
watching I hope this was helpful and we
will see us in the next video just a
short teaser I got this one here this is
the saw in transit XS a pretty decent
sounding speaker effort for its size not
very loud but well among all those hand
or pocket sights because it's definitely
one of the best not very cheap but still
pretty decent if you are after serious
sound in a small form factor the saw an
audio transit access really does the
trick this is a nice figure I got from a
from a hi-fi exhibition here in Vienna
called clong buildin and this is from
new bed newbie this is their there I
don't know muscat him their figure so
everything is speaker related again
thanks a lot for watching and yeah
bye-bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
