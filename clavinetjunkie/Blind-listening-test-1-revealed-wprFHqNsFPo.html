longer and would like to reveal which
because we're actually playing in my
last blind listening video I would also
like to say thanks to everyone who
commented and was brave enough guessing
which because we're playing it's
impressive that some really got all four
right yes all congratulations
but yet I don't want to talk any longer
please have a listen and check them out
Oh
so you say you know what I call the
mystery of me
unfortunately that's just the way it's
gotta be
what we it's not about now it's not
about yesterday it's all about so I wish
you wish you clarity wish you Joey
serenity
you
yeah I think there may have been some
surprises for many indeed speaker D got
most loads for being best followed by
speaker B speaker C was regarded as
being worst by most but some still
claims because C to be best which is
strange I mean it's not a bad sounding
speaker but it's it really sounds weird
I mean stereo separation is nice but the
frequency is a bit screwed up that bass
plays along and the music not together
and the balls being well comparable to
the JBL
some preferred a some prefer deep but
many couldn't well couldn't quite decide
so it seems as we will compare the river
is against the JBL charge - again I will
prepare maybe some other tracks so we
can well we can again start guessing
because with these tracks you already
know which speaker is which so for the
next video I will try doing again a
blind listening test with the river and
the JBL charge tool but choosing some
other music maybe so that yeah we can
start from scratch I hope you enjoyed
this everything or maybe I can do
similar videos for for bigger speakers I
thought about the FIFA Helsinki maybe
the ban on Dolph some do play a to the
powers and Wilkins t7 which would
probably well be heard as worst I don't
know it's might be interesting so stay
tuned for more yeah thanks for watching
and bye bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
