wanted to show all sony ericsson pick 30
owners how to charge this pick up by USB
or even a power bank and not true what
sony was thinking when they decided to
go for a proprietary charger with an own
connector although the speaker still
only need 5 volts so it should be easily
possible to charge it by USB but sony
said no still there are some fitting
cables on a market like this one with
the right connector at this end and USB
on the other one i will take a power
bank this is from anchor with two ports
I will attach it here this end at the
speaker and as you can see it is charged
immediately so technically it's possible
just Sony said yeah we don't want this
this cable is from all night they come
in a dual tech so two are included for
the price of 6 or $7 or you can simply
sell the other one to a friend or
something so for $3 I think it's worth
it you can charge the speak on the go or
you don't need to take this power brick
but also especially from Sony the
speaker won't be charged when it's on so
yeah you have to turn it off for being
trashed and really not sure they really
castrate or crippled s because also hear
the sound the defaults tuning simply off
you need to adjust the sound through the
Sony song palate at least it says within
a speaker but still I am really not sure
technically stone is really great but
somehow they always screw it up but at
least now you have the option to charge
it by USB
I've added the link to my description of
the video it's from all night then you
can find it even for cheaper from China
or something but I think for $6,000
definitely nice to have the option to
charge the speaker by USB yeah just
wanted to share this with you I got this
from a German high five forum a guy
posted this so thanks to him for letting
us know about the right cable yeah you
need simply the right connector and it
already is charged by 5 volts there for
USB charging could easily implement it
from the beginning but Sony didn't do it
maybe the XP 300 will have it them so I
hope this was helpful for anyone who
always looked for a front option or who
thought I won't buy it because it needs
a non-public it doesn't
just need a cable a fitting one this one
is from all knives but you can
definitely find others as well so thanks
a lot for watching and see you in the
next video given assignment bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
