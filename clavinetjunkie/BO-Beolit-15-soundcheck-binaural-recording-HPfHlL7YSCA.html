bank on all of the story in VMs in Gaza
they just got the brand new billet 15
they also have the old be elite 12 my
fault
we'll have a listen how the new one
compares let's get inside and have a
listen okay here they are as you can see
we have the old billet 12 here and the
new billet 15 they look more or less
similar the old one was an airplay
system at with 2.1 speakers one huge
woofer and - Twitter's the new one has
bluetooth instead with FX support and
the acoustic car was completely
overworked it has a huge main driver two
passive radiators at the sides -
Twitter's at the edges and one Twitter
at the back so you should get an
omnidirectional sound close to a 360
degree to see how they compare I will
wear binaural microphones in my ears
this way you should get a quite
realistic impression of how they sound
in reality assumed you are using really
good headphones in my case I'm using the
PIO play h6 not because I'm affiliated
in some way with Bang &amp;amp; Olufsen but
rather because they really sound great
it's a pretty nice flat natural sounding
headphone so put them up and enjoy they
are both connected now I will start
playing some tunes starting with the
bill 812 and then switching over to the
15 back and forth
this is Ranelagh trick
we know no one says a thing why I think
they all asleep
yeah I was on the side
this way
let's try another track again bewdley 12
plane first
I reduce the game of my recorder now and
turn both speakers up to the maximum
let's see which one can play louder
I will go away a bit father to avoid any
Distortion
people always asking for a rock track so
this time I chose one extra for you
again both playing at their maximum
volume
you
you
I think you felt that the bewdley 12 is
a bit more powerful but it's also more
muffled not quite close to the
360-degree sound of the billet 415 now I
have the PIO plane a 2 here so let's see
how this one compares to the bigger and
more expensive Bo lead 15 okay this time
I'll start playing with the a2 first and
then switch over to the pure lead 15
okay thanks for watching I hope this
video was helpful a little bit
let's see us next time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
