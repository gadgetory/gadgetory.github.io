Pro which I presented some days ago
today we'll take a look at another new
release from those or other two releases
the ego and the ego tool but you can see
the ego is just an ego to cut by half so
I think this is a little bit more
interesting overall and I got mainly
interested in this as it might be quite
a bit of the Libra tone tone you can see
this any small is the same maybe
remember the Libra tone quite a nice
speaker with omnidirectional sound not
the greatest sounding one still quite
okay so I hope this would at least come
close but this is of course way cheaper
so on Amazon you can find it for $35 and
here it says great sound extra bass IPX
six rated 12 for drivers 12-hour battery
time also customer reviews are mostly
positive but it's hard to judge the
sound from all these videos which will
do by ourselves yeah it's always amusing
binaural microphones so you should
listen with headphones for the best
results I will play some tunes and we
can have a listen first let's turn it on
the same tones you get from the song box
Excel and of course when a company has a
product like the Sun box Excel which is
yeah quite a deal-breaker I would say
the expectations for a speaker like this
are also high and unfortunately they
cannot be fulfilled here I will compare
it maybe against the tribal ex encore
similar price although currently it's
available on this count you can get it
for $28 so more compared to the smaller
one but we will unbox this later on
first let's have a listen to this and
let's start with the DOS ego ego - sorry
again if you notice somebody from my
previous videos you will notice if we
get again this strange compression show
that we had from the sandbox bra so
obviously it's the same bad tried it
let's turn it on much louder and you can
see doesn't have anything of this
compression but also fool√≠s sounds more
bass heavy
despite being smaller
because again the tuning is nice nice
travel everything but again this volume
pumping it's like this you can hear a
much fuller sign maybe Travis notice we
find Sunday became so far because of
this limitation
please one gonna try it this way
everything here it's hard lot and if you
came softer again more than a me
it sounds a little you probably also
need to I guess I heard from users and
Android users that they don't have
issues with the sample so hopefully this
can be corrected in a few traffic this
for this and maybe this reduce volume
slightly you can hear there's no
adjustment on all levels why the tribe
it will sound way bigger now
so for low levels it's not really fun to
listen to but let's do the opposite
let's increase them to maximum I think
that those won't change the sound at all
so it will remain the same something can
hear no place without cheat so it makes
you a spider pay the try bit on the
other hand will reduce base mind more so
let's see which one becomes better
now that sounds more powerful more the
operates from the traffic so the tribe
it became a litte bit worse long but as
soon as we lose volume again it improves
why the dose becomes rather worse so
what you try is the smaller one UDP and
compete here a quick unboxing so
design-wise the same just yeah cut by
half I will turn this on so we can hear
but it's a little bit larger as you can
see so it's not really half it's more
than this and yeah let's start
am i connect it already or not obviously
not it should automatically reconnect
but it didn't not sure why
No
and let's try another fact again II go
to first
this compression show really destroys
the music here the smaller one why is it
so loud in here it misses this
refinement from the bigger one
sounds laughed and muttered great the
travel is strange
so this one definitions houndred
but not necessarily bigger let's release
track travel is definitely nice so the
tuning is definitely worse from the
smaller one
let's try if there is some difference in
laughter's between store assuming the v1
has two drivers with Stella the small
one has just one driver so this is
Maxima on the big one or the small one
some frequency boost in the six seven
cubed ice region so this sounds
definitely nicer yeah but now with the
discount the I think the smaller one
costs twenty-five dollars so they have
quite close to the traffic let's compare
these two again I will turn this off and
let's put the drive it beside so 25 27
28 dollars yet check my video
description there is the discount code
I think the tribe it is definitely a
much better deal here mmm I'm connected
to both and an R track
drive it much bigger more exciting
zombie yeah this I think it doesn't make
sense to come any further for two
dollars more yeah this is way better
I measured both and you can see the
larger ego tool and the overall
frequency response is quite balanced but
lack of base is quite obvious so below
200 Hertz is not much apart from that I
think it measures quite nicely and
natural but at low levels no adjustment
while it has hardly any base reduction
so that would be definitely some
potential with additional DSP processing
even a smaller one overlaid in green and
you can see they measure similar but the
smaller one has some presence boost and
also some peak at around 10 kilohertz
which doesn't sound that great you can
see upper base is more boosted and from
the bigger one but it was of even
earlier so overall not that great I
would say but what surprised me is there
are other natural frequency response of
the big one despite some lack of base
this reminded me quite a bit of the
denim and I am but this is four or five
years old so I think today's speakers
should at least come close to this I
will start again with the dos ego tune
and another track
here they sound similar but denim has
just I suppose necess on stage because
of this stereo enhanced processing here
and the compression chigan button that
you can hear the frequency response is
not bad just liking bass and too much
compression it's like this they should
squeeze out more bass all of this sighs
look I mean the demo is not larger
I still like the down or voice not
depressed anymore it is such a great
speaker really enjoyable they're too
little place a button that you can hear
people's responses really okay which
others and maybe let's list at maximum
I think the dose becomes quite usable at
maximum
despite some compression services the
denim maximum volume the dose give you
more powerful
yeah certainly the boss sounds better
here so you can see the secret is just
clever DSP processing nothing else the
drivers would have the potential to to
to get more to pump out more sound the
Denon was already struggling it makes
him I think it was makes him yeah it
doesn't so must be we are at 2018 this
was 2014 I think when it was released or
2013
I think today's speaker should have yeah
adequate sound compared to the denim if
it wants to be successful look at the
travitt it's not as great as the Denon
but for current price $28 I think is
limited until beginning of September so
if you don't have it yet and I'm
interested in for a great price get that
rabbit but with the distal not
distortion but compression issues
currently I wouldn't recommend the dose
I am not sure if there is even a DSP
inside but with some DSP it could be
definitely brought to a much higher
level just keep the base as high as
possible
and then reduce it again if volume
increases I'm even more underwhelmed by
the smaller one because the tuning is
off with the strange peak at 10
kilohertz also too much in the presence
here they have exactly opposite they
rather took out presence to make it
sound smoother this sounds a little
harsh and not really that great so I
hope this video could give an idea about
the dose ego and ego tool or ego and ego
tone compared to some other ones then on
my old favorite classic really great
speaker but you could hear it maximum it
it had no chance against this so it's
just DSP thanks out for watching and see
you in the next video have a nice time
