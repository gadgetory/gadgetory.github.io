going to have a look at another
low-budget speaker this is the soundbot
SB 525 currently it goes on Amazon for
only $35 so pretty cheap and just seven
dollars more expensive than this one's
angled three crap we just heard recently
someone suggested to me that I should
try it out I had a look and I think it
looks really promising also interesting
just like like some JBL charge to
knockoff but a really blatant one you
can see the same basically it has the
same design same layout so it could be
of course interesting to hear how this
cheap copy sounds compared to the
original but unfortunately this because
only available in the US so thanks to my
viewer to my trusty viewer Sandra she
sent this to me to go this owns angle
three so that we can check it out and
yes see if it's really worth it yeah
before having a listen maybe let's check
out some frequency response measurement
and first I thought it would probably
measure like some JBL charge to well but
in reality it doesn't so here you can
see the soundbot and yeah rather natural
except this high treble peak at nine
kilo Hertz if we overlay the JBL charge
tool here you can see that it measures
and also sounds completely different but
then I thought it reminds me some of the
charge three so when we overlay the
charge three here in gray you can see
that yeah they are both pretty similar
just the treble is quite different on
the charge - it has the peak slightly
higher and doesn't roll off a steep with
treble Deborah maybe the soundbot has
this nine kilohertz peak - to mask some
treble and miss some missing treble
above 10 kilohertz and when looking at
some lower volume steps you can see that
the soundbot even has slightly more bass
but at high levels it reduces bass more
than the charge 3 and it also cannot
play as loud at maximum it distorts
quite a bit so it's rather comparable to
the loudness of the charge - but with
the base of the charge 3 therefore yeah
it's of course interesting to check out
how it sounds as always I'm using
binaural microphones so please listen to
that phone
I will turn it on and yeah let's check
it compare against the JBL charge 3
which costs quite a bit more I will
start with the soundbot and yeah let's
have a listen trash free you can hear
the both head at tribal problem
but in this case the sample you may be
sound slightly more convincing both
don't solve some debt right with treble
but of course it depends on the kind of
recording also kind of music let's try
maybe some jazzy funk track the charge
tree has slightly smoother treble but
gives a similar muffled impression as
the sound board but you can hear that
the bass is pretty similar law just like
seen from the measurement something else
it's a really very powerful sound just
like a charged Reed
for $35 on me this sounds a little bit
clearer here maybe not attract yeah
yeah I'm crazy I'm called the sharp-eyed
nakedness and also green leaves equality
with mr. cream strong when they strive
with the best huh
the wall like a tribe called quest's so
many favors the basket of promise is ice
cream it is a trek from kept yak and
here you will notice that the Chari
starts to sound a bit more powerful with
bass touch him
here overall quite a bit more refined
but still for $35 if you are base lava
this is pretty impressive of course with
this is from soul persona together
princess freesia
so final recordings let's save the
difference in travel will be will become
more Atlas sounds really muffled edges
there charge tree is definitely much
better here or some smooth chest track
here you can reach this resonant peak is
quite noticeable here patrasche mean it
sounds definitely better I mean it's
also much more expensive
but you know we could maybe correct some
of the sound here
as always I'm using this is equal ten
for example a by the way sorry and we
will use a track from Seoul / freesia
this is without EQ now I prepared a
preset which produces 200 Hertz slightly
reduces that peak at nine kilo Hertz and
boosts upper treble a lot s up a double
is completely missing this is a track
I'm also using on my database and you
will hear how it sounds with some EQ
adjustment and some play it sounds more
comparable to a charge tool
so reducing peak and boosting upper
travel slightly helps definitely a lot
again without this is the sound you'll
get yeah
it's a pity they could have definitely
tuned it much better but let's get back
to our comparison against the charge
three or maybe some rock track and it
doesn't sound bad but it could have
definitely be much better than it is now
yeah this has a much finer sound somehow
with some dance tracks
because maybe try reducing volume on
both okay pick the store track so far
she finishes haha so yeah sorry for the
short break but my camera didn't have
any charge left in simply turned off but
where did we stop at low levels so let's
start again with the soundbot
the charge tree sounds a bit clearer but
also thinner
let's put them far away and turn to
maximum to see the difference in
loudness and also I have to be careful
here they didn't even change the base of
the charge tool so they didn't redesign
it I will turn the sound back to maximum
we are not very loud the charge free as
well
now track in the meantime we can replace
solve for that the lightning change a
charge free yet is this maximum I mean
there is difference in loudness but not
better each day to be there what it's
still quite a pain loudness wise
although not very clean sounding anymore
to charge through again
so now the slicer sounds what cannot
quite complete it's more comparable to
the charge - maybe that's why this
touch screen difference is pretty
obvious
Oh
but what we could also tries maybe
comparing the soundbot against the the
angle there oontz
angle 3 let's turn this on
also check out sound quality and
loudness although this is really loud
but still loud doesn't automatically
mean great sorry this was that bluetooth
button here is the power button they
even put in some sticker so that you'll
find it and yeah let's see if it's
connected it is and I will start with
the ones not with a sound pop this is
not maximum now but
now they're hones I mean this is
ridiculous
I will turn it up again a little bit
maybe this sounds really harsh there for
the Sun but if you see more mother's
knowledge I will turn both to maximum
the sample the soil
you
is this a pretty great difference in
loudness this is the soundbot now still
I think at maximum the ends gets a
little bit more bass punch avoid also
this horse quality
so yeah loudest why's the ones angle is
hard to beat in this price range maybe
even one of the loudest speaker speakers
in for around 20 $30 I'll put them again
a bit closer
first I have to reduce volume on the
housing otherwise it will play at
maximum and yeah maybe some other track
from soul persona but you can hear at
normal listening levels they simply
sucks big time the soundbot avoided
muffled sounds much better
is it it's also hard to match volume
football face this one has much more
bass while the other one what I think
for yeah seven dollars more if you like
bass I mean this is real bass so I think
it's worth worth more than this anchor
sound got all n Cassandra the UN's no.3
I'm getting a bit confused still it's a
bit of a pity that they didn't really
make it as great as it could have been
also they just copied the charge two or
three design but they didn't try to
improve it with maybe even drivers at
the back so you get a more only
directional sound slightly better tuning
this base of food here is the same as it
was on the charge too so it tends to
roll away especially if you put it on
some some some soft surface it doesn't
really stand stable they put even the
same here so they can also place it
vertically I mean it's a nice pickup for
$35 but it could have been definitely
much better you see this battery
indicator here you have to press the
battery button now it lost one dot
strange
you can skip between drags with I think
let's try you have to keep button
pressed for volume change and press
hotly for yeah so it has everything you
need including hands-free and so on but
sound wise it's not perfect you read it
it's great bass performer very similar
to the charge tree although it doesn't
have the same power charge we can play
much louder this reduces bass earlier
and also cannot play as loud and
distorts quite a bit at maximum of
course it's already within the database
together with the un's angle 3 you can
compare them both I think this is for
just seven dollars more if you like bass
it's much better
although not as loud but you will hear
this once Anil is one of the thinnest
sounding it within the database even the
smallest ones like the on may currents
on somehow have more punches in this so
not quite sure what they attuned here I
mean this is the neither treble is great
nor anything so I hope this could give
you an idea about the soundbot SB 525 I
was really curious to hear it as I
thought it would be more a JB a charge
to copy but in reality it's rather a
charge 3 copy with charge to design it's
not perfect and could have been
definitely better but yet still quite
nice for $35 if you like bass you will
probably like this on but also with some
EQ adjustment if you have some great EQ
app or even some Android device with
with rooted device that you have a
global EQ you can definitely improve the
sound a lot by simply pulling down 200
slightly as the 200 Hertz boost is a bit
too big too huge and take down this 9
kilohertz peak and add upper treble as
much as possible as it's completely
lacking up a treble therefore yeah so I
hope you liked it I hope it was helpful
thanks all for watching and see you in
the next video
have a nice time and bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
