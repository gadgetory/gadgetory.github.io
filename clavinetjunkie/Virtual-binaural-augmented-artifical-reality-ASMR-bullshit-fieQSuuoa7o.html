it was so tempting but back to our
localization test from last time I'm not
sure it was really that easy and it
really depends on the shape of your ears
and if they are similar to those
artificial ones then you should get a
quite realistic sense of up and down
also may be front and back also depends
a lot on the used headphones some has a
completely screwed up stereo imaging so
with others it might appeal even more
realistic if I throw this stone for
example you should maybe hear where it
is fallen but it's really not that easy
yeah let's reveal the test from a stand
I will play it again but this time
actually showing you which one was
playing so let's have a listen
pink
another thing you probably already know
is that these recordings are already
equalized so I really tries to bring
them as close to reality as possible but
I'm still not quite satisfied this and
process of hours tweaking listening
comparing sometimes I have to boost very
narrow bands or take them down to make
the sounds as close to reality as
possible
and I thought we'll have a listen again
to my advances because recall it with
the binaural is artificially is
equalized and with my traditional pseudo
binaural method also equalized and you
will hear that the years has better
imaging somehow you can really hear
there's the effect of this superficial
SPECT quite well there are some nice
stereo effect these are a little bit
more narrow and maybe less realistic
with my traditional methods but the
sound for myself I know how in something
nasty I think the traditional one is
simply wirelessly please Sarah listen
again and tell me afterwards what you
think is it realistic enough are they
close enough we have to do further
tweaking is really not easy this is a
process which takes hours I'm never
satisfied the next day I listen again
it's not again different
yeah thanks a lot I hope you liked it
anyhow it's always tell me what you
think about these binaural artificial
ears which I shall continue my first
person camera sometimes sometimes that
dangling wires that got stuck somewhere
or I don't know this more static method
is quite nice for me when I start with
your example so it is fiddle-dee-fie for
example which has some nice views
because most people will really hear
some rear effect if you have movies or
except that I can play that there's lots
of surround effects we can try to be
playing them and make some some some
kind of general comparison for several
sound but I have several at home now and
we can maybe compare them in future so
thanks again for watching and see you in
the next video have a nice time bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
