up with all these unboxings lately
yeah recently I'm getting lots of stuff
and I thought this way I can immediately
give you some first impressions on
impression otherwise it would take much
longer to easily speaker do measurements
and so on but this way also the surprise
is big if you unbox it
have a listen and see that it rather
sucks
so yeah this speaker is from Ponyville
yeah I contacted them if I could
the contacted a manufacturer also the
distributor but I never got any response
Oh finally I ordered it on Amazon it
goes for $80 the dark version the light
one is a bit cheaper
I think 69 and it looks quite promising
also videos are great so who knows how
it sounds therefore I thought we should
check it out it's quite big and heavy as
it seems
so let's look then boom extra audio yeah
we know this already from a grain audio
they also had these wooden speakers
quite promising but yes oh this is big
it was already quite good if you can see
much with the dark one or the light one
looks better in this case I like the
color of the wood but maybe I would
prefer a gray grill here some kind of
fabric I'm not sure into this more than
one kilogram already what else is inside
I'm coming back which is yes nice bit
big maybe and just USB wires and some
manual so let's put this away
and the price will be either big or or I
don't know this is the level 120 this
goes for $60 but you can see half the
size so no choice this can really
compete but the bathroom taking its
reference for a
more neutral stalling speaker without
any boost so we can maybe hear how this
camisa sounds so let's turn it on let's
see there is some power button on this
one
and okay let's see if we can look it up
in the little list that doesn't quite a
cure here much why this is flashing here
it is so it's called camisa
m20 and i thought oh we will play a
track from solar physicist and yeah
let's test the sound
let's see volume button to increase
okay this immediately
we have to keep volume press to change
volume as you can see volume is
thankfully in this is by the way a
feature that is also included with
Android seven so if you happen to have
some Android 7 device you should be able
to control volume directly for the
speakers well I think it's not a big
muscle which is a steady check available
there's something supply protect over
here
but this is something we must try not
affect little bit for me as well face is
not really precise travel is really not
too much maybe not so a decorator hidden
quiet
quite a bit of vibration or maybe it's
only on one side for the bomb package
that we found more high five
come on effect also I'm not really
hundred percent King I would say I mean
for $20 more you can get the JBL flip
for here it's in this turned off so I
may be not a very fair comparison if you
look at the size difference so let's
hear how these two sounds
starting in with the same song intere
comido
the face is at the top of control mr.
Rowland it expressly battle me this is
my home to lock up
it's been around approximately in my
pleasure like rats getting shots exactly
five bucks
give me some bike when you finish don't
worry my pants are you messing your mind
I wanna beginning on that one comparator
term results and without it's a good
economy because it is simply for muscles
without manager don't recommend
appropriate space here has nice
definition just not as most people
humming oh yeah you don't like you know
song haha crap
yeah mess impressed let's read it
specifically snort it already thank you
for
some ugly so it's volume is unavoidable
in this and hear how this form to help
particle physicists if there was some
pillow on top the record comes much
we're here camilo again and making
volume not that loud regarding your side
they require
this is my mama
perfect
anything more bass that I'll ever give a
report on a much better I will with you
Trojan again on the sleet forest well
I'm not sure about the Camino I expect
this quite a bit more available the
place is just boosted is doesn't seem to
have any any depth I mean it sounds much
nicer so yeah first impression are
already a bit disappointed it's heavy as
hell
big as hell but sounds simply yeah
questionable too much bass boost and and
also i'm precise bay muscle treble so I
already know know that this is not a
winner nice wood although this doesn't
really feel like votes rather like some
plastic still look is great but I would
expect much more all of this madness
better bass deeper bass more precise day
simply much more refinement it's
unstressed muscle therefore when the
package I'm not impressed with kameez oh
yeah now you can help with some EQ but
yeah for $80 you can already get some
better speakers I think so yes this was
the first impression and unboxing of the
camisa and 20 you like know what this
means
so communal bamboo speaker get beautiful
sound wirelessly know what a beautiful
potatoes it sounds it rather sucks the
ugly sound if you ask me uh yeah hope
this was enough um and I will probably
not included into the database it is it
make sense it's too much hassle but it
is hurt it's not even worth it so thanks
all for watching and see you in the next
video have a nice time and bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
