listening test today we are going to
look at the ultra portable bluetooth
speaker class because like this lady and
go here that you can put inside the
pockets walk around prevalent them quite
popular models on Amazon it goes for $26
also highly rated the next one is the
creative mule to see goes for 50 but you
can see the fun factor everything is
quite similar so obviously this was the
prototype and this is from copy another
copy the felix pixel pop on amazon it's
not available but it's quite popular in
europe also highly rated and kind of
outside of the show we need it can be
found from $35 but on amazon it also
goes for 55 yeah and it's always i would
like to show you how they sound cover so
that you don't know which one is playing
you have to get switches which tell me
which you like most
which one's the worst as always I will
be using binaural microphones there for
ya
please listen headphones and let's check
them out please put up your headphones
now and then always use my voice is a
guide for the current clicking loudness
just because a place plastic closer than
euro st so small it's not as powerful
but now let's start with the first one
and
so all the trees now from me falling
slowly huh chemistry is so screams like
it's been holding on and hold it now you
and I we've been changing all the butter
I'm in a circle
like we know he doesn't wait too long in
some honesty lion-like we thought of me
200
and your eyes no surprise a feeling
wanting me like lover to shake of course
as most speakers have the natural limit
they are elements for personal listening
and not to put away 2 meters crank to
make semantics on party but it's still
quite rare to find something really
decent in this size most of them are not
really suitable for low level listening
and they cannot play loud so in reality
they are not suitable for anything but
people are still seem to be satisfied
with it when looking at all those videos
so yeah please tell me which you liked
most with all the worst maybe and
hopefully we have again some who can
distinguish all them and make them
correctly also please check their
speaker audio database where all four
are already included so you can hear and
compare also there and you will be
definitely able to distinguish them yeah
we will reveal this in about two weeks
or something until then stay tuned I
hope you liked it and have a nice time
