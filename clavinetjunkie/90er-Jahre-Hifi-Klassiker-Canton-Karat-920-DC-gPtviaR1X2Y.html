today we will travel back in time about 25 years
and we will have a look at a classic from germany from that period:
the Canton Carat 920 DC
the appendix &quot;DC&quot; stands for &quot;displacement control&quot;, there was also a normal 920 and a 930
it should play more controlled with bass and with less distortion
and was recommended to me by a friend of mine who is really a hifi enthusiast on a high level
also when looking at some fromer press, back then audio magazines were still competent
they provided measurements. if looking at some modern magazines they mostly consist of ads only
here from &quot;Hifi Vision&quot;
yeah, the measurement nearly linear, they also gave it an &quot;excellent&quot; rating
really the fewest speakers were given an &quot;excellent&quot; rating, rather very good, good or satisfactory
even speakers that were way more expensive
back then these cost 1000DM
and they were chosen as &quot;reference&quot; in the class below 1000DM
I thought we will have a listen to them
how such a speaker would sound today
I don't have anything comparable except the Nubert NuPro A-300
of course this is a little bit unfair, I will play them from my old and also vintage Pioneer amplifier
it doesn't even reach 50 or 60W or something like that
the speakers themselves are rated with 70W of nominal power
maximum power 100W, frequency response is provided as 3... what is written here?
30khz down to 33hz, of course no idea within which dB-range
but I have already taken down the grill here. you can see it's a two-way system.
bassreflex, hidden here is the port
of course I also tried to measure them on my own, but taken with a grain of salt as it's a nearfield measurement
and also compared to the Nubert Nupro A-300 shown in grey here
you can see that both do not play perfectly linear, at least not in my own measurement
but the Cantons appear a bit more boosted in the bass region, while the Nuberts reach deeper
but you can also see that the Nuberts have some bump in the presence region
the Cantons seem to play smoother in this area
of course the Nuberts are electronically equalized, particularly in the bass region
probably the Cantons won't be able to keep up here
you can also see it from the measurement, but overall it's a nice smiley response
although the measurements from that time show a really flat response
which was also what they emphasized about the Cantons: being a very neutral sounding small bookshelf speaker.
you are already listening through an artificial binaural head
of course you have to listen through headphones.
the recording gain will remain constant whole the time.
this is simply important to me to also provide you an as realistic as possible sound level impression
so please put up your headphones, I will set them up
and then we will simply switch between both
I will start with the Cantons, playing some tracks then swap them and do the same with the Nuberts
and afterwards I will cut everything together so we can hear the differences better
the first track is from Steve Nichol, a Soulpersona production
and before I'd also like to show you some settings of the amplifier
it is now playing with neutral settings - CD direct
but as the speakers won't reach as deep as the Nuberts, which obviously are artificially pushed in the bass region
I thought I will play them with loudness while turning bass and treble down at the same time
to retrieve some lower bass without affecting the overall sound too much
like I said, this is with CD direct
with loudness this lower bass part comes out better
I will turn volume up so that you can hear the difference better
CD direct
and I set loudness to such a level that we get around 85dB, 90dB maximum at listening position
this is already quite a decent listening loudness
and let's start with the next track
another aspect I would like to demonstrate you is the dispersion of both speakers.
unfortunately this topic is often neglected, but how do they sound if you are not sitting exactly on axis
for that purpose we will play another track, namely &quot;Analog&quot; from Soulpersona and Princess Freesia
and then we will sit more to the side, even more to the side and will listen again
so let's go!
yeah, they are remarkable speakers, especially for that age
they were released 1993, I was just on the verge of my school leaving exams
of course I would like to hear your opinion about them
maybe I should have played them with neutral settings, I am really not sure to tell the truth
so this is with loudness and bass and treble turned down
neutral
mids come a bit better through, also presence region becomes more emphasized
let's turn volume a bit higher
loudness
like I said, I turned treble down, because otherwise with neutral bass and treble it would sound like this
again neutral
not easy, let me know your opinion
anyway, you can meanwhile find them below 100â‚¬ on ebay or want ads and so on
they are more or less classics I would say and they even sound great today
maybe with a better amplifier, where you can adjust the sound more acourately
I am just missing some lower bass punch, like from the Nuberts
although that was already quite exaggerated, in this room it sounded nearly artificial
overall I liked the Canton more, you could also notice off axis they sounded simply smoother
this is not the strenght of the Nuberts, this is also my only point of criticism with them
they really sound great if you have placed them directly in front of you
but as soon as you are not sitting within the sweet spot or if you place them apart
the sound is not right anymore
this is where the Canton really shine, and I am quite impressed
thanks to my hifi-friend, he knows who I am talking about
I am really impressed by them, very decent loudspeakers
but as I already said, you would maybe need some additional equalizing
maybe even directly at listening position, with Equalizer Apo or something
in case you are streaming from a PC, so that you can optimize the sound even further
please tell me your opinion about them, they are really great speakers.
I hope you liked this video and see you in the next one, bye bye!
