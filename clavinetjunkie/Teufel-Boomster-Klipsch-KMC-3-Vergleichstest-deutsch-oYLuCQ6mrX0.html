last time we've heard it against the JBL Xtreme
this time I have a Klipsch KMC 3 here
that was kindly lent to me by a friend
I think both units are nicely comparable due to similar size
the Teufel Boomster is a bit akwardly constructed thanks to the offset part here
otherwise it would be even more compact
the Klipsch KMC 3 has no built in rechargeable battery
you have to fiddle around with a coin to open the cover
put in 8 batteries which will finally make it a portable speaker
you could also power it with an external power bank
but such a power bank will cost you another 100â‚¬
to get a suitable model which will provide enough running time
the Teufel Boomster has a built in rechargeable battery
hidden behind this cover
you can easily replace it
and, what I didn't mention last time, you can extend it with additional batteries
which means you can extend running time
of course the rechargeable battery won't have any space inside anymore
you will have to let it hang outside or something
but you simply put in some AA-batteries inside
which will result in a longer battery life
so far I haven't mentioned battery life yet
I forgot it the last time
but I got more than 5:30 hours at maximum volume with bass at maximum level
I cannot say much about the Klipsch
so far I only had it playing from batteries
but it can already happen that the power-light will start flashing after half an hour with strong bass content
and the bass will start cutting out
as energy saving mode the subwoofer will be turned down
if we have a look at the frequency responses of both
you can notice that both will play very similar, especially if the Boomster has bass turned up to maximum
both have some kind of treble emphasis too
the only difference is, the Klipsch being much more powerful according to the specs
according to the spec sheet it should have 90W I think up to 130W maximum
the Boomster is specified with 30W I guess up to 40W maximum
when simply looking at the output, the KIipsch is the much more powerful unit
of course we would like to hear this, that's why I will be using my binaural microphones as always
first we will go indoors and have a listen inside at normal listening levels
but later we will also go out and listen to both at maximum volume
to get an idea how much of a difference in loudness there really is
so please put up your headphones to get the best impression from binaural recordings
we will go inside and have a listen to both
as you can see I put them above each other, that's because the table is too small
but you will also hear them more centered to be able to judge the stereo image better
I will turn the subwoofer to maximum with the Teufel, to make it better comparable with the Klipsch
because the Klipsch is basically very bass heavy
But I'll start with the Teufel Boomster first and some smoother tracks
the problem with the Klipsch is that it has a very directional treble dispersion
when I stand up you will hear what happens
the sound becomes rather muffled
the Teufel doesn't show this effect to such a strong degree
something different
Despite bass turned to maximum, the Teufel Boomster sounds somehow more balanced than the Klipsch
the Klipsch even sounds droning quite a bit
Klipsch again
a bit of &amp;quot;Hammond Jazz&amp;quot;
Hammond organs have a particularly extreme bass
this is also a very bass heavy piece
and maybe again that House-track which mostly causes distortion
or makes the bassreflex ports fart
let's hear the Boomster first and then the Klipsch
OK, this wasn't it, this is it...
yes, you can hear it slightly, now the Klipsch
yeah, doesn't sound funny
so I would say let's go out and hear how loud they can play
you can see I am again at my usual forest place
unfortunately wind upset my plans
I'll turn both speakers to maximum
the Boomster as well
and then control volume from my mobile phone
the subwoofer is already at maximum
Now I matched both loudnesswise more or less
this means the Teufel is playing at maximum
the Klipsch at around 3/4
I will play some tracks
then I will also turn the Klipsch to maximum, so that we can hear the difference in loudness
I will start with the Boomster
full volume as mentioned before
it is at around 3/4
and slowly I can turn up the Klipsch to maximum
this is maximum volume now
and the Boomster plays at maximum as well
yeah, the difference is pretty big
I will go farther to the back
you can really hear the Klipsch still pretty well
the Boomster is disappearing slightly
let's try another title
both are still playing at maximum
yeah, this is simply much more powerful
although the Klipsch is not very clean anymore
you don't hear that the Boomster is playing at maximum
I have always the impression as if it could play louder and louder
it doesn't distort at all
it also sounds completely unstrained
the engineers could have definitely pushed it farther
a bit more dynamic compression, a bit more distortion
simply all all that's possible
yeah, the Klipsch is not very clean
let's try another track, maybe... some Rock or something
this is the Boomster
yeah, here the difference is huge again
with this title the Klipsch remains even pretty clean
and the difference is really...
let's listen from the side how this sounds
the Klipsch becomes quite dull
you notice that eventually treble gets lost
yet another title
this is from &amp;quot;nocopyrightsounds&amp;quot;
you have to look them up, they have really nice stuff
a real summersong
it's called &amp;quot;Entropy&amp;quot;
yes, fully clean the Klipsch isn't here anymore.
I will reduce volume to be at the same level again
I think you can clearly hear that the Klipsch packs even more punch
but on the other hand mids and treble get a bit lost
yeah, that's it for now!
I hope the video could give you a first rough impression of the sound qualities of both speakers
on loudness alone the Boomster doesn't come close to the Klipsch
the Klipsch is simply much more powerful
but if not maximum loudness is important
but comfortable listening at home etc.
I found the Boomster more convincing
it sounded more refined more sophisticated
the Klipsch sounded a bit rude
the bass was boomy to some extent
it didn't convince me completely
also the fact that you need batteries or some external power bank to power it is a downside
you have to trade in what is more important to you
maximum volume, party: definitely the Klipsch
for Hifi-sound I would say Boomster
I thank you for watching, I hope we'll see us in the next video
until then bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
