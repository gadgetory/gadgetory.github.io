breaking HD this time especially
compared against the JBL extreme I think
these two are pretty well comparable
they are rocked weather resistant
speaker models they are similarly big
and heavy
the braving may be slightly smaller and
lighter but this is also quite a break I
mean this is not a light speaker anymore
and they also should cost the same this
is a bit strange because Bravin had a
cheaper model the same speaker will 855
on the market already and now they
reshoot the same speaker with a higher
price tag so let's see if it really
deserves this high price compared to the
JBL and unlike most other youtube
reviewers which managed to talk half an
hour about unboxing and features of a
speaker I would rather like to
concentrate on sound of both therefore I
prepared some frequency response
measurements first let's have a look at
the Bravin in its normal sound mode and
as you can see this is not a very flat
frequency response there is some high
treble peak and the base already rolls
off below 200 Hertz there is still some
response at 80 Hertz but it's really low
amplitude the Raven also has some sound
mode called SR as well which you can see
in red here and SRS Wow scoops out mids
boost bass but you get the strange hump
at around 180 Hertz which makes the
sound really unnatural there is also
probably some sterile enhancing or with
this SRS algorithm some phase shifting I
don't know but many claim that the
Bravin sounds much better with SRS
enabled I would rather say that it's
sound strange and honky if we have a
look at the JBL now in blue we can see
that it has a much stronger bass
response it has a bass peak at 75 Hertz
but you can always take this away with
with an equaliser if it's too much for
you I think for outdoors it's better to
have more bass for the sound to come
through but it's also easier to reduce
particular frequencies with an equalized
then to boost something where there
simply isn't anything of course I would
like to show you how both sound in
reality therefore I thought we will
check them out indoors at normal
listening levels later on I will also go
outdoors and play them at maximum to see
which one can play louder which one
distorts and so on and unlike many other
youtubers who will record their videos
with their mobile phones or some cheap
camera microphones I am really using
high quality binaural microphones so if
you listen with headphones with flat
sounding headphones you should get a
pretty realistic impression of how both
sound of course nobody would listen to
Debussy or Charlie Parker with these
speakers therefore a selected rather
electronic start this time and yeah we
will have a listen to both I'm starting
with the JBL then switch over to the
Bravin and yeah please enjoy
I think the difference is pretty obvious
let's listen something else so and now
some rock
yeah horrible now let's check how they
compare outdoors its maximum volume I'm
starting again with the JBL yet Sam
Raven appears a bit louder but it's
using space no functional bass
let's try another house check on Sabbath
hallo
maybe we should turn on this SRS Wow
thing maybe it sounds better like that
extreme again
well no this SRS is really to forget
something us again from
nocopyrightsounds
Fred called candalyn
sounds as if someone was knocking on
wood this is not a base for a knocking
effect let's try the extreme again
yeah the Bravin is definitely a bit
louder but there is also much more
compression going on and bass is simply
missing
maybe we should also try a rock track
again starting with the JBL
yeah it's louder but the sound is simply
yeah I'm not a rock listener but I would
say they both fail at rock so I hope
this was helpful it's starting to rain a
bit I'm going back yeah the Bravin is
definitely a loud speaker but it doesn't
sound good the JBL is maybe not the
loudest they are definitely louder ones
but I think it sounds simply much better
especially at lower levels and not
maximum yeah thanks for watching and bye
