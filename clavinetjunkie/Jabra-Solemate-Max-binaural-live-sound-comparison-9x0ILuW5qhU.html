which I was
interested in the Jabra soulmate max
well this is quite a break it's really
heavy
that's what so large I think it's larger
than my usual Bose Soundlink wireless
system it's also heavier so it should
pack some punch the packaging is
promising it says amazing sound clarity
with pls build quality and durability
with two powerful woofers and the
proprietary best radiator and the
reviews on Amazon are also quite
positive we have 45 user reviews 30 of
them are five-star reviews with comments
like you will not be disappointed or
loved the quality of the speaker most
awesome wireless rechargeable blah blah
blah the original price is 399
260 in Europe you can even have it for
130 euro so let's see how this speaker
fares against some others as you can see
the Jabra soul mate makes it so large it
could even accommodate some flowerpot no
kiddin aside let's start comparing it
with some speakers and start with the
larger ones this is the post Soundlink
wireless music system on let's turn both
speakers on connected and let's play
some tracks starting with the sonic mix
okay pose
you
I think it's not quite there yet
let's try a smaller speaker the infinity
one from Harman Kardon maybe this is a
better match for the Jabra
okay and start again with the soulmate
mix
thank you
and thank you again
okay I think it's still not quite there
yet
next let's try a smaller one the JBL
charge - maybe this is a bit better and
we will start again with the sonic
mix-match idea
I can summon
hmm still not really there
maybe we will need something much
smaller so let's take the ban on in via
Mini and see how this compares we will
start again with the Jabra sonic max
okay
denim
and saw Mad Max it still seems as if it
was not quite there uh I have a surprise
and we will try the PDK track which
might be a better match for their
soulmate
let's the PDK know Chara
I think they were really close and as
you can see the size difference is
pretty impressive no I'm just kidding
the Java soulmate max is a speaker well
that sucks no maybe it needs some volume
and next time we will go outdoors and
see how it compares at mixing volume
until then have a nice time and see you
then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
