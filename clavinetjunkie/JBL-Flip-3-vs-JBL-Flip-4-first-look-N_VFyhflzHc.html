to give you some more details about the
blending jbf it for especially compared
against the recent model the JBL 53
what has changed one of the main
differences but first let me say that
I'm really impressed with JBL managed to
achieve with the Flip series so far
since the very first flip model which
was respecting five years ago they
managed to improve it with each
generation so they victory was already
great but they fit four sets the bar
even higher while still keeping the same
price we're looking at some other
companies like ultimate yes or both they
still try to sell you the things because
before maybe adding some new features
but the sound is still the same the UE
boom is slightly other with no
distortion but the flip 4 is a
completely different beast than this 3 3
we will hear this later on but first
year let's have a look at this because
also the packaging which has changed
slightly you can see that box of their
sleep for is slightly slimmer but inside
still just a wire for charging no charge
I included you can see the sleep for is
slightly higher than the 3 3 apart from
that they could still be mistaken one
for the other the bigger design change
is that they have redesigned the foot
here so it doesn't roll around like
crazy like it did before also a big
change is that it's completely
waterproof now you can put it into water
it will swim and maybe I'm not sure I
haven't tried it yet but it seems if the
speaker would aim itself upwards with
the driver so maybe you could even
listen to music when floating in trance
water I try to fit that sharply and it
always turns it upside down so it didn't
work yeah another big changes that then
flip for has JBL connect plus include
now which allows you up to 100 or even
more speakers to connect together
unfortunately it's not backwards
compatible so it won't connect to a JBL
flip 3 but from what I heard they charge
three and then extreme will be also
updated for connect plus yeah and the
biggest changes I think the sound which
is a big improvement over the tapes 3
and especially the two and one
this is closer to a charge 3 although
with added clarity and everything we can
have maybe a look at some frequency
response measurement from the seat 4
here you can see a lower level and
see some base response below 70 Hertz
it's not completely balanced as you have
some clarity boost at around five six
seven keynote compared to the GPL from
tree you can see that the base is deeper
or so slightly stronger at higher levels
it manages to keep more based on the
flip flip and it makes the moon although
the same loudness it still has more
lower base and of course you can check
them out in mine speaker audio database
how they sound also compare their fit
for again some other people's like the
UE boom or both something mean you will
definitely hear how strange they both
sound against the flip fold but I also
wanted to show you life how they sound I
selected one single song from a Dutch
group called Joel featuring this guy a
funny retro disco tried called
I wanna be a BG I will use my head
command by Anolon microphone so please
listen headphones and let's check them
out let me turn it on first you can also
hear the welcome tone yes pretty much
the same as before and I will start with
their fleet prefers ableism
something to fear
so Kappa
Oh
education
you cannot protect them okay and
estimate maximum volume
this is it for now increasing volume for
mixing
well
