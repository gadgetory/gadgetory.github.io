is right yesterday I didn't admit
because I thought we would like to open
this together this is from Hong Kong and
I think I know what is inside I got lots
of packages from China and Hong Kong
lately but this shows is a base Puma
this speaker is currently offered on
Amazon come only for $99 it's not
available in Europe yet yeah nice
science here but let's have a look
inside looks pretty promising on paper
and of course I always wanted to know
how it sounds and here it is so we can
have a listen together as always I'm
using binary microphones so okay that's
stuff inside
I think I will have to destroy the box
because this is of course has always
been our microphones you should listen
headphones this is the only way to get
really realistic and correct impression
I know our recordings don't work well
through speakers or maybe if you use
some gem box or big gem box type of
speaker it has live audio so this works
with binaural recordings as well the
speaker has an ohm charging cradle
because this salt is optional while the
speaker super bass output superior sound
quality charges laughs and here is the
speaker so
let's look at this first it reminds me a
little bit of the shock wave this is
also a new speaker looks a bit similar I
don't know if they really share any any
internals together so honest guide yeah
usually you don't really meet one this
is the designer Aris new creative
product design he is passionate about
the new designs in blah blah blah not
sure if he was the guy who contacted me
but yeah thanks a lot here is the
speaker yeah not too small even bigger
than there than the river s so it comes
a bit closer to the turbo X already but
of course cheaper $99 you can see this
is other contacts for the charging
cradle we can unbox this as well so you
can charge it by just placing it into
the cradle here and it works as a
stationary speaker does we have here
controls on the back and reset button
not bad because yeah some speakers
sometimes do strange stuff so it has a
charging Otto's as well charging yeah it
needs 15 volts input and even output so
you can use it probably as either as
some Bluetooth receiver or maybe we
could even attach the mini rigs up here
mmm don't know if it makes sense but
maybe this has enough bass on its own so
what else is inside here are probably
some wires and the power adapter adapter
yeah mr. pollak etre and an auxilary
wire so let's put it away everything
don't need the cradle either and let's
try turning it on fully charged so three
dots show that yeah it's full or should
be full let's look it up if it's here
maybe we should for sparing first power
yeah my phone is a bit too bright for
the camera hmm here it is VP wants base
Puma Puma how to call it English puma or
Puma Puma troll and we are connected and
today is a special day because princess
freesia is releasing her upcoming album
so no I think it will be released on
22nd of September she made a pledge
music campaign and of course I pledged
and she already who released the very
first singer so today we will listen to
some songs of Princess freesia this is
the new single so we can have a listen I
think it was already set to full volume
I think it would be better when placed
at the edge of the table sounds really
really nice from what I can hear pretty
full-bodied sound volume is so yeah this
is the kind of sound I'm really
expecting out of their collection
of course we have the anchor premium
here which we could just use as
comparison and reference it's always
recommended to put speakers closer to an
edge and not in the central table
because of inter reflections of the
drivers which reflect at the surface and
then you get some kind of comm filter
effect so with such speakers that have
the drivers very close to the to the
bottom surface it's really better to
place them on a on an on an edge and
yeah we can hear how it sounds against
their anchor I will start again with
their base Puma
banker
what's this it's also support suppose
something a solution
they sound quite a bit more mature
larger
respectively more funky
this sounds really impressive I am quite
impressed too terrible I mean yes treble
is slightly directional a second here
it sounds best when placed at your head
with really nice treble you can also see
maybe I'm not sure if it's visible but
here is the best freighter to drivers
and another not too big persuader at the
back there is some B which probably
means B stock I don't know or better but
it doesn't sound really bad I mean from
what I can in all four my microphones
this sounds a bit Tong hearing
another track from princess features is
from her latest album which was released
2012 you can of course buy all the songs
on Bandcamp this is from her special
edition with some remixes came up quite
completely let's try the net maximum I
will increase the anchor first
that base Pumas well quite a bit more
powerful far more the slower yeah I
think we will need another contender
yeah this cannot really compete the
anchor here I have the Riveter by X
which costs quite a bit more $300
let's put this away I mean definitely
nice pika for $60 but this needs really
something more serious obviously yeah it
should connect doesn't ok did and
let's enable thermal mode so we really
have eat entire what's nice about the
river is of course that you'll get this
floating sound cloud around even without
us around and well let's put it two
maybe three four four something that
base Puma also increase in volume maybe
slightly more punchy but this is a
theorem let's try a trick
confident muscles of the driveway we've
definitely sounds less force also quite
a bit bigger we try more normal
listening levels but I think it competes
pretty well against the speaker which
costs three times as much
the revocable external around half
volume with terrible mode enabled I
think there is also some kind of
networks has nice face but it's it mrs.
Trevor from how this sounds definitely
more convincing him also at low wave was
probably a very first volume step
appears a bit loud from my taste but
it's not really much better than terbaik
so these are both playing now at the
very first volume step okay
it sounds more full-bodied richer this
starts sounding a bit too despite the
turbo mode without even even worse a bit
more kitchen radio light he always jumps
back to to zero let's say
so yeah for the first impression I think
this is enough I really didn't want to
play that long but it impressed me quite
a lot and I think it's a decent speaker
from what I've heard now of course we
will do some measurements I will try to
edit to the database as soon as possible
not sure if I can manage a full kind of
review before I leave for holidays we
will be living on well in five days and
come back on 15th or 16th of September
so there will be some time without
reviews but I hope I will manage to
include it at least into the database I
cut many other speakers from China these
are more more kind of clock radios from
Shrek's
don't know how to pronounce them they
are not that bad of course not in the
same class but quite quite decent and I
have this speaker from Shrek's as well
this looks maybe you know it like the
bowl bowl bowls there or I don't know
see one or the ADX pulse there were some
other speakers with the same design so
this one has Wi-Fi included and it's
pretty interesting costs around hundred
twenty I think but from what I heard it
cannot quite compete with the base Puma
in sound this sounds really really
powerful I'm quite surprised that it
sounds that great from what I heard the
similar room shockwave sucks it already
starts at high volume lots of his also
lots of problems
so obviously despite looking quite
similar they are quite different
speakers so I had the fear that the bass
Puma is a kind of
shockwave knockoff but in reality the
shark seems to be the late speaker here
so yeah these will be coming up later
after my return from holidays or
probably at the end of September
he had his adjust clock radios but also
not that bad and yeah this was it for
the base Puma pretty pretty nice speaker
maybe not completely hi-fi but you've
heard it sounded better than the river
turbo X of course I would maximum the
turbo X it remains pretty pretty punchy
and powerful at maximum this cannot
compete here but at normal levels so I
think I prefer the best Puma here please
tell me how to pronounce it correctly
Puma Puma I don't know what else do we
have here written on a box
it's our bank we already know increased
special increase special DSP chip super
bass output superior sound quality and
long-lasting playing time yeah
everything maybe it's a bit on the
bigger side for really portables because
the anchor is quite a bit smaller but
still carrying back would be nice for
this but yeah why not nice speaker hmm
maybe hey why not let's compare it
against the JBL charge 3 here it is
maybe a bit unfair but well I will put
them a bit far away so we can also turn
volume to maximum and let's try the very
first track again from princess fridges
new upcoming album called Stella sonic
the charge three No
the pace Puma okay Tori next
hidden wide and bigger amount of the
upper face some obvious booster 250 200
health
let's eat this one into maximum again
I think that base Puma doesn't like it
closer to a wall I think it sounds
better when standing free the base
becomes to Bhumi like that let's try it
again
when positioned here we can turn in both
to Mexico
and all the trucks with something else
yeah the bass humor could be taken as
Auto speaker yeah yeah
it comes from filthy attic Lani
ich bin mitten Drinan okay thanks a lot
for watching my wife wants something
from me yeah this was about the bass
Puma and Yahoo see you soon in another
video thanks all for watching and bye
bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
