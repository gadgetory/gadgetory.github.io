watts Bluetooth speaker I got this at no
cost in exchange for an unbiased review
so here we go
when looking on Amazon you can see it
costs $50 or not that cheap anymore but
the reviews seem quite promising so
maybe a no-brainer here it says great
Bluetooth speaker speakerphone or here
one of my new favorites this thing is
fantastic this is actually my third eye
clever speaker I love this one good
quality yeah when I had a listen I
contacted the agent and I told him I
would prefer not to review it but when
reading all this I decided to do it
anyhow here I have another speaker this
is the taotronics pulse x costs $23
currently sometimes you can also find it
for $20 and I think this is a much
better value so we'll have a look let's
turn them on first the hike lever here
and the taotronics yeah quite suspicious
isn't it
and before we listen we can maybe check
out some frequency response measurement
of both and you can see the high clever
and it's immediately obvious that there
is a complete lack of cradle now if we
overlay the taotronics here you can see
the damage until equal just at the top
running still has some trail response
the plus X is far from being perfect but
looking at the size and price difference
I think it's a much better speaker as
always I will play some tunes I'm using
binaural microphones therefore you
should listen headphones and I will
start playing with the I clever first so
let's have a listen
Oh
something else if I look around nothing
matters no you hold just a while walk
almost through the day for
self-knowledge where should I go you
they sound really grow prosper sir I
clever has no trouble not a song Thank
You Francis Ivan day in this case
it's why not a song although is much
bigger the data came to any advantage in
bass we spent or anything even loudness
is the same as Wesley gave close to
being unstable I'm not sure how all the
great ratings can be it's like this and
I will go far away and play them at
maximum I think the prospects from
behind field sounds better than the high
clever form from total is the perfect
increase in volume to maximum I clever
as well
yeah
nothing else that I can look like an
elderly
there is some slight base advantage for
the I clever maybe part it's still
negligible I would say so yeah this was
my short review about the I clever I
don't know the name
I think it's called party totally it
says BTS Oh 8 you will be definitely
better off with the stocktronics here
being much cheaper and smaller so it's
twice as big
looking at the cubic sure of both but no
advantage at all I mean the taotronics
is nothing great but for this price is
still quite recommendable so thanks a
lot and hopefully some better speakers
are coming up until then have a nice
time and bye bye
hi everyone this is from Ike level at 20
watts blue to speak and I got this at no
cost in exchange for an unbiased review
so here we go
when looking on Amazon you can see it
cost $50 and has great video so
according to we're looking at Amazon you
can see it costs $50 since then this up
Gator snare first six Norma when looking
on Amazon you can see it costs $50 $50
when looking on Amazon you can see it
costs $50 so not the cheap anymore but
the reviews are quite promising so
probably a no-brainer right a look
despite a fluke text Aguilera's looks at
fluke shots
who choose computer the victors of
intervals for assessing of my
