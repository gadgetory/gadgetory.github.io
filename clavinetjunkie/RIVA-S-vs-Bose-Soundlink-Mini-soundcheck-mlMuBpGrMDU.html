you the most important question with
which is the best portable Bluetooth
speaker they don't I mean yeah I really
like it a lot great speaker or the JBL
charge tool also great speaker just look
at Amazon on the reviews the calf Muir
pretty good speaker or the ballast and
we'll Kings t7 what I forgive it five
stars
some other magazines gave it five stars
definitely one of the best speakers
according to them but I think the best
speaker is their Bose Soundlink mini
look at all the reviews there are
thousands of user reviews on Amazon also
it's one of the most sold portable
speakers until today so it must be
simply great but now I have here the new
brand new rear is and this is not just
some Bose copy like some others we have
heard that count on music box for
example or the anchor premium speaker
the gem heavy metal they all use the
same design with two drivers two passive
radiators Riva came up with something
completely new they have three main
drivers to add the sides one here in the
center and four passive radiators so
this thing has seven drivers inside they
use trillium processing to enhance the
stereo field and so on and I think it's
a really good sounding speaker therefore
I would like to compare it against the
number one until now they both sounding
mini maybe will also check it against
the highly regarded Bowers Wilkins I
bash the speak a little bit and I was
bashed because of this so yeah as always
I will be of course using my binaural
microphones if you listen with high
quality headphones you should get a
pretty realistic impression of how these
speakers sound but first we'll
concentrate on the River s and the Bose
so please put up your headphones and
let's have a listen so let's turn it on
and as you can see it has this near
sensitive area here when I come closer
with my hand the controls light up and
it should connect to my iPhone already
as I'm paired it takes some time so it
doesn't happen
immediately and there is a new app
called Riva audio and I can connect to
the speaker and there are some options
for example I already set it to silent
mode you can also enable voice prompt
tones but I prefer it completely silent
so yeah there are no tones and anything
and we can start playing some music
let's start with a kind of jazz track
and I can remotely control the speaker
from here and you also have the option
to turn on surround mode from here
this is some kind of delay between left
and right a driver I don't know the
exact algorithm but you definitely hear
some some get eco or something with some
tracks so it works better I think for
movies and for also for classical music
I will turn it off again
it depends on the song sometimes it
sounds really great with other songs
it's not that good
but of course you would like to know how
it compares against the post
I will set them up like this so that the
drivers here can breathe a little bit
and I'll switch to the boss now
this is much more precise I mean listen
to the symbols
also much more spatial the sound because
of the drivers that aim outwards I will
turn on sir on the game
it appears already a bit mushy all over
the song yeah it's not very critical
so you hear some slight room delay
effect so I will turn off surround again
and then let's try not affect this one
is a bit more critical for distortion we
already heard it with they come from
music box
here what you get here is horrible
unusable the river plays the screen
without any wealth any hint of problem
the Canton was exactly as bad as the
pose maybe even worse
yeah it's simply horrible
let's try not a prick
also from the side it has a much better
directivity
this becomes yeah
there is not much difference
you can hear it this is merely
non-directional while they pose this is
very focused treble the revised much
better in this regard here is nearly no
change inside let's try something else
again this is a track which really makes
many small speakers struggle the bass
together with the bass drum let's listen
how they're both manages here horrible
this is the best portable Bluetooth
speaker
the place is so unprofessional
everything that I have
yeah another trick some retro 70s porn
music
I will stand up again it's this one's
okay from above yeah this is night and
day difference another pack again
you already hear the track becoming
softer because of the compressor again
something else so personal together with
princess freesia a nice 80s retro disco
funk bogey track or something
the treble is completely missing
yeah I hope it's obvious that this is
night and by day difference between
these two speakers the poster comes
together like this but I can afford it
in my hand the whole time like this
another salt Poisson attract some mushy
I will try increasing volume for maximum
yep that boss is louder but how I'm
eating the result this is unusable
therefore the river doesn't compress
anything you have the whole dynamics
even at maximum volume while the boss
tries to keep the song loud but you've
heard it's horrible let's try it again
both at maximum
really
No
that's like this and it's pretty low
volume now let's try the pose much
louder this No
I mean
yeah
the post was not as loud anymore the
problem is they try keeping the level
always maximum but when you get this
punch some kicker here it struggles
while the river s doesn't do anything
there is no dynamics processing if a
song is recorded soft it will remain
soft while the boss tries to make it
louder than here so it depends I mean is
this is not a bad speaker but compared
to the reverse it becomes a toy it's
it's you cannot take this serious the
result you get from this with many songs
I mean it's it's really struggling it
appears a bit more bass heavy maybe at
low levels but this is not this not
natural sounding the revised sounds like
like the original recalling and I'm
really impressed with with with the
result so far I have another highly
rated speaker I was bashed a lot because
my review of their Bowers &amp;amp; Wilkins t7
was not really positive so people
criticized me for having no clue about
speakers and no clue no idea about good
sound yeah this costs $100 more than the
river it can play quite a bit louder but
the result is also yeah unusable I
thought we will try a track yeah again
some jazz track and have a listen how
both render the same song I'm starting
with the reverse again
you know the powers in Philippines yeah
this has some FM radio or no it sounds
like a low bitrate and pith mp3 or I
don't know if you tell me that this is
good sound
yeah then I really have no clue about a
good sound there's no difference I mean
this is night and day even worse than
with the Bose section even know becomes
a bit better on exes but how often can I
listen like this I mean it's simply with
one word horrible let's draw another
track in soul persona
yeah this is a toy speaker I think China
stuff sounds better than this listen how
how the sound changes when I move my
head
off-axis it loses everything so yeah as
you can hear oh this is the river is
this is the powers and wilkins t7 i hope
you liked this first sump check and
first impression I'm really impressed
I mean it's not very loud speaker effort
they both appeared louder but simply
with unusable results you have this this
cover here the port cover and can use
this like that so its water proof water
is resistant to some degree a great
speaker I mean one of the best I've
heard in this size and price range
hey this is look when I touch it what
what does is I don't know but I was
bashed because I rated it badly and I
have no clue about speakers so please
buy the Bowers and Wilkins t7 if you
really like good sound FM radio sound
thanks for watching guys I hope you
found this helpful in a bit and yeah I
will probably do much more checks with
the revised so stay tuned for more until
then have a nice time and bye bye
so for all these outro levels let's try
David against Goliath
so which one is playing though I won't
tell you you choose the better one
yeah you tell me which is better</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
