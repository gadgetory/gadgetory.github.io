say thank you to all the subscribers for
their continued support and I wanted to
say goodbye for the next 2-3 weeks as I
will be leaving on holidays undermine
italia questa volta a lot activity Emily
legacy ciao unfortunately for the IFA
the international phone card in Berlin I
won't be able to offer you any updates
so there will be probably some
interesting products but I can report on
this afterwards but before leaving I
have a surprise because I still want to
offer you some interesting videos and
sound comparisons I have some speakers
like for example the bank you prev hola
this is one that can fly look it
believes it can fly so before leaving I
wanted to cover this speaker make a
little Sun comparison to give you an
idea how it sounds I also had the
infinity one for one day I borrowed it
from some friend his friend and well a
friend of his friend and of course I
made a comparison against the JBL
extreme so I hope to be able to make and
finish the video of these two as well
then i have the klipsch kmc one here
this is the baby of the kmc three maybe
i already had the speaker some time ago
and what's not very excited about it but
i think it's a pretty decent speaker so
i hope i will be able to give you some
comparison with this as well and i also
have the braven beer vhd well it seems
to be a loudspeaker by many so I thought
I should give it a try and also compare
it against the table Extreme as both
cost exactly the same well this is what
I can offer you before leaving or during
my holidays I will try uploading the
videos and make them online well one
after the other
another thing that bugs me a little bit
is how people react on the JBL extreme
saying that it's not portable at all
it's so heavy it's so large I mean these
are two kilograms if you look at
speakers that guys were carrying around
in the 80s 90s with boom boxes with 10
kilograms 15 kilograms I mean this is
ridiculous and you get really a
full-bodied major sound I already made a
comparison against the IVA and I mean at
normal listening levels if you don't
crank it to maximum it's pretty close i
mean it's it's still a small speaker but
sounds like a huge boom box so i'm not
quite sure but maybe that the time
changes so people become weak now two
kilograms are too heavy for them in 10
years that they will complain because of
500 grams and then they will complain
because their smartphone is so heavy I
mean if I look at me 15 years ago I also
looked different if I look at me now
well you see everything changes so I
think the JBL extreme is still a very
portable device I mean it's not
something you put into the trousers also
I think I could manage oh wait no but
it's definitely portable I mean these
are two kilograms so this is ridiculous
um yeah for the holidays I also thought
about which speaker to bring to take
with me I thought about the denon in via
mini but then I was afraid well maybe
the battery won't last the whole day at
the beach then I thought about the JBL
charge too but this one doesn't look
that great when put into sand and so on
I also thought about the extreme but my
wife hates it because she says she gets
headache because of it because of the
base it pounds so strongly well it's
true it's a bit place heavy but you
either like it or not and I thought I
will take the JBL flip three with me
it's pretty decent sounding speaker it
is pretty loud about as loud as the UE
boom it's nicely rocked you can post it
into sent and it won't damage I mean the
passive radiators well maybe they will
scratch but if you don't I don't
or you could don't speak something
inside it will be okay so again thanks
for all your support for all thumbs up
also thanks for all the bumps down and
the critics that I'm getting again and
again which I don't I mean if you give
thumbs down please tell me what you
don't like about these videos I'm not a
native speaker so I cannot offer you the
fluent English language others natives
because can do so sorry for that i could
also do all my videos in german or put
it for sake in italiano now with papas
could be explored all the tech report
screen is a WAG so I'm trying to do my
best to offer you well something some
some idea so please be patient until the
next videos with the kmc one the
traveler the braven and also the
infinity one I hope you will enjoy them
I hope you will spend some nice time
also on holidays like me um and we will
see us after the holidays with probably
very interesting products I I already
think i will be getting the jail that
sorry that fugu XL for a review so as
soon as it's ready i will hopefully get
one and we'll publish a review also some
sound check maybe and the river s is
close to be published and i'm sure i
will be getting this one as well so
after holidays although the summer is
over it will start again hopefully with
these speakers yeah i cannot say
anything else I thank you all oh and
we'll see us in 2-3 weeks until then
have a nice time and bye bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
