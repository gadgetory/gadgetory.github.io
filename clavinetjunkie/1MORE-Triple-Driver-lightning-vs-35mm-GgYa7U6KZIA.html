make a last video about the one more
triple driver simply to clear up some
things and the reality is that the
Lightning version sounds much better
than the normal 3.5 millimeter one so
obviously the first unit which I got
that I also best was not fake or broken
like I said I got a new one to replace
the Lightning version of it yeah I crept
this just accident I wanted a normal in
here which I can also use with normal
device is not only a post I didn't
assume there was some different but in
fact they do so the normal version yeah
has a completely had a balance
they still resemble each other but it
has more bass less meets trebly shifted
more to the right so it has more upper
treble sizzle while less lower treble
the lighting versions are slightly more
balanced so I'm not sure if their famous
Italian sound engineer leukopenia tuned
this one or the Lightning version but
this really doesn't sound good the
Lightning version sounds way more
balanced like and you know shoot sound I
would say it sounds great so when I
compare the normal one to that I was
yeah it sounded way off while the IRA
and the one more trip driver with
lightning sound quite similar I'm not
sure what the reason is for this if it's
the lighting connector if it's somehow
power or equalized actively I'm really
not sure I'm also not sure if other
reviewers are referring to the normal
version or to the Lightning version
because they really sound different of
course you can trust my ears my words or
don't trust but you will hopefully trust
some measurements yeah I did some
measurements with this year's
mirroring system from unity SP and no
it's not standardized or rather a kind
of toy but here I think what I hope it
can give us at least comparative results
so I measured both also many others and
you don't expect flat curves I'm already
using the compensation curve for in
years there are different compensation
curves available so without compensation
it would look like this and compensated
for Indians you get this response so
this is the 35 millimeter version for
the left and right channel and you can
see left a slightly more bass while
right has slightly more treble of course
the reason for this can be that the
drivers are not matched perfectly
this is normal for most headphones but
also that the insertion was different I
tried to make them as close as possible
for left and right
but yet there is always some difference
so when looking at the Lightning version
here yeah I think I will average both
channels so we can see this a little bit
better so this is the average for the 35
millimeter version and the average for
the Lightning version so you can see
that balanced has changed the base is
flatter on the Lightning version we have
more mids also more responsive their
presence region around 7 kilos which
gives you some lower treble yet the
treble overall son simply fula
especially as you can see that around 11
12 kilo hertz we also have more travel
from the Lightning version if we overlay
that over here also average for a left
and right channel you can see that this
resembles more the Lightning version
with even more treble boost and this is
the only issue I have with the Iowa
which is simply put treble heavy for me
therefore I apply my mod to bring treble
down slightly and then it becomes even
flatter sounding but I would also like
to offer you some sound samples yeah
quite unique here I tried some
recordings with this year system the
included calibration files did not work
so I had to equalize them manually which
is really hard task but I did my best to
at least offer you some idea how they
differ in sound so I will put them in
here of course it's not really easy to
bring them in perfectly equal so I hope
it's right and I will play analogue from
savasana and princess freedom at the
very beginning you will hear the
original track then I will switch to the
normal version to the lighting version
and you can hopefully hear the
difference so let's start
I hope you could hear the Latin version
sounds way more balanced way nicer the
resource or some based problem with the
normal version the sound is slightly
shifted so motor able to the right mode
base to the left and I don't understand
how reviewers can rate this highly if
they listens to the lighting version
then yes but with a normal version no I
could also offer you a comparison to the
Iowa's maybe yeah this will also be
interesting therefore I was quite
shocked how bad the first unit sounded
when I got it so I will insert it again
and we will directly compare it with the
Iowa's which is a little bit more
seasoning than the Lightning version but
still I think sounds way nicer than this
so again first the original track and
then the 3.5 meter triple driver and
then the Iowa
I think it was available also here that
they I was sound way nicer yeah too much
travel but therefore I apply my mod but
I'm not sure how people can like this if
they are referring to the normal version
not the lightning on the lightning one
sounds indeed great and more balanced
than that I was doing
I also gripped another lightning version
in silver this time and although yet
they some all is the same they like
somehow a Patronus battle so I
definitely prefer mine
and I will send back this one and the
3.5 millimeter version yeah I'm not
quite sure what's what's tuned here why
it's rated highly because it sounds
really bad compared to the normal one so
the lighting version yeah if it's active
or if there is some equalization thanks
to this and it's actively powered and
really not true but this sounds really
decent although yet my second unit like
some upper treble compared to this I
also try to measure the differences but
they were not so easily also thanks to
this insertion depending on how deep you
insert them and you cannot be sure to
get them perfectly right all the time
also here take my sound samples with a
grain of salt is really hard to equalize
them the original sound that I recall
that the ears are hearing is like this
and I have to give them to something
with a Santos divert which sounds like
this
so for $50 and really great in here
still I have to find a better one
although it needs a mod but I also will
keep this one more triple driver is a
kind of reference because it sounds
nicely flat and when looking at the
curve again I will turn off all the
others and just use the lightning
version here so I think the curve shown
here is close to being well not perfect
but close to so you see there is
although in the measurement it shows up
at some is some deep in the 7 kilo Hertz
region if we get it flat here it becomes
way too hard sounding so taking all
resonances in account from from the ears
here from from a normal ear canal
I think yet it's already quite a natural
and smooth response with some treble
boost because this is this gets lost
otherwise and yeah I'm still not sure if
I will keep it I try to different but
I'm not getting consistent results also
with recordings I record one then I try
recording another one and with the same
calibration it sounds different so I
will probably seek for another kind of
more professional coupler cupola cupola
what's the name I'm not sure although
it's fun to use and not that expensive
it has its limits so I have to
experiment a little bit more so yeah
this is to conclude everything
the lighting version of the
triple-triple
driver is really well I wouldn't say
impressive but it's definitely a really
decent one if you get a good unit the
other one is not as great yeah and what
I forgot is that I also have there me in
ear Pro which costs around 20 dollars
and it's something in between it's also
designed by one more so obviously the
same company so it's austerity better
than the triple driver with normal still
worse than this but it's something in
between
curve wise so
some in the in the middle for $20
definitely a better deal I cannot
understand how this can be rated highly
if you haven't heard the latin version a
pity that you cannot get this here with
a normal connector maybe the reason is
because it's somehow actively powered
I'm really not sure yeah this was it for
the one more triple driver my final take
on this a kind of sum up also I hope I
could clear up some confusion regarding
the lighting version versus the normal
one there is a huge difference in sound
especially for me I'm not sure about you
but I will definitely keep the lighting
version here is a kind of reference for
future tests also if you can find
something even better for this price we
will have to see but this one is really
nice and I enjoy it
although for $50 you can get the Iowa
which is a little bit tradable heavy
therefore I apply my mod but it also
sounds nice at low levels thanks to
strong a bass and treble while the one
more trigger driver here the Lightning
version has a nicely balanced sound so
you can even use it maybe for listening
to my videos still more bass than a
normal studio monitor would have but
really really nice yeah I hope you like
this video thanks for watching and see
you in the next one bye bye
