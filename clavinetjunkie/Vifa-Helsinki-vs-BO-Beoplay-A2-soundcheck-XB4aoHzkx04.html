really interesting speakers the FIFA
Helsinki which is maybe what I think the
best sounding portable speaker I've
heard so far and the bangle of some pure
play - both are quite comparable they
also have a similar price tag both
companies are from Denmark both speakers
are green and both look a little bit
like handbags as you can see a little
bit uncommon for a speaker but of course
the main differences between these two
are that the a2 is a 360-degree speaker
so you get sound from the front and from
the back while the FIFA Elson key is a
more traditional high five - on speaker
of course I tried measuring both and if
we have a look at the frequency response
measurements you can see that the a2
measures a little bit like some mountain
landscape so it has deep bass it has
some nice shrill treble but well
everything between is a little bit
woolly while if you look at the FIFA
Helsinki especially with the late type
tuning it measures like a straight flat
red line of course you only get the
sound if you are sitting directly in
front while the Bang &amp;amp; Olufsen you play
a - emits sound in a 360-degree way so I
thought we will hear how these both
compare as always I'm using high quality
binaural microphones you should really
listen with headphones to get the most
realistic result so please put your
headphones up and let's have a listen to
this tool first let's start to listen at
lower levels which is definitely a
strength of the band all of you play a
tool while f if I don't think you rather
prefers high levels I'm starting with a
few files in key first
I think you can hear the different
approach to some tuning very strong
emphasis on higher treble also base is
pretty dominant but the meats sound a
bit Hollow if I think it has a much more
natural sound of course this changes if
we start moving around the room the
lemon also maintains the sound quality
also from behind you can still listen
well while for the before you simply
have to sit directly in front
I increased volume slightly and put this
because a bit far away you know you
won't crank them when sitting directly
in front let's have a listen to a
classical track from Tchaikovsky
starting with the 50s thank you first
you
yeah think you can hear that this sounds
a bit artificial
not like some Orchestra but more like
some synthesized instruments
there is something wrong with the
frequency response
maybe some chess
because sounds a bit more diffuse
I got thought yes yes the boughs okay -
yeah
or Russian dance music
some retro 80s kind of disco sound
wait
yeah
even more a tip think although this is a
modern prep from savasana
hear the vocals are somewhere trapped
within their I don't know how to
describe
oh come on it suddenly became more
reggae so let's listen to some blues
rock
and
now I increased volume is more and put
them closer to the wall let's have a
listen again starting with the F if I
think you first you're playing a tall
start swallowing the whole dynamics the
drums have disappeared only high hats
and cymbals F remain this still sounds
like the original recording
yet becomes some sizzling strange kind
of song let's try something else
also very dynamic electronic drums yeah
this is a little bit messy yes again
yeah the salsa bit strange the telephone
no press there is still lots of punch
with the pricing hey let's try the a -
yeah bass drum has disappeared I have
the difference is my delay here I will
increase volume for maximum involved
doesn't go any louder if he fights well
here it is something else
yet became a toy speaker
here even the 360-degree song won't help
anymore
some disco
yes a different Freck
yeah I don't know I mean it's trying to
be loud
but you cannot let's try this last wreck
the whole dynamics is simply missing
here
yeah no this is a joke doesn't make
sense to compare yeah I think you would
hear it if you want the best sounding
hand back yeah this is the FIFA L sinky
while the Biot play a2 is not a bad
speaker but simply compared against
their FIFA it sounds a bit tight
especially at high levels it's close to
unusable also battery life is really
ridiculous at maximum volume you will
get 50 minutes then it drops exactly to
half while with the favela stinky this
is not some battery King but I measured
more than two and a half hours it makes
the moment you could hear that it's it
sounded still powerful and was also
louder than them and then a two so yeah
I hope you liked this video yeah I hope
I could convince you again for the FIFA
Helsinki as I think this is simply the
best sounding portable speaker while
being still portable I mean you see how
small it is it cannot compete against
larger speakers like the I Phi X s nine
nine or even the larger FIFA Copenhagen
I hope I will get a Copenhagen soon for
comparison and we could maybe try
putting the Copenhagen against some
bigger speakers like the boom stir excel
from TOEFL or the is nine it will be
interesting to hear how a high-end hi-5
portable speaker sounds against some
boom boxes like those so thanks again
for watching I hope you liked it yeah
please fold up when possible please
support me and we will see us in the
next video thanks and bye bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
