replacement for my gbx1 just arrived in
the very first one in what so much man
what a test therefore maybe take GTO
claims that it's really waterproof with
a grain of salt but this time before
opening the box I wanted to try
something completely different as I'm
still taking questions and comments
about breaking or burning of speakers
and the I wanted to try this out so
I will open it I would set it up here
you can see the wizard vinyl on
microphone official head also a metal
microphone and I will do some
measurements and recordings directly
after the unboxing and then I will break
or Bernardin for let's say 48 hours
playing some music some noise crowd
noise or know some sign sweeps as many
sleeping yet the Sun opens up of the 20
hours of use it becomes better and sort
of song and I want to try this out in
reality if it's really true so I will
open it make some recordings and break
it in and do exactly the same 48 hours
later and I do it myself so yeah first
you can hear that that acoustics is
pretty but but I cannot move it even one
millimeter you would hear within the
recording that the sound changes
therefore I have to set it up here fixed
do the breaking don't move anything and
then do exactly the same after two or
three days and yeah let's even if there
is some difference I will play two
tracks then divide it into chunks and do
again a black list in tests so you can
tell me if you hear any difference or
which one you think is before breaking
which one is after breaking and we can
discuss this later on
therefore please pull up your headphones
yeah you are already listening from that
official aid this is another one meter
anyway the measurement mexican
disabilities closer but let's see if any
change in sound will show up in the
measurement or in the recording whatever
headphones and
so after two days of breaking in the
jail extreme to the difference in sound
is non-existant nothing zero I don't
feel any difference at all you can of
course also check out my uncompressed
high-resolution flat file the link is in
the video description and tell me if you
hear any difference or if you can say
which one was before break in which one
after breaking at the very end I will
tell you the result
so the breaking or burning of a speaker
in this case with the gym extreme who
didn't show any effect we can of course
also check out some frequency response
measurement before breaking and after
breaking you can see there is some
slight difference especially in the
lower mids but the difference is so
minimal that I really thought it will be
horrible by anyone the only thing that
will change is distortion after break in
distortion increased in the base region
so in case of the gable extreme to the
breaking or burning period didn't have
any benefit to the sound on the contrary
it increased Distortion I also noticed
when playing some side switch that it
becomes completely out of control at
particular frequencies so they persuade
the stand to read as you can see
especially the right one here below it's
clean
but here comes completely chaotic
perfectly
and I thought this might be some defect
if you need yeah some sample variation
but I tried it in a store with another
it did exactly the same but and both
said so both we're a team
therefore they build quality from JPL
seems quite questionable as well also
yeah my first units in died after my
water test it was full with water and
tried opening it dry it but it died
anyhow I couldn't turn it on anymore so
to close this topic yet the JB extreme
tool doesn't really benefit from any
burning the difference there is no
difference some slight one visible from
a measurement but they cannot hear it
anyhow and also a still question why a
burning should improve the sound it can
also worsen salt still many people
believe in burning breaking and we can
maybe try doing the same test with some
more professional gear when I get some
other studio monitors maybe so I will do
exactly the same again after unboxing
set them up do some measurements some
recordings and then after breaking again
the table extreme to also show an effect
but maybe us because though yeah so I
hope you like this video thanks for
watching and see you in the next one
have a nice time and bye bye
hi guys as you can see the replacement
for my Jeep</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
