wait, I'll have a look
look, 2 huge packets have arrived
I can hardly carry them
Jazzy is barking
have a look
another one is still there, wait I'll bring it
and a small one
please close the door
so as you can see, Teufel has send me again something
we will unbox this, but this time with a time lapse
so that it won't become that boring
and later on, we will of course also take a listen
so let's go
so I wired everything quickly
and as you can see, that's the Teufel Ultima 40 Aktiv
the active version of the maybe most popluar German loudspeaker
2005 this was the mostly sold speaker
and the active version has the advantage to substitute an entire stereo system
it has HDMI, optical, also Bluetooth
it also comes with that funny looking remote control
this well known Teufel puck allows you to control volume
also switching between sources
and I thought we will have a short listen
of course please listen with headphones
this is a binaural recording
I have no idea what to expect from them
they are indeed quite huge
but yeah, let's listen how they will play
I'll go a bit farther away
here you can change volume
it works quite nicely
sounds quite differentiated
you also have to consider that we are around 650-700€ here
so for this package the result is really impressive, what's coming out here
at the back you also have controls for bass and treble
that is neutral now
increasing treble a bit more
a bit more bass
although this increases upper bass too much
but I think it should also play well with more acoutic music
let's listen to this
so come closer to me
I am not missing anything here
neither bass, nor treble
also mids are very direct, very neutral
what do you think?
good
something else
I would say, they really play on a high level
doesn't sound like a &quot;prole&quot;-speaker
I am really quite impressed
let's listen to this, something more jazzy
maybe something a bit more danceable
let's try this
I don't want to crank them too loud, but...
ho ho ho
the sofa vibrates!
the sofa vibrates?
a little, let me see
they also have a subwoofer out
although I don't think you will really need a subwoofer
except if you want to make some disco maybe
but for home this is more than enough
let's try something like that
yeah, I think we don't need to listen further, it sounds great with everything
some shelf is already vibrating here somewhere
here is something vibrating
it is already a bit too much bass for this room
let's hear this one
and I know there are many rock-fans
so go a bit farther away, to the window
why?
because I will turn up this horrible music now
and watch out, close your ears!
ahhhhh....
yeah, quite nice
of course there will also be a more detailed test
also some comparison
although right now I have nothing comparable at home
I think something may arrive
something similar in a similar price range
right now they are without competition here
I have some studio monitors, which of course sound more linear
but they are not as much fun as these
because here you can really attach your TV
it has a HDMI Arc input
with audio return channel
you can use it as some surround system
but without rears of course
yeah, really great!
I am quite impressed as for now
I also like the design a lot
white combined with black
we have another package, a small one
doesn't matter, it's that as cool as this here
I hope you had fun with this first impression including unboxing
I hope it could also give you an idea about the sound
I think soon, in 1-2 weeks we will be able to hear more of it
although I am not sure if I will manage to include them into my database
with such floorstanding speaker, it was never meant for that
it was rather meant for these little bluetooth boxes
in the meantime I also have some larger ones...
yeah, we could try if we manage to include them into the database as well
anyway many thanks for watching
and see you in the next video, bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
