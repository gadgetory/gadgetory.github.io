about the comparison of the new table
extreme to against the docking define so
I told you I checked my database
both are all included this should give
you some first idea but many obviously
still don't know about my database
although it's their first big video on
my channel also in every of my videos I
insert a link to it still people are
asking compare this with this and so on
although all these because I included we
have to keep in mind that I cannot keep
them all at home so I have sold many
speakers like the diamond box modem is
it was too big for me too
it was great but I didn't have the need
for it also I don't have the go and play
anymore it was substituted by that
private booster and gee but I have visto
so yes you have wished I would like to
do this comparison still I get comments
like yeah that database is boring I
don't use it and this makes a little bit
said I thought it would be helpful to
you to really get an overview about all
possible speakers I think there are
around 250 recordings of different
speakers from all classes it took me
lots of effort to bring it as far also
lots of time to record
I need a calm day so without any
motorbike as passing by otherwise and I
have to record everything so yeah it
takes me lots of time and if you don't
like it or if you don't use it if you
don't know about it I will simply quit
to feed it with new speakers because
yeah I need time to add new speakers I
need also a special mood because
otherwise yeah I cannot sit down for
half an hour and do nothing just because
because therefore yeah if you don't like
it I will quit with this database but
yeah many a vest about is tuned so here
here they are you have to keep in mind
that the docking define is way cheaper
so we can get it four hundred forty
years sometimes it was already on offer
below 100 so yeah it's one third of the
G bit extreme to for me personally I
prefer the tuning of the JB extreme tube
which is more hi-fi maybe this is a hill
bit booming - booming for me especially
the upper base starts to drawn sometimes
but I think it's also a little bit
louder and I would like to test this out
first we will listen to them indoors it
cannot have volume maybe this is where
the G bill extremely shines so our
volume is its sweet spot below it tends
to
it sounded a bit thin and a buff also
because it reduces bass or so cannot
keep the power and it makes me some
strong limiter kicks in and and reduces
volume so you get some volume pumping
you won't get this one at docking define
and yeah later on let's get outside and
also listen to them at make some volume
so as always this is a binaural
recording usually listen with headphones
for the best results listening through
even yeah a great speaker doesn't give
you this kind of impression that you
would get if you listen from for
headphones please put your headphones up
and let's check them out keep in mind
that volume control is not simply
talking define anaconda JP Alan and
interestingly also bass changes
depending on the volume levels so for
maximum bass turn the speaker to maximum
and let's start with the JBL extreme
tone and volume around half
you can hear that hele appears somehow
more balanced also more direct the
knocking seems somehow more details and
also away Bhumi another song
looking again you can hear that or some
leads are somehow swallowed so the GPL
is more hype I while this year rather
boom-boom' box
not okay
well you better count your blessings
good when you got CL now you got back
all your connections in return why we
live and we learn is then you don't
worry this totally build a bigger future
for the kids these ten war let's take it
to the floor every time we take two
steps to crafting the console here at
their smallest deepest from the PBO the
anger and the fear was in the dressing
room crap that we came out to light it
up and put it in the hand that's real
abacus
they also so much booming as somehow
this even appears somehow yang Hong Ki
compared to the docking so it really
depends on your taste if you have rather
for flat response or for a booming bass
and treble boost so probably small
boosted that meets are not as pronounced
something else and you can hear that the
pace doesn't have this yeah this impact
it just me somebody drowning also I'm
sitting a little bit yes
subpar so you will definitely hit deeper
bass from here for example so an
increased volume you can hear some nice
slower pace while that talking to find
other videos
I think you can get a difference let's
try this wreck
okay
sounds a bit hollow because of the
strong upper base
so you're always there on 2/3 and this
is where the GB always starts to loose
base
while the docking defense will keep more
upper base let's fight this fight and
increase one anymore like this give us
the face from is just some mocking but
knocking on the talking but of course
out was this should have an advantage so
let's get autos and check them there I
will turn the docking defined to maximum
again so we have the entire volume range
and also maximum base and let's start
with the JBL and volume around half
if you can leave that it is rather low
levels the JBL manages a nicer base
lower base but as we are in nearby
highway which is quite loud we'll have
to increase volume a little bit so let's
see what happens we around 2/3 3/4
meeting networking then thanks to this
our base and meet base which remains
more punchy and sounds full outdoors
invoke this still sounds more pleasant
meeting its in Kristen's maximum GZ oh
okay test somehow more of this kid I
think the entire bench is vibrating
supposed to rattles quite a lot still
the deviations were pleasant but
also a little bit lost offers this way
now track will come close again it's not
that loud so I'm standing four meters
away now or three meters talking
and Bumi but all those are things this
is more of an advantage which may become
somehow more meat focused in our base is
how believable
he goes yeah more but also as the Moapa
dace come to us
so this luminous is an advantage I'll
post this one out back the big Texas
okay acceptable order and :
we can hear this volume drop the limiter
has some problem of the GBO trying to
push volume down all the time but the
starts to the wrong a little bit so
let's read this track
and you could do it well after the piano
when that bass kicked in the limiter
also kicked in and reduced rolling again
so here they're talking should be
private louder they're definitely
positive this limiting issues so I will
try to get far away but a mirror Lotus
which is a bit weak
thank you JBL becomes a little bit
my way maybe eight meters now
well the myths also sounded a bit
strange on the talking so it's not
perfect
please for making noise I think
collegiate bedroom let's write this
right just for the base from here what
it's distorting off if it's the bench
the vibration here
so it's a cheese wedding again except
the edge shall feel distorted but also
more punchy somehow basically more
pronounced on the bottom part which is
not that day
boom overall the gdl would be more
pleasant let's write history also with
this kind of reference or a dubstep each
other straddles because of lots of mix
and treble so this is where the limiter
really strikes the talking over here if
I go too far away the talking will start
to lose hopeful connection it's not that
way you can hear material has no
problems although yeah it because a lip
gloss
you have to come closer Center
so overall the videos constantly more
pleasant but they notice suitable for
high also lawdness miss reduce from
metal threat
I'm not sure I wholly say which one is
ever hear of exited to continue
knowledge seems very strange scientist
Virginia
for the business
it's placement the token it gives now
the footer legatus maybe 30 degrees off
axis but sounds based on exit
I hope you could hear the docking define
is definitely not bad especially for the
Esk price at maximum volume autos it
easily outperform the giblets from -
although it tends to sound a little bit
too booming so the bass starts to get
drawn and also vibrate a lot I'm not
sure if we could hear real bass or if it
was the bench vibrating but at normal
levels I prefer that a bit extreme hands
down as it has a more natural tuning
this has quite a bit of a treble boost
and too much upper base so there is too
much bass in there 200 250 Hertz region
apart from that it's a decent speaker
for the price and I would still
recommend it as some kind of a boombox
maybe quite compact but if you really
need loudness you need still something
bigger like the joyful booster engine
which is only available in Germany the
going play is not as loud
therefore I prefer the toilet still
against the J bit extreme to the top
defined still fast well I would say and
for the price it's a great value so I
hope yeah for all those who are asking
this video satisfied you and I went out
to us so that we can hear the difference
in how this was not that huge with very
loud tracks you can hear that the
limiter pushes volume too much down on
the G of extreme talk while the docking
defined kept the volume on a normal
constant level but with particular
tracks here you could hear some strange
distorting from that bass drums not
really starting but it was at the edge
of being a little bit uncontrolled maybe
so yeah I hope you like this and maybe
this is the last video of the GD extreme
- I won't keep it I was fighting with
myself but it's simply not enough for me
for normal levels I'm satisfied with a
gentleman via my defi force law there's
also a greater job while at high levels
it simply fails so I will take that for
you boom stir ng which also sounds
grated lawyers maybe less Sparkle on
this but simply better overall with
deeper bass and I can adjust based on my
liking therefore although it's a great
speaker it's not enough it's not extreme
and this is the biggest problem yeah I
think I will get something similar so
maybe I will still keep it until the
news
this will be a surprise some cheap China
one but quite comparable hopefully so
I'm curious to hear how that one will
fare but until then stay tuned have a
nice time and bye bye
