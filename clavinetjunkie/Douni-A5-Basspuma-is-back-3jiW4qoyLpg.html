base BMO which represented last year I
had put it against some other more
higher class because like then Marshall
Stockwell still I think the base Bhima
felt quite a bit better
unfortunately it was discontinued pretty
soon but now the same speaker is back
under a different brand within your name
is cheaper now and with better sound
here I have the downy a5 currently
available on Amazon for $70 you can
check the link in the description of my
video I doubt you can get much better
speakers for this price and I thought we
should check it out immediately I regret
my head cam and my binaural microphones
you should grab your headphones and
we'll put it against their JBL charge 3
which costs twice as much so please put
up your headphones and let's check them
out so let's have a look Downie a 5 with
20 watts of power superior sound quality
increased special DSP chip super bass
output at the back you can see this
power bank function even an auxiliary
out and the battery has six thousand six
hundred milliamps I will open it some
QuickStart guide manual and the speaker
and here is probably the power adapter I
will turn them on immediately so we can
have a listen
Travis Lee County a 5 pretty software
compounds and some have maybe noticed
that soul persona princess feature has
canceled their pledge campaign for the
new album they have some severe problems
so will dedicate this to them I will
start with an unreleased track and the
bass drum efforts so please have a
listen
trust me sailors to me tell it to me
give me your line but the like just
around my face these purses amigo okay
the postman deliver it to me you're in
charge
please accompany the cover dear fans out
making my fan base is from how Fuller's
from the town another track from super
something suspicion which is an
alternative version of analog
yes I will speak more zero compression
this is you soon
differently some are FX moocher
but they sound quite similar
you
although the downing has a bit more
clarity maybe come on attack
or something like this from house maybe
now the deficit has more boosted bait
so nice for bass lovers both employees
just asleep
he'll come home a mouthful but it may be
without a
come on perk and I will stand up so we
can increase volume and hear how they
compare a maximum volume this is the
downy a5 now is according to maximum
charge 3 as well
the only difference is louder here just
a even to come to the fountain where we
don't quite work and we hurt ourselves
with depression
please Milius office office after a
rapid loss I think you could hear it the
new bass puma or downy a five sounds
quite a bit better than the old version
the strong upper bass boost is gone so
it sounds smooth out somehow more mature
now there is some slight distortion
higher levels but still I think for $70
it's still and much better than this
large communal speaker I read it before
I also think it sounds somehow more
appealing than the JBL charge 3 which
costs twice as much so if you're
interested I would grab one now as
seventy dollars is just an introductory
price and the price will increase soon
of course we will do more tests over
there Donny a five also including
frequency response measurements putting
it against some other speakers in this
price range but I cannot really tell you
one which can compete here so if you're
interested grab one I hope you like this
and see you in the next video agonized
island bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
