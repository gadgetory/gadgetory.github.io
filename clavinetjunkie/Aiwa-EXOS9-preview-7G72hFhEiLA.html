surprise for you it was a surprise for
me as well when I found a huge box left
in front of my door by the postman of
course we were so curious to see what is
inside I think my son was even more
curious so we immediately opened it this
is the first and brand-new bluetooth
speaker from IVA the access 9 and as you
can see this is no toy anymore I mean
this is a real speaker this thing is
huge
I mean it's heavy it's it's like a Dumbo
and if you still remember Ivor
I mean you're probably old enough to
remember all the old boom blasters
ghetto blasters boom boxes from that
time and this is a kind of revival
I mean you see a huge woofer two main
drivers to tweeters and of course we
would like to know how it sounds but
first let me give you some details let's
turn it on as you can see it has a nice
customizable five band equalizer there
are also four different other presets
there is also one battery saving preset
which reduces the bass you can link it
with another one for either stereo or
doubling the sound there is NFC onboard
of course it supports up to X the volume
dial is really smooth and at the back
you can see a charge port for external
devices you have to note that it's a 110
volts device only so I nearly burned it
because I try to attach it to 220 a good
thing is the battery is quickly swept
double and you can exchange it for
another one very quickly so a pretty
nice device of course as usual please
listen with headphones as this is a
binaural recording and because of the
retro revival I thought we will try a
kind of retro track with Simmons drums
from the 80s and some tr-808 cowbells
this is hexagon from opal opal I'm
starting with half volume
let's increase the volume a bit so full
volume no Distortion nothing just pure
sound
this is so you really thought the JBL
extreme was extreme ha she went toy if
you need music I think this is the way
to go
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
