back with another unboxing and oh sorry
I couldn't resist I got here something
and I thought we will open this together
I think I know what this is
mr. flossing already got it before this
is the Beast
the shark beast ultra powerful 45 watt
speaker this is a real beast man yeah
let's open it a knife without knife
there is no life yeah I'm really curious
it already got pretty raving reviews get
this out here looks very very precious
shark beast yeah this is really a beast
whoa first I thought it would be kind of
Sound Blaster roar clone but this is
larger bigger this looks really huge
yes I move over inside I wonder
here are the passive radiators the
designs looks pretty similar to the to
the sound blaster roar just that the
woofer is below not on top let's check
what do we have here maybe you can turn
it on yeah so maybe I can immediately
connect let's have a look shark beast
and I think this calls for 199 also in
Europe connected yeah and we could have
a short listen sounds serious
let's see volume Jason snake
volume let's put those besides the boss
is already yes report
I'll put them away and we can walk
around a little bit and see how loud
this beast is BC these reliefs
reflecting volume not
yes this makes the Emporium of the bone
peace again
yeah this sounds pretty impressive loud
clear let's check another track I think
we will need something bigger I will
take the JBL extreme sorry for the mess
but yeah I got quite a lot of stuff
lately and the trusty old JBL extreme is
still there hidden so let's check this
out compared against the shark beast I'm
curious if the beast can compete at
least loudness wise
Jabil extreme is already playing at next
I will reduce the volume slightly so
this is the extreme
might a bit different the shark seems to
have some nice low base extension but
not that much upper base it will be
definitely an interesting comparison
this is just for now a quick unboxing
impression yeah looks really decent I
mean loudness wise which impressive
sound is yeah also nice although you
heard it sounds simply different than
the JBL and as already mentioned I got
quite a lot of different stuff recently
that I really have so covers own I also
have this GG mm mm for speaker also
calls 499 well it's a bit bigger than
the shock but at least price-wise they
are comparable so I will have to cover
them soon and I have a bit lack of time
so for now just a quick unboxing with a
very short sound impression but it looks
very very promising I think not too big
not too heavy and still pick some really
serious punch so I hope you enjoyed it
this little unboxing and yeah we will
see more of the shark beast in a real
upcoming video
not sure which speaker I should compare
it with I don't have any sound blaster
roar ah but well I contacted sound
creative but they ignored my inquiries I
wanted to have the high
well how do you pronounce this wrong
rawr
yes sorry and yeah they didn't answer so
well I think the I row would be I roll I
roll would be the best contender I think
because they share lots of similarities
so thanks guys
I have to continue with my work I hope
you enjoyed it
have a nice time and bye bye
