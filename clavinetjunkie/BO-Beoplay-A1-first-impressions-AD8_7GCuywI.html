front of the bank on all of the store
I'm shortening they just got the brand
new beer play a one a very nice small
portable speaker I already ordered mine
but it will probably arrive next week so
I thought we will get inside and have a
short listen so here we have the a1 as
you can see it's really nicely small I
think it's exactly the same size as the
ultimate ears roll but a bit heavier
I brought my JBL charge 3 with me well I
had it in my rucksack so let's check how
these two compare is always on of course
using high quality binaural microphones
and I'll start playing with the charge
free first it's about half volume now
you
very one
as you can hear this is a more
omnidirectional song so it shouldn't
change regardless how I stand or while
the JBL loses every treble from behind I
will turn the knob slightly higher
maybe not a prick
a one it sounds really nice for the size
especially treble is impressive here one
of the weaker points of the Chakri is it
just a G touch freegan you really have
to spend like that
of course you could also place the a1 on
the floor and still have great song
let's try this
this should increase bass as well but I
think you can hear that both on a very
high level I will put it back
let's try another crack keep in mind
that you can connect both wirelessly in
stereo with another one of course the
sound of the a1 appears a bit more
diffuse because it fills the entire room
now playing upwards maybe some dance
house and I will increase both to
maximum is the charge 3 no
nor is torsion mapping
it's much louder
another track some rock
a slightly softer but it's been
impressive I mean it's much louder than
they charge for some it means
in mind I can walk around and still get
the same song
we loses everything
yeah definitely a very impressive
speaker and I hope I will get my own one
soon so we can have a listen more in
detail yeah of course I forgot
completely you can let the a1 hang like
this so let's have a listen how both
compare like this I'm starting with the
charge 3 again playing it around well
two thirds maybe
anyone
yeah this travel is really sparkling
like some diamond you also use the wall
as reflection for base so I think it's
really impressive yeah
thanks for watching everyone and bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
