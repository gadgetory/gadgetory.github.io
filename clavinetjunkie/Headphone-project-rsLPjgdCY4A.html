of content lately I have lots of
interesting stuff coming up like this
rarity kenwood bt 77 from japan quite an
outstanding speakers already web showing
although only available in japan i also
have the brand new anchor sound called
boost here sound course select and sound
code tool they are more or less equal
but there are still some differences
what I'm currently in the process of
rethinking my approach to videos to
recordings and so on so I do some
research trying out and so on therefore
some delay you probably come here
because you want to hear how the speaker
songs in reality before trying them out
in the store or buying them not because
I'm prettier because my views are so
great but this is not really easy to
offer you the most realistic sound
impression this was always my intention
to offer you exactly this but I'm still
getting comments like how can I judge
the speaker where the sound of a speaker
to a YouTube video this is or
the spirits because I just sound like
yours because therefore from some
certain point on I started to I settled
for binaural recording as I thought this
would give you the most immersive
realistic impression I also try to film
the sound of the recording for a very
neutral sound so when listen to a
neutral headphones you should get more
less the same results that I was hearing
in reality so when I unique for a
neutral headphone like the sennheiser HD
600 it will sound great through this
headphone but for another neutral
headphone like this audio technica ath
m4x it will sound different or both both
are neutral so also getting some other
comments like the speaker sounds much
brighter for my powers and linkings
headphones than in reality of course
because this is just a headphone if you
listen to it for
sennheiser HD 600 or even the bangles
from h6 it should sound ok but now I'm
thinking if it wouldn't be better to
tune my recordings for a particular
headphone only one that anyone can
afford to this available worldwide so I
was doing some research trying
different headphones you might have one
from super-luxe
it's called HD 668 be available for
around $40 here in Europe it's cheaper
for 30 euros and also nice because it
has three different wires to be attached
I already did some tryouts and I can
really achieve great results so when
listen to this headphone you will hear
what I was doing so of course 100% the
imaging is still quite a bit different
then when you listen to - when I sit
here this is where speaker then I put up
the headphones it's very very close the
frequency response is close to equal but
of course the imaging is different
because there's a driver surface of the
headphone I bit far apart so you would
probably need to loose some in ears
so I'm really looking for a headphone
that you would buy just for my
recordings and this way I could give you
really valid results and I would tune
all my future videos just for this
single headphone so when listen for
another one it will sound off but when
listened to a particular particular one
still doing some research on oi have
here this Sennheiser px hundreds - but
it sounds off too much bass boost and so
on
here is a very cheap one also from super
luxe HD 681 this would go for 27 or 28
dollars so I think everyone could afford
it but the unit I got here has some
strange imaging left/right difference so
I just asked for every placement and I
hope maybe they are all like this or
because they are so cheap there is no
quality control all others are great so
the more expensive model from super luxe
is great
I could definitely tune all my
recordings for this but I'm not sure if
you are really willing to spend 30 40
dollars for a headphone just to to
listen to my recordings but I think this
is the only way how I can really give
you valid 100% valid results of course
it will still sound a little bit
different as I just told you because my
ears are different than yours because
the imaging of the headphone is
quite a bit different than in reality
also my most of my recording so far
upside or 3.0 don't know how to process
in English I'm not real binaural
recordings I don't have my my my
microphones directly inside my unit but
in front of the year this way I avoid
the resonance of my unit but I also get
much clearer recordings if I really had
them inside the year the recordings
would need much more utilizing much more
tuning I already have to tune them to
really get realistic results but when I
have them inside my ear there is much
more resonant so it has to quickly sound
in words and it's much easier to me to
really do it for a particular headphone
and therefore I want to know from you if
you are willing if you if you are going
to spend thirty forty dollars for a
headphone just to listen to my videos of
course in future I want to extend my my
review more I'm the process of creating
a room just for videos for speakers so
it will be it will be only for for my
videos so probably acoustically
optimized in some way I also want to
extend my livers to sound bars but to
give you this realistic front back
effect and so on I have to use binaural
recording and you will have to listen to
it through this particular headphone I'm
trying out some other ones but currently
I think this Apple acts
seeit are super super luxe 681 seems the
most promising it sounds a bit off there
is some resonance in treble but anyhow I
will equalize this away
so with my recordings the treble boost
is okay because my very callings when
all recordings are a bit more muscle
anyhow so I just want to know from you
is it a great idea to unit for a
particular headphone and are you really
willing I want to know how much or how
many of you how much percent is going to
spend money for a headphone just to
listen to my reviews but as I told you
there will be
in much more coming up so I also want if
I manage
currently most a madman channel is much
too small so I have approaching 50,000
subscribers but I cannot do this for
living if I could I would really extend
everything even for more professional
gear studio monitors and when I can
optimize my recordings in such a way
that they are really as close to reality
as possible when listened to a
particular headphone you will get much
better results still I want to know from
you are you willing to spend some money
20 $30 $40 for a headphone so that you
get really valid results or don't you
poor you don't care at all you just
watch the video because it's funny or
you watch it through an iPad without any
headphones so and still getting comments
like I am listening to this for my JBL
charge 3 or hey this does not make sense
these recordings are binaural ones and
you need to listen to a headphone
otherwise you can crappy results or not
valid ones there is way too much room
ambience in the recording so when listen
to a speaker which additionally add some
ambience you will get double the the
reverb and because of the resonance of
the head and currently I avoided the
resonance of so the HRT FS from my head
the frequency response for speaker will
be off you will get much too much needs
and so on therefore you need headphones
but still each headphone despite neutral
sound they sound simply different and
the only way for me is to unit for a
particular one and I want to select one
that anyone can afford so really cheap
one and again please tell me are you
willing what do you think about this
idea or shall I continue like I did so
we will live with wishy-washy without
what I think to bring it to a higher
level I need to do more I'm not
satisfied with the current state because
I don't know which headphones you use
for the recording I cannot try all of
them out but I know that my recording
sound or through some particular ones
beats to do correct with lots of bass
boost some
even the the pendulum you play h6 has
too much bass boost so if i turn it more
neutral for a sound so that they sound
right to the sennheiser they will sound
off through this h6 network this is
where I'm currently a little bit
fighting and I stopped or simply doing
any real speaker videos because I'm not
satisfied with the current state and I
want to take it to a higher level to
really give you all the best results I
think this is what my channel is
specialized for so I'm not here because
I can with great reviews or because I
don't know because my videos are so
looking so great that better one so this
just look at genes video room is
actually the best looking videos on
YouTube but I want to give you them best
sound recordings available on YouTube
with the best quality and the most
realistic one if you listen to a
particular model I don't think it makes
sense to continue using handheld
recorders for speaker recordings like
many others do because then it depends
if you listen to a headphone it will
sound off if you listen for a speaker to
something more off and yeah the only way
to really give you great results is when
I tune my recordings for a particular
model and then of course there will be
some slight central variation but it
will be much less than two different
headphone models with lots of resonance
within my recordings also when I try to
listen to this so then there has to be
lots of neutralizing to really bring the
recordings to reality and I will spend
lots of hours testing switching between
headphones reality
I already did before but I want to do
this again and tune them for a
particular headphone model so that you
really get the best results possible
everything else is just wishy-washy so
please tell me again what do you think
about this is this right I will probably
also in future extend their data base
for a new one
so when I want to test floor standings
because of having in my new room
currently it's still too early to say
something I have to do to renew their
room it's currently it will be my seller
so I will have much more time at night
during that I cannot place because here
in my living room so it will be really a
room just for recordings and I could
even record them the whole night I will
have much more much more time for this
but yeah it only makes sense if if you
tell me if it does make sense to you as
well to buy a headphone I mean this may
sound decent if you hear the super Lux 6
668 V you will notice that there is some
too much treble but overall it's much
better than many others for 40 dollars
you can get I still hope the new unit
from the 681 will be okay without the
strange left-right it was really strange
I put it on and I had the impression if
there was something left by us then I
turn it around and it still had a left
by us but I thought hey my ears are
broken I took this one and this was ok
all others ones were ok just this one
always had left by us regardless how I
put the pulley down so there must be
something maybe some phase out of phase
problem wiring from I'm not sure of
course for 727 or 28 dollars you cannot
expect much quality control still I hope
that this is just a single unit that has
this flow so yeah much more will be
coming up now but currently I'm delaying
this a little bit because I don't know
how to proceed if it makes sense to you
if it makes sense to me I can proceed as
always but then I will be never
satisfied I really wanted to get a high
level to achieve something and not to
just tell videos because it's so funny
and it's not funny it's really time
consuming for me also bring this special
audio database but without knowing that
you will really get the same result for
me it doesn't make sense
I want the to hear exactly the same what
I was hearing you're sitting in my own
and the effect is incredible when I put
the headphones on and with the tuned
sound for them
and I sit inside the room here listening
for the speaker listening for the
recording of the speaker really have the
impression as if you were listening to
the speaker so it's not power percent
that you get food pretty quickly if you
put a when you switch directly between
real reality and recording of course you
notice some differences but when you
leave the headphones on for some time
you get fooled and you really have new
question hey business the speaker
playing in front of me of course this is
much more realistic when you sit in
inside the room here because you'll hear
the acoustics you know the acoustical
therefore I also use my head cam too so
that you get more or less the impression
as if you were sitting inside this room
here otherwise any binaural recording
without the image is not as true as when
you already sit inside so yeah
becoming it long I hope yeah I could
tell you some of my ideas of my future
plans of course I mean thankful that I'm
reaching 50,000 but it's still for me I
have to I need much more feedback much
more don't know how to proceed because
currently I'm not really satisfied with
the deepest level
I want that it grows that it becomes
better that it becomes some some
important resource including the speaker
database I will try to extend it to make
me maybe make a new one with a new setup
so in my new room I will have to
rerecord the speakers or simply
concentrate on the more advanced one so
really from studio monitors floor
standings because sound bars still don't
have any concept how to put them how to
take them into some database maybe this
will be standalone videos and some some
web app where you can also put the video
side by side and switch but maybe not as
advanced as the current one because it
only creates problems this switching I'm
not satisfied another solution would be
to make some kind of
of paid solutions or anyone interested
should they I don't know $1 per month
this would allow me to really give you
the best so I could spend my time
recording optimizing my my my setup and
really spending time for all this but
frankly it's just yeah just waste of
time you know when I spend a whole day
to record some crap is because I don't
have any any relevant I really do this
only for you so that you can I don't
need this database I have this because
at home or yeah so for me it's also a
little bit of the help so to memorize
how did this one sounded which I don't
own anymore but in reality I do this
just for you so I hope you will value
this as well let me see my camera stops
in some seconds this is these are the
European community limit half an hour
recording time and then yeah so of
course again if you are willing to to
help me with my work with my research
and so on feel free to donate
I could still some donations thanks a
lot to all those already donated I mean
I can tell you some values since I
started the database one year ago or
even longer I got around thousand euros
of donations
so it appears maybe much but this
covered
the cost for the programmer discovered
some of the speakers maybe but yeah I
didn't learn anything from this you know
it's just a zero zero calculation so and
really dependent on your help if it
helps you
yeah if you think my database my
recordings help you you can also help me
by some donation so that I can really
continue buying headphones trying them
out as well so thanks a lot for watching
this was maybe not helpful but yeah I'm
trying to help where I can
of course I cannot respond to all
comments and getting so many currently
and I don't have the time I have to play
with my son
and so on so please apologize if I
cannot respond to any question also use
my database don't ask me how does this
one compare to this one if both included
within the database you can already hear
them there and and make your own
judgments but still think many don't use
the database they don't know it although
I I have it at my main page and so on so
thanks a lot for watching let me know
what you think about the headphone
project and see you in the next ago Emma
nice bye bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
