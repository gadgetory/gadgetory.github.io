going to talk about that bangle doll of
some do play a 6s with most bang &amp;amp;
olufsen products they try selling this
premium so this speaker has a price tag
of around thousand euros I got it for a
way cheaper so otherwise I probably
wouldn't have bought it but I wanted to
share my impressions with it
yeah bangle Dolson hosts this a one
point music system that fills the room
with spectacular sound so this is a
stationary unit which has Wi-Fi included
also bluetooth it has spotify connect
tune in to DS or whatever but it needs
to be attached to mains all the time the
design here looks a bit strange it has
this fabric cover from quadrat some
Scandinavian textile company just the
same that is used for all FIFA's
speakers so they look quite similar
regarding finish and although the
venison you play is six looks a big a
bit big it's quite a slim speaker so you
can see there is hardly any any
thickness to it it comes or there are
optional wall mounting brackets so you
can let it hang on a wall but I think it
looks a bit strange it looks rather like
some some satellite antenna then a
speaker you really have to like this
design it has a nice grip at the back so
you can carry it around although it's
not a light lightweight it's I think
around 4.5 kilograms or something of
course no better included and yeah the
specs are quite interesting it has two
woofers to Twitter's and even a full
range grab at the back which should
offer a little bit of an omnidirectional
effect we could take off this grille to
have a look how the drivers look so yet
you can see the big woofers here -
Twitter's they are slightly aimed
outwards which should enhance the stereo
field the back driver is of course not
visible but yet below
you have another compartment here which
includes a switch for placement so there
is a placement for free clothes at the
wall and in a corner this switch what I
noticed adjusts based slightly so in a
corner base will will be getting reduced
while standing completely free you get
most base quite quite a bit of a bass
boost so it says here 260 watts for the
woofers one time 60 watts for the back
driver and 230 watts for the tweeters so
altogether we are 240 watts for the
speaker but as we already know Bennett
also likes to exaggerate a little bit
with the ratings because 240 watts for
the speaker is a bit much I would say
what else to say
controls are a bit strange the entire
area here on top is touch sensitive so
depending where you touch it something
happens also during carrying around I
always touch something here so it
switches to another source or starts
playing music for changing volume you
have to stroke it like that I would
rather use it remotely from the
smartphone or tablet or whatever and I
don't want to go into details about
usage functions and so on but rather
concentrate one sound and as always I
will be using a head cam and my normal
microphones to give you a kind of
first-person impression we'll have a
listen to it with some songs I already
played before so we get a nice
impression about the sound I hope and
yeah please use headphones as this is
the only premise for binaural
microphones and yeah let's check it out
as you can see I set the a6 slightly far
away together with my Phillips on switch
because to have some comparison although
the Philips because are an older model
and not available anymore they should
still be quite comparable as the
original price was also around 700 up to
thousand dollars switching to the Bo
play a6 takes a bit of time because of
airplay so I will simply cut their paws
out in post-processing I will start with
the a6 and a jazz sound so please have a
listen
something else another song and you can
maybe hear some strange problems
problems with the bass here
Tilly's don't have any of these problems
basics again
needles something is not right here
there is some bass distortion let's
check how this sounds of exes so
obviously the back driver contributes
quite well on the a6
but the bass sounds really orbital here
would
a six again
yeah I think a computed
maybe a dense trick
yet according to the iPhone we are
around maybe 2/3 closer to 3/4 but it
sounds horrible tips because yes sounds
more normal here
you
three six again and maybe let's increase
volume slightly to see what happens
you have to reduce it closer to half
volume to get clean sound so apart from
the nested bass distortion why does the
Bo play a sick sound so much different
compared to the Philips answer is
because we can have a look at some
frequency response measurement and you
can see it measures small s like some
ballet landscape the Philips answer is
because although not perfectly flat
either measure just more natural so this
may be the reason why the Bo play is
6-ounce just different than many other
speakers now this may be a bit unfair
but let's compare the a6 against the
Harman Kardon go in play which is a
portable unit in place from battery it
also costs one third of the bill play a
six I will start again with the a6 in
the song from kpx so please have a
listen you can also hear it struggling
with the bass here the con play place
much cleaner
basics again maybe a track from princess
freesia we also hear boho basics again
they can hear just rub rub rub
there is no precision with the face
nothing let's try it right from
sunchaser
we also hear the bass drum sounds
horrible to do be just the same it was
on the Bo play a two
here everything is perfect a six again a
two three let's check how they sound off
axis
as you can see I put some rubber below
because they tended to vibrate a lot go
and play
here nothing of the strange effect here
also nice dispersion of X's but here the
bass sounds horrible
definitely not a speaker for modern
dance music and so on
probably not hip-hop either let's write
a threat I will increase volume slightly
but you can use some distortion from the
bass the coin play as well
much more punchy without Distortion
this sounds hollow somehow and outright
you're going to check how loud they can
play although this sounds already
distorted now
it won't play and I will increase what
information on
thirty-six as well
with quite a bit louder but sounds
horrible
another threat come on come on don't
play
a six yeah okay it turned off yeah
obviously some protection inside yeah
won't play so this is the effect when
the speaker yeah has some protection
building because it cannot play at
maximum volume but tries to so yeah I'm
not quite sure what to think about this
speaker I mean yeah please tell me your
opinion but four thousand dollars I was
expecting quite a bit more especially
the sound which starts falling apart
that levels about half is unacceptable
for a premium product like that I mean
it performs well at low levels but still
it has this typical bang bowls and sound
signature that you have to like with
lots of deep bass lots of treble but in
the middle everything is somehow missing
sometimes I had the impression is if I
was listening to some clock radio
together with a subwoofer because in the
middle there was no nobody to the sound
but really very detailed treble upper
treble mid treble really nice also deep
bass but this distortion is horrible we
heard it from the Bangalore symbiote
play it all the same
this one is even stronger as it has more
bass more boosted bass yeah you could
switch maybe to corner placement but
this would get rid of the bass nearly
completely yeah I'm really not sure I
mean I like the approach but it would
need some better processing there is the
latest firmware installed because I
thought maybe they corrected it like
they did with the a2 they too had lots
of distortion at the beginning later on
they issued an update which improved but
here it's it's still there and it sounds
horrible yeah
$4,000 I think I would go for definitely
something else it is not able to feel
larger rooms with an adequate volume
it's nice for a low level listening in
and maybe bedroom or some other small
room but I wouldn't play something like
that it's just too big
some smaller because because do the
trick as well so yeah
I'm not that impressed with it I liked
it because everything sounds so
different through the speaker then
hunama because but this distortion is
unacceptable for me I cannot listen to
music as most modern recordings have
this strong mastering which makes the
speaker strung completely so yeah it's
not a speaker for dense music maybe some
classical fans or jazz with not too much
bass not much upright bass but rather
Jess without bass would like it maybe
only piano music it has a nice sense of
stereo of course nothing exceptional but
there is some nice spaciousness to the
sound also very open sounding the back
driver of course also contributes to
this but yeah altogether I mean a
speaker like the Harman Kardon going
play which is a portable speaker costing
1/3 out performs this I mean it doesn't
sound natural either but it's a portable
unit that you can really take with you
and it sounds I mean does not distort
like this so yeah nothing else to say
about the Bengal single a 6 I already
added it to the speaker audio database
you can find it there and compare it to
some others because you will notice that
the b.o.b elite 15 has a very similar
sound signature this has even deeper
bass and and nice a treble but it
distorts horribly yeah I'm not that
impressed and I would if I if you got it
as I did for less than half the price
yeah maybe but not $4,000 forget it you
will get much better speakers think of
the JBL el 16 or something the big ones
yeah they are able to fill a large room
not this one so thanks a lot for
watching I hope you liked it I hope it
could give you an impression about the
sound and yeah if you want to know more
details you look up the side or some
manual it has some nice functions but
there is no ability to tune the sound
somehow with an equaliser like like it
is possible with the a21 where you can
slide a dot around and
change the tuning this is not possible
with a six so thanks a lot and yeah see
you in the next video have a nice time
your hash law</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
