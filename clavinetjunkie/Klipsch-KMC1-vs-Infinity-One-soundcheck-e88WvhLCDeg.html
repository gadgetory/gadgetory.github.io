Klipsch KMC one the little brother of
the KMC three that we've already heard
in some videos I already tested this
speaker maybe two years ago and it was
brand new and was not too excited about
it not because it sounds bad because it
has a nice frequency response really
deep bass but you won't hear this bass
usually at low levels it disappears and
at high levels it tends to distort so
there is only a very little range where
the speaker sounds perfect it has a
sweet spot at I would say maybe 60 70 %
below it sounds rather well tinny and
above it distorts with bass heavy songs
what's interesting about the speaker is
that it's always in some kind of standby
mode and I can wake it up by simply
selecting it from the Bluetooth list I
would like to give you an idea about the
sound I thought first we will try the
JBL extreme but this would be an unfair
comparison the clip could be had for
below 100 euros recently there was lots
of hype around it in German discussion
forums because for 100 years it's really
a very decent performer outperforms most
other solutions at this price but well
the extreme is simply another category I
have the infinity one still here with me
that a friend of a friend of another
friend borrowed me and the infinity
smaller it's also a bit a bit lighter so
I think this would be a better contender
the original price for the clip CMC one
was also I think $300 so it's still the
same price as the infinity one sometimes
the Infinity one can be had for below
like 250
now when the extreme comes to the US it
will probably drop even more I'm wearing
binaural microphone
so please listen with headphones and I
will play some different tunes and we
will have a listen I will be starting
with the infinity one first and some
jazz funk track from resolution 88 one
of the greatest British jazz funk groups
have a listen
now when Chris was a little more
yes we have powerful maximum as it
already
I will reduce volume again it's fine on
a track I'm not sure it sounds a bit
lifeless
you hardly hear their deeper bass of the
clips it's simply drawn away that
infinity doesn't reach that deep but it
still sounds more punchy somehow
another press again
yeah there is some rattling from the
pistol here cuz from the infinity a
typical no arrow or floor you hear but
there's also distortion so all farmers
really great yeah let's try another just
 track by resolution 88 let's have a
listen
I will reduce volume again for both yet
now you hear that the bass drum has more
body more more load base but then PT
still has this punch that is somehow
missing from the clip
I think it would benefit from
positioning it closer to to some back
back wall or something let's try it here
too much Distortion
I will turn both to maximum
god it's hardly usable let's take them
back for a kind of resume I mean 400
euros or if you can get it for close to
$100 this is a pretty decent speaker but
the original price I think $2.99 is
simply exaggerated I mean nowhere close
to the performance of the JB on Xtreme
finally they are even similarly loud but
I mean it's not usable at maximum volume
or close to maxing volume while the JBL
has this processing that it limits Peaks
and reduces bass clip doesn't do
anything it would help if it pushed bass
at lower level slightly to make it more
sound more full-bodied and do the
opposite at high levels but it doesn't
solve well for a portable speaker I mean
you can do this approach with with huge
floor-standing loudspeakers but not for
small portable boxes that have their
limits I think a clip should overthink
the approach I mean this is not high fee
we are we are talking about portable
devices and I think the goal is to to
squeeze out most sound most distortion
free sound regardless if there is some
processing or bass reduction but I don't
know maybe a purist will even prefer the
pure approach from clips I don't
I hope this could give you an idea I
mean it's a decent speaker but maybe not
for everyone's taste for auto use if you
want high loudness and and distortion
free sound for the clips is not very
very perfect it sounds pretty good at my
bath
the acoustics enhances the deep bass and
it's not boo me because you heard the
bass is rather restrained a bit but the
acoustics of my bathroom enhances bass
again so you really get a nice
full-bodied sound yeah but only for a
bathroom I can also put some saunas
inside I don't know yeah thanks again
for watching and see you next time bye
