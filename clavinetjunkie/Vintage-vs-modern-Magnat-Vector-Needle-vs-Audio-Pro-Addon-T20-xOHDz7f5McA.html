magnet victory home with me as I wanted
to give them another try the very first
impression at the house of my parents
was a little bit underwhelming but here
they have attached to my own end this is
a panier also they beat windage but I
think you should do the trick so around
15 16 years ago when they were released
I liked them a lot especially because of
the slim design also all the drivers
certain books are really great and of
them I've never heard them but I know
many other mothers because so I thought
this should be said as well but now
having them at home also compared
against some others because like this
audio Pro a 20/20 they are even more I
mean so I'm not sure what what the
problem is if it's the end call it
justice because I thought we will
compare this to the magnet vector middle
vintage against some modern ones their
audio Pro Adam t20 you are of course
listening to a binaural head so if usual
one you should listen with headphones
for the best results and attached with
IR to my name for the madness and
Bluetooth to the other probe and fit
start with another from software so many
precious region we know the strength
quite well and the magnets will be pain
first settings
this
poetry's now for me I'm so numb it's
slowing down industry is so extreme
we've been chasing around
don't each other way too
in my sunset sound like a mobile phone
there's no place at all
yeah share my my disappointment with you
is I had really high hopes for these I
like that look so much also the color
the silver and yeah now heading wrap
them 15 years later I can say it's yeah
it's a huge disappointment which is now
for a similar price I think it's because
like this smaller somehow nicer with
more features they cost whenever
released I think 700 heroes 60659 690
this cost 650 but you can already find
them below 600 so I think 590 or
something so I think you are way better
off with these of course at very high
levels maybe they get the pack more keep
the pediments on the end I think they
are rated for
200 watts I think these are just 60 but
I mean how often do you really create
music they have not polished because
anymore because taste yeah we could do
some some bass test how deep they really
reach with signal generator start with
he said yoga pro
there's some reading Sanga Australia
yes
making scuffle here
so let's go deeper
these are the magnets with 55 Hertz
it's going deeper
so we are now at 40 mass
you can still hear something let's go
deeper
very long
still here oh well
so I'm 25 now so it's starting to become
softer you can see them just move but
yeah no not here at all so yeah I just
wanted to make this very quick video
it's starting to rain so I want to
finish because my my my wife and son are
outside yeah thanks for heel-toe this
video so thanks for watching I hope this
was a little bit could give you some
insight into new and old because I
definitely that must have been some
progress within the last 15 16 years
otherwise yeah because with this sighs
20 years ago would be possible to get
such a sound
there is notis be included these are
probably also tuned by some DSP
processing and so on so again thanks a
lot I don't want to let my people wait I
hope this was a little bit fun and see
you in the next year I'm not quite sure
I don't even I won't keep them so if
someone interested maybe hundred fifty
euros and you can tell me but yeah it
must be someone from from Austria I
can't shoot them I don't have such large
boxes and the one speakers I said sounds
fears because from Philips and they
arrived broken so I don't want to do
this again therefore it's only
interested around Vienna or no in
Austria that you know and you can have
them it until something of hundred euros
is minimum I think my father paid the
same which is a great price I saw an
eBay there were some for 250 so I think
hundred 250 is great thanks all for
watching and see you next year bye bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
