to make a short video about the jb clip
tool as i think there is lots of
misleading information about this
speaker when looking on amazon it costs
$50 with 650 customer reviews most of
them are five stars here it says great
speaker and small size 5 stars 5 stars
great buy what a deal got exactly what I
ordered
there's also this video from PC Magazine
where they review the new Bose Soundlink
micro and they claim you have to pay
some both Texas and with $110 it's
completely overpriced you can get great
because for half the price
like the GBA clip 2 which is their
favorite I think this is a complete
failure and the speaker
it's a successor of this old JBL clip
there was also a JBL clip pass which was
water-resistant or something this one
isn't but I think the old one yeah I
think this is already four years old or
something that was also a JBL micro
Wireless which is even older the same
design just without this clip you hate
sounds way better they somehow screwed
up and I would like to demonstrate to
this the only thing they changed is they
improved the battery life they also
added some kind of wireless
daisy-chaining but not stereo so you
just get the same sound but this also
had daisy-chaining just you had to use
this wire yeah and before I thing listen
let's check out some frequency response
measurements and you can see it measures
quite balanced with the exception of
some treble boost but bass or you also
pay 200 Hertz overlaying the old JBL
clip here you can see that it had some
stronger upper bass boost and also
travel looks a bit smoother so thanks to
the space boost the old cable clip will
sound even full up of all bass is quite
an emic on both the old one was a bass
reflex system by the way you can maybe
see it here this is a port so some
particular frequencies you could hear it
fat the new one has two strange band
bessie freighters here but this didn't
help to improve the sound a lot yeah
indeed it's quite a bit worse both do
not have any kind of these people says
inside just some limiter at high levels
which kicks in on the small one then you
want compresses all the time so
regardless if you listen at low or at
high levels there is some compression
edit and i would like to demonstrate you
this so let's have a listen i will turn
them on
the same JBL tones we know from the GBA
fit for extreme and now the boombox this
is the old one and so as I'm of course
using vanora microphones
therefore you should listen with
headphones I will start with the new JB
a click tool and a remix from so persona
so let's have it sir and you can hear
the drums the bass drum everything with
full dynamics everything is just a
compressed mess
so we also somehow Jesus smooth our
travel while this has been strange
Trevor
metallic Aussie releasing heat a step
backwards how the song became is a
software so the successor model is worse
than the original which is five or even
six years old completely screwed up if
you ask me and you can see the volume
controls also stood up we are already
close to mixing here one has a more
reasonable
and you can hear this is still has other
dynamics also a smoother sound overall
this sounds quite a bit all non effects
and here let's increase them to make
some them not as loud so that we have to
stand up or something so yeah I mean for
$50.00 this is a complete I don't know
how to how to say it in English
fresh head you would say in German this
speaker currently is a little blondie
best for 26 euros this is the show me me
so half the price of the GPL which costs
50 euros money you can get it maybe for
40 or something if you if you find some
discount but yeah let's have a listen to
these two maybe I will first have to
match volumes a little bit and I'll
track analogue from Sol Poisson process
future again you can see how it push the
volume down so there is some design
oversight maybe they never never
corrected it let's rather tell me can
you source much fuller
I really have this modem it's a very
strange volume curve at least that it
can also play at very low levels hardly
listenable howdy horrible course you can
also place there this will enhance pay
city more than place like this on a
table yeah I mean and they really praise
you from PC Magazine experiment
alternative for the polls sounding micro
I think he'll you really pay JBL Texas
for the speaker without getting
something back to Iraq
and their biggest one is this
compression which II all the ones in
death so I'm not sure what they screwed
up here
and the show needs sounds like a big
speaker while costing half the price we
can hear how the vibration enhances the
basic more
and we are still popular maximum so I
will increase the Xiaomi connection as
well
a compressed mess
so yeah I just wanted to share this with
you all the reviews on Amazon and all
the trace for the JBL flip 2 is
completely wrong or false is this here a
failure this because broken they had
some design over set maybe with some
limiter which I don't know but even
without this it's still nothing special
so they clip that the old one sounds a
little bit better smooth I'm really not
sure I mean it's completely waterproof
now and has better battery because it
was really sad pound on the old one I
think when trying to make some it would
not even reach one hour this one reaches
I think three hours so it's okay but
it's not a competition for the bosonic
micro let alone yeah some other speakers
so for $50.00 this must be one of the
worst I've heard it's small but still
the sound is even smaller than from any
other smells because therefore yeah
thanks for attention and don't trust
everyone who praises it let's have a
look again on Amazon it's horrible when
I look at all these reviews here great
sound and so on amazing sound quality
for the price worth the purchase I mean
50 dollars for this junk it's horrible
the little speaker has an own awesome
job it sounds terrific terrific you
could hear it sounded off completely
with this seasoning travel and and
compressed on I really you cannot trust
any reviewer anymore also PC Magazine
who praised this junk if I am really
sorry I don't I don't want to say that
you have to trust me but trust your ears
listen to it for my speaker audio
database and you should hear it how it
yep it's crap more than 200 speakers are
already included there and you can make
your own decision which one is really
great or not of course it's only a
recording but again it should give you a
very general overview which speaker is
great which sounds rather bad but this
one is complete crap for 50 dollars
yeah I'm quite shocked so thanks a lot
hope this was still a little bit helpful
but just because JBL is written on it it
doesn't mean it's great in this case
it's horrible
again thanks a lot and see you in the
next video have a nice diamond</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
