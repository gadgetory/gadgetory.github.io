like to give you my personal view my
personal opinion on the ODC
LCD I for at $2,500 in here or here in
Europe even more expensive for three
thousand euros so first of all I would
like to thank one of my viewers for
sending me them for providing me them
for review otherwise I wouldn't have had
the chance to get such an expensive gear
so this can really be called high end
although it's not in India but a planar
magnetic head phone like those from
Wi-Fi men also all the others from
Odyssey or from mr. speakers but it's
worn like an in-ear so a miniaturized
version of a planar magnetic head phone
although you can see that Wi-Fi still
quite big but then the sound is led
through this pipe or whatever food is
path into your ear so you work the mic
like usual in ears but the experience
it'll be different so you read it's some
kind of outside your head localization
unlike with most normal in years which
sounds rather closed inside your head so
here the soundstage is really quite
extreme so different to most other
Indians I have heard also the fit or
seal is not crucial you just have to get
sure to get the pipe inside here also
comes with some helping accessories
accessories like this ear locks here
unfortunately don't work well without
them yeah it tends to fall out because
it's simply too heavy although the sedi
fault is made out of magnesium which is
quite it's not that heavy like this one
it still tends to slip out so it doesn't
work that well for me with these ill
looks but it also comes with your hooks
that i mounted on the ice and here they
work more like some glasses so you put
them beside your ear or behind your ear
and then they stay quite quite well
inside but of course not that
comfortable to carry around before an
import sound we will do this later some
other effects it's an open design so
when you have them inside your ear you
still get everything around you like an
open headphone this can be an advantage
or a disadvantage so it's the complete
difference or opposite of the automatic
ef4 or whatever which blocks completely
and also has a more intimate soundstage
this sounds broader or more open but
it's hard to judge for me which one
is more realistic for example with my
banner recordings the automatic sounds
way more precise I can localize any
sounds was precisely also the front ones
one here it sounds rather more to the
sides everything it's nice for normal
recording stall binaural ones as it
gives you a broader soundstage but for
banal recordings which are meant to be
listened with headphones in the Odyssey
in easier don't work that well they are
not as precise as the a thematic which
really has a totally precise
localization I am having quite a hard
time to judge them correctly also
because after having heard the ice I'm
ten which is way cheaper three hundred
dollars or together with this cipher
cable around four hundred yeah I tend to
think that this one is way better
especially regardless of price I mean
two thousand five hundred dollars so you
would expect it to be perfect or close
to perfect and you can get great gear
for this price as sennheiser HD 800 s
costs maybe 1500 euros so have the price
of this and the problem is we had a
sound just sucks it's horrible I know
that they are meant to be used with some
equalizer but without equalizer
I mean unusable completely off that
tonality is is just weird
and although it's getting it gets
reading reviews already people saying
that with the stock came it sounds so
good you just need a great amp yeah
trust me they sound just off I'm aware
that all these he claims them to be used
with some equalizer so they provide some
VST plug-in which allows you to it's
called pure I think pure yeah so there
is some equalization built-in which you
can turn on but it still sounds off I
mean if they provide a headphone which
cost two thousand two thousand five
hundred dollars and then an additional
equalizing this equalizing should bring
it to a level which is spot-on
just perfect but the frequency response
is just weird
and yeah I'm sure most of you who take
this topic seriously here
the classic from Floyd it all sound
reproduction and let me let me call
something from him mr. Toole says
frequency response is the single most
important aspect of the performance of
any audio device if this is wrong
nothing else matters and this is what I
was always saying I don't care if it's
fast if it has the lowest distortion
distorted distortion drivers or whatever
the frequency response is just off even
with some equalizing for the I sign it
comes with this cipher cable
unfortunately this first generation the
first doesn't work well I mean it works
with a CDI for - but it doesn't probably
it probably doesn't have the correct
profile so it's rather meant for the I
sign 10 and I sent 20 and although the I
sign also sounds off without this cable
or without just with the stock cable
with the cypher cable it improves a lot
and you have an additional app also from
from Odyssey which allows you or key
gives you an option for some additional
10 band equalizer and with this
equalizer you can bring it to really
some high level I would say and to such
a level that I'm considering keeping it
mmm this guy wants to sell his unit and
I had a listen and I think regardless of
the price and friends that the I intend
is simply way better
maybe the stronger distortion or I'm not
sure but even the fact that the SVI 4
has the image slightly shifted toward
towards the right side so the right
drama is definitely the other than the
left this fact alone makes it completely
unacceptable for a unit priced that high
$2,500 so imagine you can get you can
get a mr. speakers if flow - for this
money which parry sounds way better but
of course it's not as comfortable still
I have a little bit problems with
wearing them so without these hooks
every time putting them on is a little
bit of a hassle so on
you have to - don't simply put them
inside your ear but have to use them
like this and then look they fall out
again so like this they okay this is a
little bit heavy here this remote it
comes also with some clip that you can
clip it to your to your shirt or
whatever and the nice thing is you can
let them inside because they don't block
anything unlike the thematic which
blocks everything so it depends what you
want if you want some isolation take the
automatic if you rather want to stay mmm
isolated this does the trick and with
additional equalizing through the app
together with this cypher cable I'm
enjoying them a lot while the LCD I fall
is unacceptable for me yeah the
packaging is quite ok comes also with
this additional carrying carrying pouch
here some additional tips some tips are
rifled which is quite nice because they
don't fall out death that much from a
year but apart from that there is not
that much inside only these ear hooks
and a locks like this so for me
personally the ear hooks work better but
here there are more one like a headphone
yeah you may be know them because KS k k
CS okay KSC 75 is also one like this
with some kind of ear hooks so I don't
want to talk about sound the sound stage
is definitely quite impressive for an
Indian but as already mentioned it's not
necessarily realistic or precise it just
brought but compared to the automatic I
tried comparing it with music also with
my neural recording so I found the
automatic to be a little bit more
intimate but also more realistic somehow
mmm
still it's an impressive and really
enjoyable especially the I sign 10 while
this is quite disappointing and I tried
to offer you some sound samples with
this ears measurement system and this is
not an easy task because they react
completely different than my usual in
years so
although I can put them inside here they
don't sound like in reality so I had
again some hard time to equalize them
I used the provided if use filled pocket
or compensation curve which comes with
this mini DSPs system and then starting
from this I adjusted some slight bands
in order to make them closer to what I'm
hearing in reality so please keep them
with a little bit of a reservation
don't take them too seriously but I
think the general sound characteristics
is captured quite well so first I will
yeah I will show you my usual track from
Sony's region with its stock cable how
it sounds so
yeah it really sounds like this I mean
close to this but you should get an idea
so lots of treble sizzle some strange
muddiness in the presence region and
again somehow too much bass so compared
to the original source it's far away
therefore the frequency response is just
something some some some mess some some
zigzag and I'm not sure how people who
are listening to this with its stock
cable regardless which aim they are
using the amp doesn't color the sound
the sound remains like this they become
a bit slightly more dynamic or whatever
but the sound does that that color the
coloration or the the formality is like
this so the only thing I can we can try
is maybe try different equalizing with
this is it called pure no reveal sorry
the pure reveal with this reveal plug-in
I will use analog from so Poisson
process freesia as it's always yeah
consists of some repeating patterns so
it's always small as the same and I will
simply switch between different
equalizing so first you will hear again
the original track then the tuning with
its stock cable then with this reveal
plug-in then let's switch on the cypher
cable which is the first game so it
doesn't work well for this but still you
should hear the difference and maybe
yeah let's also switch between the ACD I
fall and the I sign at the same time so
to get a better idea and we will stop
with the cypher cable plus my equalizer
in which look like which looks like this
and you can see i reduced eight and four
kilo hertz also reduced based slightly
because with its stock tuning with the
cypher cable there is too much bass
boost it doesn't sound flat anymore I
mean it doesn't sound flat anyhow but
bass is too much
so like this I think that I sign pen
sounds really great why the CDI for
still sounds off so I will simply switch
for all equalizing always playing the
sedi for first then the I sign and at
the end we will stop
at the final tuning which is cypher
cable plus make you although I read I
had to readjust the EQ for the CDI for a
little bit reduced well completely
because this resonant peak was still
there so I had to yeah Mallis cut away
the entire treble to make it sound
except though so let's have a listen
again
yeah I think it would hear the final
result which is cypher cable plus
equalizing the I sign 10 was ok it was
still not like the original source but
it's reinjure able to keep in mind there
is some slight coloration with the
recording in reality it sounds better
and but the general tuning is captured
well I think and if I compare the I sign
10 against this it's not you had 10
times more expensive I would expect
something 10 that not timber may be
twice as good or really close to being
perfect but it's just horrible
I mean it's unacceptable what you get
here and there are people who who think
who claim the CDI for is a step up over
the ice and time I haven't heard the ice
on 20 I know it has I think slightly
less space but the overall tuning from
what I've seen from some other
measurements is small is the same they
are all slightly off therefore yeah
let's check out some frequency response
frequency - pitch frequency response
measurements still done with this mini
DSP system but as the coupling as the
impedance is so different to hit to a
human ear yeah also keep the
measurements rather relatively don't see
them then in an absolute way compared to
many other in is they look just
different so here I have the LCD eye for
in raw in gray and with diffuse field
compensation in black yeah and you can
see yeah I think I will take away this
raw measurement you can see yeah there
is lots of zigzag here there is some
peak at 8 9 kilo Hertz also some strange
one at 4k nodes and the high peak at 13
kilo Hertz if I overlay the I sign here
both by the way with with the stock
cables so no equalizing involved film
you can see up to one key nodes they are
equal so a rule of flat line but then
yeah it starts to become a little
different but all have some zigzag but
the Iceland has more response in the 5
kilohertz region and not SPE treble if I
I will take away the ice and again and
let's look at the
sedi fault with this reveal plug-in so
you can see it raises the 3 kilohertz
region travel remains modest untouched a
little some deep here at 10 kilohertz
and it also raises bass hmm I will
overlay the I fall with it with the
cypher cable which is yeah the wrong one
I would need the second generation which
probably would have better equalizing
but let's say look anyhow
so with the cypher cable and it looks
like this raises the entire the entire 3
4 kilohertz region also raises base
rather lower base so below hundred Hertz
mm the buffer at rest there is not that
much and it also lowers the speak
slightly at at 13 kilo Hertz
I will overlay the high sign also cypher
cable and you can see yeah it looks
still mall is the same or I don't know a
little bit different but yeah I'm not
sure but last one is yeah I've a CD I
fall and the I sign with EQ and although
both looks similar
still the I sign somehow gives a better
result I mean I compared back and forth
between my HD 600 which becomes quite
modest sounding against this also
compared against the automatic er 3 XR
so they are not the same but with the
cypher cable and the equalizing which I
showed here it's quite ok with
articulating there is too much let me
see again I sign cipher there is too
much in the 3 4 5 6 up to 7 kilo Hertz
so I tend to reduce this because it
sounds just too harsh but with
equalizing if you reduce this it becomes
really ok and I can join them a lot
really
maybe because of the different sound
stage because they are quite comfortable
to care at all to where I don't need to
take them off all the time which is
quite a hassle with the etymology if you
go shopping and someone talks to you and
then you have to screw them in again
while this you simply stop music the
remote works nicely stop music in here I
can
everything what the other one says so I
can leave them inside here get a very
nice sound but this is not possible with
the LCD I fall it would need additional
equalizing get rid of these Peaks I have
know what it is but it sounds just just
just unusable and unacceptable to me
yeah I hope you could hear it from the
recording still it doesn't represent the
sound in hundred-percent but the general
idea the general representation should
have been called quite well and this is
what what makes me quite shocked again
how companies can ask such such an
amount of money for such crap and then
they they provide you a better one which
is really usable I mean I'm not sure
what makes this worse than this because
the sound in the end is much better it's
really it's so far that I would call
this one of the best yeah
assume that you are using the cypher
cable with additional equalizing I'm not
quite sure why they didn't get the
equalizing right with this reveal
plug-in I mean this reveal should sound
the same as the cypher cable if you ask
me if they take this equalizing thing
seriously I mean they have so much they
could take all these Peaks I'm not sure
from what I heard it's designed like
this to minimize distortion and then
afterwards you can add some equalizing
but it doesn't work well I still have to
equalize it to make it sound acceptable
not because I like it that way because
then it sounds normal without it doesn't
and this is a bit shocking disappointing
and this puts me again in contrast to
all the other reviewers who are praising
all this the I sent em yes assumed that
you are using the cypher cable with some
additional equalizing it can be really
enjoyable to such a degree that I'm
willing to spend some amount of money
$300 to get this for myself because it's
really it's great it is great but this
one isn't let alone the fact that it
costs $2,500
I mean you can get really great stuff
with the speakers for $2,500 or
headphones I would take 3 4 different
pairs not necessarily planar McNair
but simply some really great something
ones so why should I help with this and
then get such a creepy sound I know
there will be again lots of hate because
I'm the only one who says this is crap
but it is the reality I'm sorry
the I sent n-no it's really great if you
use it like intended with the cypher
cable I know that reviews he took this
cable and tweed threw it away
immediately it was only for iOS users
the problem is this this there is a DSP
inside and some equalizing which
obviously does the job it also has some
amps or you're bypassing the internal
ampere it works quite well but still you
need to hassle with the app then the
equalizing are stored within this remote
or cable and if you attach it to some
other iOS device you will still get the
same preset you you have two presets but
you cannot switch between them so you
would need again this app yeah it's a
pity they could have added effort but
maybe even three presets one off one
your favorite one and one yeah but I
don't understand why they don't get the
tuning right if they ask you to equalize
it then they should provide equalizing
switch are really great which which
offer you a usable frequency response
shall I quote mr. tool again no
frequency response is the most important
aspect of a sound every everything else
doesn't matter so it can have the best
imaging the best resolution whatever but
if the frequencies responses off I don't
care about this product
still I'm really satisfied with them
with the I sine 10 the only thing I'm
getting here with the right one I'm
getting some crackling as if it was some
driver flex while with the left one not
so this worries me a bit but apart from
that you could possibly be here from the
recording that the ice antenna was
nicely centered a little bit different
soundstage compared to the original
recording why this had the sound more
shifted towards the right mmm I'm sure
many won't probably even notice but
place I'm some some pink noise and put
them inside like this
then turn them around and it should
still sound the same but in this case it
doesn't you can hear that the sound
shifts out of the left or to the right
so yeah this was my take on the odyssey
LCD I for playing a magnetic open in
here over your headphone whatever quite
unique but quite disappointing at the
same time why the I sign which is from
the same family that's a much better job
so I can recommend this if you have some
areas device with this reveal plug-in
it's not usable but with with this
cipher cable I would like to try maybe
the second version the second gen to try
if if you changes something I mean
another change or another improvement is
that it works with the SDI for two but I
would be interested if they may be
adjusted equalizing but it's a very
strange product idea is great wearing if
you get used if you adjust to the ear
hooks it's quite nice that doesn't
follow out so maybe even more stable
than the normal in here because it
doesn't really rely on the seal here but
you really you rather have to to get the
sound somehow inside your ear so I
rather see this as some kind of path
into your ear not as some traditional
in-ear headphone and the result with
equalizing is really really impressive
quite unique and beside the automatic er
3 X I which I still I'm still waiting
for the EF 4 XR which hasn't arrived yet
but these two are definitely my high-end
recommendations yeah I think this was it
I hope you liked this little bit also on
my new viewers my new subscribers who
come from set reviews so I hope I didn't
disappoint you but this is this
disappointing if you take the price into
account which is just shocking
yeah I'm really shocked yeah so thanks a
lot for watching I hope I covered
everything feel free to ask questions
but I will definitely and keeping
probably this is unusable I would never
spend that much I wouldn't take this
even for 200
for one tenth why this is nice
to some degree really really yeah
I'm not as entertaining as the trivial
sorry but I just want to give you my
facts my my yeah and this was it I hope
you liked it anyhow thank you for
watching until the next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
