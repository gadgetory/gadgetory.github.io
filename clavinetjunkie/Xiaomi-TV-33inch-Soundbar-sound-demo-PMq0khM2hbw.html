going to take a look at the immediately
song bow which is quite new on the
market currently available on the bank
good stuff I think around $130
so a little bit more expensive than the
blitzwolfer samba i show you some time
ago we will compare this later on but
first let's have a look at this it comes
in white
unlike most other Sambas also with this
vast favorite finish romantic any bit of
features because like the few facing key
here but with a different format effect
also an elevated one one singer play
fifa stockholm maybe but way smaller of
course comes with some accessories not
much just this power taper here but I
will have European or British blacks
included so you would need an extra
adapter for this comes also with the
coax wire and some more mounting screws
but it doesn't come with any mode
control and this is the biggest problem
as connectivity is also quite weak you
have 3.5 millimeter auxiliary some sync
coax optically and this was it the
problem is if you connect it to your TV
set through optical yeah when I control
volume for my TV it doesn't route this
to the Samba so there is no way to
control one you would have to stand up
all the time but from that I think the
song is nice and I would like to
demonstrate to this also compare it
against the blissful samba we tested
last time I think two three weeks ago
this is the advantage of an HDMI RC
input so it's connected to a different
TV and the volume if you control volume
for the TV it's controlled entry through
the samba so I mean attach both and do
some music later on maybe also some
movie trailer but in this time this time
I would like to do this one after the
other so you can really hear the
differences well hopefully you are
listening to a binaural head so you
should keep the volume to such a degree
that you hear me
well I'm away two meters from you and
you feel of course listen headphones
this is the most important premise for
when you're recording so I will attach
it and you can have a listen not let's
base the music starting with the missile
bar the first trick is from stiff nickel
which is produced by solar so nirvani is
around half
it's
to wipe out half the universe boy if he
gets all the Infinity stones she can't
do it with the snap of his fingers just
like that tell me is there again tennis
got one minutes
she's coming to us
we have a dentist once so that's what we
use
let's talk about this plan here's I
think it's good except it sucks so let
me do the plan and that way it might be
really good Wow
humanity will still exist
you always have to stand up which is
completely annoying I think we would
hear the song is quite decent maybe he
was letting better than from the boots
of Samba which tended to distort with
particular tricks there was some bass
distortion with her recordings not that
noticeable for movies but on the other
hand they miss Honda was not that loud
and the titles you could maybe hear some
stronger volume pumping some strong and
emitting effects but none of these
offers in any kind of virtual surround
or enhanced and also if you are
expecting some broader song they don't
give you this they have elements to
enhance the sound of some great leaflets
in that this but the biggest flaw yeah
it doesn't let you to control volume
remotely maybe with less suitable TV set
for me it will work but mine doesn't
look through the volume which comes in
for optical so for me it's unusable
although it looks nice it sounds nice I
cannot use it I tried it connecting to
my best on digital player also no way to
control volume remotely there's no
remote control no and control I'm not
sure maybe they tried to simplify it too
much and in this case you would need the
suitable TV set for this otherwise you
cannot quite use it let's blow truth if
you want it but apart from that yeah I
think it sounds nice
but you have to try out if it works with
your TV or not I hope this video could
give you an idea about the me TV sample
or so compare against the bits off here
yeah but the biggest part of the bits
which is the stress distortion but you
really you shouldn't notice it that much
when watch watching movies what that
means from both is any kind of night
mode which reduces dynamics a little bit
at night
yeah the dialogues are pretty soft and
then explosions are really heavy so you
can I try to do it both independent use
the world so the Philips Samba I usually
have here has some particular auto
volume some night modes also some voice
mode which enhances dialogue signor it's
much more suitable to watch a movie also
at the software level yeah thanks a lot
for watching in soon and exit of heavy
night</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
