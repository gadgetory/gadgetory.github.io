have a Jambox look-alike this is the
mutex portable wireless bluetooth
speaker this is quite a low budget model
it costs below thirty dollars or thirty
euros but the design similarity to the
original jam box is pretty obvious I
also have one here the jam box cost $200
at the very beginning well meanwhile its
discontinued but there are still some
idiots who asked about 8090 hundred
dollars for it so I thought we will test
how the cheap copy compares against the
expensive original so let's turn them on
put up your headphones and have a listen
I will play some tunes recorded through
binaural microphones I'll start with
your original the jam box and then
switch over to the near tech let's have
a listen
baby even though with me let's go people
try not a trick
when I tested the gem box people were
always complaining that I didn't turn on
live audio well I will try it now if
it's better
this is with life or no and now the
muted maybe it would work if I stick it
to my nose but forget life order let's
try another trick
let's try turning them to the maximum Oh
does this make someone so let's try the
network now
oh maybe another trick come on louder
nothing now the music jambox again
maximum volume nothing come on another
trick me
JimBob stress the jam you'll order okay
I think the jam box is what the mere
tech should be or the other way around
the music is what the jam box always
want it to be well forget the jam box I
think if you are in the market for some
kind of jam box designed speaker well
I'm not quite a fan of this whole well
this grille patterns here but maybe you
like it the music also has track
controls which is pretty nice you can
switch between different tracks
something that does not work well with
the jam box you can also make calls and
so on so it's a pretty nice speaker
especially for $29 or Euros if you can
get it thanks for watching and bye-bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
