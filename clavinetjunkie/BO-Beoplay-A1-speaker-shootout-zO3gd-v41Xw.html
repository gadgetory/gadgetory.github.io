make a speaker shootout I would like to
show you how that Bank of San Pio play
a1 sounds compared against some other
comments because smaller cheaper ones
also bigger and more expensive phones I
would like to cover them all at once
therefore I selected one song from ever
elements as so personal mix the song is
called it feels so good so please put up
your headphones and let's have a listen
first let's start with the new Sony srs
h g1 and dep you play a 1 playing first
i will start at a level slightly above
half later on I will walk around and
crank them both to maximum so extra bass
is disabled so I will make it
it becomes a bit more yeah I will start
turning them to maximum chance no
coincidence no fede
I'm very your place well then both of us
and feel so cool this
yeah the a one is much more powerful
much louder now let's try the sony SRS
xb3 this should be more powerful
I will leave extra base off as it sounds
a bit weird again starting with the a1
first let me ease asleep one thing
Kubota I can
yeah it's not an omnidirectional speaker
therefore you have to stand in front I
will start increasing volume and
next would be the charge free again with
the do play a one playing first just
nothing stepping stones always asleep we
don't take the ball then I can
again stop turning and
yeah the a1 we're just nothing
stepstones
that means fine that's why you always
come so easily we don't
I will
my hands tasty
yeah the turbo X is able to retain more
base but without as Y is not that much
difference next will be the JBL extreme
it takes a bit longer to switch to the
JBL extreme so I will play a bit longer
oh my god
means my hands
yeah the extreme is much louder and more
bass-heavy but I think that a one still
sounds better now one of my favorite
Steffi files inky and you will notice
that always go so easily we don't
yeah I think it's impressive what the a
one achieves here the hell sink is
playing at late night mode so there is a
bit of distortion at maximum I would
have to switch to normal mode but still
really impressive what beyond Olufsen
managed here last but not least the
toilet booster with the base setting at
neutral again with the a1 plane first
always is asleep but we don't have to
just
I will turn them to maximum fish stop
the chance no coincidence no Phoebe
lyric stop on the bus and feel so good
yeah that Pifer has definitely more base
especially at high levels but still
pretty pretty impressive for the a1 yeah
I think it was obvious at least this is
my impression but I think the a1 smoked
all of them yeah of course it cannot
compete at high levels with the much
lighter tauter boom storage a bit
extreme but it even outperformed the JBL
charge 3 was louder still more
restrained with no Distortion
I even prefer it over the V fire sinky
for low level listening despite having
this own late night mode it still sounds
a bit tinny at low levels this also
because of this omnidirectional sound
dispersion sounds great from behind from
any angle why all others because became
muffled from behind so bangle Dolson
really has something special here this
thing is great and I think this is what
will become the next best portable small
speaker after having a best compact
speaker like the VL sinky this is the
best small one I've heard so far the new
Sony HD one I thought it will compete
but it cannot it sounds a bit strange a
bit undefined muffled the JBL extreme is
I mean the JBL charge 3 is more punchy
but it lacks this nice sizzling treble
from the pure play 1 so I hope this
could give you an idea in general how
the a1 sounds of course it has a much
more diffused sound as it's not aimed
directly at you but rather aims upwards
and yeah but still a very very nice
sound and I think much better than the
Sony or even the turbo X being nearly as
loud so thanks a lot for watching I hope
this could help you and we will see us
in the next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
