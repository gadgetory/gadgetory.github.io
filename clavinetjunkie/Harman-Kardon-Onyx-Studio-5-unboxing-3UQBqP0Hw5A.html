ah, hello
thanks a lot, good bye!
Hello sweetie
so, let's go home
because a package has arrived, do you want to unbox it?
so let's go
and, everything ok? how was it today?
good
good? what did you do?
we played
did you build something cool?
yes
they are mowing your lawn don't they?
yes
daddy, I want to pluck those
no, we also have dandelions in our garden
but these
yes you can pluck these if you want
hey, look now you can look inside here
look, this is not a cellar, it's a room
someone is living there
but how does it smell?
what how does it smell?
inside
how can I know how it smells inside? it's not mine...
it smells like meal
come along now please
mummy, we are here
look, here it is, do we start immediately?
yes
wait, there is still some tape
many pillows
you can again make some belt of of them
wow look how long it is
and, how does it look?
like some bowl
a bowl? wait, we will open this
a bowl doesn't look like this
oh yes
look, there are buttons on the box that you can press
funny isn't it?
so, let's open it
we can put the boxes together and put them aside
and, is it a bowl?
no
look if you can find a power button
hey, it is working
we have to put this away as well as it is annoying here
can you also put it into the box?
sit down here
you know what, I will make the fishtank a bit softer as it is purling so ugly
so what do you say?
so what do you say?
phew
and how does it sound for you?
good!
good?
so bring the Dockin along and we can compare them
and then you have to tell me which one sounds better, yeah?
the new one
the new one sounds better? why?
because it has more bass than this
more bass?
and which one do you like more? still the new one?
you need to listen from another spot how extreme the bass will become then
is also something coming out from the back?
from the back too or not?
no
not?
get over
let's listen from farther away, Sashi
I will turn both up a bit, ok?
from here you can hear the bass well,  come here.
watch out, watch out, listen to the difference
now the other one
and? sounds good doesn't it? sounds big...
but the music is good
do you like this music?
wait, let's hear another song, Sash
Alexander, where did you disappear? We are finished
what do you say? good speaker?
mhmm
doesn't it look like a handbag or something like that?
but daddy, where do we have that speaker which looked like a book?
ah, that's long gone, we have sold it already
you have to say bye bye
why are you ashamed, it's only a camera</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
