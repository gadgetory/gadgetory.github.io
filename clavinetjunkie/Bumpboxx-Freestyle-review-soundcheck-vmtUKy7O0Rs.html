to check out the BAM Box freestyle this
pika is all about hugeness huge size
huge weight huge loudness so if you like
huge boom boxes retro style back from
the 80s this is definitely the way to go
yeah this is a portable bluetooth
speaker portable but it is already 16
kilograms so you have to be some tough
guy to carry this around it comes also
with some nice accessories like this
another cassette well no this is a USB
stick it can also play back music from
USB also from sd card and it comes with
a nice wireless microphone so you can do
some noise really nice hello hello hello
there is even some echo yeah of course
we would like to know how it sounds but
before having a listen maybe let's check
out some frequency response measurement
and here you can see with both bass and
treble at neutral and it measures a
little bit well strange it's far from
flat sounding but it doesn't even have
any BAM box styled sound so no really
heavy bass no heavy treble if we dial up
bass you get this curve if we dive back
bass complete we get this curve you can
also increase treble to maximum or
decrease it but the sound always remains
a little bit strange it also comes with
an own remote control so you can control
volume remotely it even has some EQ
settings but this only work for USB or
for SD card plated not for Bluetooth
it's always I thought we will check it
out how it sounds I will be using my
binaural microphones and the head cam I
thought we will check it out against the
popular Ivor XS 9 yeah this is a bit
smaller also quite a bit cheaper
definitely not as loud but we will
hopefully hear the difference in sound
so please put up your headphones is you
need those for binaural microphones and
let's check them out as you can see I
put them far away this time as these are
huge speakers so definitely more capable
of filling a whole room with music
compared to other small ones there is
some noise you are hearing this is
coming from the band box especially the
left twitter is producing some high
amount of hiss
but well we will have to live with it I
will start with a track from no
copyright sounds which contains some
deeper bass notes with the first one
being around 49 Hertz then the next one
55 Hertz and we will hear if both
speakers render them correctly volume is
set to slightly above half for the band
box and I will start with the band box
first so please have a listen
and yeah I think you could hear that the
bass notes all of them were hardly here
able from the bomb box while the Iowa
excess line played them all let's maybe
try and Iraq also from nocopyrightsounds
yeah I think you can hear that both
sound completely different with the Iowa
giving you this metro deep full sound
while the Baumbach some sounds somehow
boxy let's try maybe an artifact from
Sunchaser we also hear you can hear the
difference really well
maybe not read also here the difference
is much more than obvious and you can
hear some nice stereo separation from
the Iowa why the BAM box is just Malo
there is no celebration not sure if my
unit is like that only or all are like
that but it's the mono speaker
yeah this is really huge the difference
here
maybe not correct I will stand up and
let's listen from a higher angle and you
can either add bomb box loses quite a
bit of its travel probably due to the
holes why the IVA disperses the sound
much better also yeah face is completely
in here make a lot of funk track and
let's increase volume slightly
value-wise well
you
Oh
I will go lapi far away where voiceover
distortion this final effect and
increase volume to maximum yeah I have
to leave the room
otherwise the bumble will be below I was
also next oh yeah you can hear a
difference in future
yeah otherwise the IRA has no chance
despite a really loud speakers well
maybe some Rockford
yeah really hello come any closer
or they report up
another noisy desert for directions
I will try coming closer
Oh
we're dead
I love about the bomb boxes and reducing
volume the better metric
but that ayah is already struggling a
little bit with this very noisy trick I
think you could hear it loud advice that
I've I had no chance this is really
crazy loud although how often do you
really listen at maximum I mean for some
street party it's definitely nice to
have this loudness but I think
nevertheless there I was sounded way
better with more punchy bass better
definition also nice a treble nicer
sound dispersion I think this is more
about style and and fun you get this
microphone if you are some tough rapper
yeah you can boom boom boom boom but the
quality is not that great I hear lots of
his from the left Twitter also it's a
bass reflex system but it's not sealed
very well more air is coming out through
these openings here you usually won't
hear this at high levels as it's so loud
but still it's not for critical music
listening you also heard the sound is a
little bit questionable yeah it's just
loud so if you need this loudness for
500 it's maybe one of the loudest the
there is a new diamond box coming up the
XL version which should reach 120
decibels I got close to 115 so still
very loud but the new diamond box will
be probably even louder but also much
more expensive thousand four hundred
dollars I think this cost five hundred
and this three hundred still there i buy
one of the best big portable speakers
also way lighter than this so yeah I
hope you liked my review mm not true
about the speaker for music listening
but for making noise definitely great
thanks for watching and see you in the
next video
yo yo yo yo yo hey yo yo Oh Duke jabu
