present that banner olimpio play as
three today also later on we will
compare it against the deep blue - and
the JBL extreme but first some facts
about this because early they go for 399
but in the meantime you can find them
for 160 170 dollars on Amazon they have
stereo wireless pairing and I think Best
Buy already had a pair for 300 so pretty
nice bargain but this is not a portable
speaker you see it needs to be attached
to mains all the time there is a USB
input for sound it also has auxiliary in
but I didn't quite manage to get some
sound out of it I think these are rather
meant for daisy chain you can daisy
chain up to five I think and yet it's a
mono speaker so let's have a look at the
drivers there's a huge main driver and a
Twitter and for being a closed system
without any passive radiator or anything
this sounds pretty impressive the base
which is really deep I of course did a
frequency response measurement and if
you have a look yeah there is some bass
boost and some well hefty treble boost
but maybe this is the typical they're
not all of some sound signature they
always announce for most of this because
maybe their engineers are a little bit
deaf and don't hear high frequencies so
well but I think it's a little bit too
treble heavy we will have a listen of
course as always I'm using binaural
microphones so please listen with
headphones I will attach it there I've
already prepared a cable here and it
should automatically connect and I will
compare it first with the p.3d blue to
the Petri deep blue to has bass set to
neutral
like always let's see yeah it's already
connected and we can have a listen to a
first song
yeah there is a short delay also when
switching from another speaker to the s3
there will be some parts of two seconds
which I cannot avoid so yeah
please apologize but I think you can
hear that that rebel is really a big
sharp let's switch over to the deep blue
too
but this simply sounds a little bit like
some I don't know
a little bit hollow maybe despite having
four hundred forty watts it always takes
with the puck time but for me the treble
is a little bit too extreme therefore I
thought we will do some slight model
I'll stake a hanky and we will take out
some part well this is too small
away and we will put it in front of the
Twitter and this should maybe improve
the see here is the Twitter so it won't
sound that sharp
probably hopefully and let's listen
again for the same song with our high
five high frequency filter yeah it's a
little bit better maybe we could even
put two hand keys inside but it's
already tamed a little bit I think
beep blow to again hear the sounds sink
is strange it doesn't sound good I mean
it has bass it can play loud but it
doesn't have this bang on Allison
signature sound which is really I mean
they they know how to tune is pickup to
sound good except yet the treble is a
bit too extreme but what you may notice
is that it hardly changes the sound
regardless where I stand you can hear
the treble remains pretty pretty solid
while when I switch over to the deep
blue - yeah this becomes muffled they
have a really great sound dispersion
directive directivity
there is hardly any change you can even
listen from really strong angles this is
impressive and bang on all of singing
does really a great job with speakers
let's try it out after heavy and despite
having this bass post it sounds simply
great Metro I will switch over to the
deep blue two again yeah it always takes
a little bit of time if you have a frack
you can hear that bass that punch of the
plains
this is really impressive and imagine
two speakers playing together in stereo
for $300 still being cheaper than the
deep blue tube but offering a much
better sound the deep blue - again
yes you should I don't know it doesn't
sound right to me
also the base has removed
maybe another peg from sole persona and
there is hardly any distortion even at
maximum volume which will help later on
the deep blue to again yeah the sound
changes quite a bit when I miss my head
let's try this with the bangle dolphin
again you can I mean there is only one
driver so you don't have any kind of or
how do you call it in the motivational
let's run on a track I think it sounds
really solid up at low levels and at
high levels it brings you the sound
which sounds simply quite metro
Tipler - again yes it has this boom
character Brut I think they have so much
bass at 200 250 Hertz which makes it
appear a bit foamy yeah I think it's
pretty impressive I mean just look at
the size difference between these two
maybe we can try connecting the trivial
extreme instead I will put it up there
and we will have a listen to some house
maybe it's connected I will switch over
to the Bo play again so where's my house
yeah sorry that it always takes a bit of
time yet cuz it's there I will walk
around a little bit and you can hear the
sound remains really solid
even from very extreme angles this is
pretty unique and you don't get it with
any other company
Dino galaxy does really great job not
extreme he has a son very yeah this
delays a bit annoying I will turn off
the maximum
of extreme as well
me
began some delay sorry it appears a good
soft remedy but the case is very
impressive
it's remote ready pretty punchy sound
JBL they have this arch mess with me
when you've rented higher we of X is
equal to come back
bingos again you can hear their sound
didn't change much JD and again you can
hear how the sound becomes cooler or
more mapped of animals around
not a trick
face is really nice to the GPL
 again
is three again
okay so let's remove our mod again our
high frequency filter
I think the Ben Dawson vo play s3 is a
really decent sounding stationary unit
if you can get it for is one hundred
sixty and seventy dollars I would
immediately take two of them but simply
for wireless stereo I just wanted to try
how one sounds and although it's mono it
already sounds pretty pretty interesting
and pretty decent I actually like this
bass boost the treble is a bit too much
for me but you've seen simply put some
cloth here in between and it should be
okay I heard there are some stability
issues when connected to another one
wirelessly I'm not sure I mean I have I
haven't tried a second one but I will
definitely do it because I think this is
a nice Bluetooth speaker a pity they
didn't include Wi-Fi as well because
this would simply be a very good
contender for the whole solar system I
think it sounds better than the play one
it I mean better in this kind that that
it's simply it's more exciting the sound
the play one can sometimes sound a bit
boring and yeah I actually really like
it so if you are in the market for some
nice small stationary Bluetooth speaker
or even two for real stereo I would
check out the s3 especially with this
price it's currently available I hope
you liked it I hope this was helpful see
you in the next video have a nice time
and bye bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
