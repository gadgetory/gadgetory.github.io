speaker from Japan it should be released
during the next weeks in America and
Europe it's the sony srs x11 I had
really high expectations for the speaker
as I hoped it would come at least close
to the bigger Sony SRS x3 or even to the
Denon and via Mini unfortunately it
doesn't I mean it has some nice features
like a wireless stereo pairing with
another one
it has NFC hands-free and so on but I
think the sound just is not worth all
the hassle I have a $15.00 music angel
this is the crap you can get everywhere
for $15 or $20 this is a non Bluetooth
model I will play some tunes so that you
get an idea how the Sony sounds in
reality I'm wearing binaural microphones
so please put up your headphones and
have a listen
yeah this music angel is really a piece
of junk
it also walks around now let's have a
listen how it compares against the denim
I mean sure the Sun is smaller but I
thought it would at least come a bit
closer I'm starting again with the Sony
okay I was I have also my TDK micro
track let's see how this one compares
but I don't think there is really much
difference between both I'm starting
again with the SRS x11
well it should cost about 60 maybe 70
dollars it's not a bad speaker but I
really expected a bit more more punch
more refinement it sounds a bit muffled
off-axis it's okay if you put it
directly in front of you but it's really
not that what I expected I hope you
liked it
thanks for joining and see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
