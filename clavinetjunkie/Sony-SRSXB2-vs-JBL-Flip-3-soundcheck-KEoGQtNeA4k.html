check of the new Sony S or s XB 2 this
seems to be the closest contender to the
JBL flip 3 which has been around for
about a year
the Sony is new on the market so I hoped
it would bring some improvement in sound
let's see ya power button it has some
extra bass at the back you have the
charging port which is micro USB
auxiliary in its splash water resistant
but probably not really waterproof so
let's turn them on the Sony does no
tones while we get this typical Jacobin
from the JBL and as always and of course
using binaural microphones so please
listen the headphones and I will start
playing with the Sony and the Russian
punk band called funky business game so
please have a listen flip three
there is this extra base button
mccredle's I think it rather works for
low levels yeah it definitely makes the
sound fuller but at higher levels there
is not that much difference
just making the sound a bit clearer
let's buy the tip 3 again
Sony again if these would have some life
a stereo let's finally yeah there is
definitely some sterile processing which
enhances the stereo field the flip three
sounds rather mono switch over the flip
three a bacon here it appears more
punchy here you can really hear the bass
drum while on the xp3 XP - sorry
think it's a bit look clear already
without big space
three three again
let's run out effects hanging around
machine looks like energy Donna did that
make scene make whipped cream is it is
much more punchy
I can hear already some strong
aerodynamics processing with a show me
which compresses a tarantula Dix fish
chicken it's something more process
what's a bit harsh the sound
to stop the ballot check the baby it
does not
let's run our trip I love this
slightly on the flip three as well oh
thank you baby
because thanks oh really she just
nothing basic it let me her late
listen space makes us harder before
always so he is asleep we don't have to
just be free again
the old punch has gone also here where
is the best run every three I think I'll
hear that this becomes like a sauce
sauce it'll sound look at this
epi three yeah much more conscious on
the Sony appears clearer on access of a
song yes you need the sweet spot it
becomes a bit motto
this is the v3 now son
yay sounds of a process I believe this
volume to maximum they flip three as
well
both reduce face at maximum but the
victory still appears country
ya know that interest let's write out a
trick clip 3 again yeah you can hear the
place from and everything so definitely
a much better speaker or house and then
feeding off your poxy
let's try not back I will come closer
a flip 3 yeah I think you can hear that
this sounds much more convincing I will
try turning on this big space thing
again this was already a gimmick on the
xp3 it doesn't seem to be that much
better here
again three three
another trick
fa3
you can feel the other dynamics
well yeah I'm not that convinced to tell
the truth yeah I hope the Sony would
perform better I mean it's an
alternative to that JBL if you are not
the JBL fan or if you hate JBL you could
go for the Sony but I think the JBL
still performs better also I like this
this loop here that you can tell her to
something I'm really not that impressed
I mean they had a year to improve on the
design of the flip three and they came
up with a speaker which is not really
better but rather worse yeah it has
Stella pairing with another one you have
the add button and I really am not that
impressed below 100 dollars or Euros
yeah maybe a nice alternative to all the
others but but not really outstanding or
something so I just wanted to give you
an impression of the xb2
I think the JBL 3 is still better also
cheaper in America I already saw some
for 60 $70 so yeah you decide would you
like more I hope this was helpful thanks
a lot for watching and we will see us in
the next video bye-bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
