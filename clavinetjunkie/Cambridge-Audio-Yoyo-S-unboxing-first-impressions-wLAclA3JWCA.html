son he has Eastham holidays so I don't
have that much time for any videos but
this package is arrived and we can do
maybe an unboxing together yes so let's
have a look inside the box jellyfish are
from British company Cambridge Audio
what can with sound works at Cambridge
organ which is it is more popular I've
already reviewed for its impact let's
say I made some videos about some older
Cambridge Audio speakers this is their
newest serious burial
and this is the EOS some have already
asked about it and I was also curious to
hear it in person now what I fight
already give it five stars so we seem to
be quite impressed with it and I thought
we will check it out
as you can see I already put the
Helsinki 55 sinky here beside which is a
bit more expensive I also have this
Mazal which is the cheapest because we
will see how this one fits in there's
always some questions in panel
microphones so we can legally play some
tunes after the first airing but first
let's have a look inside the box here
there is also an M version which is a
stereo pair and I think a large one but
I think that one doesn't have any
batteries yeah quite nice I would say I
hope you at least charge a bit trust and
if it reminds me of the audio link go
maybe this is just a repect
means go with some fabric on top let's
see we'll hopefully do this immediately
after hearing and commission or hospital
system and hiking whatever customers
even troll to the end Rockingham's okay
look up here yes obviously obviously
there is some charge left and here this
yo-yo s Cambridge
I think we will start with the cheap
speaker first at that we will put the
Helsinki here the meizu like me
this cost around 70 $80 from some
Chinese stores and this is the nasal
also connected and I will start maybe
with the yo-yo and an unreleased track
from from sole person and Princess Frida
so let's have a listen
there is trained workers how does volume
work here
we already about half the BC here comes
to be see here so weak speaker system -
let me tell it to me email back missiles
around my face is in the beginning the
conservative position I deliver
it's me baby as a Chatham
image my for centipede lifeless
as you saw affairs are not really very
versatile especially not Rick
a little bit a little bit very strange
volume becomes very not family I think
it sounds more living somehow maybe not
perfectly linear but simply keep the
music from life
yeah the switching pigs always a good
time some on track maybe the most nice
lady even Yorkshire by morning
yeah your sister if they live through
here struggling because the best remedy
but we could of course try a thief I
think he which is kind of reference of
course a little bit on let's say twice
the price of this yo yo yo but we'll
hear how a real speaker should sound
yeah why did it play music now not sure
and let's try the hell think you know
the yo-yo again is slightly bigger sound
overall single resources and coloration
in the mix let's try an effective and
instrumental jazz maybe it is so
perfectly more lifelike
it's very hard to match them we can hear
one is very loud
the other one is symmetric let's try
analog from prefix regions focus on
again it is no real big kill just I will
try and searching the healthy people you
promote living they will become a bit
more comparable other small ways that
the app doesn't quite like yeah this is
unfortunately a problem of this FIFA
appear doesn't recognize the speaker
here it is so we can start music again
and you will get a difference in this
late night no neutral a maybe-date you
know they should maybe not a bit more
similar still this is changing so make
it remember we are maximizing income
it's how loud it can play Commission's
so this is the yo-yo
increasing volume to maximum no
distortion so tight nice they're healthy
quite loud although I don't think that
they differ from special media how
strict system along my league
yeah I don't even see me but nicely
doesn't export here much order from here
hey I think it's a solid performer of
all really nothing special it sounds a
little bit boring I would say no
sparking no real bass looks nice but it
will have to be seen in a full review
yeah I think this is enough for a very
first impression I really expected a bit
more to tell the truth because how does
it does it have some touch control so I
don't know it's nice great British salt
not that great it's British sound but
the mini leaks definitely sound way
better also more expensive but it's not
really that great as I have hoped after
all the great reasons and also cleanings
so thanks for watching I hope this was
enough and see you in the next video and
also a full review of the Cambridge
Audio vos see you then and bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
