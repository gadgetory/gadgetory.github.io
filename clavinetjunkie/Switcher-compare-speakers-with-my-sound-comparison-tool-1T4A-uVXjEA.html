thousands of portable speakers at once
at home to be able to compare them one
to each other
well I created a tool which hopefully
can give you at least a very first
virtual impression please let me
introduce my own interactive speaker
audio database or let's simply call it
switcher switcher consists of more than
hundred bandura's speaker recordings all
recorded under strictly controlled
conditions and matched volume levels
this allows you to compare the smallest
ones with the biggest ones or the
cheapest ones with the most expensive
ones the recording setup is ordinal from
my usual videos with me sitting at the
sofa with the speaker standing around
one meter in front of me this is what
you will see a standard volume then you
also have the option to listen to them
at maximum volume with me standing
around four or five meters away there
are nine different channels to select
from starting with smooth jazz over to
jazz funk R&amp;amp;B house also rock and
classic so hopefully there is something
for everyone's taste
and in future I can hopefully extend the
database in further by adding new
functions like for example including
measurements for each of these speakers
or creating an own rating system so that
people see immediately which one is
great which one is rated rather badly
currently it's still a bit of a work in
progress so not everything on smoothly
but I still hope it comes in handy and
you'll find this helpful please keep in
mind I'm offering this all for free it's
very time consuming to do all this I
also have to pay the programmer I'm
doing all this in my spare time so the
only way of some income is may be
through ads and affiliate links so we
can find amazon links to each of these
Pickers so if you're interested in one
of them please use those and if you find
my work helpful a donation is of course
welcome you can find the donation field
in the upper right corner of this site
so I hope you enjoy it please let me
know and have fun with it thanks and bye
bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
