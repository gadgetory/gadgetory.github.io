the party with the Harman Kardon onyx
meanie I've seen lots of not so glowing
reviews on YouTube so I thought I will
skip that one
but then there was the one they offer on
a German store for 80 euros I couldn't
quite resist I ordered it and I think
these were the best
Atos actually spent usually it goes on
Amazon I think for 129 but there are
different marketplace dealers which
offer it for much less like here is one
with 63 dollars plus six dollars
shipping sixty four plus six dollars
shipping so yeah it's what I would call
low budget but it wiped the entire
competition at this price range I would
like to compare it maybe against an area
charge three the same company cost 150
the creative I'll go also the you play a
one which costs three times as much but
before having a listen as always yes you
can check the speaker audio database as
I've already included it so yeah you can
have a listen compare it to many others
because but we can have a look at the
drivers speaker Tony showed me how to
remove it so there is a trick and it has
two main drivers to persuade us one at
the front one at the back nothing that
special but it's tuned really nicely
before I'm using MIDI I'd check out some
frequency response measurement and you
can see they're pretty nice and smooth
quite a balanced sound there is some
deep eight eight nine kilo Hertz there
is some very slight bass peak at around
seventy seven Hertz quite comparable to
the JBL charge too and if you overlay
this one you can see that the Onyx mini
measures quite a bit more balanced the
bass which is just as deep doesn't have
the strange OneNote character and treble
is also smoother funny thing is that if
we move the gorilla we can improve the
sounding more especially treble benefits
quite a lot when listen to the speaker
make it like this we can have a look at
another measurement without grill and
you can see that the treble smooth
without the deep becomes lower the
slightly level and Trevor peak at around
15 kilohertz is also toned down so it
definitely sounds better without good we
can have a look at some measurements at
lower levels and you can see there is no
dynamic bass adjustment so it doesn't
give you this full-bodied warm sound of
a bose soundlink mini or other speakers
both space for low levels for me
personally yet is a bit of a pity I
would have definitely preferred it
warmer for low levels it done something
it but yet on the other hand
it remains really nicely controlled
there is no distortion even the highest
levels it maximum there is some stronger
base reduction is also a compression but
it's quite usable up to 80% I would say
which is sleep pretty loud and louder
than it both something mean maximum
volume is about as loud as I charge 3 or
AB you play a 1
it also has Harman Kardon dual sounds so
you can connect it while asleep where go
and play or tune onyx to your 3 it
doesn't do any stereo but here it
doubles the sound and now I would like
to give you a most comprehensive sound
comparison and I thought we'll compare
it to the JBL chart 3 the creative I
will go and do play one which is yes
three times as expensive as always I'll
be using a head cam and binaural
microphones to give you a most realistic
first-person impression so please put
your headphones up and let's check it
out first I would like to demonstrate
you how the Onyx mini songs with and
without cover I will play track from
savasana so let's have a listen
our reviewable in slightly and keep your
listen close you will notice that their
treble become quite a bit cooler without
power without the resonant peak system
terrific thing may also directivity
improved quite a bit
without cobblestone for really critical
listening is definitely better without
let's put it back again and let's try it
again the closest contender on the JBL
charge three and i will play a track
from princess freesia
who did the vocals on a previous track
and again starting with their onyx mini
first
I think that he practiced yoga the trash
pre-salt fuller doesn't have the treble
definition the fellow is little help
from their charge team Norfolk
multiple quite well that they will be
multiplied right your participant alot
on the dollar you need simple I will try
a kind of Buddha track which has a lot
of nice big fat defined instruments the
truss cream and of quite a bit of course
things change when we place on the egg
music
you can already give some slight
intermodulation from attractive equally
to note the comic mini is cleaner but
doesn't have a kick we support is quite
important for our dancing with the
candlelight I hope you can hear it as
level check with the French prison
also here now let's try maybe the
creative IRL go a great thing about the
Onyx mini is how controlled it usually
is regardless what kind of basically
music you play it will never thought
this would be especially noticeable
compared to the Iroko so let's start
again with the Onyx me so I will go you
already hear some strange artifacts on
the bass from here
in this place much cleaner or clearer
which would keep improving more if I
take off the cover clock final attract
which is quite prone to the caution with
the best run
there we go yeah I will reduce volume
slightly we are on half volume now but
it still there
honestly this place is much more control
so now let's try the Bo play a one
although the do play a one is designed
as an emulation speaker I still think it
sounds better when empty tightly at the
listener therefore I will try placing it
more upwards just like the Onyx mini so
it should be more comparable like this I
will play a jazzy track with lots of
dependent organ bass mode and again the
hammock our own onyx mini first
we could of course try again taking of
this cover here to see how it's improved
but I think you can hear that there a
warm place quite a bit more stable
but apart from that abate I think that
honestly has been more natural to
confuse problem of their a1 is that the
bass is not very under control it's
pretty deep but produces some side
effects signal noise and time they won
so the base is not as people there
honestly but much that under control
does not be sportive reduce any strange
hobo
come attract absolutely we have the same
effect we got from the eighth week there
a one and according to this needs to be
some typical and almost effect the
presses
track for Mashable it's pretty clean
pretty punchy say one you can hear it
balloon balloon the face is pushed very
strong here and it has differ based for
thousands of consciousness and click it
complete the mission camber a one here
and so yet last top of this we could
maybe check how loud the army can play
and we will compare it against their JBL
flip three I place them far away
increase volume slightly to let's say
3/4 and I will start again with the Onyx
mini
yes we can hear that click please I was
a quite a bit thinner and increasing
volume for maximum bionics in the flow
I think you could give some stronger
compression from the onyx knee but also
a bit louder and also more bass I must
confess I'm really impressed by what
Hammond Karl has achieved with this
little onyx mini here I mean it's
nothing revolutionary but a really solid
perform and if you can get it below
hundred bucks there is nothing better in
this size and class yeah with the green
taking off it allows for really critical
music listening close to Effie fire
thinking but of course without this bass
and credit extension still a really
great performer definitely a better
all-rounder sound wiser than a JB HR 3
which is a bit on the bass heavy side
and also treble is not that great this
has it all and yeah if you can get it
for 60 $70 I mean don't hesitate just
buy it I'm really really impressed so I
hope I could give you a first impression
also give you my opinion about the Onyx
me I think it's a great speaker and for
normal price even 429 it still worth it
definitely better than sound wise than I
will go this can play it louder but it
disposed already at our volume has lots
of features but sound wise this really
shine so yeah a very first quick sound
check compared against some closest
container if you're interested check
again my audio database compare it
against some other ones if you are
interested in some particular comparison
I will try and maybe to do a more
detailed comparison against a charge
tree or some other ones yeah
so far thanks a lot for watching I hope
you enjoyed it and see the next video
nice time and bye bye
