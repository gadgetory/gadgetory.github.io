lot the GBL party box release compare
against them are smaller to be a boom
box it was quite a bit louder although
not by much I was quite surprised
of course bass was way more powerful but
here I have the photo rocks there which
is nearly as loud as the Sun box - idea
even smaller I made an SPL measurement
video last winter and I think it reached
hundred fifteen point five decibels the
sandbox do with exactly the same setup
the same song had hundred seventeen
point one so just 2 DB less yes ice is
way way smaller so it would be
interesting how these to compare the
viperox there is a litte bit more
expensive six our heroes vs 450 but
still I would like to know which one
sounds better which is louder and show
the toy will be louder but as it stills
on greater maximum therefore will hear
this you're already listening to a
binaural artificial hair I select this
method because photo box that has pretty
bad so I'm gonna let you listen from
there and rather stay here this because
I would set them up in the forest so and
maybe first with a distance of 5 meters
later on I will turn on to maximum with
distance of 50 meters so put up your
headphones and they check them out
meters away bonus 1 2 3 4 5 the
recording game will remain constant
throughout the whole video so raise the
volume to such a level that you hear me
realistic and the speakers are set to
around half volume now the TOEFL rock
stays playing with neutral settings for
bass and treble and the bass is disabled
[Laughter]
five six seven eight nine ten and volume
is exactly the same as it was before and
later on I will
spaceship
okay
Hey
I hope everyone could hear that the toy
rockstar had no chance against the JVL
party box on sound alone it was quite a
bit louder but Cora github vol II could
hear there was some slight distortion of
particular tricks with analog some kicks
were distorted why the JBL remains
completely clean up to maximum really
impressive I could hear some slide
partners from the back but normally you
shouldn't hear it at all it's not that
loud but if it reduce bass to such a
level as the driver does you could also
make it louder and it'd be disappointed
by this bass boost mode which just boost
some upper base it sounds horrible to me
it makes me maybe bearable but it has
volume just ugly indoors forget it yeah
I'm not sure maybe it was tuned by some
15 year old practice practice II how do
you call them yeah I hope they will
update it and make something better
because this bass boost is completely
useless but without it sounds really
great I think it wipes every other boom
box I have heard so far away I think it
sounds better than the song box too just
not as loud so it likes some loudness to
really be able to compete with the big
boys
even the Sony expedite it will be louder
but it doesn't have this sound you could
hear it sounds just great has two grips
for carrying around you can set it up
like this so horizontally
therefore it is free Twitter's just like
the Sony it switches the sound depending
on the position so if you place it
horizontally upper tweeters are playing
here otherwise this here yeah I lost
just one dot from the last video I
didn't recharge it so I think better is
quite ok I will of course do a full
video also a battery test it makes him
I'm curious if it manages three hours
maybe even more at the back you can see
some inputs microphone dieter line-in
lineout you can switch between channel
left and right and not sure how to
connect to the other one if you have to
because maybe there is some trick I
should have read the manual so I hope
this was helpful to give you an idea
about the loudness I will maybe do an
own dedicated SPL measurement for this
it's not that windy today maybe to the
evening set up an experiment an SPL
meter and I thought it will reach 110
maybe 106 with good luck but you could
hear the sound remains completely nice
nicely balanced up to maximum with no
bass reduction just some slight
compression
select limiting but very minimal so and
quite impressed
for this price cheaper than a toy fur
with better sound just liking this this
she allowed miss of the big boys like
that I was sorry I ever forget that
there's some books too and and what else
diamond box
the big one should wipe this away well
of course costs twice as much the
diamond box model LDL pro cost
I wasn't 400 I think so for 450 euros
this is really great I think yeah I hope
you like this I hope I could give you an
realistic impression about the sound was
about the loudness thanks for watching
and see you the next year
