back here in order to make some noise
again but this time to measure the noise
soundbox claims 122 decibels for the
noose on books too but nobody knows how
they measure it indoors outdoors what
kind of distance which waiting and so on
so I thought we'll do our own scientific
measurement 3 field so without any
reflective walls exactly one meter
distance with a calibrated microphone
and see you 18 later on we will also
make it try unweighted to see if it can
reach their claim 222 vegetables as
always I will also use my banner on
microphones and the head cam so I will
film this life please pull up your
headphones and let's do the measurement
the sound box 2 is playing with its auto
mode volume is at maximum and as you can
see I also set up my main camera here so
that you can film the measurement all
the time I will step back a little bit
further and I also record with a lower
game this time so I don't have to go 50
meters away and let's play the same tune
I did with the 1 kilometer test so yeah
let's get started I think the
undetectable
oh shut up and been difficult
on what go
you know
and
yes expensi we didn't quite surpass
hundred thirteen was maximum peak
unweighted is hundred twenty-three but
here does this peak there's a slow
response the only thing we could do is
maybe unweighted let's reset all and
let's try it again so again trying to
make a bit father is it's really really
doubt from this distance and the same
track again
Lucas pieces apart for another time
let's go north hundred ten
I'll make you casino
let's reduce volume again and again P
cost hundred twenty three point seven
but unweighted was maximum 113 with slow
response the only thing we could try is
I will reset again everything maybe some
other tracks from nocopyrightsounds
which are also very loud you can see the
ambient noise here is around 65 okay
when I talk it's louder
but around 60 decibels maybe so let's
try another fight from no presence again
stepping it back a bit far away because
yeah I'm afraid to get deaf here
nationally for water to have fun live
and at this end
unless 11-point and we thought
I
yes I believe it surpassed 111 point
eight so far from 120 to only peak is
measured with Honduras 24 and so yet but
we also had peaks from the bomb box at
120 maybe of course this is an outdoor
free field measurement the only thing we
could try a never tried it with normal
indoor mode yeah what'm is really at
maximum and let's try again
I will reset this here we set all and
let's try to maybe with indoor again the
very first track yeah
first I should of course I should turn
volume to maximum and let's write again
no chance to reach 120 - except Peaks
maybe becoming quite back already so I
have to pecker it in quickly otherwise I
will forget something but back to the
measurement I think this has shown that
it's far away from 122 decibels when
measured scientifically there were Peaks
unweighted Peaks with other 2495 but
with normal slow response see waiting
you get maximum 114 vegetables so ate
vegetables less than what Sun box claims
persist in every doubt because you could
hear so we could hear it from one
kilometer away and the sound is really
nice even at maximum you could hear some
slight compression limiting in contrast
to the old sound box which didn't clean
it at all but this sounds way better
overall with better bass more bass also
overall sound is much better than the
old sound box therefore I think it's
called it cost us $100 more than the old
one but I think it's worth it and it's
definitely an upgrade over the old one I
haven't heard the old one but from what
I heard from videos from harvest boom
tech and so on the new one is definitely
way better and and can compete with any
other because maybe I will manage to get
hold of another PA system portable one
comparable one I'm not sure if I really
managed but it would be of course
interesting to hear how the sound box
compares against another battery-powered
system with a comparable price so I hope
this was helpful to give you a better
idea about the loudness of the speaker
120 decibels is of course overstated but
we could try doing the same indoors like
I did with the bum box so we get a more
comparable result also compared to the
bum box playing the same tune and then
comparing both values but outdoors in
the free field no way it will reach an
or 22 vegetables so I hope you like this
and see you in the next video in the
next I read bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
