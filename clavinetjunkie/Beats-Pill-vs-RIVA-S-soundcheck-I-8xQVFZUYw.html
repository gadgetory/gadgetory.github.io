and he was very proud to show me his
latest acquisition this is the new beats
pill plus he played some tunes and tried
convincing me how great it sounded he
said well here the bass hear how loud it
can play but I was not quite sure so I
asked him if I could have it over the
weekend and here it is I think it's a
much better looking speaker than the old
pill and it also feels much better you
have something really solid here you see
and notice that Apple had its hands on
it also charging is done through a
lightning cable not microUSB anymore
and also sound wise I think it's a big
step above the old pill but I also think
that it's a big step below comparable
speakers I mean this costs 249 I even
saw it for 259 euros in some shops and
well I don't quite think it's really
worth this I think the sound is a little
bit bully and muffled at the same time
it's Bomi with our definition and it can
play loud yeah but what you get the
result is simply yeah it's comical so I
thought I will measure it and if we have
a look at the frequency response
measurement
it looks quite a bit wavy I mean there
is a huge bass boost at 200 Hertz the
bass would even reach quite deep but is
simply covered by the upper bass boost
meets our scooped out and there is again
a lower treble boost but treble doesn't
really extend that high the problem is
that at the lower levels the beats pill
Plus done adjust its sound so you see it
always measures the same this tends to
give you a teeny and also wield sound at
low levels so I don't I'm not quite sure
about the sound I thought we should have
a listen how it sounds compared for
example against the river s which costs
exactly the same I mean the price for
the pill plus dropped already I don't
know why but usually Apple products are
quite stable let's turn it on yeah the
tones remain the same as on the small
peel and peel XL but this thing is
and as always I'm of course using
binaural microphones so you should
listen with headphones to get the most
realistic impression I will start
playing with the pill plus then switch
over to the reverse and we'll play some
different genres let's start
let's listen to something else it sounds
strange it reminds me a bit of a toilet
this is the sound you get when you play
a speaking a toilet with quite a booming
sound the treble is missing and so on so
I'm not really convinced let's try
another track
it doesn't quite help to tilt in your
sample
it's simply yeah it covered
hey you first meet songs off that's
right on track yeah I think dr. Dre's
some repechage blessing shook song crazy
hip-hop and rap then cool your
connections in return why we live and we
learn you think you know what is this
totally build a bigger future for the
kid
please in war let's take it to the floor
every time we take two steps the
crouching fool lady I will come to the
street is how I cut of beef I'll let me
handle that is why you made me Jesus
back walking is here
stop six minutes pill or s let me train
the ferret undressing room France that
we came out to light it up and put it in
the air all my ladies for tickets enjoy
cuz I submit it and you gotta get with
it and you'll never forget it
yes I bought the best downtown hall
to the fans in the home
yeah not that convincing either my
friend was so impressed that it can play
dead loud so let's put it well let's put
both a bit Father power away sorry
and let's crank them to maximum and have
a listen how they compare at maximum
volume okay I will start turning them up
to maximum
yeah he loves is that he said longer
fucking Oracle
I can already hear that this is not
right yeah I mean the the reverse is
definitely doable but it sounds like the
original song
yeah that's right another fuck again
yeah it sounds as if it was round force
I might have noticed some chopper
chopped into slices I have the clips
groove here this is quite a bit louder
than then realize so I thought maybe we
should compare these to the clips costs
150 so it's hundred dollars or even well
no depends how much it costs no let's
turn that lips to maximum as well and
let's have a listen again I have another
dance track let's have a listen to this
whoa
it's been you expect
we have the clips roof is not that clean
at maximum but it still sounds like the
original song while the pill plus made
it sound a bit like some some effect
some specially picked or something so to
tell the truth I don't think it's worth
its current price tag there is potential
but it screwed up I don't know I mean
it's not usable at maximum you have to
bring it down some notches and then it
won't be louder than the Riva s anymore
why the clips groove being much cheaper
yeah simply wipes the floor with with
the pill plus so really not that great
speaker how many make it seem there are
many five-star reviews again but I
wouldn't say it deserves even three
stars I would maybe give it two stars
one for the design and the other one for
build quality but the sound is simply
atrocious so yeah thanks for watching I
hope this was helpful to give you a
first idea about the pill plus
definitely not worth it but it looks
great and yeah feels great
there are definitely much better
speakers so let's wait until the JBL
charge 3 comes out and maybe let's have
a listen again thanks for watching and
bye bye
hi I met an old friend recently and he
tried a team-high I met an old friend
recently and he hi huh Lonnie beat to
death
hi recently I met an old friend of mine
and he was very proud a proud he ok - ok
he played some tunes and tried
convincing me how great is sing this -
just like I was not quite convinced over
the truth to tell the true love to me
compared to some other comparables
because I think it's a step below now si
you will see I mean you feel that it
belongs to Apple now also the charging
port is lightning are not microUSB
anymore and regarding sound it's
definitely much better than the old peel
