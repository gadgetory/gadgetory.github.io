do you want to open it?
yeah!
on your own?
yes!
look, it is something small, do you also have your small JBL somewhere?
yes
so try it out, I will come later
hmm, so a manual...
hey, I can already hear music
and?
but it's the other one playing
and what can it do? show me
look, when it starts to rattle you can place it here
actually both sound the same
do you think so?
but look how nicely this one glows. maybe place it like this, so they will become more comparable
hmm, you are right, they sound somehow similar
play something else
slightly louder?
boah...
and this one?
hmm..
this one is already playing at maximum, the other one still not
but look, it jumps around, look
like this it's better
but it has more bass
the other one... not!
so, I'll be back soon, I have to look after something
and, which one sounds better? did you already decide?
actually this one, but look how it crawls around
yeah, it dances, it's a dancing speaker
wow, but look how nicely it shines
let me hear again
yeah, but they sound really similar, don't they?
make both softer, I would like to hear how both play at low levels
wait, we will lay down both maybe
it sounds nicer I would have said, somehow fuller
yeah
but like this it dances around
but look, you can also see the volume level, come on turn it higher and softer
no here, with the phone, you can see how it changes
seen?
now it's softer and here it becomes louder
do you have another track?
what kind of effects does it have?
what kind of effects, what kind of lightning effects?
this one is boring
this also looks good
does it dance with the music?
yes, look it even dances to the music
great! wait, let me see
this one is not so great, where do you press?
here
but look what was included
ahhh, wait let's turn it down...
let me see, let me see
I think you can attach it here somewhere and then you can... whatever
hmm, try passing it through here without a needle
not easy
here, look, I have it
look you take it like this and then...
a knot!
no, not a knot, you have to lead it in through here
and look you can hang it somewhere, for example...
then it won't rattle around like this anymore
where to hang it?
I don't know, somewhere... wait
don't have anything to hang, here...
so the Minion will also have some fun
so, what else do we have?
and did we finish?
yes, do you want to hear something else or not anymore?
yeah...
daddy wants to hear some funk
wait
I cannot hear anything
ahh, it's turned down
really?
hey, not that loud, you are turning it to maximum
what does this mean?
what?
is this music?
sounds in fact decent, I really like it
it moves
listen how big it sounds
look how big it sounds, and the other one...
this is already maximum!
let me see, this is unbelievable
let both like this for a second
look how huge it sounds, it sounds way bigger than the other one
I really like it
actually I wanted to give it to you, but I think I like it now and will take it with me again
or do you want to have it?
I!
you want to have it?
well
so pack everything together and let's go eat somethiing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
