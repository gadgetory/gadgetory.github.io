voice that I'm a bit sick together with
my son but I wanted to do this video
anyhow is I got so much stuff lately
that I have no idea how to cover this
maybe my son will help me a little bit
but here I got to rugged outdoor
speakers one from archaea the 226 and
one from big thing this doesn't have a
real name but it appears in the
Bluetooth list as victim punker both
cost around the same the victim goes for
$40 the arch here for 37 dollars
and according to the description they
should have bass here it says beefy bass
so well of course I was curious to hear
them so let's have a look hmmm a special
of the Archie is that it also has a
flashlight so you can use it too well to
brighten up something you can see it
glows but it's not very bright so you
can use it in darkness unfortunately the
button is not elevated somehow so it's
not easy to find the the on/off button
for the for the light let's turn it off
again and at the back is the on/off
button so let's turn this on yeah it's a
bit it takes a bit let's do the same
with the bitten big thing I think the
company is called big thing and let's
have a listen how this sounds as always
on of course using binaural microphones
so you should listen to headphones yeah
now the beating is connected as well and
I will start with the Archaea 226
yeah some dance tricks old-school style
but I don't hear any face
yeah not for it sounds like all the
others because for twenty thirty dollars
without any kind of yeah I can feel
vibration but the Archaea swell but the
lower base is hardly noticeable you can
just feel it
let's try electric we also hear quite
tinny sounding it off don't really sound
convincing
I think the Archaea socialism more
balanced involve so yeah I'm really not
that convinced can equal to DT D Kappa
Muhammad maybe let's try let's try the
GDK we've heard before I think that
sounds more convincing it doesn't have
any any deep or low base but it it
sounds of at least full-bodied so yeah
here is the TDK is connected as well
let's try another track starting with
the ax here
yeah I think the difference is pretty
obvious here this is salt and in there
is some slight lower place but you
really don't hear it at all
the dedicated list has some upper base
which yet which you hear is base let's
try now trick
get the only thing which we could price
maybe poking them far away well towards
the wall so this could maybe increase
some of the lower base of the Archaea so
let's have a listen again let's make
some volume now let's try the TD k as
well at maximum yes still come to be
skinny that's not right this has some
nice deep bass drum so you came here the
part from the arch here
this sounds a little bit funny now
yeah in this case I think the Archaea in
this case was then TV mama oculi maybe
let's have a listen how the a flip three
sounds compared to and let's turn on the
flip three as well it needs a bit of
time to connect yeah Divya madam is
collecting we forget into this way let's
start again with the arch here and open
sister clipped we know the arch here
it's already playing close to maximum
you can also hear that this sound simply
much more much
let's put them away again and let's turn
up both to maximum a flip three as well
oh yeah I think I know which one is the
better outdoor speaker of course the
flip three is more expensive
I think it's double the price of the
Archaea but I think the sound is also
well twice as good if not even more it's
louder more punchy so I'm really not
sure why they sent me this I asked does
the speaker have any bass yeah yeah it
has bass especially at maximum volume
the fixing should sound comparable to
the roller we've heard at least yet they
will claim this but you've heard they
sound a bit oh yeah
very disappointing at least for me I
mean maybe some others will be more
happy also the reviews are thing I think
yeah 9 customer reviews with only 5
stars
so I'm really not sure you can meanwhile
showing Matsuda's can store you can
meanwhile get the PDK for less than both
both these I think I sell I headed for
$30 32 so I would definitely go for
another speaker not not really
this one's I mean this is nice because
of of this flashlight but how often do
you need a speaker with a flashlight I'm
really not sure
so yeah I've colored this I'm really not
that impressed with these speakers you
have you seen some fatigue induced
octopus on Comm 60 here on to stinkin so
yeah thanks for your patience my son is
also a little bit sick now
I hope my next videos will be normal
again
I hope this was helpful to give you an
idea someone already asked about the RG
I told him yeah it's not that great and
I hope you could hear it from this video
so thanks all for watching have a nice
time and bye bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
