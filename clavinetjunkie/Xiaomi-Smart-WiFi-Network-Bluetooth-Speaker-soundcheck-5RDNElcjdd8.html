into the new shell mini Wi-Fi speaker
this was mainly for the Chinese market
so order it's quite cheap with 400 yuan
which would give us $60 but you can also
sign it on there and then goods for $420
a bit more expensive but I think it
still works it is it's really sound
decent and has tons of features
therefore let's have a look
yeah the manual or crystal deities in
Chinese only and there is also an app
which unfortunately for iOS is also only
available in Chinese so far if you are
Android user the app is also in English
so you shouldn't have problems
configuring the speaker which you can
see here but the speaker is not that
elite reason so there is no battery
built in it only comes with this AC
power cable so it has to be attached to
mains all the time yeah but from Wi-Fi
is also equipped with Bluetooth you can
see at the back is a USB port so we can
also play the music from a flash drive
hard drive or whatever and it even has
memory built in there are 8 GB for
storing internal music but as I don't
quite understand Chinese I couldn't
figure out how to save music on to the
speaker so I won't be able to show you
all these functions but I would rather
like to concentrate on sound and maybe
in a later video if the app gets updated
for English we can deal with all the
other functions but now yeah I think the
sound is really nice it's a bit on the
warmer side so when looking at some
frequency response measurement you can
see that there is some bass boost
together with some upper treble boost
which are slightly scooped out so the
speaker may be legs a little bit of
presence and clarity but as well extends
nicely the speaker still sounds pretty
convincing
yeah it's equipped with two main drivers
or woofers together to Twitter's and
it's a basic flex system so they'll
support at higher levels and with bass
heavy tracks you can maybe hear some
slight farting but I wouldn't call this
a parasitical for normal use you
shouldn't get any problems yeah I
thought we will check it out how it
sounds also may be compared against this
river 2x they are quite comparable size
wise also price wise the rear is
discounted now so you can find it 440
hundred fifty dollars the only
difference is that the reliance battery
buildings why this has
be attached to mains yes always I will
be using my vanilla microphone and the
head came to give you a kind of personal
question therefore please use headphones
for best results and let's check them
out I will treat the show me the normal
Bluetooth speaker is also switching
between both is easier and I start
playing with an acoustic gas song and
the show me playing first so please have
a listen
the ticket needed the river has and more
spatial sound thanks for trillion
protecting foetus radical sites that I
also separated completely but the Xiaomi
has a nice round account with nice
trouble talking them Riva proactive
slightly missing there is no upper
treble another more funky Justin letting
to give a bass boost which is not bad in
this case is coming from pony but has a
nice full body count
yes the river here hopefully the kitchen
area like my spaciousness up some quite
mature although you can maybe do that
they vocals of lightly ugly so he
another two years on the river may be
another fit
and you can hear some slight parsing
come from the port already difficult
they can't quite a bit different from
how bigger and further trigonometric
yeah you can hear it well the bass drum
produces the starting notice that again
the river doesn't have this problem it
doesn't have any port just ready for a
day that doesn't have this strong place
either at lower levels this will
disappear but if we increase volume I
will stand up and maybe with turn them
to makes me to see how loud they can
play so this is the show me Wi-Fi
speaker now increasing volume to maximum
in not very loud but the river 2x also a
testament and quite a bit louder
not affect the allowed me write another
competition they rewrite much louder our
adventure you can hear no distortion
from slightly anything but hopefully a
policy over the river somehow boom here
I think they show me new Wi-Fi speakers
really great device although no better
algorithm it still does a good job as
stationary unit it looks great
some decent and has lots of ways to
stream from or you can use it as a
normal speaker though this would be
waste of functions I also hope that show
me will update the iOS app soon for
English so I can show you more fit
functions until then I hope this was
enough for a first impression to give
you some idea about the sound I hope you
liked it and yeah see you in the next
video until then have a nice time and
bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
