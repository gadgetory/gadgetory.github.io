check out le JBL extreme killer from
germany yeah this is a German company
docking the speakers called docking
define it's available on the German
Amazon store for 140 euros so you have
the price of a JBL extreme it splash
water resistant I don't know
it has also power bank function 50 watts
of power you can see how to put also
some service pots so maybe there will be
some updates and yeah 2.6 kilograms here
compared to the JBL chat screen
unfortunately I don't have the extreme
anymore otherwise we could have put them
side-by-side but I think this is much
more decent especially for the price how
much for it's not high five
you can see nearly two woofers to
Twitter's and back the back to huge
passive radiators and yeah it's tuned
obviously for a really heavy bass quite
a bit too much upper base but really
powerful and very controlled it does not
distort it vibrates a little because of
this male fantasy faders to the only at
one side and I thought we'll check it
out or how it sounds yes you can see it
comes also with some kind of carrying
bag like this so its splash water
resistant you can pick take it to the
DGA turned off now it turns off so I
think actually I talked too much so now
you can carry it and listen to music
without you and without taking it out
but yeah let's have a short listen as
always i'm of course using binaural
microphones i will turn it on again and
later on as I don't have anything
comparable yeah we will compare it
against this G boom this is really
highly rated on on I launched I launched
gave it highly recommended a so the G
project G boom wireless boombox they
read a raving about it but will see this
cost
still $100 mmm yeah although I'm not
sure it's really worth that not price so
you have to increase
him on the speak of the maximum and I
will play some tracks so let's have a
listen I will start with the docking
defined first the axial slightly far
away help
yeah each are also different role let's
want to turn them a bit higher you can
hear with the charts we can take sounds
like some clock later compared with the
distance above the proxy has this both
with heavy bass this makes it sound up
here another track you remember this
from endocrine are as for politics are
used to stress tell ya from chemical
very often for Omega where we are around
to first lady
okay here is pretty quick you know the
touchscreen is Glen plaid live apart
we become strange here put your hip lock
like this with this model universe sound
but I think it sounds pretty different
now it will pause the same or now I'm at
$50 under 40 years among people are
checking out Rome Wow come on effect
it's like this like that it's like this
like that like this the jiggle Springs
you started with the spread like that
it's like this like the touch feels like
this it's like that it's like this like
that it's like that like that so we come
from the way every day it's like this
just like this it's like that at the
like that it's like this it's like that
yeah I'm pretty heavy nothing out
I mean there is because the features are
quite to the side the list from long
after separation but nothing really
exceptional there is not protesting
nothing to charge Lee
there is it really it becomes more of a
clock video from house
from up here the charge tree is not a
real contender for the docking defined
despite the costing the same yeah and
this is twice as large it's a bit
cheaper let's turn it on really highly
highly rated yeah let's see if it's come
at if it will connect I hope so take
some time yeah I think no I think we'll
have to increase volume here as well to
maximum as oh yeah doesn't seem to have
volume control yeah I'm connected but
okay is maximum mode and let's try
analysis this is the doc in the final
the table but I have to make voluntary
better a different work and I can't wait
inside being a beautiful monster
I'm a prick also to increase them with
cool beach Walker's sweeter and tasted
horrible and there are computer based on
a banana Nelson
maybe I'm obsessing about
it was interesting to hear how they
perform at maximum and in G boom
pretends to be from booming loud or
thicker so are you supposed to make some
business tears talking to find out
come on Oh trick okay we paid out but
you can already hear some strange yes
and please question or please sound much
more control another track yeah a little
okay unusable yeah I don't know how this
could get any a rating I mean mother a
nine - modded B button a this is junk
this is really hos oh it's huge and yeah
I mean the docking define I only wanted
to make a short sound check for all
those not german-speaking guys you
cannot buy it anyhow therefore yeah just
to avoid any complaints here why is this
German why is this video in German I
mean I don't understand the word then
yeah I made a full review in German
because the is a German speaker and the
main market seems to be German I haven't
seen it anywhere else just on the German
Amazon store and some other German
stores it's made in China but the the
speaker companies from Berlin and I
think it's really decent
if you want bass if you want some
powerful sound outdoors with this heavy
bass it has too much upper base there is
a booster kind of 20 Hertz which makes
it a little bit boo me but any other
outdoors this really shines and what I
haven't shown you on is my phone I will
have to reduce volume it also sounds
great at at low level listen to this
there is some really nice bass boost at
low levels which you for example here
let's try to charge free again the
charge 3 does is both database so it
doesn't compensate for human loudness
controls controls controls so come on
come on connect and the chat resound
think 18 years this is volume slightly
or increases here I can hear with just
no comparison for low level listening
this doesn't
so maybe they will release it also
worldwide I'm not sure it's already on
the market for I think some month or
even half a year or something I haven't
known it just discovered it on Amazon
raise money right pet just colored it on
from the Amazon store because nice
ratings and I thought I will check it
out and bite yeah hope you like this
it's really a great speaker and watch
the only available in Germany but it
wipes the floor with most contenders in
this class not high five but well
controlled pretty loud I think about it
louder the JBL extreme but no distortion
no compression doesn't do this strange
meat boost at high levels so it sounds
really great a little bit too much too
much vibration maybe so if you put it on
some some resonating surface it will
rattle but apart from that also this bag
is nice so you can really take it to the
beach let me put it again and walk
around with it like that I think I
should turn it like this
so I can really put it about my shoulder
yeah like that it shouldn't fall out and
I have it here year year so thanks for
watching I hope you like this help no
complaints about a non-english video or
about the German video but this is a
German product only that in Germany
doesn't make quite a store here to make
some English video but I did so I hope I
get a thumbs up so see you in the next
video
a nice Thailand bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
