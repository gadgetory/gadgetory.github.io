have a look at the anchor sound core
Nano maybe you remember recently I
reviewed this show me miss pica which is
quite comparable but I was not that
impressed so I became curious to hear
the anchor sound corny noise well first
let's have a look at the packaging it
comes like this typical blue wide
packaging from anchor let's look what is
inside there's some carrying loop which
you can put in here this was missing
from the show me me speaker and some
wires that was not included with the
show me either
so this is the microUSB charging and
this is obviously some auxiliary so if
you put it here put it in here you can
also use it to buy it yeah what fits
away also wanted to tell you that this
is the first time I'm using a gimbal and
again my wii 4k camera yeah i'm looking
even more stupid than before but yeah
maybe the image will be better more
stable and as you can see there is no
fisheye it's stabilized within well
let's say it's rectified within the
camera the stabilization is done with
the gimbal so the stabilization from the
4k weii camera was really wobbly and
shaky yeah i thought we will have a
listen to this also compared against the
xiaomi me but first let's maybe check a
frequency response measurement yeah and
as usual nothing exceptional there is
bass loss already at 400 Hertz and some
slight rebel boost but not as extreme as
we've seen from the xiaomi me speaker so
i will turn it on and we will cat we can
have a listen as always i'm using
binaural microphones so you should
listen at once these are the welcome
tones let's turn on the me as well and
as always please use headphones as this
is the only way to listen for binaural
recordings I will start with the sound
qua non Oh first so let's a medicine you
can even hear some slight bass the meat
yeah only treble I will maybe try both
for maximum the anchor as well maybe it
is taught slightly more but it simply
sounds more natural I will reduce one
again and yeah
definitely better than the me the me
costs I think thirteen fourteen fifteen
dollars this goes I think for twenty it
doesn't want to turn off okay and maybe
you remember we had the omakr also
speaker for fifteen dollars maybe 19
depends where you live probably let's
turn this on and we can have a listen to
these tool
yeah sound call Nano first and another
trick I will increase volume again
who's the new single from princess
freesia the homemaker
yay sounds woolly I would say hot
prescribe the Sun but it just not really
great
this sounds yes more relaxed simply
better
maybe it's increase both makes more game
Oh maker for as well it's advancing
speaker although there is slightly more
Distortion at maximum with the anchor I
still think it sounds better
I don't know this is some strange wooly
sound I have another one also quite
small it's from PQ but you can get it
from many other brands let's try this
one I will increase volume slightly here
and it also has a place afraid I'm not
sure about the driver layout from the
anchor it doesn't vibrate that much so I
think there is no passive Raider maybe
it uses bass reflex as I've heard some
strange side noises when I measured it
and let's try the anchor Sankar nano
again first
I will increase volume slightly is its
it for soft not a very loud speaker then
P q EF sounds horrible
this site is persuaded by Marie
let's turn modernism slightly higher
here sounds much more seriously anchor
yeah forget this one I mean maybe it's
one of the better ones very small ones
but yeah this is to three times as large
also costs maybe three times as much but
I definitely prefer the show me me here
as it sounds just like a big speaker not
like all these magnet or speaker but
yeah we can have a listen to these two
as well you know it's connected again
starting with the Nano
it's not bad and definitely better than
a smartphone but I can hear this sounds
just like a real big speaker have
increased volume slightly imagine again
I mean there is some distortion of
maximum with their move but the
difference in our loudness is also quite
big both are playing at maximum now and
especially at low levels let's say you
know background listening and this is a
much bigger difference between bulb
someone even suggested to place it flat
as you could maybe also enhance bass
lady is the radiator is moving up and
down yeah there is some slight
improvement so yeah I'm not that
impressed I mean it's still one of the
better a very small mini speakers I'm a
bit on a trip to find the very best one
one that you can really take around with
you all the time I do this with Demi as
you can see it's slimmer
although longer but really fits nicely
into any pocket the anchor is nice but
really nothing with any kind of wow
factor it's definitely better than all
those I prefer it over the Omega also
prefer it over this Xiaomi me which just
produces travel nothing else so the
anchor is one of the better ones but who
knows if there are even yeah if there is
still any better model out there
something small like that maybe you can
suggest something but it really has to
be small and fit into a hand yeah this
is already a big
yeah on the larger side let's say I mean
it's still great for taking around all
the time but if I could get a decent
sound from an even smaller form factor
yeah I would definitely welcome this so
I hope this was helpful to give an idea
about the anchor sound call definitely a
nice speaker and one of the best very
small ones I've heard so far but maybe
there are even better ones I think it
could still take some improvement maybe
slight dynamic bass boost at low levels
to make the sound fuller at at high
levels it sounded pretty full about it
but yeah still not really comparable to
for example this show me me here so
thanks a lot for watching and yeah we
will see us in the next video please
tell me how you like the camera together
with the gimbal I'm turning the head to
the sides now and it the great thing is
it always remains a horizontal
horizontal horizontal I don't level
sorry my English is really bad so yeah I
think it's nice although the
stabilization has to be has to be seen
if it's really great it has just arrived
today this gimbal I charged it and
immediately started to record this video
yeah again some live view from my head
well hopefully you can see it it looks a
bit really ridiculous so again thanks a
lot and we'll see us in the next video
bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
