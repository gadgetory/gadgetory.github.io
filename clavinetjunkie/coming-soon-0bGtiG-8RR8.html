a short these are what you can expect
during the next time you are wishing I'm
listening and many already asked about
this so please have a look what just
arrived today this is that peach tree
deep blue too I think it's a pretty
impressive speaker I already had a short
listen to this and we are definitely
going to compare this against the iva
excess nine against a powerful boom star
excel and also against the fifa
copenhagen a half here i thought about
doing another blind listening test so
you can remain as unbiased as possible
and simply concentrate on sound but i
can already tell you it will become
tough because all speakers are great but
also quite a bit different so it's a
matter of taste which you will like most
then i also got a brand new river turbo
x my old unit was not okay but to tell
the truth the new unit i have at least
the impression as if it sounds even
worse especially when compared against
the fifa helsinki we've heard before the
riveter beck simply cannot compete it's
in another class I don't know if if this
unit has an issue as well but it simply
sounds wield a bit and and it's missing
any spatter from the FIFA Helsinki so I
will try my best to make a an unbiased
comparison look what I grabbed here this
is the TDK track max or a 34 they
already go for sixty seventy dollars and
for that price they are pretty
impressive do you remember this junk I
made an unboxing this G boom yeah this
cost hundred dollars but I made a short
listening against their TDK and this
sounds like crap so it would be quite
interesting to I didn't have any
contender for this because speak up four
hundred dollars that can play loud and
some decent is pretty rare but this TD
gay easily outperforms the G boom maybe
not as loud but simply sounding much
better I also grabbed a bluetooth
receiver some suggested to try out the
mini Rick's up with other speakers so we
will do this as well the sub doesn't
have bluetooth
but with the receiver you can use it
remotely and attach other speakers to it
we will try this out as well just like
many suggested so stay tuned for all
this of course much more will be coming
I did a comparison of the fugu XL
against the Bengal de las indias play
too I already sent the pure play back
because I was not quite satisfied so
this will be the next video as you can
see lots of stuff coming but little time
so please be patient until I finish
everything but there is definitely
something to do worth waiting for so
thanks again for your patience thanks
for your support and see you in the next
video bye bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
