show you the arrays Olevia 10 minute
today today the truth I didn't know the
speaker before but some have asked for
it the company Raisa is more known for
gaming and gaming accessories I think so
I'm not sure they are that great of a
speaker company therefore let's check it
out to give you the most realistic sound
impression I'm wearing a head cam and
binaural microphones so you should
listen with headphones and you will get
this kind of first-person view let's
turn it on and before having a listen
let's check some frequency response
measurements and you can see that the
overall response is quite natural but
there is some treble loss above 10
kilohertz and the base although boosted
at low levels is reduced pretty quickly
at high levels therefore the sound
becomes or gives a bit of an unbalanced
impression I'm not sure what kind of
music gamers are listening to maybe some
kind of 8-bit chip tune therefore I
thought I will select some suitable
tracks and let's have a listen and the
first thing you maybe can notice is that
there is some higher amount of his at
low levels definitely disturbing but
yeah what kind of speaker can we compare
it to I mean the JBL charge 3 which
costs around the same the razer goes for
$150 or in europe even more with 170 i
thought we'll compare it against the
Vava 120 we heard just recently the
bomber costs half of the price therefore
let's check how these two compare I will
increase volume slightly
and this is maybe the music gamers are
listening to yeah some extra game or
something
let's check the relevant
the eight sounds fight a little bit boo
I would say maybe another crack this is
some super now I think there ba-ba-boom
20 sounds a bit more convincing and it's
not bad but $450 you can definitely get
much better
let's increase volume even more
on the raise I saw
yeah I'm not that sure maybe let's check
maximum volume I will switch to another
track again with the Lafayette and mini
first and I will increase volume to
maximum
the volume is low I think it depends
more base and more punch
yeah I think it's solid not that much
distortion but the problems are rather
at lower levels which we will try now so
for normal listening it let's say for a
room a room volume or something I will
reduce the volume of develop 120 as well
and let's listen to this track and you
hear I don't know some distortion some
as if the DSP was struggling or not this
droning reminds me a bit of the Bose
Soundlink mini boots by the bhava boom
it plays completely clean here I think
there is not really that much DSP
processing inside
unlike the Levitan mini gate now you can
hear this sounds horrible
as if the these P was trying to adjust
the sound then even here there is some
droning the father sounds much more
natural and let's find our track also I
will reduce volume again it's not the
base from here available it sounds
horrible
if we are around well slightly below
half now even above half it sounds not
really good
therefore yet with the same price we
should maybe check out the JBL charge
three
yeah it's larger but costs the same and
has more features a more rugged design
and so on so that she knows these two
now again leave yet and mini first but
this sounds really questionable the trap
free and the chattery although having
some slight treble problem sounds much
more convincing here so the treble
no it's a mess it's not listenable which
sensitive was broken while this place
clean and undistorted which marshal
ponchos
it really reminds me of Sony with lots
of dynamic processing and so on
let's familiar track yes this is a much
more conscious on let's put them away a
bit farther and increase volume slightly
you put maybe here all the charge three
started reducing bass let's try the
Libya panini now there we are close to
maximum volume now but you still can
feel and hear the punch of the bass drum
while the livia tammini compress
everything away maybe let's try this
the traffic and I will increase volume
to maximum
Oh
on the contrary it's pretty loud but
sounds over process which are
three-cylinder yeah it's ridiculous
now attracts a charge three yeah I mean
the difference is really obvious here
no it becomes a bit of a joke at high
levels yeah I'm not sure if it's really
worth the hex price I'm not 50 so for
the same price you can get the charge
free or many others because I think even
the xb2 sounds better than this there
I'm not even talking about the xp3 which
sounds sounds much much better so yeah
mmm I mean my speaker pretty small quite
a bit small on the bottom 20 but I
prefer this a lot I mean this sounds
like a normal speaker well this has lots
of issues at low levels so I hope this
could give an idea about the Razer
Leviathan alleviate and I'm not even
sure how to pronounce it a mini it's
really not that great and not worth the
s price maybe for 60 $70 it could be
decent but with all these distortion
issues at low levels it's well not I
wouldn't even take it maybe for free as
it's quite unlistenable to tell the
truth let's turn it off again yeah this
was it so thanks for watching and see
you in the next video bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
