have the brand new dolly ketch maybe
you've already seen my quick and short
unboxing I prepared some time ago well
it was not so short but in the meantime
I spent lots of time with this pickup
and I would like to give you some more
details prepare some kind of review but
still concentrate more on sound and keep
the video as short as possible dolly is
a Danish high-end speaker company and
the catch is their first portable unit
and if looking a bit closer it resembles
quite a bit banged off symbiote play a -
especially with the green taking off you
can see on both because that the driver
layout is pretty similar so on both
sides they have a main driver a Twitter
and a passive radiator in the center
which offers you of course some kind of
360-degree sound that the leakage has
some new features that the a2 didn't
have for example it has this retractable
grip which of course can be used for
carrying the speaker around then you
have some nice better indicator with
four dedicated that's each of them
representing around 25% of battery life
this also works as volume indicator so
when changing volume you can see more or
less the volume the speaker is set to
and the lis included also on EQ button
which switches between a clear and the
warm setting we'll have a more detailed
look at this later on the main feature
of the dolly catch is maybe it's 360
degree sound dispersion the benefits of
only directional sound are more than
obvious with other more traditional
because you always have to sit directly
in front to get the best sound while
with the dolly catch you simply place it
anywhere walk around and still get more
less the same sound I would like to
demonstrate you this with a simple setup
of course using binaural microphones and
a song from soul persona so please put
up your headphones and check this out
I think you could hear that the sound
didn't change a lot when the speaker
turned around
although placement of an omnidirectional
speaker can also become a bit tricky
especially indoors when placed closer to
wall or inside a shelf as the back
drivers will always contribute to the
sound creating diffuse reflections but
outdoors inside my garden I really
enjoyed the tally catch quite a lot also
near the pool
although outdoor use is a bit
questionable it comes with a nice
carrying bag but the finish is maybe a
bit too precious and too sensitive for
real outdoor use and it doesn't stand
relate that stable so if you put it on
concrete and it falls over yeah you will
damage this nice finish the carrying
handle although not really meant to be
removable somehow I managed to remove it
and I found this feature also quite
useful as you can let the speaker hang
from some branch or something although
this only works with really thin
branches and objects although that the
leakage needs an own charger a full
charge takes less than two hours it can
also charge external devices you can
find the parts below a flap including an
auxiliary port and battery life seems
indeed great when kept it reasonable
loudness levels but even at maximum I
got more than two and a half hours just
for comparison there bangle Dolson do
play a tool will reduce volume to half
after around 50 minutes so what about
sound of course I prepared some
measurements here you can see the clear
setting at our volume which measures
quite a bit more balance in that Bo play
a 2 but lacks a little bit of its deeper
bass response this is where the warm
setting comes in and you can see treble
gets quite a bit reduced while bass gets
boosted for my taste I would have
prefered still more treble for the warm
setting and generally I really like the
one setting more is it gives you this
big huge sound out of a small speaker at
low levels you get a nice bass boost
with both settings but it levels above
half bass that's getting reduced already
and some kind of limiter or compressor
starts kicking in resulting in some
pumping sound levels above two-thirds
are becoming close to unusable with the
delicate unfortunately so it's
definitely not a speaker for highest
levels if you know where the limits of
the speaker it's really enjoyable and I
enjoy it up a lot I mean it's one of the
best I've heard up to half volume but
above half it doesn't really sound that
great of course I would like to
demonstrate you how it sounds where the
limits of this speaker are as always I
will be using a head cam and binaural
microphones to give you a first-person
impression
please use headphones as this is the
only premise for binaural recordings and
we will check it out to get a better
idea of the delicate sound
I thought we will compare it against
some difference because at once like the
phobic cell that P Phi Helsinki and that
bang on all simply apply a 1 let's start
with the food work cell first although
the band all of symbiote play it would
be probably the best and closest
contender for the deli catch the flu
Excel is one of the other view-only
directions because I currently at home
it's a bit different so it's a
completely waterproof and more rugged
model it's a bit cheaper but at the same
time a bit heavier as well as you can
see I use it completely with our jacket
as I think the jacket compromises the
sound too much the Dalek edge will play
with its warm mode while the flu work
sell place with normal mode so I will
start with a more acoustic song and the
Dalek edge first please have a listen
for excel
allocate it sounds a bit more open also
clearer to extend again and thanks to
the main drivers which aim outwards the
full Excel manager manages even some
kind of stereo while the dolly catch has
more at front and back stereo but still
both sound very open let's try another
caustic song
to excel you can hear that it's
Mississippi declarative the Danny ketch
we can also hear how they perform
off-axis
bass both are more less omnidirectional
but the
for excel becomes a bit muffled while
the dahle catch
retains more of its sound
let's try some just fun and I will
increase volume slightly this is
therefore excel now now that'll catch
you can maybe hear that then for Excel
retains more punch at higher levels a
track from Princess Frida to excel I
will reduce volume again so we can hear
how they perform at lower levels online
edge as well and you will notice that
their tally catch yes sounds warmer more
full-bodied the fluid cell but the fugu
has really this nice spaciousness this
is a little bit missing from the Danny
ketch mini
of course it changes quite a bit when if
you increase volume which will which I
will do now so I'm increasing volume
well to have the for Excel has a bit
different volume curve yeah let's
increase volume even more on the catch
as well and you can hear how some
compression starts kicking in while the
peer Excel managed to play this yet
memory
becomes white I'm this hair
another freak from princess creature and
you should hear the difference well how
they both blend are the drums and bass
and everything you can already hear
compression and limiting from the dolly
catch this is the for Excel yes there is
still all the bass I will increase the
completed for maximum
and over the catch place much longer
it's not really miserable rexella game
it needs some time to reach final volume
catch
you really have to fold closer to half
volume to make it normal again maybe
let's try the FIFA Helsinki now the FIFA
I think is not an omnidirectional
speaker but also comes from a Danish
company they both cost exactly the same
and also size-wise not that much of a
difference the most interesting aspect
of the FF I think is that it manages to
retain its sound quality up to maximum
volume we will test this out I will
start with a song from soul persona
together princess freesia and the
delicate first it slightly lower levels
at lower levels that the link head
should have more punch but we will see
what happens when we increase volume the
FIFA
sounds maybe a bikini so I would use
volume slightly and then 3/5 slow and
let's listen from far away again
increasing volume slightly on the catch
as well and you can again start you can
hear how the compressor starts kicking
in
FIFA game
and increasing volume again the FIFA and
is maximum volumes also mixing and the
difference is really obviously FIFA
again
another song from princess freesia
stating it is a bit louder the Dalek
head for the sound quality is just
completely
yeah you really have to reduce volume
around 5060 percent and the lower we get
the more full-bodied the catch will
become while the difficulty remains
rather pretty teeny sounding so the
people stinky is more speaker that
becomes better than I alternate
while the Danny ketch prefers laid-back
and lower levels dally catch again maybe
let's try the bangle dollars in your
play a 1 now the a 1 maybe a smaller
substitute for the missing Bang &amp;amp;
Olufsen vo play - although I even think
that the a1 sounds better than the a -
despite being just a mono speaker will
definitely hear this difference I will
start again with an acoustic song in the
deli catch
they won
it's more focused inside the speaker
everything also better treble definition
just more open sounding
maybe let's try some kind of jazz funk
and I will increase volume we are round
up volume now on the Dahle catch that a1
is closer to third maybe even higher the
catch still sounds bigger and more
convincing here maybe another smooth
jazz song yet they saw the much
different
although the belly catch there sounds
bigger and more mature
maybe let's try this song from savasana
and let's hear how they perform at
higher levels this is the a one now so
turning volume closer to maximum also
with the catch and again the limiter
becomes quite noticeable here
so this is mixing volume of the a1 now
and although sounding a bit thin it is
not normal while the catch start pumping
the only thing we could try
is maybe switch to clear setting and see
what happens now it's a bit bit better I
will
yeah I think it's better with clear
setting but still far from perfect so to
conclude that the leakage is definitely
on the speaker for everyone also because
of the higher price tag this is some
kind of luxury object for sure and if
you prefer high listening party levels
go for something else like the JBL
extreme or harman kardon going play but
for normal listening levels I'm really
enjoying the Dahle catch a lot I prefer
it over many others because including
the effacing key which tends to sound
really teeny at low levels even the
Harman Kardon going play starts to
really shine at levels close to half
this is where the leakage starts to fall
apart a little bit yeah you have to know
where the limits of this speakers are
but I I'm enjoying this 360 degree sound
dispersion also battery life is great
and although I would have preferred
maybe a bit more durable finish
something more suitable for outdoor use
it's still a great portable speaker that
you can carry around and and have with
you yeah let's see what Dahle will come
up with maybe they will improve the
processing slightly currently the
speaker is really close to unusable at
higher levels it improves a little bit
when you attach it domains but it's a
portable speaker therefore most of the
time it will be probably used from
battery yeah I hope my video could give
you an idea about the leakage it's not
the perfect speaker but within its
limits it's one of the best I've heard
although yet there is definitely some
room for improvement and let's hope
Dahle
takes some response some some feedback
seriously so thanks a lot for watching I
hope you enjoyed it a little bit and see
you in the next video have a nice time
and bye-bye
act of peace daya Banach or what a piece
the whole areas now the FIFA I think is
not an omnidirectional speaker but cost
exactly the same as the Dali catch and
also size-wise not that much of a
difference the most fascinating</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
