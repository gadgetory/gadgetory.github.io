FUBU XL vs. JBL extreme this is what
everyone was asking for well
unfortunately this is just a piece of
paper why haven't I done any review of
the fugu XL yet the answer is pretty
simple because I didn't get any unit so
far not because I'm in love with JBL how
someone claimed in a comment no I was in
contact with fugu for some time now and
they promised to send me a review sample
but lately they didn't even respond to
my emails so far it's only available in
America it might become available in
Europe at the end of November but this
might be too late for all those who are
still undecided between JBL extreme or
for XL therefore I wanted to start some
kind of donation campaign so with a
little bit of your help I could order
this pika directly from America do my
review and so on do some videos and
later on give it away among all those do
some kind of raffle among all those who
donate it my goal would be to collect
$500 until 1st of November it doesn't
make sense to wait any longer because it
would be too late including shipping and
so on it would arrive too late so the
deadline is 1st November until then I
would like to find 500 600 people who
are willing to donate $1 this would
cover the shipping cost to Europe the
Texas the import or custom fees and
hopefully they would also cover the cost
the shipping costs afterwards when I
ship the speaker worldwide I don't know
who will win it maybe someone from
Australia maybe from China or Brazil I
don't know so I hope five hundred five
hundred fifty dollars would be enough to
cover all costs I hope there is no risk
I mean I have no profit from this I will
give the speaker away afterwards also if
I don't manage to collect five hundred
dollars within this week I will give all
money back to all those who donate it so
you see there is no no trick and there
anything I would like to prepare also
vlogs videos of the current status so
that you see what's going on how much I
was able to collect and of course the
final
lottery raffle or tombola how you would
like to call it I would like to maybe
even do some live broadcast or make a
video so that you see that it's all
official that it's not fake or something
I mean I could make five hundred with my
own name or something no I really want
to make it as transparent as possible so
yeah how to donate the link is in the
description of this video please also
have a look at my site all apps gadgets
dotnet where I describe it well longer
also the costs what I try to show you
how much all costs will be and I hope we
can have this done for some kind of
review video whatever and one of you
will have the chance to get the speaker
of the words I think this is a nice
campaign unfortunately I really cannot
afford it now because I would I would
buy it by myself but I ordered this
lobaton's it mini recently which was
just announced and I cannot afford
buying a second speaker therefore I need
your help if you are interested you're
welcome I would be glad if we get this
little project done yeah again have a
look at my site for more details olives
Gators net and thanks for watching I
hope we can have the real fugu at not
some kind of paper within two weeks here
thanks a lot and bye bye
