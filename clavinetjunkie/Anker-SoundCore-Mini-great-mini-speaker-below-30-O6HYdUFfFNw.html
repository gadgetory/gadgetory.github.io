have a quick look at the anchor sound
coil mini this is a low-budget speaker
although what the prices increased
recently it was around twenty three four
dollars now it's thirty but still I
think it's pretty interesting and decent
for this price as it has lots of
features like SD card playback it has FM
radio built-in although here where I
live it didn't find any station but I
thought we will check it out against
some other comments because I have the
etekcity rover beats D 16 here which is
pretty similar the very popular JBL go
also the Harris Park KS 200 which is a
bit more expensive and we will also
compare it against my very favorite mini
speaker they show me me later on but
first I thought we will check out some
frequency response measurement and you
can see one measured exactly on axis so
you can see it's slightly treble heavy
the bass rolls off at 200 Hertz but
there is still some response down to
around 75 Hertz if we measure it at an
angle of 45 degrees you can see that
there is some slight tread loss at 90
degrees which is exactly from the side
you will get this response at low levels
you can see that there is no kind of
dynamic bass adjustment which is a pity
and we will see later on why this is so
important and it makes them it keeps the
base amount at the same level it's not a
lot a speaker but things know bass
reduction it's still pretty punchy yeah
let's check it out I will turn it on so
we can hear the welcome tones and first
maybe let's check out SD card playback
just insert a card and it should
immediately start playback the
controlling volume is done by a short
press if you press longer it jumps to
the previous track in this case to the
next track
and maybe you can hear that it sounds
indeed quite nice for this size and
price and you can also hear the treble
with action when not listen exactly on
X's FM radio yeah we won't get any
station you see this is bluetooth now
this is FM but I did a scan before and
yeah there is not a single thing
even with when aux wire inserted it
didn't find anything this works as an
antenna then so let's change to
bluetooth again let's take this off and
first I thought we'll compare it against
this
etekcity here yes they are really pretty
similar but you will immediately hear
how ridiculous this one's on ta come on
she tells me her whole life story and I
will start with the anchor sound Kamini
first of course as always I'm using
binaural microphones so please listen
with headphones yeah
let's check it out
this is the incus on Kamino
they're over boots
yeah I think the difference is more than
obvious here
yeah this robber beats it's slightly
cheap I think currently around $15 but
it's not even with this price then we
have the JBL go which will test very
popular also highly rated I mean I'm not
that big fan of the JBL go and let's
start again with the Hankerson / mini
JDM for the next one
I will increase the anchor also okay
this is mixing now it's not a big messes
so another complaint that we have is the
Harris Park which is quite a bit more
expensive currently I don't know what
the costs are more than $30 maybe even
40 so let's check this out it's
connected now and another track again
starting with the anchor
it's somebody changed on them you can
clearly hear its vibrational I think
even here the anchor sounds somehow more
convincing and keep in mind it's a
360-degree speaker so you can walk
around and get more or less the same
song
and this vibration somehow kills the
sound yeah let's try there let's try the
Xiaomi me speaker well which I like a
lot although it's not really that much
better than the anchor the only thing
the Xiaomi me has is yeah dynamic base
adjustment for low levels let's try
another track and I will increase both
to maximum starting out with a sound
kamini and you will hear the difference
in sound so this is maximum the anchor
will do the same for there shall only
need get slightly louder but doesn't
really sound that much better
so let's decrease volume too well more
normal listening levels let's do this
with the sound car mini as well and you
will hear the difference
the me suddenly gets some bass why the
anchor is pretty tinny yeah we've seen
from the measurement that there is some
response down to around 75 Hertz but
it's always kept at the same at the same
level at low levels it could have been
increased but yeah it they didn't do it
which is a pity as the speaker would
have definitely much more potential as
you can hear maximum level at mixing
volume they both sound pretty similar
let's try another track medium so at low
levels the Sharmini sounds simply much
better because of this dynamic DSP
adjustment
but as soon as we increase volume the
anchor keeps the level while this starts
reducing gauge
so yeah it cannot really compete with
the Xiaomi because of lacking DSP
adjustment oh yeah it would have been
great to have also DSP inside here maybe
it's not possible for this price but
this doesn't cost really that much more
I saw it already 4:30 seven eight
dollars so eight dollars more than this
anchor still a really nice speaker it
much better than a JBL go for example
also many others at this price range at
this size yeah if I think it's it's
really okay if you need some small
speakers Oh with SD card playback
battery life is great so yeah definitely
one of the better ones in this class
although some DSP adjustments some
dynamic processing would have been even
better it would have made it much more
mature sounding similar to the Xiaomi me
which simply shines because of this
dynamic bass boost at low levels so I
hope this could give you an idea about
the anchor sound kamini of course is
already included within the database I
will call it like this in lying flat you
could also place it like that although
it will roll around for a more
directional sound I think this is the
normal way you usually would place it so
yeah I hope this could give you an idea
about the anchor sound compared to some
other ones it makes them which really
impressive as it doesn't reduce bass
also no kind of dynamic compression or
something but at low levels it's not
really that impressive it's more in line
with all the other speakers in this
price so thanks all for watching and see
you in the next video have a nice time
and bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
