previous videos I already mentioned it
that the GBA church was sounds really
great when played together the GBA flip
for with Kinect plus maybe they're even
designed to be used like this so playing
together so you need two devices because
the charge for playing alone is mono and
it makes a little sparkle like the GBA
fleet form here next is base but when
played together the sound is similar to
a bit extreme - maybe and I would like
to demonstrate to this but first some
other story a friend of mine tech
history you can also check out his
channel he cut his trivia track for he
measured it uses exactly the same
measurement setup as me and his unit
medicine will be differently
we compared both our measurements and he
doesn't have this base team at around
hundred Hertz but doesn't have this bass
boost around 60 70 Hertz either a
passion that they sound on a similar but
mine obviously seems a bit more bass
heavy
I'm not sure which is more
representative but maybe some other ones
can also post their measurements but now
he attends a listen to the JBL charge
for alone the problem is that if you
activate comic glass and some changes in
this case treble gets reused listen
meets a pme3 Mahalo and I would like to
show you this I better wait I will
because one after the other
first the TV a charge for playing alone
then both play together and later on I
will put them aside and crank them for
maximum you can also hear the difference
in overall hours so you are already
listening to an artificial head by no.11
so do so this context was for best
results and
so very young opinion what do you think
about them when playing together is this
not any better per ticket it's way the
other like this but also you know it
makes move that before become so harsh
that the church poor cannot keep up with
the base anymore so this is how that
makes me it's not that great but it's
really really loved may be louder than
the TV explain to them if you want I
could maybe add them like this to my
database
please tell me but you could also hear
that meets become a bit Hollow not true
what the reason for this is maybe
because the drivers are so close to each
other and they are not playing exactly
in sync because it's just the wireless
connection so maybe there if there is
some interference some some computering
I tried measuring the JBL charge for
alone outdoors from a distance of 50
centimeters and also when playing
together with the table flip for and
with the flipfold you can see there is
some interpret some conflicting it's
probably not to be avoided
thanks to that house being so close so I
wouldn't have to put them far apart you
tell me your opinion is it really that
much better
I think these are really nice maybe not
really close to GTO extreme this is not
the trash problem it takes some time
until they connect to each other
so I hope this was helpful for all those
who maybe have a flip for at home and
are thinking I'm thinking about the JBL
charge for I didn't notice such a an
increase in sound with the tibial artery
and the feet falter because the charge
is not it's full-bodied like the Arabian
transport but these two really
complement each other quite nicely
although I'm still not quite sure if my
joint is really representative the one
from tech history seems even more
balanced with place there is no base
post at all or no nope a centrist is in
the lower region well technically has it
so there is some resonance at around 65
Hertz with mine trying maybe some sign
generator and it's not all this edge so
we are eight years
so you can see this basically this move
we have 463 so this is loudest here and
then it starts running off at 56
you can hear it's definitely the most
movement I have so that basically does
seem to be tilted around 63 64
and really I can increase water to
maximum but you can hear the bass but
what I also wanted to show you is I will
increase volume
this is a small dog and if I were to
spot him quickly you can hear how the
bass creep seen again this is also quite
noticeable with some tracks no face
that's creepy
so thanks for watching firstly I don't
have much time for talking</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
