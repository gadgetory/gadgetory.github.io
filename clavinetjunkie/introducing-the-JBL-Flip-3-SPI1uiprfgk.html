new JBL flip 3 after having heard the
JBL extreme lately which literally blew
me away and also my friends who had a
listen and immediately ordered one
I thought the JBL flip 3 might also be
interesting and ordered it to have a
listen and demonstrate your some of its
features let's have a look inside well
there is not much just some quick guides
and volunteer cards and so on a USB wire
no charge at this time and the speaker
itself and as you can see both look
pretty similar design wise I mean they
share the same design language this this
finish here and the red JBL logo and
both a dual passive radiators design in
contrast to be for the old JBL flip tool
which was space reflects and compared to
the 53 it looks a bit girlish I think
it's well it's not as decent
and cool-looking as the flip 3 which is
also water resistant or splash proof and
of course we have the JBL charge too
this is not the JJB I charge to plus but
they look the same and sound the same
but you can see immediately that the
charge tool is a bit out of place I mean
it has it doesn't have this nice finish
here umm but all three share the same
acoustic design with passive radiators
at the sides so I thought later on we
will have a listen and see how the JBL
flip 3 really compares let me spoil that
it's a decent performer oh but it
doesn't knock my socks off I mean it's
not in the same category as their JBL
charge tool but we have the
and we'll see how it compares against
the whole generation I also have the UE
boom so we will hear how it compares
against this one very popular very
laughed speaker by many well not by me
and we also have the Denon by a mini and
we will also hear how all of them sound
but I will post some videos later on
this is just to demonstrate you some of
the features which we will try now I
will try to show you this JBL connect
feature which is you can connect two
speakers wirelessly first time with JBL
other speakers head already had this
function but it works pretty well on in
case of JBL because you don't need any
app you just press the button and they
find themselves you thought this this
was the welcome tone this is the tone
confirmation tone for a Bluetooth
connection and we can start playing
I think it's called flip because it rips
over you can roll it around no of course
not you can also put it like that but
you only get stereo separation if you
place it horizontally therefore let's
try JBL connect you have just press a
button on both and they should find
themselves and connect automatically
yeah now both are playing
it can also switch it off again and
click 3 should continue alone so it
works pretty well
of course there is an F as well but it
doesn't have many functions it can only
rename the speaker there is no equalizer
but otherwise you need an equalizer if
the speaker sounds great so I don't miss
an equalizer you can rename the speaker
and if both are flipped 3 or both a JBL
extreme you can choose between party
mode or stereo in case well two
different speakers are connected there
is only party motivate level so both
will play the same so next up I will
prepare a video comparing the second
generation with the third one to show
you if it's really an improvement later
on we will of course compare it against
the GI Bill charge tool and maybe the
most interesting question is it much
worse than the UE boom or even much
better who knows
and my still one of my favorite speakers
portable ultra portable because is the
den on my mini and we will also hear if
the JBL flip 3 comes a bit close in
sound performance so stay tuned for some
upcoming videos I will divide them
divide them after speakers I don't I
won't make one long 20 minute video so
you can only watch this which interests
you most until then please stay tuned
and we will see you in the next video
thanks for watching and bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
