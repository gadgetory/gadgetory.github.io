noise outside this is my neighbor doing
some high pressure cleaning sorry for
that but many people were asking how the
new harman kardon go and play compares
against the toilet boom stir so i
thought we will do a very quick sound
check both are pretty comparable same
weight same size same price the only big
difference is that the battery of the
toilet boom stores twice as large so you
will get around 6 hours at maximum why
the Harman Kardon going play will play
for around 2 hours and a half yet it's a
pity that Hammond didn't include a
bigger battery but yeah we cannot change
it I selected some different songs which
I will try to use for all upcoming tests
also maybe we will compare the new
version against the old one so we will
have a bass with the same songs as
always I am of course using high quality
binaural microphones you should listen
to headphones and I will start playing
with the Harman Kardon go and play at
level slightly above half later on I
will put them far away and will crank
them to maximum but first let's say very
simply Harman Kardon
basis neutral now I will turn bass up
slightly later on this is definitely
sounds a bit thinner
now basis at maximum for the fight
against drug
Oh
believe me
me
Oh
yeah I think bass at maximum is a bit
too much let's take down one notch and
let's listen to another song
you
again something else you can already
hear pot noise here
yeah the Harman Kardon has specified it
has so no partners here and still very
punchy
but this sounds incredibly old and and
spacious another song
yeah I will put them far away now and
let's listen to some rock
I will start turning them for maximum
another phone
yes - bolsters thousands appear as
powerful also the face of the hammer
atom is much more punchy
something a bit more extreme
yeah both are pretty loud let's try this
you
yeah finally silent now the neighbor
stopped yet still I hope it was helpful
for you despite all the background noise
I think both play on a very high level
although I prefer the Harman Kardon it
has a more open sound also broader more
spacious the top lip boom star excel
doesn't have this bass punch of the
Harman Kardon if you increase base to
maximum you get more of a booming sound
oh yeah but it has a better battery
twice the capacity of the Harman Kardon
gone play it's really a pity that Harman
Kardon didn't include a larger one maybe
you can open the device and check if
there is place for something bigger
still both are really great but I think
for simply on sound alone the Harman
Kardon is one of the best I've heard so
thanks a lot for watching and bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
