look at two ears or earphones that
usually get a got for free and not
country if a please still including the
iPods with the new iPhones but I got
them for free with the iPhone 6 and here
I have the Samsung s8 bundle I think
they are called Samsung is eight
earphones tuned by AKG there is also a
model number II o IG 955 they also came
for free but you can still find them on
Amazon or some gearbest but I would
avoid buying them from Kapus because I
think they are fake or so without AKG
logo I bought them from Amazon for
around 15 euros so still quite cheap and
not quite true I think you can also buy
the airport separately yeah but I
wouldn't do this I was sure I already
threw them away but I could still find
them and it's really the first time I
try them on and I think here their
design failure because they are just
some some has some earbuds
they don't work like in use so you put
them in like this and when they hang
loose you get a sound which is compared
to this here so really thin I don't know
then if I try to really put them deeper
inside like I would do with with an with
an in-ear you get a muddy bully mess
like this
horrible but if you try to maybe adjust
them slightly to some yes somewhere in
between not too deep inside not to to
lose it become something like that but
when you move your head yeah it's
impossible to get this sound right
because I know the left one is too deep
inside or the right one I had a hard
time to record them here so I think they
are really a design failure I'm not
quite sure what they had they have very
very loose just hanging there
the sound is thin and crap in the
Samsung on the other hand is a huge
surprise for me it was recommended to me
again by one of my viewers John who
already recommended me the automatic mk5
he recommended some other ones I already
got them I will do some reviews in
future about them and all of those are
really great great so these are
outstanding if you can get them from
1015 dollars yeah a no-brainer look here
I have tons of suggested in years the TR
TR n V 20 t RN b 80k set a s 10 revin
xed QT - what else the King audio T -
yeah mine is defective I would still
still do a short video about them then I
will hopefully get a replacement you
have the ultimate ears 350 ve VI also
the final audio e mm highly rated
everywhere these are tough on them also
I could really stop reviewing others
because it doesn't make sense they sound
just yeah horrible crappy against this
yeah let's simply take a listen or have
a listen I will put them in here and
will let you listen also may be compared
against the April airports with this mid
feet so not too deep inside because you
get really a muddy very detailed booming
mess and not too loose because then they
something like some I don't know as if
you were listening to some yeah
headphone from a distance so let's
compare them with this meet
I don't know mid feet and later on we
will discuss
I think you'll tear the Samsung is eight
bundle completely outperforms there he
puts yeah yeah and they were for free
they were included with the Samsung
Galaxy s8 quite impressive I think this
is a dual driver Co X design
it's by Samsung but they put the AKG
name on it maybe there was some tuning
made by AKG before they bought the
entire Hammond family where AKG was also
bought before by Hammond AKG is an
Austrian company was an Austrian company
so quite a historical one I think
founded in the 50s or 60s always made
great headphones now it belongs to
Samsung design is yeah not quite sure
there are angled but they work well very
nice fit the only thing I would suggest
immediately is to exchange the tips with
the original tips when I put them in to
get a good seal the treble goes away but
maybe remember the Sony hydrate tips
I recommended for the case that 80 lead
with this without any first skin trick
just put this on instead of the original
ones hence they are really great
so I recorded them with these sony tips
and they have not perfectly flat or
something but a very pleasant neutral
sound without any strange peaks like all
the others have it's horrible I don't
know I mean we can prove this with some
frequency response measurements so here
I have the Samsung s8 bundle sorry I
couldn't I couldn't measure the Apple
earpods here because when I put them in
I will try show you is this really funny
I really had a hard time to record them
yeah they fell out after some time they
become looser and looser so I tried it
to a sticky tape but I never cut them
right so it was impossible to me to
measure them as you could hear the sound
with this meat meat fit they are maybe
okay but not more why these outperform
many more expensive headphones earphones
let's have a look again at the
measurement keep in mind this is a
diffused field target compensation so it
looks a little different than an
uncompensated one like this but I will
average left and right and you can see
yeah maybe
mind you of something it reminded me as
well sound wise I will overlay that I
were prodigy one here my modded version
and you can see they measure
surprisingly similar the Iowa has
slightly less meet here in the two three
kilohertz section but again a slight
peak at around five kilowatts why the
Samsung has a flatter response here also
trail is similar so my modded iowa i
modded it to such a level that it sounds
quite similar as the AKG I think a
Samsung I don't know who is responsible
for the design but yeah for being for
free these are I mean these are
outstanding they are in Germany would
say parallel for the Sawyer so pearls in
front of Peaks it's really it's waste to
include them or it was a waste because
they are really are sending I had a look
at some reviews some praise them while
others think they're sound average then
we recommend some other crap from sound
magic I'm not sure I should I think some
people should really stop reviewing in
these or headphones because they're
healing seems to be off these sound
outstanding for this price or I'm for
being for free they are just I don't
know I'm enjoying them so much that I
don't use the triple triple driver
anymore because they sound quite similar
and I don't have issues with this with
volume control because the lighting
version of the triple driver has very
rough control already below half they
allowed so I didn't dare even to put the
slider close to to half because yeah
they would yet they would make me deaf
what they would definitely who is in how
is it in English I prefer these they're
also more comfortable you simply put
them in no hassle with with fit just
yeah keep keep sure to have them nicely
inside and use these Sony
Hydra tips and we'll add against an ebay
link to this I get to or I got two sets
for three euros 50 definitely worth it I
use the largest ones and although they
look similar the tips from the Samsung
here
it's still different maybe I don't know
if it's there if it's the German yet the
diameter diameter sorry is a little bit
different there also may be shorter but
with the with these Sony tips they sound
really amazing and we could maybe have a
listen against the case at a te as I
thought them to be some kind of
reference in this price range around ten
dollars or something but I think the
Samsung s8 bundle outperforms it simply
with a smoother sound overall also more
treble sparkle the eighty are still nice
but you need to apply this to strange
for skin trick to make them sound right
and they also a bit too harsh in this
five kilo Hertz region while they are
really really smooth so let's listen
again the Samsung is eight first and
then the Kate Kate
maybe some still prefer the case at 80
over this year but it's really hard to
judge the sound from a recalling
correctly it also depends a lot on which
headphones use for this how they color
the sound but when listened life I
immediately like the Samsung is eight
why would the case at 80 I had to try
different tapes different fits also try
this for skin trick to make them sound
right and they still sound a little bit
out of balance for me they have slightly
less bass or maybe more neutral with
base but the Samsung is a boundary here
way more fun to listen to
also they don't color the sound bed much
as the case at 80 do and you should
definitely listen to them life so if you
haven't heard them or if you have them
included with your Samsung s8 phone yeah
take them out and try them because they
are better than many others you can get
for round 50 $60 completely auto from
all those recommended ones to me yet
they have better than than all these
this trmD 20 they sound similar but the
TR did the v20 a horrible day you cannot
fit them right they fall out very
strange design we tried putting come on
let me try putting them in so they are
so big you have to to get it to have a
good fit but it's impossible because of
the design why this just hang there
inside your ear yeah and feel
comfortable
no annoyance or something from them and
sound similar to the v20 I saw audio
budget he reviews lots of budget in his
but most of the recommended ones avoided
ones are worse than this so I'm not
quite sure what the right there is not
more hype around them because I really
great from what I heard at the very
beginning there was maybe some quality
problem with them so but when was the s8
released two three years ago or more so
these are probably a more recent models
they sound really great I can ensure you
not perfectly flat or something but
still neutral enough to be able to hear
to hear the recording how it was
intended
from from the artist because all the
others color the sound make treble the
the which was this rebel next QT to
completely colored treble I gotten from
the company and they are asking when do
I do a live review I mean what should I
say they are crap sorry but I wouldn't
pay money for this also exactly the same
strange design very big for out of your
ears heavy three or four drivers these
are dual dryer coax quite interesting
design and maybe AKG retune them who
knows or if they just put the name on
them but for me a really huge surprise
from all those crap that was suggested
to me finally John Young thanks John
for recommending them I have another
unit that he suggested to me also I'm
awaiting a fourth one yeah I bought all
of them he suggested to me because they
are just he's the only one so far I
really trust because all the other
recommendations are off so yeah this was
my take Apple earpods at design failure
I'm not quite sure
maybe the engineers have different your
Anatomy but just hanging it just letting
them hang like this the hottest thing
sizzling something but he see tons of
people walking around with these I think
the airport's is all the wireless ones
I'm always the same so maybe but how to
put them in if you get a good seal it's
a balmy blue wine just letting them like
this still people buy this for 150 or
200 dollars I'm not quite sure I mean
yeah but everyone everyone taste is
different it's different
so Samsung is eight bundle or let me
give you the name again IG 955 black
very cheap packaging like this but only
its packaging if the result is so great
so thanks for watching I hope you like
this a little bit just wanted to there
is so much crap especially these piece e
mm they sound half decent with well when
I
stick them with my hands with my fingers
but as soon as I let them lose the Sun
becomes yeah comparable to the earpods
here I also tried different tips they
arrived best earphones below fifty
dollars or something no sorry yeah I
thought you can get these for free with
the Samsung is eight and they completely
outperform this so more in ears of
course coming I have a very interesting
one from sony also recommended to me by
John so thanks again John really I
appreciate your help
at first I thought yeah this aquatic I
had one automatic why does he suggested
it sounded crappy but it was my fault I
didn't get the right fit with this and
the upcoming Sony is also really great a
little bit different sounding maybe more
neutral but also maybe more boring but
yeah stay tuned for the review of the
sony also ten euros it was a little bit
more expensive very old in-ear to three
or four years old and you can hardly
read anything because people hype all
this recent crap from crazy which you
cannot listen to I'm not quite sure
what's instead of really suggesting
great in years great sound they they
suggest some crap maybe twenties have a
very I read or your budget wrote that
they have very detailed the most
dependable no it just sizzle it just the
treble is just boosted with some peak so
the Samsung is eight bundle here
definitely sounds better and more
balanced more high fighting this so yeah
I hope I didn't insult anyone but I'm
surprised that there is so much yeah I
mean also the it depends a lot on the
feet maybe on your ear geometry but the
easy
they reproduce the sound see me to see
to such a degree or in a similar way
what I'm hearing so my human cannot be
that off that some like or don't like
this then it's probably your problem not
mine yeah like this was it thanks all
for watching and stay tuned for some
upcoming in your videos I will yeah I
didn't want to review them but I will
of course do some review some
comparative ones still my new reference
in the $10 10 euro class is the Samsung
s8 to go with this upcoming Sony maybe
so stay tuned until then have a nice
time at bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
