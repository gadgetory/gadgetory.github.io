I'm recording with a GoPro Hero session
so maybe the image quality is a bit
better than with the Sony action camera
was recording before but the image of
course is not stabilized so please tell
me afterwards what you prefer what you
like more but today I thought we will
have a look at the TDK a 25 or Trek Plus
this is nothing new but recently it was
offered at some German stores for 20
euros and I think for 20 years it must
be one of the best I've heard as you can
see it has some nice small compact
design a bit similar to the TDK track
max I think the a34 controls on top its
splash water-resistant sold all the
ports are behind some protective flap
you can see charging is done for micro
USB there is some main power switch
which should be here off most of the
time because there is definitely some
self discharging just like on the other
TDK speakers and before having a listen
and comparing it against some others
because I thought you might want to see
how it measures and as you can see the
measurement is really natural this is a
measurement that you also get from some
more high-end speakers like the Eclipse
came zero on the clips groove and so on
just that the TDK doesn't reach s deep
you can see the base already rows of 800
Hertz and you have a bass boost between
200 and 400 Hertz with some treble peak
at 14 kilo Hertz you can also see that
at low levels there is not really any
bass boost so no loudness compensation
but at high levels there is hardly any
bass reduction either so the sound
really remains always the same and I
thought will compare it against some
other speakers for example the era spark
is 200 the TDK currently goes for $45 on
Amazon but some operate for less like 32
here the era spark of 30 then I have the
anchor sound core which cost $36 the
polar is v8 for $50 I also have the
sound transit XS which I like pretty
but it costs 92 which is a bit well
expensive and we have the highly rated
shark boom box which costs $58 currently
and as you can see it has really the
best ratings with 3350 reviews so yeah
let's see how it compares but first of
course let's listen how it sounds in
general there are not any kind of well
welcome tones so this is pretty nice and
regardless what kind of genre you play
it sounds pretty decent for example with
jazz
or some rock
or electro one thing you should know is
that volume control is not in sync so
you should keep the speak at maximum all
the time because if you max out the
player the sound becomes a bit
compressed and in E it's definitely
better to increase volume of the speaker
and keep the volume on your player low
instead but of course we would like to
know how it compares against some other
speakers and I thought we will start
with the era spark a s200 dedicate first
here the sound is much more mature from
the PDK
and the as9 of also love fades let's try
the ankus encore instead starting again
with the TDK banker also here's some
confession already but this sounds much
fuller much bigger
despite costing all is the same
let's try the polarise v8 GDK first
again the Polaris sounds like some other
situation t3 you can hear that this
sounds much more mature
it also gets the highest ratings maybe
let's try the soign√© audio transit
access I really like the transit access
a lot because it's small but sounds
still pretty decent you can attach it to
some belt on the go but for close to a
hundred dollars it's definitely
overpriced so let's have a listen how
these two compare again starting with
the TDK drag plus first let transit
Excel keep in mind that it's already
playing closer to maximum
but this feels sounds more grown-up more
mature this isn't another trick and all
the trek from savasana transit access
the eight has no chance let's increase
loading to maximum but yes this is not a
very loud speaker did you play again and
I will increase volume to maximum value
yes becomes a bit ridiculous so maybe
let's check how it compares against the
highly rated shark boom box again TDK
first
the shotgun box here lots of mates but
no boom so a speaker with a boom box in
its name should have some boom but
this sounds definitely boomer let's
listen to another track yeah rap hip-hop
name like your feet exact adjustable to
answer second max step into life with
the door psyche
alright is our age recycle what is it
Chuck again on circular I really cannot
follow quite everything's not even
priests are success people make swing
back it's so much bigger of all let's
listen to this
a shock
this is closest kind of music hey oh
this isn't for this and maybe we should
increase volume to maximum the kiddie
Kapers this is maximum volume now the
shocked almost as well
it appears a bit louder but just because
of much more meat this sounds more
refined
all photography
yeah the GDK is not really that loud but
simply sounds much better so yeah I hope
this could give you an idea about the TD
ka 25 I think it's a kind of underdog so
not very well known with not really many
ratings but it definitely outperforms
all the others here even the much more
expensive transit access yeah sure it's
smaller but this is exactly as portable
as the transit access and I think it
sounds much better than their shark or
any others of these it doesn't quite
reach the level of a JBL flip 3 but it
also costs well half and it's I think
smaller so if you can get it for around
$40 maybe even less if it's well maybe
there is some kind of promotion ones so
I should or I would definitely check it
out I mean I bought it for 20 euros and
I haven't heard any other speaker for 20
euros that sounds as great I mean it's
not some kind of wandering machine but
it simply sounds decent just like a
speaker of shoots I mean you've heard
the others this is ridiculous I wouldn't
like to listen to music with any of
those except maybe the transit access
but it reaches its limits pretty quickly
you always have to listen closer to
maximum it's maybe even slightly softer
than a gem box so yeah I hope this was
helpful somehow
thanks a lot for watching and see you in
the next video bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
