the brand new Harman Kardon go into play
this is the latest generation of a very
popular boombox model from Hong Kong
the very first going play was released
around 10 years ago maybe you still
remember it it was a bit bigger had an
apple dock and I even had two of them
because back by then I thought it was
one of the best portable speakers around
but it had a huge problem
it needed a big batteries for portable
use and the sound really suffered when
powered from batteries it sounded much
better from means later on Harman Kardon
released a wireless version with
Bluetooth instead but it still had the
same battery problem so this is where
the newest version from 2016 comes in
it's still Harman Kardon go and play but
it now has a rechargeable battery built
in it has bluetooth wireless pairing
with another one so it's up to date and
I thought we will have a closer look at
it you can remove the grille to have a
look under the hood which we will do now
and I think it looks great
even without grill as you can see we
have two big main drivers to twitter's
which aim rather to the sides each of
the drivers is part by a 25 watts
amplifier which means hundred watts in
total one big piece if rated at the
front one at the back and I think the
sound is really huge it makes most other
speakers sound a bit toyish including
the JBL extreme to demonstrate you the
qualities of the new going to play i
thought we will have a short listen
against the JBL extreme of course as
always i will be using a head cam and
binaural microphones to give you a kind
of first-person impression please use
headphones for the best results so let's
grab them and have a listen I set them
up here both are playing at around
two-thirds I will start with a track
from Sanchez are called take me as I am
and the Harman Kardon can play first
the JBL extreme yeah I think you can
hear the bass from already be spot
slightly go and play again get much more
punchy the bass is really extreme I will
start turning them for maximum Oh
the extremists were maximum
the loudness wise not that much
different but the Harman Kardon sounds
much cleaner much fuller
come on cotton again
now let's try a track from NCS by toboe
called colors both playing at maximum
extreme
not that much space
don't play again
it sounds much more estranged still much
more powerful go loudness is not that
much difference extreme again
so the new Harman Kardon go and play
might be not the loudest speak around
but I think it's one of the greatest
sounding ones I already compared it
shortly against their Peachtree deep
blue too and I think this sounds much
better it's also a nice addition to the
already great lineup of JBL Harman
Kardon speakers including the Onyx - do
- and the upcoming small clip tool which
is pocketable
yeah the design is great the sound is
great price is also great it's the same
price as the JBL extreme you get much
better sound of course at the cost of a
bit more weight in size of course this
was not meant to be a full review just a
very short first impression to give you
an idea about the speaker many more
comparisons will be coming soon against
maybe even the peachtree against the old
version which i will hopefully be able
to grab again and maybe even the onek
studio tool but this sounds much better
I can already tell you so thanks for
watching I hope you enjoyed it so far be
patient until I prepare some other
videos have a nice time and bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
