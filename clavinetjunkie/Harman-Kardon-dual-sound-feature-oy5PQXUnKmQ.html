video clearing up the confusion about
dual sound because the recent Harman
Kardon speakers like they go and play
here and also the new onyx studio 3
supports dual sound first I thought this
would be some kind of wireless stereo
but it isn't if you connect two speakers
for dual sound they simply double the
sound but you don't get a left in the
right channel how to do dual sound yet
first you have to turn them on and then
keep the Bluetooth button pressed for
five seconds on both and they should
jump into some own pairing mode then
they should connect ya and now if we
start playback they will play the same
left-right left-right
but you don't get a left and the right
channel so if you really wanted to buy
two Harman Kardon speakers for why does
they know well currently they don't
support it maybe in future they will but
I already encountered some problems with
dual sound because the sound sometimes
shifts to the left or to the right it
seems to be some sync problem so maybe
if you really had them for stereo you
would hear that it's not right I mean
it's nice for a party you put one there
the other one over there and can crank
music up because it's quite a bit louder
when two are playing together but you
won't get real stereo experience
first during my unboxing video I was
also mistaking because I thought hey man
they are playing in Stara but they
didn't so just wanted to tell you this
dual sound doesn't give you wireless
stereo currently but hopefully they will
already contact the command support but
they didn't even quite know about this
feature so well maybe that product is
too new maybe you also need some real
contact who is responsible for this but
if you have a Harman Kardon speaker and
yeah please contact them tell them do
you want wireless stereo so I hope this
could clear up some confusion thanks a
lot for watching and
ain't enough waste
one of you
with me don't you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
