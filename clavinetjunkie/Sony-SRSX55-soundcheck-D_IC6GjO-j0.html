you the new Sony SRS X 55 this is the
successor of the old x5 and the bigger
brother of the X 33 that we heard
recently it still looks pretty much the
same as before new is L DAC which is a
proprietary codec from Sony to improve
streaming quality it's available only on
Sony devices so far also new is that the
new X 55 doesn't reduce loudness or bass
when it's run from battery the old model
did this I thought we will have a listen
how it sounds I'm wearing binaural
microphones so please listen with
headphones as this is the only way to
give you a realistic sound impression
let's turn it on and I think the sony
SRS X 55 is a pretty solid performer but
only at lower levels we'll have a listen
I'm starting with a track we are below
half volume here there is this magic
sound button and you hopefully can hear
how it increases the soundstage
although I think it worked better on the
x-33
but the effect is still pretty decent on
the X 55 as well it just not as extreme
but I can I think you can leave it on
all the time it opens the sound more the
problem starts when we increase volume
which I will do now
you can hear that the bass drum is not
clean anymore and we are still far away
from maximum
I thought we will try the table charge
too many we're asking how does the Sony
X 5 4 X 55 compare against the J being
charged to I mean the jbr charge a 2 is
a different class it's smaller it's also
cheaper but we will have a listen so
again starting with the Sony the same
track another JBL it's not 100% clean
listen to the bass drum here while the
table charge - there's no distortion
nothing
that trick
now this JBL
remember that we are still well half vol
slightly above
the next example is pretty extreme this
is a jazz track listen to the bass again
you hear real overdrive driver overload
or something the same with the JBL
this is unacceptable
this is horrible it becomes better if I
reduce volume but and again they're the
stereo image is impressive but you have
to keep the volume down
look simpler mix this is a house trick
it's okay if you listen or if you like
listening house at lower levels but I am
increasing volume now this is doesn't
make fun anymore the JBL is perfectly
clean here
let's try increasing volume even more
and to hear how the base is reduced more
and more not the JBL
this trick I mean this is horrible
I thought we will try the Riveter by X
how it should sound in reality let's
turn this on okay I'm connected now and
we'll start again with the with the same
house track and the Sony first
let's try this maximum volume on the
smaller kitchen radio
okay I tried playing a bit with with a
frequency generator if we have a listen
I will set 63 or something Hertz and
then we increase volume on the Sony you
will see what happens nothing because I
turn it down so we will increase volume
here
and you here this is not a clean sign
tone anymore but when I would use volume
the distortion should go away but it
doesn't have a listen
it comes back again
it is as if the TSP was trying to push
pace to the maximum all the time
it's coming back I mean I'm 16 DB below
maximum but there is no difference in
because the bass is coming back
the river
when I reduce volume the bass is reduced
but not on the Sun that DSP is trying to
push too much I think
of course I measured the frequency
response of the Sony as well and I
measured it at three different loudness
levels first a level where it doesn't
distort this is below half then one at
about two thirds and that maximum volume
and you can see that the bass is reduced
at higher levels but you will also
notice the high bass boost at low levels
and this is well not bad because the
human ear is not so sensitive to lower
frequencies at lower levels therefore
Sony just tries to apply some kind of
loudness company compensation but I
think they are doing it what they are
pushing it too far
the bass is really too much that basic
radiators are at the back and if you put
it closer to a wall in a smaller room
that bass is just too much
it starts droning which we will try to
have a listen now we are in a small room
of my son I will put the Denon in via
Mini beside the Sony they are standing
closer to the wall now or common
positioning for speakers oh and many
people will probably place them like
that and we will have a listen how it
sounds in a smaller room I'm starting
again with the Sony
and the denim I think that the base is
just a bit too much
you also hear that it's not very clean
anymore the Sony
okay I hope I was helpful my video was
helpful I hope you liked it if you're
interested in the Sony well it's a
decent performer for lower levels but
they're increasing volume past half
because it will distort I'm not sure if
it's really the best speaker
how many claim it's a decent speaker but
with lots of limitations thanks for
watching and bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
