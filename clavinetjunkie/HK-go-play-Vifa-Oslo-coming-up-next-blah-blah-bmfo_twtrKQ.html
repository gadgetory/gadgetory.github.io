video about the new Harman Kardon going
play also what's coming up next some of
you already noticed that I had taken
down all videos including the Harman
Kardon go and play that I did before
well because of Harman Kardon they asked
me to do so I am not sure about the
exact reasons but I think some more
official more important reviewers than
me complained that I put them up so
early I think they have contracts with
Harman Kardon which I don't but in the
meantime it's already available at least
in Europe and I ordered and bought my
own device so I can put up whatever I
want without having to tell or ask
anyone we will do of course an unboxing
also we will try doing a linking a
sterile inking of both Hammond Colin
calls this dual sound so we would check
out how this sounds I will of course put
my videos up again I think the Harman
Kardon go and play is definitely one of
the best sounding devices in this class
and price range in Europe it cost 299
euros I'm not sure about America because
the price is still $4.99 this is too
expensive I think either an error or
Harman Kardon tries to rip off their US
customers there is no other speaker I've
heard so far which can really compete
with the go and play regarding sound and
and also spaciousness and so on of
course there are loudest because like
that either X s9 or I don't know even
the clips KMC 3 is louder but it doesn't
sound that great the only one is the
FIFA Oslo that I have here this sounds
even better especially in terms of high
fidelity but despite being able to play
louder it doesn't remain as restrained
as the going play you can crank this to
maximum and you still get this punchy
bass sound
this starts tool to fall apart a bit
sound wise at higher levels but for
everyday listening the FIFA Oslo is
great and will of course do also in a
comparison between these two the FIFA is
smaller it's also one kilogram
lighter so really impressive what
if I managed so far but this is not a
boombox so it's not a speaker for going
out and doing some party there are
better speaker for this but yeah so stay
tuned I will of course also do
comparisons of the Oslo against the FIFA
Helsinki or so against the larger FIFA
Copenhagen please give me some time ah
but now well I will put up my hammock
card on videos again so please enjoy and
stay tuned for more thanks for watching
have a nice time and bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
