just very shortly as I have the run of the house
in some minutes my people will be back
I have just finished my video of the Neumanns and iLouds
and I thought I will use the time to turn up the Teufel Ultima 40 Aktiv a bit
last time I couldn't because of my son
but now I am alone and we can push them
they are not standing ideal, and although the room is quite large there are not that many options
therefore I am more a fan of small speakers
but let's have a listen
of course you must listen with headphones, this is a binaural recording
I mention it again and again, but I get comments repeatedly like this:
&quot;I heard this with my JBL Xtreme&quot;
yeah, but then this is not what you should hear in reality!
yeah, I will turn them up and let's listen to the first track
I will stand a bit closer to you
obviosuly we are standing here in quite a big room mode
you can hear the bass...
we should almost turn bass back a bit
maybe something like that
that's of course not maximum
it goes way louder, but...
maybe this
I noticed Bluetooth is a bit... hmm
but otherwise sounds really nice
maybe this here
the whole room vibrates
yeah everything vibrates
what else do I have here?
maybe something slower?
I also don't want too long in order not to bore you
simply so that you can hear how this sounds in a big room
as mentioned placement is not ideal
but I have hardly any better option
what I miss a bit with these speakers...
I wanted something else, what's this?
as soon as you turn volume up, you get some real power
but below a certain level, there doesn't come much
especially if you want to listen as some background
I even think the Audio Pro here would sound better
I will attach them, because it is still a mess
you will hear, they do not sound really worse
the remote control should be somewhere
that would be it for now
I think also my memory card is becoming full
I don't have much space
yeah, I only wanted to show you the Teufel Ultima 40 Aktiv again
or &quot;active&quot;, depending on...
I like them a lot, of course with some limitations
I miss a bit the sound quality at low levels
then they do not sound that thrilling
for such a loudness level, I really find the Audio Pro more interesting
and as mentioned, Bluetooth seems to cause some problems
I noticed it, but I have to check this more in detail
of course there will be a full review soon
I hope I can get something similar so that they become more comparable
because I have nothing in this size
yeah, I hope I didn't bore you, ciao, see you!</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
