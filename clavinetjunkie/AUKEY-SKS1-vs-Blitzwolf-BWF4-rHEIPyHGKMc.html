take a quick look at that okay SKS one
you can see looks quite a bit like their
bluetooth f4 just with a different color
or surprises similar currently on Amazon
they're okay cause for $50 that leads
off I think 55 or 56 and I have another
one from the series this is the X power
P t-28s if you have a cheaper with 46
sometime ago I also needed an easy act
PT 28 s currently I haven't found it on
Amazon but all of them have in common
with this as well as the same speaker
just tuned a bit differently all with
different features like this X star here
this SD card playback there is also an
app which lets you control the speaker
remotely and adjust some song settings
unfortunately the Expo is the only one
who doesn't have dynamic bass boost
followings all the others have some kind
of yeah loudness compensation you can
compare them all through my speaker
audio database you will notice that all
of them sound quite similar just a bit
different treble or different base so
the okay sounds definitely comparable to
the Bluetooth but the biggest difference
is that bass is not as pronounced as on
AB little so we can maybe check out some
frequency response measurements you can
see the okay and the bleats wolf has
more bass books especially more lower
bass treble looks a little bit smoother
on there okay the Bluetooth f4 has a
stronger boost in the process region of
7 8 kilohertz so overall the okay would
sound smooth adjust with a little bit
less bass at low levels you can see
their story continues that okay simply
has less bass or not so much lower base
at high levels they are mall is the same
with the okay still having less space
but also a bit less Distortion we can
make the overlay all for that one so if
the okay deplete off the X power and be
easy ik so you see all of them are mall
as the same just tuned a bit differently
of course I would like to show you how
this okay sounds in reality especially
compared against the splitsville f4 here
I will turn it on and as always i'm of
course using binaural microphones
therefore you should listen with
headphones let's play some tunes and
check out if the differences in bass are
really that pronounced i will start with
the okay and the biggest difference is
that volume is in sync here while there
is wolf has
volume control for yes speaker and
player so let's that would be okay if
you see volume changes also on the
iPhone which of course is nice although
maybe the very first volume step could
be a bit software that you can hear
sounds like a few not up maybe a bit
smoother from the travel and that will
happen if we reduce volume you can hear
that both boost bass but this still
sound a bit thinner difference is maybe
not as big
but it's typically here at all
I will increase volume a little bit
the people I have to increase it here
Phyllis to me sustain it to me give me
your life but the life gossip topic
these purses in the okay beautiful ooh
boss man biscuit man Norma Bates here is
to be as a try to make sense out making
my fans can never be good to me
I will try increasing volume to mixing
media so we hacked the entire northern
range available
let's try this track here you should
hear a big metal punch for a little f4
I'll end with dinner
leaving it checked and at maximum volume
this wolf will have a bit more
distortion because of the strong a bass
boost oh this is the okay now playing at
maximum
so yeah the difference between these two
is not as big but I definitely prefer
that this wolf f4 usually you won't play
that maximum that awesome and economic
levels it has some very advantage for
sure so it depends I mean it still more
as the same speaker just that the diesel
has a bit more base color is of course
nice but apart from that there are not
really that many differences
yeah please check them out again you
might speak on your database maybe you
will hear it better the difference with
some other tracks it's definitely nice
speaker for 50 dollars better than this
empower I reviewed recently or many
others in near costing $50 like this I
clever this has a nice sound
although the lower based part could be
boosted more just like on that beats
wolf still I think the X power would
have the best tuning just that it
doesn't have any basic just me follow
levels I would definitely recommend the
X bar most not sure about this tseebo a
20 which is the fifth speaker in the
series maybe someone has heard it and
can tell me if this sounds best better
or worse than this I'm also not really
this tseebo has SD card player acts like
the like this one here it would be
interesting to find the very best one
out of these I would still probably go
for the Blitz office the best rounder
the easy ik had some quality issues
distortions and treble was quite a bit
off although bass was best it doesn't
or it didn't have this this upper bass
boost but the lower base from the X
power so yeah hope I could give you an
idea about the okay ska s1 yeah it's
small as the same as the Beatles just
with less space so thanks a lot for
watching and see you in the next video
have a nice time and bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
