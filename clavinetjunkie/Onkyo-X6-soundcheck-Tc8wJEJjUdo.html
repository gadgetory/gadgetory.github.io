check out the onkyo x6 we've already
heard the x9 some time ago and although
a pretty decent speaker it was nothing
particularly outstanding thanks to the
friend of mine who works at Gibbs
innovations I was able to borrow this
from him so here you have it it looks
pretty nice with this aluminum finish
here this is some rubber stripe with the
control elements power play
- plus obviously it supports multi
pairing at the back you have charging
out but it needs a proprietary charger
so no USB charging here and before
having a listen I thought we will have a
look at some frequency response
measurements of this speaker here you
have some at different volume levels and
you can see that it measures quite
nicely with some treble boost and the
bass reaches down to about 70 Hertz but
it already rolls off at around 200 Hertz
so it's not a very bass heavy speaker
and it also misses some well loudness
compensation so for low levels you don't
get any bass boost and it tends to sound
a little bit tinny I thought I would
like to show you how it sounds let's
turn it on first you have to keep the
depressed for some seconds these are the
welcome tones yeah more or less the same
tones you get from all the chips because
for $30 or something and I thought we'll
compare it against the top class leader
the JBL charge 3 as always i'm of course
using binaural microphones so you should
listen with headphones i will start with
the uncle x6 first so let's have a
listen
I was wrong goodness you
like a special
you can hear a fuller sound but also
just the treble sounds a bit recessed
down take six sounds clearer also
because of this treble boost
No
trust Regan it gives a little bit of a
public impression
although the bass is much better here
maybe huh track from so persona it has
some nice clarity but we'll get along
with more bass is a keeper but I'm
watching me so the treble becomes a bit
muffled from above whilst the onkyo
sounds pretty nicely
another track from Sanchez ah it's more
in line with speakers like the denim via
mini it doesn't have this punchy sound
of the charge three
yeah the weakness of the charged is
definitely treble response otherwise it
would be yet a top speak I need this but
it seemed to missus this refinement this
sounds a bit more convincing that's for
something else let's see how loud they
can play
I will turn volume to maximum yeah not
very loud they charge free as well this
is quite a difference
okay again it can't compete laughing
sighs this is completely this is really
an excellent doesn't go in order just
figured they are also much more country
there are some bull complain that the
charge tree doesn't have any bass at
maximum that it loses all bass but I
think it's still pretty pretty punchy as
you can hear compared to the onkyo it's
Madden Bay
so maybe let's compare it against the
reverse instead the reverse will of
course play in power mode so let's have
a listen how this to compare starting
again with the onkyo x6
they also hear their treble booster is
not bad on the x6 it really helps to
make the sound a bit clearer more
sparkling the reverse sounds a bit
muffled compared a little deeper and
more bass but the overall sound is not
lesson from the x6
Oh
Patrick very nice clarity here it's not
directional pad
it's simply missing some scription takes
a bit of time maybe let's try lower
levels I will reduce volume so you can
hear that the pace is slightly missing
the river should sound fatter yeat it
could get along with more bass at low
levels let's increase volume again
you can see we are already closer to
maximum here the cpt code is because I'm
not very loud let's try an electric also
soul persona now in reality this is Sol
Felicia the relays if you remember the
reverse was class leader some months ago
but yet times have changed and a great
speaker up half a year ago becomes yeah
we can't be underwater
biggest difference is definitely treble
here let's fan out effect
maybe sir home
I still prefer the clearer some of the
next signal
let's see how long I can play
and I will tell the river is the maximum
uncle Sikhs as well
yeah there is some compression and maybe
the reverse is less processed but
loudness Wives not that much difference
it sounds eminently fuller and
uncompressed
you have some dynamic compression from
the exist
but I think it still sounds better than
the whole solving minute maximum that's
right okay yeah really not that much
difference yeah always take some sexy
even near the river esk appears louder
the older and more punching no effect a
sounds a little bit lost and ridiculous
that both are not really loud speakers
you can get more punch here but also a
little bit more covered x6 again yeah so
if you want highest loudness both are
definitely not that great but still I
think the x6 is a decent speaker well
maybe a bit overpriced I think the
original price should be hundred ninety
nine so for this price it's a bit
questionable but for 130 maybe even if
it goes down 200 it's definitely nice
only problem I see is ya know charging
through microUSB and there is no battery
indicator so I have no idea
I cut it without charging device or I
don't know if it will play any longer
but at least we managed this video here
yeah maybe I will also be able to grab
the uncle x3 and the T 3 from my friend
he tries to organize them but just like
with the with the X 9 X 6 is decent but
nothing particularly outstanding for any
anyone who likes that brand why not but
you can definitely get better speakers
for less I hope this was helpful to give
you an idea about the speaker yeah I
like it but I'm not impressed let's
let's say it like that
thanks for watching have a nice time and
bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
