to try out if the GBL pati books will
become louder more powerful when run
from a car battery it comes with this
cable here so this is included this is
for the cigarette lighter and according
to the specs its rated with 120 watts of
power but when we run from battery it
reduces volume by three 3.5 DB so it
should be around 60 watts I'm not quite
sure I haven't tried it out but I
thought we'll do this now I will set up
the camera and microphone you are
already listening to a binaural
microphone around 1050 meters away
and then I will play some music and
attach it to the cigarette lighter later
on so we can hopefully hear if there is
some difference
I will also set up my SPL meter so we
can later on make some SPL measurements
if it became louder I think we got 100
7.1 out to us so with the same track it
should be more than Howerton hopefully
yeah as always please listen with
headphones this is a banal recording and
let's check it out so you are more or
less 10 meters away now the SPL meter
setup is exactly one meter distance from
the speaker measuring unweighted just
like last time so we can hopefully get
some comparable values you can see there
is quite long I think about three maybe
even four meters so you could even set
up the speaker far away from the car but
let's do it like this I will play a tune
cranky to make some first from battery
and later on I will try it with the wire
so let's go
yeah a real quick there was some
difference
I could definitely hear some when I
attached it to AC power
so maybe the 12 volts are not enough but
let's iron out right yeah what
I'm really not sure so when V strikes
the SPL meter showed 106.7 I will leave
it attached and let's try the other
track the one we used for the experiment
of the diamond box and if there is some
difference yeah we know it otherwise
we still are at 107 point zero now so
yeah obviously it doesn't reach full
power even when I'm from from a car
battery from 12 volt it needs there 220
volts to achieve other 20 Watts then it
will become 33.5 DB louder you can also
get a little bit more powerful play with
full power but it doesn't so it still
just halogen yeah sorry to disappoint
you I didn't try it before so the first
time I attached it to my car it was
working because the cable there is some
LED that it was lit so get some power
obviously not enough oh yeah my last
video with the GBO party box I hope you
liked it I hope I covered everything but
it doesn't get full power hundred twenty
watts when one from car battery you need
to attach it to means so thanks for
watching and see you the next year bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
