to the more detailed look at the
creative Nouveau to see yes we'll
probably spoil the last plane missing
test a little bit but many seem to like
it
and as I haven't done any review yet we
should do this now you can see quite a
small become comparable to the JDL goal
but their goal is a Desilu flag system
this has a bessa freighter here at the
back also behind the flap you can see it
offers microSD playback yet which is
also nice and another nice feature is
that it can be paired with another one
for stereo so if you have to you can
tell them and have stereo sound or not
many smalls because offer this and here
I thought we should check it out how it
sounds so I'm going to turn it on these
are the well compounds usual for
creating speakers and assault we'll
compare it against my personal favorite
they show me which you can see is maybe
slightly larger but also slimmer proof
it implant pocket and maybe you notice
here this time I'm trying to film with
my main camera yes it's a bit crazy to
mount this on my head but I thought
these are so small so little for me
maybe a little bit otherwise it will be
tiny in the on the screen so let's have
a listen I will start with the creative
neo to see first and then switch over to
the Sharmini so please have a listen
according the volume below half
the important here here with a lot of
distortion and also quite as readily
found maybe not attract again this is
called inter modulation so the strong
base already effect effect so it's all
the other frequencies the show me
so it's not really quite listenable if
you cancel music so with lots of tracks
you get this problem let's try another
tech you can give it a show me clay
private clearance it just needed more
 reality to a more balanced
and pick motorcyle is using volumes to
seal it a more background kind of
listening I will do this from the show
me it will and you can hear that the
nouveau doesn't have any loudness
compensation so at low levels despite
some nice response it tends to sound yes
martini and the volume curve all is
quite a bit strange because it comes out
pretty quickly again not that much
repeat again the distortion is really a
bit overwhelming
that's something else you can hear it
all the time as full as you increase
volume from notches with a undistorted
direct comparison comparison there show
me sounds muffled yeah it's much closer
to the original sound we can have maybe
a look at some frequency response
measurements and you can see the
creative Nouveau at a higher level and
although balanced there is some really
strong trail boosts you can see a peak
at around 13 kilo Hertz this is around
15 DB so this obviously is the problem
as the treble is boosted so much that
together with the bass boost for the
small speaker it cannot handle both we
can also have a look at lower levels and
you can see that they're new or remains
always the same it has some response
down to 100 Hertz and slightly below but
the show me me in contrast to this has
some others compensation so at low
levels it will sound fuller let's try
nearly another track again starting with
a creative mover to see first
you can be here some other kind of
distortion the paestum is completely
distorted here show me and the treble is
quite a bit excited we're gonna try some
house track
you're a bit more punchy and maybe let's
check them at maximum so I will end up
and go away be Prada this is a show me
me no I created and yeah I will try
crazy volume this is maximum now show me
as well maximum the middle slightly
louder but also quite a bit more punchy
and cleaner the showman
another fact you can see quite a bit
here not right you can definitely hear
some compression limiting here this
folks together is much better from house
and economical enough to help us yeah
they've found quite a bit more force so
that creative has definitely better
based and most others most because but
it's not quite there this strong
intermodulation distortion and yeah
distorted sound all makes it quite
subpar especially together with this
boosted treble which yeah makes the
sounds really harsh I still think that
the Xiaomi is a much better deal you get
the same functions except they're
appearing and the sound is also way
better especially at low levels this
sounds really mature while this cannot
give you quite this yeah let's turn it
off again to hear because the typical
sound of the co not the IRA series so
yeah yeah I hope this could give you an
idea and also yeah check the language
thing test again now you should really
know which one is the creative which one
if they show me
I mean without this distortion this
would be really a great speaker but it
distorts too much for my taste
yeah with every track I tried there is
some some dirtiness in some scratching
so I don't like it quite not quite a lot
was always has definitely better bass
response than the JBL call and all the
others so yes I hope the
could give an idea about their creative
you want to see a better idea we are not
sure about the camera the first time I
was smart again and yeah not sure about
the image stabilization because it has
image stabilization built in as you can
see it was quite a bit yeah we'll have
to see but at least no fisheye
Distortion therefore let's see if I will
continue using this camera it that's a
little bit because I think the whole
setup is half a kilogram so mounted on
my head but tell me if you liked it I've
seen it in 4k although I'm a I noticed
that 4k seems to be only available
through Chrome now on YouTube all my
videos when watched through Firefox or
some other browser are only a little up
to 1440p but 2160p is only level within
Chrome not no idea why I already
contacted YouTube wise this but so far
yet the only solution was yes try it
with chrome so if you want to see them
in full resolution yet check them in
chrome yes nothing else to say my
speaker but need some improvement to
really shine because I will own some
different colors and not that cheap 50
dollars I think this can be found for
less so have a nice time consider this
my live view here to the iPad so at
least I know what I'm feeling
otherwise I could feel yes no yes see in
the next video some surprises coming up
hope maybe even come tomorrow or after
tomorrow
otherwise next week stay tuned and bye
bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
