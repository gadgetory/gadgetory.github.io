say not really late but dark the current
summer gives more the impression of the
winter but still I wanted to do this
unboxing together maybe remember some
months ago I did a kind of blind
listening test of a mysterious prototype
speaker so this is the prototype speaker
but now it became a final version you
can see here it was from TOEFL and this
is the new boyfriend M star pro we only
did some listening against the Bose
Soundlink mini back then also against
the beats pill glass thought it was
still a prototype so it was not finished
there were still some issues this is the
final version so let's hope yeah it
won't have any shoes anymore and the
sound is also tuned for final sound yeah
before well I didn't complain but I told
them yeah there were some effects I
didn't like that much about the speaker
and powerful told me that they fixed
everything for the final version so
let's have a look and also have a listen
the only thing that really changed is
that price at the beginning I told you
it will be below 200 euros but now and
it's offered it costs 229 so more in
comparable to the river yes maybe well
if you look at my hey you need yeah you
see it got at the end this is when
portable speakers are not really meant
to be portable you know you see this
glossy finish here the grill is not
really stable so if you put it into some
rucksack with other objects things like
that can happen this happened to me with
the Bose Soundlink mini as well I also
got a dent there for portable speakers
should be portable more rugged like for
example the JBL charge 3 or the fugu
fugu XL and so on these are really
portable speakers that you can toss
somewhere and they shouldn't damaged but
now let's have a look at this for
advanced a pro let's put this away
typical Thai food packaging similar to
the Rockstar excess which also hurt so
how to open this either I'm too stupid
or no and also size wise quite
comparable to their URLs the eunuch I
have before was okay
unit I had before was black
this one is silver so you can get it in
silver or black color or a so now here
this so you can see size-wise yeah not
really that much different I hope you
can see it it's a bit dark it has two
passive radiators yeah
two drivers and the new feature is how
does I feel call it it's still
enhancing algorithm that I think they
call it Dinah more this is their own
very enhancing already yeah there is a
charging hood also a cradle as you can
see so you can have a look at this one
too let's put this away here so for home
use you just dip it into the scroll here
for charging like this obviously like
this similar to the Oh something mini
the first version because the second one
didn't come with cradle anymore but you
can also charge it normally through
micro USB as you can see so I hope there
is still some charge left yeah maybe you
remember I had it like that and when
turned on it should was it here there
was some glowing some red glowing
therefore people immediately knew this
is the dempster brought some headed
guests immediately others thought it is
some mysterious kind of I don't know JBL
speaker let's see if I can find it in my
bluetooth list no obviously I have to
force pairing
yeah no toy for them start pro with my
my iPhone is a bit too too bright maybe
for the camera and I should be may be
connected toy for M star oh here it is
and I thought we will have a listen also
try this stereo enhancing algorithm
dynamo and I thought this should work
well with ya with more mmm it's a
natural sound with natural recordings
that have some stereo separation so
let's listen to some jazz track
obviously here volume is not in sync so
maybe better keep the speaker at maximum
and turn volume from iPhone so this is
normal without any stare enhancing and
now you can immediately hear how it
broadens up the sound there is really an
impressive difference and it's doesn't
fall apart when I move my head which is
quite impressive
you can hear that guitar somewhere here
to the piano over there
and now it collapses back again I think
the effect is really really convincing
let's try maybe the river is just for
comparison I also turned on surround
here well not really that much
difference between surround on half
here you have really really spacious
sound just as impressive as it was in
the in the blind or covered listening
test I think this should be left on for
forever why turn it off it sounds really
great with maybe let's try another track
yeah I I mean I I have the impression as
if there were some speakers standing
over there and it sounds really
impressive also from you don't seem to
have any sweet spot for example the demo
and buy a mini you have to sit let's say
around one meter away because otherwise
the effect disappears but here it
doesn't seem to change a lot so which is
really really impressive let's try again
the river
yes sounds quite a bit different I think
the selling feature is definitely dynamo
or let's say boyfriend stereo enhancing
algorithm let's try something else
you know when closing my eyes yeah let's
try it
when closing my eyes I have the
impression
Isildur as if there were two speakers
standing while here you can definitely
well focus with closed eyes I can
immediately say it's current coming over
from here I will switch over to the
Webster program and here I get this
sound clouds floating along which is
really impressive
it doesn't really make sense to turn
dynamo office it sounds so great with
something else maybe Wow
yeah I'm feeling hearing the sound
somewhere and what's also great is that
the that hooves bump them instagrams 11
Dempster Pro is not very directional so
you can hear I can also listen to it
from behind this is not quite possible
with the river as it loses the the
definition it has side drivers but the
main driver is at the front
Sachi Sachi home 11:30 Cabrera to
medical care occurred sometime yes
hunters to the elitist the maturation of
them Chalmers
it's activate them did he wrote lies
data of them man of the Mandan of the
Mandan of demand on men of him and
another yard on Leith the Orbison on the
waves man did annoyed that man named
Phoebe Lloyd fit buckets energy like
that shot that Sashi either we are and
he shot the still time
yeah I mean is the difference you can
see not my not much not much not where
yeah you can hear how the sound road and
stop even from some distance with not
mine not mine
what mark
you're so fast our kitchen looks firmer
unlock my hasta la vista
danke Schoen none last and it's like
that Nanak did the under a vivid Oh
Katya super danke Schoen thank Ann
Kuster Sean so I think the effect is
really really this is the river as now
although you get also some slides
enhance reverb effect so it's Familia
now track I will increase volume
slightly the river is also well also
playing at mixing already so let's
increase the defense Pro it's
this is a track from Sanchez er which
has already within the recording quite
extreme stereotypes about upper treble
seems better defined from the river is
slightly elevated seems to have pepper
treble extension although here I can
also hear some echo effect on Tony from
restaurant succession here is extreme
pain
the one part is playing completely
beside me
the river is you can listen to the
question so reverse sound slightly more
full-bodied maybe but it's much more
mono sounding the Walker is floating
somewhere here
now she comes to meet with traits of
Maxima of home come on it from midnight
and then unitless tomorrow sneak
Comaneci the flood and I will turn both
again for maximum let's try this track
this is a gangster promo
every bias there is a bit more of
compression but it's also quite a bit
louder
so yeah it's quite an impressive speaker
I mean definitely not for making party
maybe or well not some face heavy
boombox
but it's really impressive
you might want to rethink the summer has
ended Sita
come on opening song Shama my summer
hear how my viscosity has ended Sita
obeah give us ratandas how much ambition
by topic as you turned us on this
tracker hunt Hannah Teter lie serviettes
haha louder no but it becomes really
much broader sounding so yeah let's turn
it off I mean this is nice feature but I
think most people will probably prefer
to control volume directly from their
devices so in case of the dempster pro
it's not synced with the iPhone which
can be of course great or not so great
but I usually prefer murad volume
control so that you don't have to well
if I have volume turned down here and I
want to increase it from my iPhone I
have to stand up and so on so it's
better to have just one master volume
super gay
don't be shy did my nose segment then
all started in Pumbaa okay now SOPA so
this was a first impression and unboxing
of the Dempster Pro the review will be
in German although yeah I won't talk
that much maybe some frequency response
measurements some samples maybe also
compared it against their dealing by a
mini which also has some nice they're
enhancing but definitely not as
convincing as the dempster pro unless
it's Oscar shot at last mr. Hinton cuts
are in Oh pshaw he can stop her shutting
de sister yeah Chuck and aaseesh are to
this so we will do the review in German
as always with
products although many complain that
it's not in English but joyful is a
German company with most consumers from
Germany I think the major part is from
Germany so also Austria Britain and
everything else is rather yeah marginal
let's say I think it's a nice speaker if
you if you like this spatial spacious
sound it's not for everyone maybe so
it's not a bass heavy speaker not not
really comparable to the GBA charge 3 or
other boom boxes let's say but for
acoustic lovers that really like stellar
sound they will probably love the total
Dempster Pro I mean I'm really sure so
stay tuned for more coming up and I hope
you like this a bit rushed unboxing it
just arrived today and I didn't want to
wait but the weather is so horrible
outside it's raining all day although we
have August it's not really summer is
versus the dream you see the community
arose the city pacified the autonomous -
yeah
you know so thanks a lot for watching
and yeah we'll see us in the next video
bye bye
take care</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
