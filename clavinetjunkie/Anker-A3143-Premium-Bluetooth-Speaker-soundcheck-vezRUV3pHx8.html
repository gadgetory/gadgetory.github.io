some kind of interesting low-budget
solution this is the anchor premium
bluetooth speaker also called a 3143
this speaker cost around fifty nine
dollars or Euros and it competes
directly with the shark boombox which
costs exactly the same
also the Linville Mass the pro costs the
same but I rather think that it would
like to compete with the Bose Soundlink
mini which costs three times as much and
I think if we have a look at the
frequency response graph it's really in
a different category than the shark or
the thimble because you can see some
bass response down to sixty Hertz which
is impressive I mean you get a dip at
six kilohertz which makes the sound a
little bit muffled but you can help with
a little bit of EQ we will try that
later on apart from that it's a pretty
interesting speaker it plays pretty loud
there is not much distortion and I think
it's for $59 you will hardly get
anything better therefore I thought we
will have a short listen to the speaker
this time I will play some tracks of the
new and just released album from soul
persona called momentum and as always I
will be using my binaural microphones
for the recording so please put up your
headphones for the best results and have
a listen so let's turn it on and as you
can hear it already tries to show off a
bit of its bass capabilities and let's
play a song
yeah you can maybe hear if it sounds a
little bit covered but we can help you
with a bit of it here I will raise six
kilohertz around 6 7 DB with the cue
it sounds clearer you can see 6 kilo
Hertz around 80 degrees
again without and for secure
but of course you would like to know how
it compares against some others because
therefore let's put it against the
highly rated shock boom box well I don't
think it's so great but we will see and
hear and I'll start again with the with
the anchor again a song from so personas
new album this is without EQ by the way
yeah a small speaker with small sounds
at low levels this difference even
increases because because the anchor
adds some bass boost you can hear that
it simply sounds much more full-bodied
much more ma√Ætre much more pleasant
this is yeah we could try this then well
masta pro it costs exactly the same I
think and I start again with the with
the anchor
let us would this would need even more
equalizer to sound good
the difference is more than obvious and
I think the most interesting part is how
it compares against the Bose Soundlink
mini let's have a listen to this again
Anka first you can already hear some
compression
but we could also do is remove the grill
it makes the sound a bit clearer just a
simple trick let's have a listen here
and suddenly the dose starts sounding a
bit strange
let's turn both maximum
maybe another trick
yeah suddenly that Bose doesn't sound as
good anymore yeah I think they're for
$59 or Euros this is a pretty impressive
speaker you can see the passive radiator
here the two drivers there is also a
passive radiator at the back so well for
$59 definitely highly recommended I hope
this was helpful for you to give you a
first impression how the Anker premium
bluetooth speaker sounds I think it's
really a nice speaker I mean one of the
best I've heard in this price range it
needs a bit of equalizer to sound even
better but I think it's definitely worth
it I mean the boss suddenly started
sounded a bit strange yeah thanks for
watching and see you in the next video
bye-bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
