present you a speaker that I received
yesterday it's called a soundbar or on
the packaging it says SL thousand s or
soul steering is on par with building
subwoofer and this caught my attention
thanks to one of my viewers who tried it
out and thought it's pretty decent the
cheapest price I found was on Aliexpress
for $36 but you can find the same
speaker a similar one from home but for
$80 which is of course much more
expensive so I ordered it from
Aliexpress and three weeks later I'd
arrived as you can see and I think 436
it's really a steel you can see it as
micro SD playback it can even playback
ape and uncompressed flag files which is
of course impressive and I thought we'll
have a listen how it sounds because
always I'm wearing binaural microphones
so please listen with headphones yeah
this is the first thing you have to live
with there are some voice prompts which
can be annoying to some and we will have
a listen to a track from princess
freesia so yeah let's get started the
speaker has three different sound modes
this is the normal or let's say music
mode it has a base mode
this Ghostface quite a lot maybe a bit
too much but the most interesting is the
3d mode it opens the sound really quite
a lot and another nice thing is needed
that you get these stones when
controlling volume with others if you
control it from from a speaker from the
iPhone they are always there but let's
try again the normal we have sounds a
bit boring the base mode is a bit too
basically I would say it also tends to
distort at higher levels for this 3d
mode is really incredible let's run on a
track and you can really do some deep
bass not just some upper bass boost but
really really deep bass down to around
60 50 Hertz we can maybe put the blitz
wolf f4 against it which yeah I raved
quite a lot about it but we will hear
how strange the blitz will suddenly
sounds I will start again with the I
sound bar
blitzwolfer
how about them and I don't know Bumi it
sounds really nice I mean if you
consider the price of $36 also check out
the stereo with here with this 3d mode
it's really impressive get a real
left-right separation a blitz wolf yes
there is not really that much left right
here maybe some smooth traffic
I like this openness it's it has some
nice deep bass but not overly boosted
it's wolf I mean it's not a hi-fi sound
but it's quite satisfying of course I
did some measurements so here we have
the normal mode then we have the base
mode and you can see the 3d mode yeah
it's not what I would call it flat
response but it's still pretty
satisfying also when looking at the
other volume steps you can see that
there is some nice bass boost at low
levels for the 3d mode and at higher
levels there is some bass reduction but
it's still well it's it's normal so I
think for $36 it's really an impressive
speaker let's try maybe another track
from a cj's park
blitz will figure it's completely
different starting over all this has a
plethora spawns it sounds just more
boring and maybe looks like the normal
mode again so even with the normal mode
their eyes on persons somehow better the
race mode is a bit too much
I would rather avoid it
and another interesting thing as I told
you is that it supports yeah it has
micro SD playback and the nice thing is
that that there is an app called sound
Bluetooth box and it can I will have to
connect with it and you can play back
all the songs from within the app which
is put into the impressive I mean so
these are the songs played from there
from the SD card I can also control
volume remotely here
or this is a flag file this is from SOPA
freesia of the flag and I can of course
switch back to to my Bluetooth mode and
we can continue listening the songs on
before but yes something is not right
with the volume controls because now it
works again so we are back in 3d mode
and let's switch over there let's once
again
it's a completely different sound
experience also imagine at low levels in
an office you have it standing in front
of you and get this incredible stainless
separation I think it's really
impressive for 36 hours it must be one
of the best I've heard maybe let's try
some techno track and let's see if it
distorted higher levels
I think it's placed cleaner with the
normal mode and I'm not sure it plays
really dead last I haven't tried it on
maximum yet so this is the Blitz wolf I
will turn it for maximum
the ice on bar there gets funneled
afloat although I think it was louder
there seems to be some problem with the
volume controller let's switch back to
normal no it's definitely not as loud as
the black blitz wolf but still I think
it's loud enough for most situations but
let's move yes in order
so loudness wise it cannot quite compete
but as I mentioned for placing it on
your work working place below the
monitor and display I will turn on you
can see there is this one is base mode
and the blue one
it's hardly visible the blue one is 3d
and we can try switching to tool there
is d cut back again again or there it's
in sync again there is really some
credible stereo so place like that in
front of you let's turn to normal mode
let's farm others spacious add base mode
the most impressive is definitely the 3d
mode
also nice a treble here was some classic
tune yes you can hear the entire
orchestra in front of you here we can
also switch modes here so we have music
bass and 3d let's switch back to music
it's fun you can hear it collapses why
3d makes it extremely broad yeah I mean
for what it is for I doubt you can get a
better speaker for $36 it's pretty
impressive and yeah it's not without
flaws I mean you have to like this tones
beep solid it's quite windy outside
today and the voice prompts are yeah
also a bit annoying but yeah apart from
that I mean you cannot ask for more for
$36 let's have a look at the packaging
again what does it says here yet what
makes audio processing here it says 60
Hertz but the bass response at low
levels you get it gets down to 50 Hertz
which is of course impressive what else
yeah makes waves makes bass makes treble
makes 3d I think yeah if you need a low
budget speaker that really sounds decent
not the loudest one you've heard the
Blitz will force quite a bit louder
I think the Bose Soundlink mini should
be slightly louder than this but you've
heard there was not made not much
compression it still sounded okay on
mixing at maximum I think this is really
decent for $36 I mean all the other crap
you get for this money this wipes the
floor with it it's not HiFi it's not
audio file or something but it's really
satisfying sound you get nice deep bass
and and this 3d stage is really
impressive so just wanted to present you
this very quickly of course I will add
it to the database as soon as poss
I'm currently you hear from my voice
maybe I'm a bit sick so I didn't want
but when I got this I was so surprised
and really impressed with it that I
wanted to share it with you
yeah Haley Express or then good has it
as well but you can see there are some
other some other ones who offer it for
37 one offers it 45036 3657 so the
cheapest one I got was 436 but you can
also order it from Amazon for what's
what's here for 79.5 9 so yeah but 436
this is really really a great speaker it
has some rubber feet I think it's a big
passive radiator with two drivers to the
sides so yeah nothing has to say about
it I hope you liked it hope it could
help you
yeah it's low-budget it's one of the
best definitely outperforming all the
others although it's not HiFi I mean
this is not something with a completely
flat response but it's really it's it's
great I mean it sounds okay
there is nothing off like for example of
many others because where you have some
boosted doesn't belong there although
this has a treble and bass boost so more
smiley responds it's still pretty pretty
decent and interesting so thanks a lot
for watching and yeah maybe if if I will
manage to do more videos with it
of course it's not any kind of reference
but it's great for what it is also
thanks to this SD card playback here put
in I don't know what the maximum size
it's not written anywhere but I think
put in the 64gb and and you can listen a
whole week without even touching the
phone although I think there are no
track controls you really have to
control it from the app from within the
app because here is just play and you
cannot skip tracks when playing from
from sdcard so the only way would be
using the app which is called yeah I
looked it up and it's a sound bar within
the iTunes store it's a Chinese app but
yeah works works well so again thanks a
lot for watching thanks for your
attention and see you in the next video
