to the Sony S on this x-77 especially
compared against FC fire stinky there is
some story behind this I saw a video
from Ellen Ross on YouTube who also
compared both and policing is we wanted
to make that FIFA work on purpose in
favour of the Sony he was talking about
the FIFA health stinky also his sound
comparison was a big question for me is
to always play the FIFA at neutral mode
while it makes him um he turned it to
late night you can usually do exactly
the opposite so in this video that Sony
appears fuller
he also claims it's louder than the FIFA
which is not quite true we had some
little dispute but meanwhile we settle
this so we are friends again but still I
have them at home at you might be
interested in my take on this because so
he definitely has some points as the
Sony is the cheapest speaker also has
much more features built in as Wi-Fi you
can see personalized Wi-Fi antenna not
sure why Sony had to make a design like
this prone to damage other Wi-Fi
speakers have been included but here you
have a network switch you can disable
Wi-Fi completely because usually this
will drain battery quite a lot the Sony
doesn't seem to have a market objective
in the FIFA even a bit worse it makes
him I got two hours thirty from the Sony
while being software the FIFA should
manage the same or even three hours so
you also have a wired network plug here
it can charge external devices and Sony
has an app which is called song pal this
has some settings yeah for streaming you
can stream from your network from to
airplay DLNA google cast or whatever so
it has really everything needs but it's
not as portable it close to two
kilograms also you see this is a glossy
finish here so yeah his model easily be
dented I have the FIFO always with me in
the back rack cycle and although it
doesn't look that new anymore if it's
not damaged any just a leather grip
looks a bit worn so the thief is smaller
it's the lighter speaker it's more
expensive but apart from that yeah
we would like to know how they sound I
already included the Sony in my speak
audio database Sony has different sound
settings to select from from the app and
with the default setting it sounds a
little bit off it sounds better with
sled EQ or even a customizable EQ or you
have five bands and I think you can
really make the sound pretty decent
therefore let's check out some frequency
response measurements and you can see
the Sony which it's neutral setting it's
quite nice there is some bass boost so
if you overlay the fifth I think it was
late night here you can see that the
bass which is equally deep on both just
at this moment is a little more boosted
treble is much better on the F I think
you can increase 12 lightly on the Sony
to get the sound closer to this but it
will always like upper trim quite a bit
I was quite a bit surprised that the
Sony doesn't adjust the sound for low
level so at low levels there is no
additional bass boost like it was on the
X 55 which had a really heavy sound for
low levels but the problem of the X 55
was that although it sounded great and
full body that low levels it couldn't
quite keep up if returned higher so it
distorted pretty quickly the Sony x-77
is much better in this regard so it's a
more powerful speaker but also hear lots
of these people facing is noticeable
already at higher volume you can hear
how Sony tries to squeeze dynamics but
still it bass becomes somehow out of
control and there is some distortion on
heavy tracks this is where the people
really shines it's always under control
you won't hear much DSP processing no
dynamic compression it is even at
maximum when played at neutral you will
get all the effects and kicks while the
sony squeezes out everything yeah I
would like to demonstrate you this as
always i'm using binaural microphones
and the head cam to give you a kind of
first-person view so please pull up your
headphones and let's have a listen first
I would play the Sony alone so you can
check some of the available tunings and
I will start to the tracks and focus on
a so please have a listen
yes it is the default tuning that you
get when you're unboxer speaker in the
compound abdicate clear audio flat so
totally toxic you left me quite a bit
both like with lots of boost in the
presentation but there are some other
settings for example flat yet become
Tosca as you increase volume again you
will hear that the stone is much better
more balanced without the strange book I
will switch back to R&amp;amp;B hip-hop and this
in years yes the others are not much
better for example rock
all right it becoming muffled somehow
with the top here but I think that is
the best one and you also have a cotton
cube in Q which will set like this gives
a bit more of a FIFA helping to found I
will switch back to class and I think
custom setting is in this case of the
small exciting
this is flat and another setting east
from kind of aerial widening which
doesn't work we need as well so it's a
normal and the highest setting so if I
switch it to high typically completed
machine really I don't know becomes
broader but talking to this town
desperate this sounds more directions
yes I get better now it would be a false
interesting to compare it against the C
files in game therefore let's put them
side-by-side I could yeah maybe place
the FIFA here on top but this vibrate
three like crazy so I'm a bit afraid
that it will fall down maybe and yeah
let's check another flag also from focus
on our yeah we are only at half volume
now and as you can hear this from
already stalls I will include volume
slightly campus comes worse and worse
well thank you
yet lasers completely in again and my
hope was just at least at low levels if
it sounds somehow yeah more full-bodied
or warmer than the Helsinki but you can
hear the difference is not really that
huge so it cannot really play great at
low level and at levels already close to
half it starts to distort there is sound
really horrible and unusable and the
other problem of the Sony step is quite
directional if I stand up and listen
from the back you can hear that yes
Trevor has wronged you completely why
are they helping key is hiding a little
more color still has some fabulous
yes perfect
he also here the space is completely out
of control
oh okay pika cannot play any base with
create from five we could try to do the
respectability for the F school you can
travel to the other turning my custom
tuning
the complete respect I think no
structures are helping to public bases a
lot of control
most respectful flag
maybe about fish over here having three
volumes likely again helping case and
these are really heavy loading tactic
not pretty strong muttering but they
help you place this without problem yeah
I think you can get a difference here
Patrick also from crack the politics
that distortion doesn't really go away
by decreased volume is that base is too
pushed back hard
that simply yet get out of control
till you can hear maybe that the FIFA
place much cleaner so let's increase
volume again so much more punchy doesn't
follow any attacks and seek
here the bass drum has already found not
a track called yeah I'm rattling and I
don't know
leave some other track here also if you
spot it mess here yeah the FIFA place
that was recorded while the Sony does
add some friendship technique means not
bad but simply completely out of control
it can handle this from day
another song oh wait let me try this
again is a fun
it doesn't really resemble the original
count of the based on the hell think
again here this is how the based on foot
sound yeah
really not that funny let's try an
electric and later on I will increase
volume connecting on both okay which one
can play way louder Alan Ross claim that
performance louder
art well let's see
we'll hear some commotion let's bend up
and I will switch the capacity for
neutral to me so we can really handle
next in volume so this is Johnny
connection
and
in the people difference is really
obvious maybe let's put them closer to
the TV set or wall so we will increase
maybe a slightly and some kind of rock
tracks again people sitting next to me
expenses and also maximum and you can
probably hear it
you
that's what we could also partly reverse
their full exponent so it becomes like
louder but also really hard found them
another fish
on the panel you can give some nice nice
bass hell thank you
pausing with a completely different
you know dynamic nothing other whispers
less but if you completely stop
keep again yes
no comparison that's right I will
Cortana Scott
not really no I think again there's out
slices I'll get fired
you order them what is the boundary that
is complain the cloud that is just some
fake neighborhood here aspect
you can hear a much more dynamic sound
from the factory a bit around 50 while
the shoaling start will follow it I
think so yeah
I think it'll quite obvious the phone it
sounded decent really close to the
health think especially when the sound
is adjusted to the song palate the
ponies yet it's not always under control
already at half volume it starts to
sound a bit strange compared to the
Helsinki losses dynamics and so on I
think that these drivers are simply not
that great they're pushed hard with DSP
but cannot handle this
why the hell think he doesn't have that
much these people facing the probably
much better drivers and in FIFA is a
driver company so they know what they
are doing
and you could hear it was twice as loud
while still keep keeping all the attacks
the cheeks and everything and the Sony
squeezed everything away distorting and
being maybe half as loud so yeah it
depends what you want for low levels
both are not that great although the
sonic sounds a little warmer it's still
not a sound I would really like for
really low level listening I prefer the
Sony HD one or other speakers so it's
not really that much better than the if
I think about if if I think he sounds
equal regardless he's played at maximum
or at low levels it doesn't change the
sound or dynamics while the Sony yeah
does apply different tricks to pretend
better sound you could with an external
tool you could definitely tune the if I
think if for more bass more bass book
for low levels from what I heard FIFA is
planning to add additional tunings yep
let's hope they will also add a real
bass boost tuning which should be
suitable for auto use addictions sounds
great at high volume without any
adjustment but for low levels I would
say the first four five volume steps
needed there could be more bass but I
was surprised by Sony didn't fare that
much better it sounds a little bit
warmer but not that much that I would
say it's better than the Helsinki leads
the cheapo speaker so Elmo sees right
you can find it on the used market for
around twenty two hundred euros or below
but for my
yeah it's not that great I prefer even
the hg1 for just low-level listening
it's smaller has the same function for
the Wi-Fi building it's just missing
airplay
this has airplay building so yeah yeah I
hope you liked this video I hope it
could give you an idea about the Sony XO
I know one was asking is this only
louder no it's not the fifth I think is
still one of the loudest speakers in
this size it's about as loud or even
louder than the Harman Kardon Onix to do
when played from battery while being
much smaller also playing much more
control than the Onyx to do which
distort a little bit the Helsinki place
cleaner yes so check them out again in
my speaker audio database I'm not sure
the default tuning suite that great I
prefer it definitely on flat or even
when the EQ is customized a little bit
you can add slightly two-level push mix
because meter scooped out slightly on
this so here check it out again for
example the Canton music box
s they are quite comparable I always
thought the compound was great but I
think the Sony sounds better for normal
levels but both become out of control
pretty quickly at higher levels which
the FIFA doesn't of course with
particular tracks that can be it's not
distortion it's rather some kind of
farting the particulars are built in
sandwich types it has to persuade us
here to here and they have some airflow
to a very thin slit so when there are
particular frequencies below 60 Hertz
there's obviously no no high-pass filter
so you will hear air coming out but this
is not distortion the drivers can handle
this it's just that because of space
they had probably to really stick the
Pacific Raiders together and yeah
another problem with this one is of
course it vibrates a lot it has to play
situated but only on one side so the
mass of the radiators makes the speaker
wobble quite a bit the fish I think it
doesn't this problem is both or let's
say all four cancel each other out so it
doesn't operate at all yes nothing else
to say both grades because I personally
definitely prefer
he fires it's the much more HiFi pickup
but this is great although some compared
to the real extreme which I quite
wouldn't is the trivial is simply a much
more powerful speaker it also distorts
but outdoors you crank it and it sounds
great it is cannot quite keep up so it's
yeah rather for indoors and at lower
levels but for low level Stara even
other and cheapest because like this HG
one quite small but very nicely
full-bodied sound so yeah thanks again
and see you in the next video
have a nice time it bye-bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
