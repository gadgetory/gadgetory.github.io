JBL connect feature
according to the quick guides and also
website of JBL JBL connect should allow
the connection of multiple speakers well
in reality multiple means - there was a
first video leaked of the JBL flip 3
which showed three speakers connected
together but an updated version of this
video showed only two speakers so if you
connect or if you try to connect three
speakers it won't work only two will
connect I'm not sure if they pulled this
feature because it caused problems or I
don't know but it would be great to be
able to connect even for five speakers
this way I think login Logitech is
supporting this and maybe some others
too so you can really wirelessly daisy
chain them right now this is not
possible you can only connect two
speakers that have this feature for
example you can connect one flip with
one JBL extreme so far no other JBL
speaker has this feature except these
two but first let's try connecting two
JBL flip three together um this is
pretty simple you have to of course turn
both on and here you see the JBL connect
button so press the button on both they
will jump into some own pairing mode you
hear them well some kind of sonner tone
and now they are connected and can play
you don't need this app there is an own
app it's called JBL connect but with
this with this app you can switch
between stereo mode or party mode i'm
not sure if you see it it's quite a bit
hard to judge with the head cam you can
see both the yellow flip and the flip
three i can rename it which i already
did mine is called yellow flip
in order to be able to differentiate I
don't know okay and you can switch
between party mode this is both speakers
are playing the same or stereo so one
speaker is playing the left the other
one the right channel you can also swept
them and this is all the functionality
you have with the app not nothing else
and the next time now we are in stereo
the next time you will connect them they
will stay in stereo so no need to start
the app again you can try playing some
music and listen how this sounds
I'm having binaural microphones so
you're ready here we have some stereo
sound stage I will turn off the right
speaker again and you will hear well
this is mono
we'll come back them again and now both
are playing in steer again let's put
them further apart one here the other
one here and you'll get quite an
impressive soundstage like this
they are also louder when playing
together in one single speaker well
that's sure but the connection remains
stable up to maybe four or five meters
but elevating them slightly hanging them
somewhere can increase the reach up to
maybe ten meters maybe even further
so this is stereo and we can of course
try connecting the JBL extreme to the
JBL flip three in this case only party
mode is possible
this means both speakers are playing the
same stereo signal and now you will ask
what kind of sense does it make to
connect one JBL cha extreme and one JBL
flip three well you can simulate a kind
of 360-degree sound source
well this is one way how to use them or
we can try something else I will hang
the okay switch the tracks we can try
hanging the flip three here for example
and then we will take the extreme down
to the pool we can hear it's already a
bit the reach is not that good anymore
we can try hanging it higher
and now we have music at the pool
and can I can lay down here and listen
to some music oh that's nice
alright go up and listen to music here
without the need of having to carry
speakers around yeah maybe I should have
turned it into my direction so you get a
kind of well not multi multi room but
yeah it's nice to have two speakers
connected like this and playing the same
music I will bring back the extreme
again
what I didn't show you is that you can
control volume from both speakers I can
reduce it here or increase here again
track changes are only possible with
what that speaker that you are connected
to for example I can switch tracks from
the flip 3 but I cannot do with the hit
stream I can only well change volume
from both or from the iPhone in case of
the iPhone they are
the volume is always in sync let's
simulate a 360-degree speaker again and
I can walk around them and have a Giga
bomb kind of speaker so let's have a
look into that again now it still shows
me the yellow flip and flip 3 which of
course is not true maybe we will have to
restart it
I hope you can see it from the from up
because somewhere we're asking what kind
of camera I'm using this is a small
mirrorless the Lumix G m1 with the kit
lens because this is pretty light setup
for for a head cam I kind of I can of
course switch lenses and take a much
wider angle one but it would be too
heavy for my head I tried it once but
the camera was shaking too much it's
already shaking now you can see the app
is a bit while it would need some update
because it's really slow it's
discovering speaker but after some time
a new text comes that you have to turn
down music and it the speaker cannot be
discovered blah blah yeah nothing
happens
it's not as straightforward as with
ultimate use and Logitech yeah this is
annoying really let's try the game
also JBL Connect is not always really
hundred percent stable I mean that was a
problem connecting to your GPS be
complete make sure your phone is
connected as a speaker and that the
speaker is not playing music okay now we
have the flip and we have the JBL
extreme but you have only party mode I
don't know what this lets okay I turned
it off that's cool
so this is all I can say about JBL
connect it works and if you get it
stable it works pretty well up to some
distance but the distance is limited you
already saw some interruptions when I
put the extreme down to the pool this is
about I think eight nine meters maybe
and hanging them or even setting them up
like this increases their range a little
bit but not by far I mean with four or
five meters you are quite on the on the
secure side to have a good connection
but everything beyond and you will
probably lose
let's try connecting the other flip
again for stereo I'm quite impressed
with the stereo feature because it
really improves the sound a lot let's
see if the app recognizes the the black
yeah it appeared here
let's switch to party mode that's not so
impressive like stereo and let's try
hanging them somewhere
okay and the black one are you here it's
already oh that's the problem because
I'm I'm connected with very yellow one
foot my phone I will leave the iPhone
here so maybe it should yeah it still
works and I'm feeling my garden with
music now
okay not much more to say about this
feature it's great and maybe not hundred
percent stable all the time but maybe
with some update it becomes better yeah
I hope this was helpful as always a
thumbs up if you liked it or not if you
didn't
let's see us in the next video until
then bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
