compare the new FIFA Oslo against the
new Harman Kardon going play yeah both
are new on the market and the both
already became what I would called the
best sounding portable speakers I've
heard many others including all the
Marshall stuff balls and so on but
nothing really comes close to this tool
it also depends what kind of music you
usually listen to if you prefer high or
low levels so you may like one or the
other more it also depends where you're
live so one or the other may be more
expensive for example the German Amazon
store has currently the blue FIFA Oslo
for 329 the Harman Kardon game play
costs $2.99 so they are quite comparable
just 30 euros difference if you if we
look at the size yet the FIFA also has
quite a bit of a smaller footprint so
you can really put it anywhere in your
kitchen this needs more place it's also
one kilogram heavier and as always I
thought who will listen to some tunes
I'm using binaural microphones so please
listen with headphones and first thing
you will notice is maybe that the Harman
Kardon has some hiss if I put my ear to
the FIFA there is nothing just silence
this is quite typical for the latest
again especially the Twitter's the
latest JBL Hammond cardones because also
the new Bang &amp;amp; Olufsen to play one has
some history with it or you don't like
it all FIFA speakers are close to silent
the Oslo is currently playing with late
night mode because the Hammond column
has quite a bit of a boosted sound so to
make them more comparable I switched
from neutral to late night and I will
start with the Oslo first
everything that you do we can play and
maybe you can new that it sounds quite a
bit more diffuse far not as direct as
the people
go and play again let's try maybe a rock
track and have a listen how well defined
the mids are from the people
click on play
the mix are slightly swallowed here
be free again
it sounds much clearer
let's find out right of course something
the people Oslo cannot quite produce is
any kind of soundstage the drivers are
so close one to each other that well you
get some slide stereo but nothing really
well strong the cosplay has a stronger
stellar separation complain oh but again
it sounds a little bit covered against a
keifa Aslan although it's really a great
sonic speaker but another frak again the
fifa oslo has really a typical high
fighting without any artificial
frequency response boost and so on it's
it measures nearly flat and you hear
this it sounds simply right click on
play you hear that the treble has some
slight sibilance and maybe also because
of the cover
I will try removing it maybe this will
make them more comparable FIFA but still
the treble is not really there another
trick
then
we have a point place seems to disperse
travel a bit better as the Twitter's
here to the sides
the FIFA is definitely more directional
yeah maybe let's try another track you
heard something is driving outside and
no some tractors
let's listen to this
you can play the other face has
definitely more punch here but this feel
sounds more realistic let's say let's
try this
something else now you can hear that
their pace from doesn't have that much
punch from the FIFA Oslo if I switch
over to the go and play have a listen
adjust that the overall frequency
response isn't quite right with the gone
flame I mean this great bass may be one
of the best bassist I've heard in this
size but let's at this and I will walk
around again
I will switch over to neutral tuning
and we can turn up volume slightly
higher click on play as well yeah
currently definitely sounds more fancy
let's try rock click again and I will
turn both the maximum
the gunplay as well
when play again
yeah there is some strong a directivity
from the fee for slaw it doesn't have
real tweeters just to full range drivers
which together with their with the
woofer produce all the sound let's try
this still voted maximum the complain
again
let's write this
play
yeah quite an extreme track let's try
this also both at maximum to see which
one can play louder this is a very
strong and hot mustard recording from
NCS
you can't play
they're the FIFA appears louder but the
gunplay remains more consistent from
from higher angles it's already
mentioned it depends quite a lot what
kind of music you usually prefer the
FIFA Oslo is hard to beat with acoustic
stuff also classics everything natural
while the Harman Kardon gunplay shines
with electronic stuff with really
powerful pumping recordings let's close
it again but maybe you could hear that
even without cover it didn't quite have
the resolution of the FIFA Oslo which
really has incredible clarity so yeah
depends if you are rather after a hi-fi
kind of sound or simply pumping bass
it's still it's not really high five but
it's nice tunes pker better than any
others including the KMC three or I
don't know even the IBEX s9 I prefer
that go in place and wise it's it's more
refined despite not having this high
fighting of the FIFA Oslo yeah I hope
this was helpful to give you an idea if
both similar priced yeah it's hard to
choose between one or the other
the thief also is definitely smaller and
has a smaller footprint so you can
easily put it into into some backpack
while this will be harder with the
current play it's not that hard I mean
in a larger backpack you can put also
this one battery is I think similar at
high levels both don't quite reach I
mean the Harman Kardon can't play played
for two and a half while this at maximum
played for around three hours so not
that great compared to many other boom
boxes which manage maybe four five six
hours like the toy foot boom stir that
played for six hours and thirty but
still yeah depends what you are looking
for and what your intention is I hope
you liked it yeah thanks for watching
and we will see us in the next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
