thought they shouldn't prevent us of
going out and doing some noise but first
let's talk about speakers in general
because the comments and questions I
always get on YouTube and well on my
blog are always the same people want the
speakers to be loud to have much base
and to be small the problem is you can
only have two of them for example the
speaker can be loud and small but it
won't have much bass it can be small
with much bass but then it won't be loud
and if it has much bass in this loud
then here you'll need a big speaker so
it's quite hard to find well a nice
compromise I think until now the JBL
extreme is such a compromise I mean it's
not too big it's loud and it has much
bass but well the bass is not really
deep it's quite a bit boosted so I
thought we should look somewhere else
and I have brought something here maybe
you can already see it it says mini Eric
so let's have a look inside so please
put up your headphones now and as you
can see there is something inside this
is the original mini coccyx and it's
built so that you can use the speaker's
already inside we have 1 min Eric this
is small and loud two are even louder
and this is the mini Eric's app which
gives us the bass I will close it again
so that we can hear how they sound
inside the bag later on I will take them
out and we'll compare it against the JBL
extreme now the obligatory saw us on a
track so let's have a listen
JBL you can carry the Luxor around of
course like this on some festival or
rave party or something the best Ichabod
is listed for me just mixing volume Oh
Bo door JBL
also maximum you can hear some
compression already of course it's more
interesting to take them out
here you can see the entire 2.1 mini rig
set up I'm connected to this one through
bluetooth I could also wirelessly
connect with this one for wireless
stereo but to avoid any interference
with the JBL I will connect them with
wires the sap has an input and an output
and place like this they give more of an
omnidirectional sound like this but to
be better comparable to the to the JBL i
will place them more like this okay now
can do some switching again i will turn
both to maximum that's pretty loud the
spikes then know that you'll see
tibialis well yes loses quite a bit also
lots of compression and quite a bit
louder
JBO
it appears half Islam
I don't go far away
yes maximum I cannot go louder this is
the JBL now they're cleaner sounds more
punchy bass somehow not as boosted let's
listen to something else again lyrics
first
yet sounds very boxy and not really loud
I will come closer again
boy whoa sounds very covetous let's
I'm interested how they sound of Texas I
mean these are tool broadband drivers
full range drivers so there are no
Twitter's inside the MINIX
the off-axis it loses a little bit but
still much cleaner and undistorted
compared to the JBL
next track is from the mini Eric
SoundCloud site it's a mini Eric mixtape
I took some tracks out of it that's
everything
yeah she really really lost now I mean
just imagine you can you can do basic
chaining with them in reeks you can add
two other ones with another sub and it
will become even louder
I like how deep the bass which is here
it's not boosted or booming simply
deeper bass
yeah in the bunker I think 7 8 meters
away data simply louder better cleaner
also a bit more expensive but it's
impressive how clean they play the JBL
found its new master it's pretty lost
against the lyric set up here I will go
away as far as I can without losing
Bluetooth reach let's see how far we can
get
I can just imagine another sub with two
mini eggs this will entertain the whole
village but it's not visible anyhow
everything is behind fog yeah now it's
becoming a bit with flip-up which we had
a mini accessible louder and more punchy
you fasting music by the way I could
even name the style but I listen to the
mix tapes the lyrics mixtapes and I
really liked what I heard so I cook some
breaks out of it I hope you enjoy this
left my chance against the
we are entertaining the whole forest
yeah
I hope the animals don't take this tool
seriously I think you can hear that the
GB of struggle settled it there is a
spice effect or maybe not price but
definitely 6 DB louder and
I love the deep bass it's really
impressive this video has nothing on
this bunch
okay what we could also do is placing
them more on the ground for even more
bass let's listen again when they become
quite a bit louder when to a plane
let's listen maybe for left right
not everyone listens to electroni
mother JVL yeah it's really struggling
you
no chance
I will reduce volume on the music as
well of course otherwise it will be
distorted and as you can see we can also
place them upright if you are sitting
around with your friends you will
probably have them like this
this is the JBL No
so yeah I think I know for one just let
me say that I'm really impressed I think
we've heard that this whole set up
easily outperformed the JBL
but already one single minaret sounds
pretty decent they improve the sound on
the Bluetooth version now it sounds
fuller more full-bodied at low levels
with better bass it's still very loud
louder than the UE boom but with better
sound no Distortion you can add another
one another sub well you can buy two
three subs and make a complete system
but I'm really impressed how well
everything works
also this rucksack is pretty well layout
as you can see you can put your mini
rigs here and then carry around this
whole setup with playing music yeah also
very nice is the sub is pretty light I
think it's half the weight or even less
than the JBL extreme this has more than
two kilograms the sub has maybe I don't
know six seven hundred grams or
something I think the entire setup is
still much lighter than the JBL so this
was just the first impression of course
I will do more comparisons and tests
with the mini Eric indoors but I hope
you liked it so far and yeah we will see
us in the next video thanks for watching
and bye bye
you
hi it's a big sis meet me but first
let's talk about speakers in general
because always people want the speakers
to be loud to have it you the speakers
can can be small and have much bass but
they won't be allowed they can be loud
and small but they won't have much bass
yeah and they can be big and the speaker
can be loud and small but it won't have
much bass it can be small with much bass
chest
a speaker can be loud and small but it
won't have much bass it can be small
with much bass but it won't be loud or
it can be loud with much bass but then
it will be big so yes and it can be
small and loud and here
chass√© lectures Vedanta it's quite hard
to find a golden well Center so because
we suffer then I think the best
compromise so far is still the JBL
extreme we've heard some well some other
speakers compared to the GBA extreme for
example the brave HD it was loud yeah
but it was not small and it didn't have
bass so yeah then we've heard the mega
boom yeah it's small but it has no base
yeah and it's loud so we have the
usual if you hit throat ah</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
