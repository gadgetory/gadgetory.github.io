onkyo x3 this one a brother over the x9
we've already heard and as you can see
they both share exactly the same design
at the back you can see both have their
Pasiphae Tazz totally exposed at the
front there is another one and in
contrast to the x6 you can see the x3
can be charged through microUSB it also
has a charging out but it looks like a
shrunken version of the x9 the x6 has a
totally different design and before
having a listen I thought you might be
interested in some frequency response
measurements here you can see some at
different loudness levels and it's
visible that the frequency response is
pretty natural without any boost but
there is some slight dip at 5 kilohertz
and although the treble doesn't reach
really high it still sounds pretty
decent and clear but it's also visible
that there is no loudness compensation
at low levels so at lower levels it will
definitely sound thinner than some other
speakers like those from Bose who boost
bass for low levels and of course I
thought you would like to know how the
sounds also may be compared to the
bigger brother so let's turn both on as
always I'm using binaural microphones
the only way to listen to binaural
recordings is through headphones
otherwise you won't get really true
results and I thought we will start with
a track from sole persona so both should
be connected now no this is the x3 nor
the x9 it always takes a little bit of
time for them to connect and I will
start with the x3 and a level which is
already closer to 2/3 so please have a
listen
here the x9 appears more punchy but the
x3 is not that bad sounds pretty natural
for me the treble has some phasing when
you move your head it's pretty obvious
with the x3 it sounds totally best on
axis let's try there x9 again it's fun
of as obvious
freeze
of course we should compare it more with
speakers that are in the same class so I
thought about the Denon environment here
one of my favorites and well a bit
cheaper I mean in Europe you can already
get it below 100 euros while this will
probably have a price of 170 so yeah
still let's have a listen how these two
compare and I will start with a more
funky track and the x3 playing first the
denim the meats are slightly more
pronounced on the denim
let's find out a crack
what the uncle cannot quite offer is the
sound stage of the Denon bio meaning it
uses some psychoacoustic processing to
enhance their stellar image it
definitely appears a bit to learn
let's try not a fag
you can hear this sounds much larger
much broader
look and drapes all but I mean it's not
bad it doesn't have any flaws it simply
sounds a bit different let's listen to
another vocal acoustic track so we can
hear how they both render vocals and
acoustic instruments your stories yes if
you clear our broader talking to me and
I'm thinking thinking how all this came
to doesn't sound bad but a little bit
more cover to maybe let's listen to
something else
it appears software may be but another
should be equal for both test isn't
another flag and it's a nice punchy
sound definitely on the high level
another fraction
also soul persona
we have the denim definitely something
more force here
you don't get these crazy effects with
their epidemic
you can hear how that travel changes
maybe let's listen at lower levels as
there is no loudness compensation it
should appear yeah quite a bit thinner
than the denim
yet the denim is definitely more based
at low limit it also appears clear so
let's increase volume again
and let's listen to our track and I will
increase volume even more we are close
to Mexico then I'm as well and let's try
mixing on cobalt there is not that much
difference it makes
let's try another trick all fire playing
at maximum we are not very loud yeah I
really couldn't select any winner here
they are both not very loud but yeah
maybe the x3 is a bit more punchy while
the demo miss Mamie slightly louder but
the difference is very really marginal
yeah the bass drum has definitely more
punch on the demo yeah maybe we should
try the JBL charge three no they should
be quite comparable the charge 3s may be
slightly larger but it also has more
features like being completely
waterproof and so on and let's listen
how these two compare I'm starting again
with the onkyo x3
yeah the treble sounds somehow nice
sauce on the XK about bass wise it has
no chance against HR 3 which ones much
for a much bigger tree again you the
treble sounds emphasized but
it doesn't really reach that high so it
gives a bit of air the sizzling
impression
let's fan out let's also listing from
off exosphere
this isn't well effect and I will
increase volume for maximum
you can hear some compression stopping
to kicking charge three as well maybe
not maximum but a rather comparable
level
you can hear that actually already
struggling slightly and I will increase
it to me
no trick
the difference is really obviously
yeah okay
you
you
this has no chance
Oh
yeah the X 3 is definitely decent I mean
it has a pretty smooth and natural
frequency response of course loudness
wise and also based on chance on it
cannot compete with the charge free but
compared to the Denon via me needs
so here heat compares pretty well I'm
just a bit worried about the prices yeah
I've heard it should cost hundred
seventy I mean you can get the denim via
mini way below 100 euros already the
charge three cost hundred seventy nine
in Europe while in in the US is it's
$149 so I am not quite sure if it can
really compete I mean it's nice it's
definitely a very nice speaker compared
to some other junk that is solved which
sounds really crappy it's not very loud
but for casual at home listening also
yeah I think it's it's really really
nice
nothing nothing special no game changer
but I definitely prefer the treble
response the smoother treble of this
compared to the JBL charge three
unfortunately the treble is not that
great on this but everything else is
definitely perfect I mean size battery
life weight and so on the ocular appears
a bit lighter yeah
comparable to the to the Denon maybe so
I'm not sure if it will appear on all
markets all over the world I've heard
that it won't appear in Europe because
we already have the X 6 so they are
maybe too similar and I'm not quite sure
if I prefer the X 6 or the X 3 I could
have a listen a short listen to both
side by side and I think the X 6 sounded
a bit more refined but this seems to to
have a bit more punch at maximum that I
don't know the x6 reaches maybe deeper
but this manages to keep to retain bass
at higher levels better so yeah I hope
oh this could give you an idea about
this speaker the onkyo x3
oh yeah smaller brother of the x9 I
think the design the equal design is
really nice and I starch I mean they
really look like from the same family so
yeah mmm I really cannot say anything
bad about this but it's really nothing
which stands out in any way if the price
went down to maybe one hundred twenty
hundred thirty it would be definitely
highly recommended so thanks a lot for
watching and we will see us in the next
video bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
