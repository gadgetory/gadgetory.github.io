a look at quite a unique and specially
in the headphone which is maybe not for
everyone but really interesting this is
the automatic mk5 either later you can
find it on Amazon for him 60 70 dollars
so definitely one of the more affordable
units on them
because usually they are more expensive
I saw a model from petit nautic for $400
I even had one of those I bought it some
years ago I think it was the ER 4s or P
but back then when I tried it on me I
thought yeah what crap is this really
meat focus no base no definition very
cheap sounding like those earbuds you
get for five dollars and I returned it
immediately I thought yeah what's all
this fuss about I forgot about a
thematic but now I got a list with some
suggested ones from one of my viewers
and the mk5 was also there is it's not
that expensive I thought I should give a
thematic another tribe here in Germany
it costs a bit more so I paid 90 euros
but I think the price is still justified
you can see it looks like this like all
automatic headphones it's out of plastic
I think it's just one dynamic driver the
other ones are balanced amateur and yet
typical automatics are the three flange
tips it also comes with different sizes
I usually need bigger tips but here with
the motives I don't get a good fit with
the larger ones so I use the smaller
tips here are also some phonies I tried
the form is but they color the Sun too
much for me usually they kill treble and
I also find that they sound better with
the tree flange and the secret is that
you have to really put them inside as
deep as possible I was not aware of this
I should have known this before when I
had the heart for s / P and when I tried
it this time I yeah was a bit hesitant
because it nearly hurt until I got a
good fit I felt like some virgin girl
who is trying to hear to have
intercourse for the first time but you
really have to put them deep inside it's
really uncomfortable the very first time
but after some time you get used to it
probably yeah it disappears completely
inside the year and it's even a little
bit too short
otherwise I don't get a good fit so you
can see I turn them around like this and
then yeah they stick they hardly stick
out so I could put
even under a helmet and then the seal is
needed and I get nearly a vacuum so they
feel a little uncomfortable but you are
rewarded or awarded with a really great
defined sound mmm it's still very MIT
focused but not like I had before but
it's not a bass heavy sound when making
some frequency response measurements you
can see that they are fled to up to a 1
kilohertz
but keep in mind they are tuned for
diffuse field also this is compensated
for diffuse field therefore it appears
flat but usually headphones are tuned
for Hammond response curve Hammond
response curve is different they tried
to approximate the response of
headphones based on speakers placed in a
Hammond listening room and they found
that a headphone yet to appear as good
sounding a speaker has to have some
upwards feel towards base so the
automatic headphones or other sound
still Finn I helped a little bit with
some EQ on the iPhone there is no akyuu
but you have these presets I tried them
all and I think the best one is hip-hop
it raises bass and upper treble so Leafs
meets untouched
this makes the sound a little bit more
balanced to my ear because without it's
very uncoloured very natural that simply
thin imagine a FIFA Helsinki standing
outside in the open field it sounds like
this if you like this definition of a V
file syncing you will probably like the
automatic mk5 for my taste they like a
little bit upper treble spatter it's
just the dynamic driver
therefore my hope is there was a mass
drop on the ER 3 XXL these have a little
bit more bass boost so I ordered one and
I hope the ER 3 XR who or the name will
sound maybe a little bit more defined as
I think it uses balanced armature
drivers instead of one dynamic driver
like here but still for a single driver
they sound just amazing just without
bass you have to keep this in mind of
course I try to record them
but it's not easy with with the ear
system here also the human ear that an
Atomics is completely different probably
also the impedance is different than
from the ear so I had a hard time to
record them but I think I managed to
come up with something compared to what
I hear in reality so let's compare the
untouched sound as it comes directly
from the iPhone with the original
recording first
we can't
we can't be
I think you could hear the overall
response is quite natural and uncoloured
especially compared to many other in
years I have tested in the meantime but
it's simply lacking base and upper
treble compared to the original
recording so to bring it a little bit
closer I would like to demonstrate to
the sound with some simulated EQ I will
raise bass and treble slightly so make
some kind of smelling response but as
it's rather in inverse many now this
food rather make it flat so on the
iPhone I would use hip hop on my
Shandling I can find you need a little
bit better so I reduced four kilo has
been about 340 B i boosted bass by 6 DB
also 16 kilo hertz so let's have a
listen again against the original
recording
we can't be underwater
we can't be
so with some additional EQ the a
thematic mk5 really shines I enjoyed a
lot definitely better than many others
or all the others I have tested in the
meantime but they need an EQ widowed EQ
the sound to meet folk cused very direct
even with some EQ if you switch to
another in here or even headphone
suddenly the other ones appear muddy or
muffled when I listen to the mk5
for a longer time and then I put on the
HT 600 suddenly the HT 600 the sons of
they sound really natural automatic yes
they know that in Atomics of the e human
ear so they know how to tune to make it
sound natural but it's I think they
approach little bit wrong they should
also more targeted at their Hammond
response Hammond response curve not
diffuse equalization and I'm really
curious to hear the ER 3xr which is
claimed to have a bit more bass also you
can tune it more with some adapters
because it's an balanced amateur so with
some resistors you can yeah get a bit
more sparkle out of them so I'm very
curious of course I will update my my
findings so far the mk5 is really great
but without EQ I cannot listen to it
because it's to meet folk cused also to
direct very it's very detailed not not
harsh but very you hear really every
detail
out of a song I like it a lot and I
would recommend all audiophile lovers
who like the Helsinki even with its
natural tuning to try the mk5 s they
resemble each other somehow yeah I hope
this video was helpful a little bit many
more Indians are coming some interesting
ones some hidden treasures that are not
reviewed very often but are
outperforming all the other hard ones
therefore stay tuned until then have a
nice time and bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
