going to have a look at the dos sound
box quite happy wait it's become
indicated some videos on Amazon you can
see that there are nearly 2,000
customers use most of them are five
stars only very few are not that
satisfied this because surf goes for $35
it's available in different colors and
so it says it offers superior sound
quality Bluetooth 4.0 technology
exceptionally durable sensitive touch
buttons and so on and so on I got some
comments that this is the best speaker
below $40 also some complaints while I
didn't include it into my low budget
Christmas video so yeah here it is we
can see nothing that special to drivers
and Pasiphae it off somewhere here below
the on/off button is at the back also
some micro SD playback we can also have
a look at the packaging yeah nothing
that special comes with some manuals and
USB charging cable also an expiry and it
comes with a nice carrying bag which is
claimed to be waterproof or something
but yet more interesting is of course
the speaker itself so yeah let's turn it
on maybe this if it has a nice disco
light no you have to keep it pressed for
some seconds to turn it on and yeah we
should maybe check out some tunes how it
sounds need some time to connect yeah
now and yeah let's check out some some
tracks maybe
and these are the touch controls so you
can see turning volume up but volume is
not synced between decals and player so
we have to increase the secret area
maximum to help the entire volume range
and yeah I'm really not that impressed
we could compare it really against the
show-me nice speaker which here cost
nearly the same also SD card playback
but way smaller so it would fit maybe
five times inside this dog here and you
will notice that yes the dog sounds
somehow strange so this is the dog home
box and I will switch over to the sonic
taken here is on somehow better
this is some kind of kitchen area for
maybe the chick in our quick hey I'm not
quite sure how to describe it
so maybe another trip so much more fine
I'm a fuller bigger here the three
counts like cement
clock radio is something else
oh and no question where the barrier
from quality come from also when
lowering volume slightly the television
them sound yeah
so I'm really not quite sure what to
think about it and the shiny fair
comparison is quite unfair which is way
smaller religious terms of modern desire
illustrating therefore yeah to know
what's going on maybe let's check out
some frequency response measurement and
you can see that those sound books and
it's quite obvious that there is a lack
of bass bass already drops at 220 hurt
there is still some bass rest how I
would call it at around 70 Hertz even
below but it's so soft that you usually
won't hear it and another program there
is some boost at 4 or 5 kilohertz region
so this is the typical boost both
usually applies to the speakers in order
to simulate some clarity like for
example that both from pink mini which
lacks upper trend completely but when
boosting this error it appears a bit
clearer the problem is the both has
really heavy based so it works here but
the dose doesn't have any base so it
makes it sound like some kitchen or
clock radio maybe should compare it
against another speaker the taotronics
pulse X which currently goes even for
twenty six dollars so ten or eight
dollars cheaper than this dose sound box
put a little battle tronic doesn't sound
that great but it takes some serious pan
chips it can also play loud and battle
these thoughts so we will hear hear how
these to compare tapping in with the
door sound box
the data says this president will host
it at least likely covered Akaka more
pleasant political in warmest on the
world
give me another track and yes completely
missing any kind of punch and drive the
topic is another story
maybe the check out oh now they can play
so I will stand up and go far away the
crane informational this is the boss
Tom box now with maximum
the pulpit automation
Oh
yes you can use a different move let's
check it out against an X power P t-28s
this one is a bit more expensive but not
by much I think forty six dollars so
twelve dollars difference let's check
out how these two compare again starting
with the DOS front box there is some
resonance with that body here or
something let's check the X power
again you can hear it rattle sound much
more maitre somehow I will not perfected
a completely different league of speaker
no comment
although usually present post with all
given their work let's check again which
one can play louder
although the exhale is not appear but
yeah okay so increasing role in
connecting on there so then X power play
more country oh yes isotope later don't
forget me
it doesn't make sense to continue any
further yeah I'm sorry to say it but the
dog sandbox is script I'm not quite sure
how all these great ratings can be
although there are some who are not that
satisfied you can see it sucked or I
returned it because it was not very good
not great product so still there are
lots of people who seem to be satisfied
with it but you can get much better
speed for here for Less like this
Sauron expects way louder excellently
serious punch or this is show me me
which sounds also way better for normal
level listening you just can play maybe
a bit louder but the show me how much
more high file also the six power not
that perfect some treble harshness but
also way more mature so I'm not quite
sure about the height and and raising of
the sound box here I am really
disappointed I expected much more after
all these comments yeah this is the
greatest for $40 but this is one of the
worst ones you can get much better ones
I only selected three here I could put
up five or six other one comparable of
price which sounds much better
so yes hope this can give you an idea
about the dog sound touch some box touch
remove it turn it off again and I will
include it of course in my speaker audio
database so you can also check it
against some others because there I hope
you like this I hope you yeah I didn't
bash it too much but it's really a
disappointment to complete
disappointment after all the hype and
from the comments so I'm really not sure
what what what what what it's all about
so thank you all for watching and see
you in the next video until then have a
nice time and bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
