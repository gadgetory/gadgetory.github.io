present you another interesting
low-budget speaker this is the medium
life with a 65 111 or MD 84 945 very
interesting name I don't quite know how
it's available worldwide but in German
and in Austria you can buy directly from
the median shop for 80 euros it's also
available from the meteor shop on Amazon
also for 80 euros and I think it's a
pretty impressive speaker for that price
I thought we will compare it against
that JBL extreme which costs well nearly
four times as much and I think the
median can really compete it has 30
watts it has no app decks but NFC
onboard it's a bass reflex design so you
have the bass reflex port here at higher
levels it starts farting a little bit
but this is typical for most bass reflex
designs you can also charge external
devices as you can see there is a nice
leather grip that you can take off if
want it and it has this funny I don't
know
look built like a like a handbag or
something with this yeah with this fake
leather look if we have a look at the
frequency response of the speaker you
can see a nice bass hump at 75 Hertz
quite similar to that of the JBL extreme
but not quite as boosted but we can also
notice some inconsistencies at mid and
higher frequencies well but this is
nothing you cannot fix with an EQ it's a
pretty impressive sounding speaker and
unlike the JBL it doesn't reduce bass at
higher levels so this might lead to some
distortion at really high levels so you
either reduce volume it would play a bit
louder than the JBL extreme so either
you reduce volume or you can also reduce
base with an EQ to get rid of the
distortion it doesn't have any kind of
bass reduction compression or something
it simply plays what comes in comes out
so if it's too much for the drivers
for the MP it will distort so as always
I will be using my binaural microphones
for recording please listen with
headphones for the best results and we
will have a short listen how it compares
against their JBL
let's turn both on the medium only plays
some simple tones like that the JBL
makes this guitar or harp sounds and I
will start playing some rock
Trek some selfish honest new album you
hear some port noise already at least
from these thoughts already maybe let's
increase volume I will increase there
let's try some kind of blues rock
country a whatever
Oh
yes you are
or some kind of acoustic house this is
pretty interesting let's have a listen
JBL sounds definitely a bit finer I will
put them aside again and we will try to
increase volume to maximum to see the
difference in loudness again the medium
first I will increase volume now
I will
but you maybe hear that median at this
level keeps more base than the trivial
the JBL already reduced most of its base
let's have a listen to another house
yeah maybe not the JPL extreme killer
but for 80 euros pretty decent speaker I
think it doesn't have this strong bass
boost as the JBL but the bass which is
equally deep and if you want a nice
cheap speaker maybe not very small but
still manageable the median life beat is
65 111 is a pretty nice speaker I think
for a low budget yeah I hope this could
give you an idea about this speaker you
can also take this off let's leather rim
here so no need to have this mounted I
think it looks even yeah it bit well
Barak maybe this is pretty interesting
this this pattern here yeah thanks a lot
for watching some other speakers coming
soon so stay tuned for more and thanks
yeah bye bye
this is the median life Pete II 65 111
or MD 84 955 45 or MD 84 954 for 45 or
md-81 i this is the median life it is 65
whoa
Nash astrick this is the median life it
is 65 111 or md80 for 900 feet 40 feet
difference Fiat see from vanilla cake
day and I don't know about availability
availability availability and available
availability availability I don't know
how it's available internationally but
in Germany and in Austria you can buy it
for you can buy directly from the median
shop for 80 euros assistant or si she's
honest I paid for Fitness in Germany and
also you can buy directly from the
median shop for $80 says it's the
amplifier is 30 watts it's a V so let's
turn both on
you hear only a very short term well
they connected simultaneously and let's
have a listen to some kind of well jazz
funk not fact but funk
let's turn both on we already know that
tones from JBL and I will start playing
with the medium first with some kind of
jazz funk then we will also hear</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
