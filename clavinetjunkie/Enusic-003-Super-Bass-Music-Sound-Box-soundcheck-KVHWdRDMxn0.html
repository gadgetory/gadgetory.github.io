an oosik sounds a bit serbian i got this
from the den good store for $38 and as
you can see here it says wireless super
bass stereo bluetooth speaker music
sound box you know super bass and
everything so i got excited
it also reminded me quite a bit of the
meeting royal or big thing and my hope
was that it would perform on a similar
level with similarly good bass and
everything you can see the design is
equal just that the music is shrinked a
bit also the backside completely equal
materials but in reality it doesn't
perform quite as good it rather performs
on a similar level like this Archie o
226 we've heard before or this V thing
banker it has some deep bass but quite a
bit recessed the first thing that
annoyed me quite a bit is the vibration
the passive radiator which is only at
the back causes please listen headphones
and I will start playing a bass heavy
tune so please have a listen where you
can hear the whole table vibrate so you
would need to put something underneath
the last some rubber feet but there are
very thin maybe not soft enough when
putting it on something like that
this improves of course let's have a
listen how it compares to the fixing
roller you can hear this is a much
fuller sound not really comparable this
one
this final effect a Russian punk band
funky business and okay here a much
fuller sound from the fixing oiler
then here you get the spiracle PA sound
then I thought which speaker would well
compare or not compare that well and I
thought the anchor sound car which is
hyped quite a lot could be a good
contender so let's have a listen to this
tool it will take a bit until it connect
oh it's already connected so let's try
another track again starting with the
music
bang come you can hear a very similar
sound this maybe is slightly more
balance slightly pepper base of the
difference is not that huge anchor
yeah I really couldn't name a winner
maybe they in usek let's try another
track anchor yeah it has slightly
sharper treble but bass doesn't reach as
deep but still the difference is really
small it still dances around and see
it's moving let's try now track
and I will stand up and turn both to
maximum but the music is not very loud
so yeah this is maximum volume now now
the anchor is quite a bit louder
the difference is really huge maybe
twice as soft let's try to attract okay
this is the same thing as before oh yeah
I really am
I'm not that sure if the music is that
great for forty or close to $40 you can
get similar or maybe even better stuff I
mean the design is really nice it feels
very very high quality
just like the victim layer but I really
hoped a comparable sound at least a bit
closer but it's really more close to all
these chips because we already know so
nothing that's special I hope this could
give you an idea about this music or
endless each speaker I hope this was
helpful I hope you liked it and we will
see us in next year bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
