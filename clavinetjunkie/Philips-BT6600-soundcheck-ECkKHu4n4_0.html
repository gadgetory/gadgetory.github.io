and simple video about the phillips bt
6600 that is brand new on the market
this speaker costs around one hundred
fifty nine euros currently but i think
the price will drop pretty quickly like
with all Philips devices I already had
the phillips bt 6000 before but was not
too impressed i think this sounds much
better
and rather competes with the JBL charge
- or the JBL flip 3a sound wise it's
also competes i think with the ue boom
I mean it's claimed to be 360 degrees
because you can see it has drivers here
and it has drivers here at the back but
there are not no drivers here so if you
place it upright it could be that the
Sun becomes a bit dull but this is this
you get the same from the UE boom there
are only particular angles where it
sounds good from all other angles you
can forget the sound I thought we'll
have a listen and compare it against the
JBL flip 3 for example or against the
JBL charge - they are all pretty
comparable or sound wise also size-wise
but first let's have a look at the
frequency response graph of the Philips
first I measured it like that placed
horizontally with the microphone
directly on axis and I got this result
as you can see it's rather pretty flat
with some nice space extension but there
is a little bit of an treble emphasis so
it sounds a little bit sizzling I mean
the treble doesn't extend that much but
it's it's pretty clear maybe even too
clear for some I also did the
measurement when it's placed upright
like that again directly measured from
front and you can see that you get a
little bit of a treble loss but I think
it sounds better like that um and I also
did a measurement from behind also
standing upright like this and as you
can see in this measurement the treble
loss is even more but if we average all
these three measurements you get this
curve
which is really smooth and flat so
walking around the speaker you get a
pretty nice sound with deep nice bass
extension at 70 Hertz and nice treble
without any peaks or strange humps like
with many others because so I think this
Philips is really a nice decent speaker
it comes with a kind of cradle charging
cradle like this so for charging you can
simply put it there it's pretty stable
it has some kind of sticky rubber foot
here and of course it can also be
charged normally through micro USB it
also has charging out here so it's
equipped with with everything you need
turning it on is done with this analog
volume dial and I thought we'll have a
short listen the first thing I noticed
when I played some tracks was some
resonance with the body with particular
tricks you will notice some humming some
buzzing I don't know maybe it's just my
sample but it might affect most of them
so I thought we will try a track and
have a listen how this sounds
this is a solo piano track and you will
definitely notice it with some
particular notes there is some some
resonance let's have a listen
as always I'm using binaural microphones
so please listen with headphones this is
the only premise for this for these
recordings so that you get the best
quality but let's not know and pay
attention how clean the piano sounds we
are about ameliafe maybe 2/3 3/4 volumes
or not very loud
have you heard it
again
hello
there seem there seems to be some
resonance between drivers and body
the JBL flip three for example doesn't
do this let's have a listen to this we
have now the JBL flip three
it's clean simply again the Philips
you
let's try maybe some other track more
funky from savasana again
and you hear that it sounds pretty
full-bodied I will switch to the JDL 3/3
but you definitely hear this treble
emphasis I think I think it sounds
better like this
yo
let's try some other frick when it's
placed like that you don't get any real
left right but rather how front and back
the left driver is here the right one
here so there is some left/right
separation but in reality half of the
Sun goes forward half of it backward so
let's have a listen to the JBL charge -
how this one manages of course the JBL
charge - has a much higher base post
artificial post a kind of one note base
with the resonance at 75 Hertz so let's
listen again first with the Philips and
then I will switch over to the JBL
and meets our swellow the way with the
JBL charge - somehow it seems to be
struggling a bit with the song
let's try in our track again with the
Philips first and I will walk around a
little bit around the speakers
you have the Philips sounds simply much
more clearer much more open let's place
it like that
let's try some kind of rock'n'roll or
blues
I
yeah it's struggling already there is
already compression going on
the Philips is pretty well under control
I don't know how you prepare it maybe
like this sounds clearer
let's try again something else
Philips first
and I will turn both to maximum mouth
the jbls well
here is this book trophy
you
the trivia has a bit of problems
and the finish is also quite a bit
louder let's try some kind of hofstra
also maximum volume for both in Christ
to keep more base but without the sounds
of applause against the Philips now
let's try a song from nocopyrightsounds
these are really mastered extremely I
these are the loudest songs I've heard
they have if you look at them at their
waveform this is a long sausage without
any dynamic peaks so small speakers
which always add some kind of
compression struggle at high levels
because you cannot add compression to
something which is already compressed I
will start again with the Philips and a
song called candy land from
nocopyrightsounds
yeah
yeah I think the difference pretty
obvious I mean the JBL tries to keep
more base it also has a more bass boost
than the Philips but I think the result
is not very convincing the Philips does
a pretty good job I think and I think it
sounds really nice definitely much
better than you it boom it's maybe not
as loud but the Sun distinctly much much
more mature I still have to learn it
make sure make mature like this so a
nice speaker currently a bit expensive I
would say hundred sixty euros is too
much especially you've heard these
resonance issues I'm pretty sure all
units have this problem it's simply the
build quality the quality check and so
on is maybe not as good but it's much
better than the older version the 6000
which simply had no bass at all this one
has really nice bass so I hope this
could give you an idea about the
phillips bt 6600 i hope it was helpful
coming up next I just got the the gem
heavy metal this is something like a
kind of premium version of the anchor
premium speaker this really you see
aluminium nice build quality so next
video we will see this one yeah I think
this was it thanks a lot for watching
and see you then bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
