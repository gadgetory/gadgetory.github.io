to compare their Bose Soundlink evolve
against the calf gravity one we've
already heard this before and I think
this is quite a fair comparison it's
both our model is the same size maybe
even with the cap being slightly larger
both are omnidirectional and both are
mono but the calf cost nearly twice the
price of the boss then I'm getting lots
of comments about the pose to be
completely overpriced to expensive wild
calf is running also they are high-end
stuff so their LS 50 lot speakers are
top-notch and you would also expect
great performance out of a portable
speaker that cost $380 both on the other
hand is rather lasted with vos e by
other sound equipment so I thought we
should check it out how they sound
compared as always I will be using a
head cam and binaural microphones
therefore you should listen with
headphones for best results please put
them up and let's check them out let's
turn them on the calf placed some cheese
well compounds and it also needs some
second to connect the both connect
immediately and I will start playing
with the Bose Soundlink evolved and it
lets the trek from johannes brahms so
please have a listen
maybe some jazz
or just attract from Chiapas
non-prescription let's call it R&amp;amp;B or
New Groove you saw whatever and all the
health claims needs to be a directional
or omnidirectional speaker it is really
a listen operationally they are perfect
and unique you driver here together the
Eric totally revolutionary as a channel
that results if we do this with both
it's really more like a bouncer around
the speaker but because of this is the
sound also changes quite a lot if I
place it on a vector so it would sound
better I think just to contain somewhere
so I think it sounds quite a bit better
and more mature than the cap company and
watch another trick
yes usually I would immediately jump to
the next song but let's wait until the
drum and bass part comes in we are all
ready now the difference is quite
obvious
but let us know
yep coming
let's start something else something
more acoustic maybe not that bad but
legs really some definitions
some clarity maybe maybe let's check
them more on the path and I think it's a
little bit better but still so I
wouldn't have designed it as an only
election today it really loses quite a
bit when this is in such a way
something else Rock me I will leave a
link back at him
I've also here to hold
and more convincing experience
me
please compressor from the box
there is some choice against track and I
will increase volume slightly on the
morality one as well and maybe let's
walk around again to hear how they
perform effective in how to manage
students in the room with music
the posters which is why this puller and
I will increase volume to maximum and
hold on the gravity one as well there is
quite a difference although they both
compress this quite a bit
there have become pretty lobster
opportune will help to come closer or
let me comment on maybe some other dance
track something more let's go
this is such a presence main objections
and also a unity that it follows the
based on a little bit but if I reuse
more emotion it's a lot of in the heaven
it comes with a click if you like
I wouldn't say that they're both
something the wolf is the best portable
speaker I've ever heard but I think it
does the job really well with its great
360-degree sound dispersion as the sound
hardly changes when you turn it around I
think they're receiving some really
advanced know-how inside the acoustic
deflector seems to be pretty complex I
think it has two levels for separating
frequencies and it just a simple foliage
driver so quite impressive what both has
achieved with this the curve from the
other end with their high end unique you
driver is rather disappointing
especially if you really want 360-degree
sound it sounds better when in target
and listener but even then it's rather
average so if you keep in mind that this
costs 300 eighty dollars and this 199 I
think the boss is quite a bit more
impressive still there are people who
seem to be impressed by the calf there
is one reviewer on Amazon who says
excellent sound for such a small speaker
better than similarly priced because
yeah $380 you can already get a FIFA
Helsinki which wipes both of them I hope
this little comparison could put this
into some better relation though I don't
really think that Bose is overpriced
it's definitely not cheap but better
than many others similarly or higher
price because than this it's really
quite impressive and yes enjoying yeah I
hope you liked this little bit thanks
for watching and see you in the next
video have a nice time and bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
