brand new German on music box
excess after toy free and Louisville
Canton is the third German company who
introduces its first portable bluetooth
speaker and I think that similarities to
the Bose Soundlink mini are pretty
pretty blatant if you look through the
grille you maybe even notice that they
have the same passive radiators and even
the drivers seem to be exactly the same
of course I was curious to to hear how
it sounds but first let's have a look at
the frequency response measurements of
both and in black you see the Canton in
gray in the Bose and I think it's really
obvious from this that they share lots
of similarities I mean the Bose has
slightly more boosted bass but it's
missing treble and the Canton on the
other hand has this nice treble
extension that the boss is missing but
apart from that they really seem to
measure exactly the same there there is
some area where it's equal where both
curves are identical I've measured them
also at maximum volume and at lower
volume at lower volume you can see that
the Bose has even more bass balls last
apply some kind of loudness compensation
maybe a bit too much and at maximum
volume you can see that the camp Canton
should play a little bit louder about 4
TB and of course we would like to hear
if it's true in reality how they sound
how they compare and as usual I will be
using my binaural microphones so you
really should listen with headphones
again and again people let leave a
comment like oh I was hearing this for
my Bose Soundlink mini or I was hearing
this for my big monitor speakers but
binaural recordings are really meant to
be heard through headphones because the
frequency response is optimized for
headphone listen
while with speakers you will get a
completely distorted frequency response
it simply won't sound true therefore I'm
wearing my head cam to give you a kind
of first-person view I have my binaural
microphones please put up your
headphones and we will have a listen how
they compare as usual I will place them
here in the center of my room because I
think they sound most natural here in
contrast to when placed closer to the
wall or in some corner they become too
bass-heavy both are playing at around
two thirds maybe even a bit closer to
3/4 of their volume I'm starting with
the boss with some kind of rock track
let's have a listen
I think the difference is pretty obvious
they still sound a bit similar but the
boss is simply much more mushy let's
listen for this
the Contin is definitely less
directional let's try another track
yeah I think it's more than clear that
they're both struggles a little bit
let's listen to the same track through
the music box
the content is more controlled and also
it doesn't seem to have any
intermodulation distortion where the
boss already starts with some hints of
intermodulation and let's listen to this
yet they are both not perfectly clean I
thought we should check out how the JBL
charge two compares in this situation
with this song and let's listen again
nice method on the denim obscene he also
had this spoon to to listen to the bass
drum did you leave your trash tool again
from the start I mean this is how a bass
drum sounds
the company makes something else out of
it some effect it's not really how it
should sound you can hear the bass from
the bass and guitar unisono
you can distinguish all of them went on
the compound yes definitely not it's
tranquil that's right this also via the
taste from sounds really weird I mean
the JBL has this metallic treble but
overall and the sound is simply much
better under control
whoa but also overtones with the
acoustic bass
this is the reason why I finally got rid
or of that pose because I didn't like
this dirtiness I think that both sounds
even worse with this let's try the boss
again although it has so many fanboys is
simply not a speaker for really serious
music listening this is the boss now you
can hear the cymbal
in terminating at the base
I think we should stick to the JBL it
simply sounds cleaner and better for a
comparison let's try another trick again
starting with the music box
what happened to the base from again
it seems as if the compressor was trying
to subdue it somehow the base disappears
I don't know I thought we should turn
both to maximum and check out some more
danceable maybe some kind of house and
I'm starting with the JBL charge too now
very very focused
not very convincing so now the most
important question should you buy it or
not I don't know I don't even know if it
will be released in the US or outside of
Europe in Germany it costs hundred 99
euros exactly the same as the Bose
Soundlink mini tow fizzes my old version
but they still sound more or less the
same to tell the truth I am NOT
completely impressed
it sounds clearer and it has better
treble but it still has the same issues
as the Bose which is this dirtiness with
bass heavy songs this uncontrolled sound
you get if you increase volume past half
it's even starts a bit droning below
half already
I noticed it more with the with the
Canton than with the Bose so it's not
what I really was expecting maybe some
next upcoming speakers could be even
better
I still hope for the Rivas to change
everything I mean it's the river s is
definitely not extremely bass heavy it
has bass it has deep bass as deep as
those but it's not boosted it it doesn't
have the this artificial boost but from
what I heard it's simply more control to
it it does not distort we tested me and
Don North from Reno Audio we really
played the most extreme songs and the
boss also the Contin sounded as if they
were broken while the reverse sounded
like the song was originally meant so
it's a nice device and I bought it from
my own money I didn't get it from Canton
so I can really say my
my honest opinion unlike many others who
get their devices for free and they say
this is the best and this is the best
and all our best because yeah because I
got it from the company and they cannot
say anything bad otherwise I won't get
anything else I bought it as well as the
boss so I really can say that they are
similar different but I don't know if
one copied from the other if they were
produced in collaboration together I
don't know but the similarities are so
obvious I mean it's it's extreme it's
opposed tuned by Canton something like
that
at least they don't ask 300 euros for it
but still the same price or it's okay
yeah nothing else to say about this I
hope you liked it if you're interested
in the canton from somewhere else from
China from Australia
you should contact Canton if they or if
they will export it also there I don't
know if it will be released at all but
even the rubber foot from both you can
see that yeah they are simply share the
same concept the same drivers the same
acoustics so thanks a lot for your
attention
thanks a lot for watching I hope you
liked it and yeah let's see you next
time bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
