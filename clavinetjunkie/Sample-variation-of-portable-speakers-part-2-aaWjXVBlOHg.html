sample variation of portable speakers
the finding so far was that two equal
speakers won't probably sound exactly
the same today I wanted to give you some
further examples but we also had a
listen to two different sounding JBL
charge three units and I wanted to do
some analysis about the frequency
response measurements and also reveal
which one was the old early unit and
which one was the new one yeah but no to
the new examples I bought a used leave
is in black here yes it was quite cheap
and I don't quite like the dint of my
white unit and when listened to both
ahead again the impression as if
something something was different so I
measured both and you can see that the
black unit has slightly more base the
white unit on the other hand has
slightly more treble in the eight kilo
Hertz region so it appears slightly
clearer but I definitely prefer the more
bass heavy sound of the black unity also
grabbed a new JBL flip for another one
I was already had one and I noticed that
the new one sounded a little bit
different let's say cleaner so when
looking at the measurements again you
can see that both measure quite
similarly there is some difference in
trouble but it's hard to really describe
which one sounds better also visible
here that one unit has a slight base
advantage but this difference is really
minimal to this one DB so it's really
not easily to be heard but it's easy to
be heard that's one sounds cleaner the
base does not distort as much I
complained a little bit about my first
unit that the base becomes out of
control sometimes especially at levels
close to half then you one definitely
plays much cleaner on voltage sounds
still quite similar but check out this
for example it's quite interesting
although I would assume that knocking
against the persuader should give you
the same sound but this is definitely a
two semitone difference so not sure if
the new one has less mass or is tuned
for another frequency also not sure if
this is just simple variation or if
there are they adjusted something
afterwards during the production as they
notice that the earlier unit had some
slight distortion the new one definitely
sounds keloid bass more controlled
the other one had sometimes a little bit
drowning healable
but piktochart read you can see I
already returned the other unit and when
looking through all the comments
regarding our listening test it's quite
interesting to see the findings and I'm
impressed that you really heard this
through my recordings as most findings
are indeed correct so many heard speaker
B is something slightly more natural
speaker a had more bass also sounded
clearer more treble but some even notice
that a had more intimate relation
distortion which is all collect and I'm
really really impressed thanks for the
comments we can of course look at some
frequency response measurements on both
and you can see that a has indeed more
bass but also deeper bass the bass on B
rows of earlier the difference at sixty
Hertz is about 6 DB so definitely here
able and there is also some difference
in treble a has more treble boost in the
upper region this was obviously toned
down for speaker B and speaker B also
got some boost at around 4 kilohertz
this is Wes pika a has a slight deep so
the difference is quite obvious between
these two to reveal it a is indeed the
old early unit while B is the new one
yeah I think this is not just simple
variation but JBL really adjusted
something afterwards I complained a
little bit about inter modulation so
maybe they reduced bass slightly or
let's say they cut it off earlier at the
same time that took away this boost at
around 12 kilo Hertz much which is great
is the B definitely sounded more muffled
than a although the treble of the a
doesn't sound right as well so both are
not perfect but there are some
differences you have to conclude all
this again to equal speakers probably
won't sound the same there is definitely
some central variation and there can be
differences because of different
companies I know or I heard that JBL has
two different locations where speakers
are produced so if you can if you get
one from I don't know same Singapore or
something or another one from China they
will probably sound different yeah
nothing else to say about separation
just keep in mind that when I test the
speaker this does not mean that your son
the same you can have more distortion or
you can be you can sound even better
sometimes I if I'm not sure if it's
really okay I order another one or ask
for another sample too just to get sure
that everything is all right and then I
can say yeah both sound like crap or but
again because I am reading about
comments regarding the Harman Kardon
gameplay because of farting PC
freighters my unit has nothing I can
play the hardest tracks and replace it
clean there is no farting nothing so
yeah maybe even here they adjusted
something in the production line this
man was very also very early on it I
bought it at the very beginning maybe
some adjustments during the production
line changed the behavior of the passive
Raiders who knows I'm not sure about
mine I tried the tracks there is some
video
farting place if later with some dance
track I tried it on my going play after
maximum no problem at all so it's it
plays everything clean yes
thanks a lot for watching I hope this
was interesting
maybe not helpful but yeah we'll
continue doing some photo tests maybe
even some technical videos not sure if
you have some questions some suggestions
suggestions please let me know until
then stay tuned a nice time and bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
