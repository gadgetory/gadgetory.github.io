how the new JBL flip 3 compares against
the UE boom the ultimate ears boom is an
infamous and maybe most discussed
speaker model on the market it's pretty
expensive but sounds rather average I
would say so you don't get what you pay
for in my opinion and they both share
similar features like waterproof water
resistance they can connect to another
one for a wireless stereo the UE boom is
a 360-degree speaker but always people
complain that I turned it to the wrong
side so I hope it will be turned
correctly this time I'm wearing high
quality binaural microphones so if you
listen with headphones you should get a
pretty realistic impression of how both
sound just keep the loudness of my voice
as a rough reference I'm starting with
the JBL flip first
it's right out of trick
get a surprise you
I always get Impressionists as if it was
playing to the back or something I don't
know
committing them maybe like that
I'm not sure if we that may I listen to
that kind of porn music so let's try
something with a little bit more boom
if you ask me there is a bit of
funkiness with the UE boom and well boom
is missing a bit let's try another track
I'll turn up go for the national No
if you ask me the only thing the ue boom
did better was being able to play louder
but it didn't sound that great at
maximum volume a bit of a honky strange
Bhoomi sound at lower levels the JBL 3:3
simply outperforms the ue boom also
battery wise the JBL flip 3 has pretty
decent battery I listened the whole day
close to maximum volume added still well
more than half I know about problems
with the battery of the UE boom that it
dies after 1 hour maybe when played at
maximum volume so yeah I hope this video
was helpful a little bit to give you a
first impression if you're interested
check out the JBL we will see in the
next video until then had a nice time
and bye bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
