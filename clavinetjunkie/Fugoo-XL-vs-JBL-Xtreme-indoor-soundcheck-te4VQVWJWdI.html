comparison video of the XL versus the
JBL extreme that all were asking for
please take some time as I will be
playing lots of music with different
genres this time to give you the best
possible impression of how both compare
what their weaknesses and strengths are
I also thought about going outdoors but
it's so windy that I will have to do
this another time this time we will
concentrate on sound indoors but first
please let me give you some facts about
the Foo XL I didn't quite know what to
expect from the speaker because of the
comments on YouTube and also some
reviewer who claimed that the mega boom
has more bass I don't think this is true
that fugu XL is a pretty sounding
speaker with class-leading bass response
it has very deep reaching base below 45
Hertz even here 40 Hertz while the JBL
extreme may have more bass but it simply
boosted its booming bass boost at 75
Hertz but below there is hardly anything
that we excel has nice and clean
response to 40 Hertz the only thing I'm
missing is a little bit of treble
sparkle I mean the treble is there and
it's smooth but it's missing this
brilliance it sounds as if it was packed
or wrapped into something and in reality
this into the jacket here if we take the
core out I think it sounds a little bit
better still I would prefer it with more
treble and I think this could be done
with some future update but as you can
see the core itself is not very large
and these two parts here are only some
some bumpers so if you think them away
it becomes even smaller so it's quite a
bit smaller than the JBL extreme and
quite impressive if you keep in mind how
well it performs what the JBL extreme of
course does better is play loud it can
play quite a bit louder and outdoors
that bass pounds much more so it's
perfect for dance music hip hop and so
on if you need high loudness the Fukui
Excel doesn't play quite loud it has an
auto outdoor and indoor mode but
the auto mode pushes meats a bit forward
it becomes louder but also these
thoughts quite a bit so if you are
loudness junkie and want the the loudest
speaker around ya I wouldn't probably
choose the fugu excel and although it's
an outdoor speaker ract waterproof and
so on I think it sounds much better
indoors than the JBL extreme that JBL
extreme becomes Bumi very boosted
drowning sound while the flu XL sounds
really decent also because of the 360
degree sound it sounds very open very
broad you really get some nice stereo
separation which is rather missing from
the JBL of course to show you all this I
will be wearing my by normal microphones
for the audio recording and you have to
listen with headphones to get the best
results because listening from speakers
to binaural recordings doesn't sound
true for the best and most realistic
impression you have to wear headphones
so please put them up and we will have a
listen as you can see I set them up
slightly offset this is because the main
drivers of the fuga are at the sides
here so this way they have a little bit
air to breathe I will start with
something classical a barack title from
Henry Purcell because many always
complaining that I don't play any
orchestral music so let's have a listen
I'm starting with the fool
Oh
here a much broader sound from the FUBU
you
let's try something else
Oh
listen how open the sound is you have
the impression of having large speaker
in front of you
that JBL is very narrow
you're from behind it loses quite a bit
and then one day I'll go away living
high living in some other way if you
awesome
you can hear that after switching the
food we Excel always ramps up the volume
a little bit this will become hard to
compare both at maximum because the fugu
will always start lower so we will have
to look for some solution but first
another trick again with the food
starting first
you already hear some droning in the JDL
we are slightly about half volume on the
JBL
the pace is there deep but not as
boosted without this hump
Hey
yeah
bass-heavy song with boosted bass leads
to look to some problems let's listen to
something else and I put them aside
this usually enhances bass a little bit
so we can hear how both compare
regarding bass response
you can hear that the JBL bass is simply
not asleep
the fugu which is quite a bit deeper
more than half an octave this sounds a
little bit to me now let's see if we can
improve the high frequencies as well I
already mentioned that the four we excel
for my taste
sounds a little bit covered so we will
try to take it out of this of this
jacket here as I think it sounds a
little bit clearer better let's try
another crack
it sounds more refined now I'm not sure
if you hear is difference for the
recording I mean it's it's a nuance but
you'll definitely hear it slightly more
a well clearer better without any jacket
I mean it's not meant to be used like
this but for home use
you
let's try the obligatory track from some
persona this moves really nicely pick up
some movement that you're feeling
they'll take it you Walter Eli the
spikes and after that you see you see
occurs the best is like this warming
already positively starting you know
right and I know nothing the garden one
is perfect without giving you free
diving moment
all the people said sir
I'm not sure if you will hear the
difference with the jacket or without
let's try it yeah I think it's obvious
the treble is much finer without without
any jacket or color so for critical
listening at home and so on I often
prefer using it without any jacket I
think it also looks quite cool and in
fact
get my half of season six and
buybacks JBL is not that clean either
this is this
you're quite shrimp ducks here
listen how the Kubik cell manages to
feel the whole room
Hey
again something else again the base
becomes a bit unclean with the GPL
listen how deep the bass drum sounds
another JBL if you hear distortion with
the bass drum already some aqua talk
either yo-yo they're based on really
pump
let's try another house trick it's nice
how separated the star effects are again
the bass drum is struggling already
let's listen to something else and I
will increase volume this is maximum
bottom on the to Excel web in your mind
you'll hear some stretching this
distortion the extreme as well maximum
here it's louder
there's aspirin pop I was talking about
but it's simply much lower morning the
nice thing is that it keeps pace even at
maximum there is a healthy amount of
base it doesn't reduce base that much
but the distortion starts becoming a bit
out of control JBL is simply much louder
I will try turning on outdoor mode it
will become louder but even more
distorted let's turn on loudness again
to maximum
let's listen to some rock tune
but I hope this could give you a first
idea about the sound qualities of the
fool as already mentioned and I think
you could hear it the bass is really
deep and nice but it's not as boosted as
on the JBL extreme but we will also see
next time when I manage to go outdoors
how it sounds outdoors I mean the JBL
becomes really very powerful sounding it
has simply an advantage outdoors because
of this boosted bass response so thanks
for watching I hope you liked it and
yeah I hope the weather will become nice
again to allow me some recordings also
outdoors until then yeah please be
patient and have a nice time bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
