check out the new Devon boombox Auto -
some time ago I already made an unboxing
but this time we'll have a slightly more
detailed look at it this is an updated
version over the old one box out wah
this has drivers at the back and at the
front so you get a kind of 360-degree
sound you can maybe see there is a main
driver in the Twitter together with a
passive radiator on both sides and
thanks to the Twitter you get quite a
bit better treble dispersion than for
example the UE boom which has also
drivers at two opposite sides but
depending on how you turn it the treble
gets lost completely as you can see this
is a more rugged version also splash
water resistant below a flap there is a
charging port micro USB auxiliary no
travelling out but still a nice speaker
to be taken around the only thing I'm
missing is some Sun lag something that I
can tether it or attached to objects and
before having a listen I thought we'll
have a look at a frequency response
measurement and as you can see it
doesn't measure completely flat there is
some bass boost at 200 Hertz together
with some treble boost so mids are
slightly scooped out this measurement
reminds me quite a bit of the UE boom
which has also some raised upper base
but in contrast to the UE boom the boom
box auto tool has also some response
below hundred Hertz you can still see
some hump at 80 Hertz with even some
response below the problem is the upper
bass boost drones the lower base
slightly and from what I heard the
speaker is just tuned by hardware so
there is no dynamic equalizing nothing
it would have definitely benefit from
some additional tuning let's say raising
the part below hundred Hertz and
lowering the 200 Hertz boost would make
the sound a bit more balanced currently
it sounds a little bit booming and you
don't get this lower bass punch still we
can have a listen how it sounds
as always I'm using binaural microphones
so you should listen with headphones
let's turn it on these are the welcome
tones not too loud and first maybe let's
have a listen if there really is any
kind of stellar separation I will play
money from Pink Floyd and yeah we can
listen you can definitely hear some back
and front stereo but there is also some
slight left and right separation the
cover is coming from from this side it's
not perfectly stereo but better than
many other mono speakers of course we
would like to hear how it sounds against
some other speakers like for example the
JBL flip 3 I think they are quite
comparable the JBL flip 3 should go for
round 80 dollars maybe the usual price
for the Devon boombox auto 2 is 80
no it's 69 but I already saw it for 59
so quite a bit cheaper I will play some
track from nocopyrightsounds starting
with the Devon boom box auto tool so
let's have a listen
maybe you can hear that the sound is
quite spacial maybe because of the
drivers of both sides the JBL it sounds
a bit more punchy but every more mono
Oh
maybe another track this is from
Sunchaser a german electronica composer
the JBL three three they are both
playing slightly above half volume so
maybe let's increase volume slightly on
the boom box auto two as well and the
great thing is of course that you get
the same sound on the back while from
the flip three it rather emits only to
the front
the Twitter also allows for a better
dispersion so that sound doesn't become
really muffled when listen from above
the flip 3 but you can hear some slight
boo - from the upper base post take
another track topper freesia
every three
is it just a Jeep my baby inside my
fantasies call to me you are in my
thoughts I never stray from something
else some kind of clock
you
p'tee via 53 it starts losing more
quickly from high angles especially from
behind
you
the game played three
it appears a bit more diffuse together
with their with that bass booster salon
it hurts it gives a little bit of a boom
impression really quite comparable to
the UE boom let's maybe to something
more jazzy but the sound is nicely
opening the flip three I can already
hear some some well dirtiness here from
the JBL this sounds cleaner doesn't
really distort that much maybe let's
check another track from
nocopyrightsounds
and let's increase volume to maximum
because the new boom boom box out with a
pretty loud speaker and in contrast to
the JBL 53 it doesn't reduce base that
much so I'm increasing volume to maximum
noise
debut free free as well and here comes
pipe in it more punches compared to
their food but also regional
some locks read
still both playing at maximum
and 53
flip three again hey it starts sounding
really teeny what we could also tries
may be quite a bit unfair comparison
comparing the Devo boombox out the two
against the JBL charge-free especially
at maximum as it's I think comparably
loud with the difference that you'll
still get sound to the front and to the
back while the JBL charge 3 is pretty
directional so yeah both should be
connected I will increase the charge
free to maximum as well and let's have a
listen to another track from
nocopyrightsounds starting with the
boombox
outdoor to again yeah I think it's
really loud
the charger
in more punch the audience wife
I will say this better doctor
it doesn't have this lower kick from the
JB charge free but still also no
compression no dynamic processing which
is pretty impressive make it let's try
another track again increasing one into
maximum also quite clean flexible no
distortion the Chari so I'm definitely
more make sure that as soon as we get
out of the sweet spot
even boombox Saturday makes more
consistent yeah I think for $60 quite an
impressive speaker definitely much much
better than the UE boom is you've heard
there is no bass reduction at maximum Y
the UE boom starts to compress like
crazy loses all bass starts sounding
ridiculous it just loud even slightly
older than the boom box Auto - but this
sounds more serious I would say I mean
not quite comparable to the JBL
charge-free which is definitely
optimized for punch end and bass but it
performs quite well against the JBF III
while being even slightly cheaper so
really a nice speaker I only would have
wished for some more dynamic sound
adjustment at low levels it would
definitely take yeah it could get away
with some more lower base the potential
is there you can hear it's really loud
and doesn't lose bass at maximum but at
low levels it starts sounding a bit
anemic at low levels I prefer my small
Shou mini speaker this starts to shine
at levels above half and yeah it's quite
usable at maximum some tracks and really
heavy recordings maybe this thought
slightly but still really really
impressive
I hope this could give you an idea about
the Devon boom box
Auto - yeah it would be great if it
could be hang somewhere some holes
unlock some something unfortunately
there isn't but maybe for the next
version they will improve it with some
some better electronic tuning dynamic
tuning let's see it's still a great
speaker and quite recommendable for all
those who like the UE boom they should
like the Devon one box auto two even
more as I think it sounds more serious
nearly equally loud but yeah better
sound overall also thanks to the Twitter
it doesn't lose travel as much as the UE
boom when not placed yeah perfectly well
the UE boom only sounds great if
listened to one side
so yeah nothing else to say about the
even boombox auto-tune thanks a lot for
the sample and yeah I hope you liked it
we will see us in the next video thanks
for watching and bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
