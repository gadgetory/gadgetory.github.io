listening session to their mini week two
point one set up I know that many
complained that it's not a cheap system
and I should have compared it to two JBL
extreme playing together but this
wouldn't have changed much as to JBL
extreme still sound the same they just
give you better stereo and and a louder
but the sound signature doesn't change
that much I also think that if you don't
have the money to buy a rolls-royce or a
Ferrari you will buy a Fiat so this is
rather a rolls-royce among the portable
speakers also keep in mind we are here
at 1.7 kilograms for all three parts to
JBL extreme would weigh over four
kilograms so they are not quite
comparable of course price wise yes but
not regarding size and weight so I
thought I would like to show you how
these mini reeks compared against a beer
system the trifle booster we've heard it
in a German video I prepared in summer I
think it's a great sounding system so
let's see how these small guys here can
compete the first time I will be using
an action cam from Sony so it will have
this typical fish-eye Distortion I hope
you will like it if not please tell me
but for me it's better to well to
remotely control the camera like this my
old camera has a back with remote
controlling and I already lost lots of
tapes because when I'm controlling it
through Wi-Fi it hangs up and so I hope
the sony will be better in this regard
as always i will be using of course my
binaural microphones so please put up
your headphones and let's have a listen
as you can see i place them far away
this time as this because is simply much
more powerful than all those small tin
cans first i will start playing some
funky tracks later on some dance and
electronica starting with their minerals
first so please have a listen
let's try this the bass response is
really impressive maybe not as deep as
the heart rate but for the site well the
toy produce slightly harsh with the
treble unfortunately you cannot dial it
back you can just adjust bass nothing
with treble
it's just a partner now I will increase
volume
got me round you sent me on
let's try something else
yes quite a bit of loudness difference
between these two
the minarets definitely appear louder
this is an Apple Apple retouch of the
Crusaders classic street life
let's try something else
get a nice first repaint small base the
minarets are pushed a little bit louder
let's read this both are playing at
mixing motifs love is the memory it's
really impressive he really managed to
squeeze
maybe another
you can develop read some just fine
maybe let's try an extreme recording
from nocopyrightsounds both still
playing at maximum
now someone once asked how far you can
set them apart when instead a wireless
mode yeah
will let's check this out I will place
this up here on the floor as this always
has to be wired to one of them it does
not have any Bluetooth unfortunately the
one will be standing here I will put the
other one over there
and let's turn up music a little bit the
right one the left one is here now at
maximum
I think that is pretty impressive
definitely managed to feel the whole
room like this so yeah I think you could
hear it it's indeed some kind of Rolls
Royce I mean it's made in Britain it's
handcrafted and it costs a lot it's
twice the price of the oil boom strip
but it's also half the weight and much
smaller so if you need something small
with great sound the mini Erik's are the
way to go it's one of the best portable
systems I've ever tried maybe not
perfect because of three parts but it's
impressive I mean you will love the
sound every HiFi phonetic will
immediately fall in love with this there
this doesn't make the rifle booster a
bad speaker but it's simply much larger
it has 3.5 kilograms so far not as
portable as this one while these can
play even a bit louder without
compression there is some slight
compression based reduction at at high
levels we could hear that the mini
Erik's couldn't quite keep up with the
powerful but if normal levels it's
impressive what what they pump out what
kind of sound yeah so if you have the
money check the website of mini rigs
they also a bit cheaper there instead if
you buy them on Amazon so here it's a
British handmade system definitely not
cheap but well it's worth it and you
will probably you won't try or you won't
buy another speak anymore if you have
this one I hope you enjoyed it I hope it
could give you another slight idea about
the qualities of the mini Eric yeah and
we'll see us in the next video have a
nice time and bye bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
