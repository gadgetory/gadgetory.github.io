include the Bose Soundlink three in a
comparison with the JBL extreme I went
out and grabbed one to tell the truth I
already thought that it was clear from
my previous videos that the boss is not
in the same class as the JBL I mean it
they both might cause the same but the
boss is based on a very old design from
maybe four years five years ago when the
first sound link one was issued while
the JBL is a brand new unit not even
related or released in the US yet it's
water proof
splash proof it can charge external
devices has a huge battery built-in it
can be paired with another one for
stereo and so on while this is a simple
Bluetooth speaker designed like an old
well kitchen radio or something from the
70s anyhow I thought we should compare
how they sound I'm wearing binaural
microphones as usual so really please
listen with headphones as this is the
only way to give you a realistic
impression binaural recordings do not
work well through speakers because they
sound distorted the best way is to
listen with headphones this way you
should really get a nice impression
which one sounds well better or worse
and so on I will be starting with the
JBL extreme first I'm above half volume
slightly for both later on we will
increase volume and have a listen
suppose who has the troublegum again
extreme maybe another trick in the pose
it sounds weird
I mean wilt and mushy lately different
let's try this
the both travel again you can see the
classic radiators move nicely the pose
it's completely different sound wise
okay let's try this and I will increase
volume a little bit
the bows pick it up
I returned the postman tomorrow maximum
they do is big enogh
they're my seven my seven man this the
poses finger
let's try it another trick remember the
JDL is still quite a bit below maximum
while the boss is cranked to John J Bo I
will turn it for the maximum mode and
pose let's try another track still with
maximum volume for both pitch video just
no comparison
JBL again I'm not sure if it makes sense
to compare it more
I think the difference was more than
clear the boss sounded a bit mushy weald
undefined or well not even loud and as I
said the JBL is in a completely
different league or class the boss had
its years but now I think it's the JBL I
hope this video helped for all those who
asked for a comparison between these two
I mean the boss is a bit smaller it's
also maybe half a kilo lighter I don't
know but the JBL is definitely worth
this extra size and extra weight so
thanks for watching and bye bye
as I already know that the next request
would be outdoor outdoor make an altar
comparison I thought I'll make a short
stop crank pots because to the mixed
moon so this is for all of you
hardcore guys hey listen</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
