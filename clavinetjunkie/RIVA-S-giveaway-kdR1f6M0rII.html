with new develops peekers but i am
giving away one relays i have two of
them and i would like one of my
subscribers to get the other one but
instead of a simple referal i thought
about something special so please check
this out I thought about doing another
blind listening test again I selected
two different songs and as you can see
here are seven further speakers which
we'll all put against their us and
everyone who can name the rivers
correctly out of these two songs will
automatically come into the raffle which
we will do maybe in three or four weeks
but I have another special the first one
who can really pick out every single
speaker from both songs and name them
correctly will automatically get the
speaker without any reference without
anything but be careful because this is
really tough I think I wouldn't manage
either so I doubt we will have anyone
who will manage I hope anyhow we will
find one who has golden ears and wins
the speaker otherwise we will do the
raffle as always to participate pretty
simple please send me an email to Olaf's
gadgets at gmail com please no comments
this time about which speakers which
because if someone tries to give the
solution within the comments I will
immediately pull the video off and ya
know giveaways anymore because it's
unfair like in the previous video with
the toefl rocks to excess to give the
right answer within the comments please
send me an email the subject should be
river only river no River giveaway
simply river so I can really feel to
them easily yeah I hope we will manage
and yeah good luck please put up your
headphones now is this is a binaural
recording I will set up each single
speaker standing exactly in front of me
around one and a half meters away on a
table with me sitting at the sofa please
use the loudness of my voice as a rough
reference for the correct listening
level I'm starting with the first song
in the first speaker the song is from
Seoul personas latest album momentum so
let's have a listen
the second song is a rock track from
YouTube audio library I'm starting again
with the first speaker
you
