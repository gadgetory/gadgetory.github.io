found a winner for the denim in via
thanks a lot to all those who have
participated the right answer would have
been of course the JBL 54 which has
appeared most often in my videos 2017
it's indeed quite a decent speaker I
liked it a lot although after some time
it can become become annoying because of
the harsh well response so the only
solution is to add a modded as I have
shown in one of my videos or to use some
equalizer but we also have we also have
the one who knew all the videos where it
was featured 29 videos and the very
first one who found them all was Steven
from Davis in California so the speaker
will go to him congratulations Steven
also yeah thanks to all the others we
had some who found them all but Steven
was the very first one I think 12 hours
after I had posted the video he already
came up with a list showing me all
videos even I thought it was 28 but he
found another one and was indeed right
so the right answers is 29 videos for
the JBL flip for ya thanks a lot to all
the others who have participated as well
there can be only one winner so Steven
the speaker will go to you I hope you
will get it in the beginning of next
year in January or something I wish
everyone a Merry Christmas a great Happy
New Year and see you in the next video
and a nice time and bye bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
