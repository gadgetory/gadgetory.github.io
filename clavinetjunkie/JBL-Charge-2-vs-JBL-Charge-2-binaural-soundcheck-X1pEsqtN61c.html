we will check out how the new JBL charge
2 plus compares against their well old
or not so old
JBL charge - these are still the same
devices the JBL charge 2 plus is claimed
to be waterproof or water-resistant well
as you can see both have the rear ports
completely open unprotected I mean if I
look at some other water resistant or
waterproof speakers like for example
this calculus it has some welcome flap
also the Denon on via Mini has some flap
the TDK micro tract has some lab well
not so the JBL charge 2 plus therefore
i'm a bit well i'm sure about this water
resistance claim i don't want to go into
details because in reality nothing
changed at all the logo is now red
instead of the usual logo so if you need
some red like our dot you can get a red
JBL logo with the charge 2 plus but we
will concentrate more on the differences
between both regarding sound there are
many claims or on youtube on internet
from some other owners and video makers
that the two plus sounds better
it sounds more refined it sounds louder
with less compression and so on so well
I thought we will check this out if it's
really true um I'm wearing binaural
microphones as usual so please listen
with headphones to get the best and most
realistic sound image I will start with
the JBL charge 2 with the old one and
then switch over to the JB charge - plus
we'll have a listen if you hear some
differences and which one sounds better
and what do you think hmm let's try
something else
and which one is Spectre
well I measured both and oh this is the
measurement of the JBL charge two of the
old one
and as you can see the JBL charge two
plus measures are virtually identical
there is some slight higher treble or
boost but well it's I would say not
really or it's negligible I also thought
we will check them out at maximum volume
and as you can see the measurement is
still pretty much the same both measure
the same so let's have a listen to a
song at maximum volume and see if there
is some difference I'm starting again
with the charge tool
Oh fine for my ears and for the
measuring microphone there are still the
same devices so if you don't need this
red like a dot JBL dot sorry I would
save some money and buy the chair charge
- I hope this a little bit cleared up
some confusion regarding sound
differences between both thanks for
watching and bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
