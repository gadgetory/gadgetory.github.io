look at the GG mmm for some time ago if
I already heard it in a short audio
video again stage a bit extreme but as
the info is not just a simple Bluetooth
boombox but also as Wi-Fi included and
can be setup for multi room or stereo
with another one I thought we should
check out this as well in the meantime
ggmm also updated the m4 slightly with a
different tuning so when looking at the
frequency response measurements of both
versions you can see that the new one
has slightly more treble boost which
results in a clearer sound also extra
bass doesn't boost bass as much as it
did before
therefore the sound remains more
balanced even with extra bass enabled
therefore I would like to show you how
this sounds
later on we'll also compare the new GG
mm m4 against the JBL extreme and some
already asked how it compares against
the Harman Kardon going play which we
will do at the very end as always i'm of
course using binaural microphones so you
should listen with headphones let's turn
it on and it should connect to my
wireless network the new one is already
connected when the light becomes blue it
connects as well successfully and we can
start streaming some music they are both
available as airplay destinations yeah
now and you can see I have iPhone which
you would would play through the iPhone
speakers then I have the old one here
and the new one below let's start with
the old one and the kind of smooth red
track yeah there is some delay of 2 or 3
seconds also in switching from one to
the other for Wi-Fi it always takes a
bit of time
we can try this extra base button which
boosts the low-end quite a bit and I
will increase volume slightly let's try
the new one
also here with extra bass yeah this
happens sometimes the dropouts for
airplay but this seems to be a kind of
network problem let's try the old one
with extra bass again it's quite a bit
boom here
when you won again so now let's start
the ggmm f to set them up for multi room
we should go into settings both should
be available here yeah and if we enable
multi room both will play the same then
you can set left right or left and right
which in this case both are playing so
let's start music again and now you
should hear both and you could carry go
on to the kitchen or something because
now when controlling volume through the
player both will become softer or louder
but we can of course increase separately
on one player on one speaker
so now this one is louder which of
course is great for a for a multi-room
system here we had a short drop out
again and we can of course set them up
for left and right as well so the old
one will be the left channel the new one
the right channel and if we start music
again we should get a real stereo system
I will set apart slightly maybe let's
try a an acoustic jazz track yeah I
think you can hear that
oh really playing in stereo now but you
can still control volume separately
which of course doesn't quite make sense
so you should really have both set to
the same level to have a true stereo
yeah of course I will switch over to
Bluetooth which is pretty simple just
pressing the mode button and it
automatically jumps into bluetooth and
connects to my iPhone and we can check
how it sounds against the JBL extreme
first as you can see I set them up
slightly far away and we'll start with
the new version of the ggmm m4 and i
will be done on this extra base
the tribute extreme isolated King
let's try something else
the GBO you won't get the slow based
content of that video it simply doesn't
reach
I will turn off this extra place again
these tracks are already pretty basic
and let's try not attract some drum and
bass you can even hear the lowest place
notes here JBL extreme yeah there is
something wrong with the place here
simply left cannot render this without
the scorching and fall again
and our track and you can also do that
there is some nice stereo separation
from the m4 although it doesn't have
tweeters so it is not as clear as there
JBL but the bass is really impressive I
will increase volume to maximum the JBL
as well Tommy is hardening here is a
smaller slot but much fuller and hipper
sounding maybe that's right
particular extreme yeah clarity wise the
m4 cannot quite compete but the extreme
is also much harsher maybe let's try the
Harman Kardon go and play now of course
this is quite a bit unfair the Harman
Kardon going play is hundred euros more
expensive and is what I would call the
best sounding portable speaker currently
so the m4 has to compete against the top
performer in this class anyhow let's
have a listen and I will start again
with the m4
I can play a slightly lack of upper
treble parts not that bad at all
let's try now track go and play again
something else of course of X's due to
the lack of sweepers it becomes a little
bit much more muffled here the contiune
remains pretty consistent even move of
X's I will increase volume for maximum
on the go and play as well
Yates then bit softer it's right
you can play
and poured again
so yeah off-axis the difference becomes
pretty obvious but 499 still a great
performer and if you like bass I think
you've heard it much better than the JBL
extreme which has just some posted mid
bass but this which is much lower has
much more punch yeah
the lack of Twitter's is quite obvious
these are just some full range drivers
so it would have been better with three
toes probably but well it is as it is
and I think for 199 you cannot complain
you get the speaker equipped with
Bluetooth Wi-Fi a nice extra bass
function if you like bass a lot
especially at lower levels enabling bass
gives you this typical bose kind of
sound with boosted low-end yeah I think
it's a pretty decent speaker not too
heavy I think it's just - 300 grams
heavier than the JBL extreme the Harman
Kardon going play weighs one kilogram
more size-wise the difference is not
that big so yeah both are quite suitable
to be packed into some rucksack so yeah
I hope this was helpful for you to give
you an idea about the GM mm for the new
version is definitely an improvement it
has more clarity than before but still
real twitter's would have been better
maybe the next version m5 who knows
we'll probably have Twitter's or
hopefully yeah I didn't mount the grip
but you can see it has this leather grip
here so quite nice to carry around
thanks a lot for watching and we will
see us in the next video bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
