I am pretty sure most of you will have noticed that Dockin just introduced the new D Fine+ recently
I have it already here, this is the old one, so to say a successor
and I already got lots of inquires if I couldn't compare both
if the new one doesn't sound better, somehow different and so on
you have maybe seen my short spontaneous unboxing where I had played both side by side
and I think sound wise there is not much difference, but it comes with some changes that I would like to cove here
The first one is the inclusion of Apt-X
There are still some who claim that Bluetooth is only with Apt-X the real deal
I for my part hear no difference, at least not from an iPhone
here the streaming is probably done over AAC, but for those who need it, Apt-X is available now
The next change is a bigger battery which is built in now
the old one managed around 3:30h at maximum I think
here the new one should easily manage 5 hours which is also great
and the most imporant change is that it comes in a dual bundle now
as dual bundle it's also cheaper, as single unit it costs 179,€ the old one 139€.
as stereo bundle 329€
and in stereo both sound again considerably better
a single one plays already great
I had made lots of videos regarding the Dockin D Fine
sound wise there is not that much difference
but both lift the whole thing on an even higher level
I am quite surprised
and price wise alread more similar to the Teufel Boomster NG
so it would be interesting to see how they fare
First I thought we will compare a single one against the old Dockin D Fine
But first some measurements
here the D Fine+ at around half volume and here the old D Fine
and you can see they both still measure more or less the same
but there is a small difference in the 3khz area
you can see here the old one had rather a dip
the new one has this filled out although there is almost a small peak visible but we will see then if you can really hear this
moreover with the old D Fine you had the option to adjust the bass indirectly by the speaker volume
shown here is a measurement with the volume and bass reduced, by increasing volume on the player accordingly
you can see bass becomes more neutral, but there is this peak at around 130-140hz which makes the sound somehow boomy
at low levels both adjust bass dynamically, at high levels there is still not much difference, although it even seems as if the old one had even slightly more bass
but now I would like to demonstrate you this
as usual I will wear binaural microphones, also a headcam to offer you this first person kind of impression and also sound
you have to listen through headphones by all means, so put them on and let's have a listen
you can see I marked one of them with some sticky tape in order to distinguish them later when stereo paired.
this is the master to which I am connected directly, this will play the right channel later on
the other one is slave and will be left
but first let's compare this to the old Dockin D Fine if you can really hear any kind of difference
I will turn on this first, and mine still has voice prompts it is really first generation, the newer ones have tones
this one has also tones, unfortunately way too loud
particularly this tone, this is unacceptable
this is also my only point of criticism, I hope it can be turned off in future maybe with an update
but the tones are way too loud
and I will start with Analog form Soulpersona and Princess Freesia and the new Dockin D Fine+ playing first
loudness is exactly half, and volume is also in sync with the mobile phone, at least with iOS
and bass will also remain fullbodied at low levels
with the old one this is not the case, you could adjust bass indirectly with the speaker's volume
it only had maximum bass if volume was set to maximum
I will switch over
of course it plays with the standard default volume
and therefore sounds much thinner, I would have to turn it to maximum and reduce volume here accordingly
so that it becomes more comparable
but it's nice if someone finds the sound too bassheavy, you simply turn down volume here and the sound will become automatically thinner
I think it's a nice feature
I will switch over to the new one again
sounds of course fuller
but we want the full bass, therefore I will also increase it to maximum
it's a bit weird, but on the one hand nice to have the option for controlling bass indirectly depending on someone's taste
but on the other hand it's a bit.....
the new one
it maybe appears a bit softer
the problem is that loudness control is quite rough particularly at mid levels
if I increase it 1 step it already becomes louder by 5-6dB
unfortunately there are no steps in between
this means we will make this one softer now
now they should really be comparable
sorry, I am done! sitting here for 2 hours translating and writing english subtitles and I am not even close to half of this video. Sorry, but I can't anymore. It would take me another several hours to cover the entire boring video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
