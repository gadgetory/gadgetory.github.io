comparison of the new JBL charge-free
against some other speakers that many
were asking for like the Rivas then on
via mini pass to flip three and anchor
premium I thought I will cover them all
with one single song from soul persona
and I think this song represents the
whole frequency spectrum pretty well
from deepest bass up to highest treble
and you get a nice punchy sound well
depending on the speaker of course I
thought we will try the charge three
against the reverse first and then I
will try the other ones as well
I set a volume which is about half on
the on the charge free on the river is
we are already closer to maximum around
3/4 it's simply because the charge 3 is
so much louder than most of the others
so let's start with the charge 3 and
then I will switch over to the revised
you hear that their River s s being
closer to maximum already reduces bass
much more than the charge crease the
charge which is much more punchy I will
increase volume of the river is too well
maximum the charge three already louder
his fights still not being quite at
maximum
now let's take the maximum yet maybe
let's try the denim again charge three
first I'm back at slightly above hop
volume on the charge three the denim it
simply cannot offer this bunch of the
charge free
I will increase volume of course space
gets reduced more importance they
trapped three it's still much more
punchy at this one level I will increase
it for maximum
yeah you can also make change
only a check then on also maximum yet
maybe let's try the flip three volume is
back again close to half for the charge
three and although the flip three can
play louder than the denim at the same
time it sounds a bit thinner which we
will hear now
yeah it doesn't have this bunch of their
charge plate I will increase volume with
three as well you can hear how the bass
gets review lick we also mixing
raise your wits
yeah the flip 3 is nearly as loud but
simply with much less space let's write
that past - no I low add volume and
we'll start with the charge 3 again the
pulse 2 is a bit more punchy than the
flip 3 but yet it doesn't have any
chance regarding base response compared
to the charge screen
I was starting cursing volume the past
oh yeah I think you can hear the
difference
experimental maximum
here much fuller south of the
charge-free let's try the anchor premium
again starting with the charge free and
close to our volume the Inca premium
also about half volume now but I think
in here that it is not very clean the
base from start sounding strange
I was not increasing bottom bankers will
so you will hear the face from is not
random
again a dead star connection on email
sorry for that everyone wants Terry bias
I was trying to make some as well
already some distortion but let's check
how both sound at lower levels the
anchor adds some bass at low level
switch the JBL doesn't so the anchor
will definitely sound fuller JBL and it
doesn't something but it doesn't have
this bass boost
let's try lowest levels yeah it sounds
thinner
this sounds definitely factor so for
very low levels the anchor might be a
better choice but you've heard the
charge free was much louder than all of
these still pretty punchy at mixing
volume with very little distortion only
a little bit of inter modulation maybe
but depends what you want for outdoors
this is definitely the unit to go with a
perfect battery life I forgot it I got
more than six hours at maximum six hours
12 minutes which no one of these will
give you the reverse will give you about
four hours that then on around two and a
half I haven't tried the anchor but it's
also not very good with battery the flip
will give you 3:30 at 3:40 and I haven't
tested the pulse but you've heard no one
of these was as loud and as punchy as
the JBL so thanks for watching I hope
this was helpful for anyone who wanted
to hear them all I hope this video could
give you this I'm sorry I don't have
much more time to well to do something
better so we'll do some other videos
soon
until now I hope this was enough have a
nice time and bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
