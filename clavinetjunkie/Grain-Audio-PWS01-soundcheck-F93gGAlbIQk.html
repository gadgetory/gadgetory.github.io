audio PWS 0-1 I know this is not the
newest speak anymore but I was curious
to hear it since the very beginning
since it was still a Kickstarter
campaign I think this was 2 or 3 years
ago and it was released about the same
time when the first bose soundlink mini
was released as well it still costs 249
and I think it's a bit overpriced
especially if you compare it against
their current lineup of portable
speakers back then when there was still
the gem box on top and so on it was
really decent I mean it was much more
serious sounding than those but now with
the Riva s the JBL judge 2 and
everything else it simply cannot quite
compete especially for the price I mean
it has a nice wooden body as you can see
charging is done through microUSB but it
has some slight issues that I would like
to show you that it simply cannot be
quite on top let's turn it on maybe you
heard it already
the tones don't seem to come directly
from the speaker but somewhere outside
this is pretty impressive
it comes I don't know maybe it already
has some kind of processing but the
first time I turn it on I was really
surprised a web stick the sound coming
from here or here but in reality this is
the front and the first issue I would
like to show you is that ya volume is
not in sync between iPhone or any other
player and speaker so let's have a
listen to a track from sole persona and
you will hear how the sound changes
depending on if I turn volume higher
here or from the iPhone this should
usually not happen now the speaker is at
maximum and I turned volume slightly
nowhere on the iPhone
but we will do the opposite I will turn
on volume down and turn volume up from
the iPhone and you hear the sound
becomes teeny teeny and compressed again
turning lower on the iPhone and turning
up on the speaker and you get all the
bass this is quite annoying as you
should keep the volume of the speaker
always had maximum and just control it
from there on the player to get best
results otherwise the sound simply won't
well won't be true so the other issue is
I will take the reverse as reference I
will put them slightly offset so that
the river can breath it has drivers at
the side as well so it can create its
well kind of surround sound and the
problem is the grain audio uses necks
audio processing which seems to be
implemented in well clumsy way it
produces some what I would call
artifacts the bass is never never clean
you hear some buttons that are simply
not present in the original recording
and I'm pretty sure that this is the
result of Mac's audio or Mac's based
processing which is also included in the
Anker premium speaker and in the gem
heavy metal they all have similar issues
that denill in via me for example has
also makes only processing but it
doesn't have these problems it's
probably a better implementation of this
algorithm the grain audio PSP wsa-01 was
still maybe in an early stage and yeah
let's have a listen instead of March
talking I will start with some kind of
jazzy track and have a listen to the
bass and everything
I will turn to the river the base is
completely clean
this track is not so prone for this
problem but it will hear this later with
other tracks again Reva you can hear
that their brain audio has a pretty well
solid tuning so it doesn't sound any in
any way off it has maybe even slightly
nicer treble or upper mids than the
relays
let's have a listen to a Tchaikovsky
track
the Sun stage of the Rivas is quite a
bit larger
it has more uh permits you can hear this
let's listen to some smooth jazz track a
sound similar I mean both are rather
tuned for a flat response without any
artificial boost but demanding ears will
already hear that the bass drum together
with the bass well it makes some strange
the river places a bit cleaner that's
right not a track yeah you hear it now
the river
there is something going on which is
well not quite there that's the super
district yeah ii will i will try this
again with the river here nothing of
this strange droning which is simply not
present in the original recording
okay the base
it's a mess and bacey mess you don't
hear it with all tracks and I mean you
have to be sensitive for these problems
that's right now track the relays place
this how it was recorded this is not
well it shouldn't be there
that's why not a track I will turn both
to maximum so that you also hear the
maximum loudness difference
yes this is I think quite a difference I
will turn off surround for the river I
think it becomes even slightly louder
without
I mean it does not distort but it's
quite a mist the river also has this
decide drivers which make it appear
clearer also from higher angles that
list maybe put some kind of house track
difference in loudness yeah
also from the side the river to remain
straight loud
let's listen to another dance track from
Salta scoffs I just wanna know no
copyright sounds yeah everything so
personal you they both are the same
loudness not anymore to hurt that
compressor kicked in they could hear the
volume drop again
but the rivers also struggling a little
bit ravenous dragon it's a pretty heavy
recording yeah I think you could hear I
mean the basic sound and tuning is
pretty decent I mean it sounds very
nicely full-bodied clear still without
any artificial frequency boosts but
there is something inside well it
struggles I don't know the bass is never
clean with some tracks it sounds okay
but if you listen closely you will hear
that that it's not right I mean
especially compared against the revised
which cost exactly the same but has much
more features it can charge external
devices you can pair it with another one
you can control it with the with the
River app and so on yeah it's not quite
there yet and I contacted I tried
contacting great grain audio and they
told me it's probably defective which I
don't think I mean these are typical
artifacts of Max bass audio processing
that I know from other speakers so it
would need some kind of firmware update
but it will probably never happen yeah I
hope it was helpful give you a kind of
first impression about the grain audio
PWS zero one I think it's wasted
potential unfortunately it's really
great I love this design and it sounds
nicely full-bodied at low levels as well
very heavy really the bass which is
quite deep but you heard you never get
really clean and high fight yon sound so
thanks for watching and yeah we will see
us then have a nice time and bye bye
hmm I don't know maybe just needs a bit
more of burning</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
