welcome to a review of the keV Grady one
the latest portable Bluetooth speaker
from keV in collaboration with Porsche
Design
after the keV Muir the Kebra t1 is the
second portable bluetooth speaker by keV
and one of the most premium products on
the market right now currently it cost
around 380 dollars or euros and it comes
in a very beautiful packaging as you can
see there is a charger included also a
USB wire so the speaker can be charged
by micro USB it can also act as power
bank to charge external devices and
hence we is included as well but I would
rather like to concentrate on sound and
technical details as a little bit has
changed compared to the key from you on
the Cape grade you want still consists
of the same two drivers one of them
being a unique u driver but now they are
positioned aiming upwards to give you a
more on the directional sound so
regardless from where you listen you
should get more less the same sound
thanks to the unique u driver which
consists of a Twitter together with a
buffer you will really get a nice sound
dispersion also off axis and compared to
the cave Muir the capability one now has
two passive radiators built in which
work in an opposing way to minimise
vibrations the cave Muir vibrated quite
a lot because of the mass of the
vibrating Pasiphae that of course we
would like to hear how it sounds but
first maybe let's check out some
frequency response measurements you can
see one measured exactly on axis with
the driver and you can see that it
measures really nicely flat but bass
already starts to roll off above hundred
Hertz and there is a slight downward
tilt towards treble so the speaker
misses a little bit clarity if we have a
look at some curves measured off axis
with an angle of 45 and 90 degrees you
can see that there is still some tread
loss despite the unique you driver so
the speaker definitely sounds best when
aimed directly at the listener at low
levels there is no kind of dynamic bass
adjustment so at low levels that cave
gravity 1 can sound a little bit tinny
of course I would like to demonstrate
you the sound how it sounds in reality
as always I will be using a head cam and
binaural microphones you should listen
with headphones as binaural recording to
acquire
headphones for the best results so
please put your headphones up and let's
have a listen first I thought
compare the cap Grady won against a show
me miss pika although price-wise not
quite comparable as this cost may be
1/10 of the cap I think this is still a
nicely balanced and neutral sounding
speaker I will start with the calf Grady
one first so please have a listen let's
link back and increase volume or not
and although the show Mimi is not a
non-directional speaker I will also
place it flat so that it emits more
upwards just like the calf and let's try
maybe another track so now the show me
also works in a more only direction away
it doesn't have any Twitter's but still
their dispersion is really nice yet the
calf may be abuse lightly fuller but
also a little bit more colored maybe
so here may be a bit unfair to compare
it against a very cheap speaker so I
have another one and this is the Vava
voom 20 but it's also more a low-budget
device so this you can get this for 60
maybe 70 dollars so let's have a listen
how these two compare also not an
omnidirectional speaker but still I
think it's a nicely balanced neutral
sounding one I will start again with the
calf great one and another trick
oh I love for summer days when I'm with
you
why thoughts so much to say and not a
lot to do
yeah not wreck tired to get
to simulate a non-directional sound and
make them more comparable I will place
the album airing upwards so let's listen
to them again like this starting with
the calf
and although the bottom 20 is not meant
to be used like this I think it performs
really nicely here even as
omnidirectional speaker
we could of course try the opposite
placing the cave like this in a more
traditional way and let's listen again
take another track I will play a dance
track increase volume to maximum at the
volume 20 as this doesn't have any new
road or sync volume control and let's
listen to them at maximum this is the
capability one now yeah mixing volume
the volume 20 also maximum
you
yeah the relevant esports quite a bit
more of also manages to retain more base
this one starts to compress a little
late in our track but no distortion it
remains me nicely restrained from all
the album is five some slight dirtiness
SDHC are using this becomes really teeny
sounding i think you could do it well
the cap great one doesn't sound bad in
any way
in fact it remains fully controlled
regardless of volume level even if
maximum there is no distortion at all
but it has a tendency to sound a bit
tinny especially at low levels as there
is no dynamic bass adjustment and
despite the omnidirectional design and a
non-unique you driver there is still
significant treble loss when listened
effects is so it sounds best when aim
directly at the listener I'm not sure
the really high price tech is justified
on sound alone you can get similar or
better sound for much less but it's
still a great looking and great design
speaker but probably more a
business-class speaker yeah I hope my
review and soundcheck could give you an
idea and some insight about the cave
grady one i hope you will join me again
in another video until then stay tuned
have a nice time and bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
