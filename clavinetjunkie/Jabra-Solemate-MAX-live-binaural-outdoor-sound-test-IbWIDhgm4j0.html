as you can see winter is back and I was
so stupid to carry this big brick around
with me now I know why they added this
grip because it's really heavy it didn't
fit inside my rucksack but I have the
the Yui mega bomb inside I have my
camera inside and I have the Bose
Soundlink wireless music system inside
it's only that the Jabra saw make max
didn't fit in
it's too large last time we've heard how
the Jabra song with Max sounded at
normal listening levels indoors and now
I thought we will try how it sounds at
maximum volume outdoors if it can fill
the space as you can see there's the UE
mega bomb that we already tested before
I thought we will test them again and I
have my Bose Soundlink wireless music
system which i think is a good contender
okay we will turn them on connected and
let's start with the summit Max and turn
it to the maximum
sonic next life another slightly more
Distortion
well noble vomit max
mega boom
till song with Max no makeup on
yeah it's a bit softer for sure it's
also smaller okay so we'll try the
Soundlink wireless music system now
let's see if the boss can make the
village dance we'll start again with the
Jabra and turn it to the maximum
hmmm let's see how we can go before they
break up connection both again
it's quite a distance let's try another
trick again Jabra soulmate
again to oppose pushes it a bit far but
it's much louder I think the Jabra
soulmate makes is not a bad speaker as
we've heard it's really balanced
sounding but it's completely missing
base and it's oversized and overpriced
the mega boom well yes there is some
boom it's also expensive but it's nice
small and you can nearly put it inside
the jacket pocket the boss is a
completely different story but post
decided to discontinue this model maybe
you can get a used one somewhere I hope
this video could help a little bit make
your own decision see you next time bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
