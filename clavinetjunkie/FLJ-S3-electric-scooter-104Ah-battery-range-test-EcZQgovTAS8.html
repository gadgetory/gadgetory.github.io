do a reach this for the fmjs three
electric scooter this is available and
the different brand names but my
original battery broke after 130
kilometers I have a completely new
battery inside and this time I really
want to know how far it will take me the
company claims I think 35 kilometers
yeah I would be glad if it reaches 20
with my weight around hundred kilograms
but instead of a long ride with me
talking I thought I will do a time-lapse
it's quite windy so not the perfect
conditions for all your recordings
anyhow so yeah I have my boss here to
play some music and let's go
so the scooter turned off after around
one hour I should have done maybe 20 21
kilometres yeah it's a bit far away from
the claimed 35 but still quite okay I
think yeah with my weight hundred
kilograms maybe with 60 kilograms you
should get there 30 kilometers and not
you about 35 but there are new scooters
a new generation coming up this is the
s3 the s5 has a dual motor system so at
the back is also a motor and it should
also take higher slopes maybe you
noticed with a little bit of a higher
steeper parts
it became slow quite a lot so it slowed
down the new one the s5 yeah it should
be released next week or two weeks it
should be much stronger if I get the
chance to test the new generation
scooter I will of course do another pest
like this I hope you liked it yeah I
have to go to the car maybe one
kilometer one and a half thanks for
watching and see you in the next video
bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
