a package some minutes ago I unboxed it
and I was blown away so I thought I
should share this with you immediately
this is their dose soundbox XL or they
call it home speaker it's a level on
Amazon for $90 and yeah I thought it's
some kind of torture on expose eggs you
know you cannot quite see the size but
actually it's quite big it comes in a
box like this obviously there is some
charger included because it needs a 12
volts input
it also has TF card or micro SD playback
and yeah we should start to this annuity
as I think this is the speaker for
summer 20 2017 or yeah the speaker for
$90 you'll have to get because it blows
away everything else I've heard yeah I
thought we'll compare it to the charge 3
which caused a little bit more is also
smaller but if you don't care about the
size but simply want the best back for
your bang for your buck then I think
that those sound box Excel is the
perfect one my unit I had some listening
has some issues there is some rattling
I'm not sure if all of these all of them
have this but I hope not but let's have
a listen to the first track from sake
some princess region and the sound box
Excel will be playing first and problem
is not thang so to help increase volume
speaker to make more progressed entire
volume range so this is the sauce on box
XL
they're charged green yet for speaker at
451 nothing pretty impressive I think
this is crazy good without any strong
coloration simply not right so this is
what a kind of played onstage today we
really get some their image in here the
charts we found somehow broken here
whoa this is really if you were
listening to something not only much
larger but but much more expensive what
I noticed is the confidence the colors
may be affected part a charge please not
very much better affected feel very nice
clear calm
let's check this you can maybe get a net
link for particular frequencies closet
rattle I think that might be some defect
so I will of course every change
I hope not all of them Arabic trash we
don't rejoice against is not this
rattling this is simply a must have yes
I do
what are some life-threatening but the
trustful and ridiculous exactly I don't
think it's a lot of stick around but I
think it might be louder in the charge
to him it's also quite a bit larger so I
think you column a maximum prison all
the trash cream also load by is credible
so this is a sound perfectly slightly
louder than the traffic until it's not
an loudness king or something but I
think for normal levels it should even
sound better than many other more
expensive because let's try the the
arena from River which I'm quite
impressed with but I think it it doesn't
have a chance against the doors here
also because it's a little bit more
diffuse let's wait until it connect and
again with the DOS on books Excel
another track from surface on princess -
yeah
in it how changes slightly the driver
thing to be slightly directional
let's try the reverse incremental cost
350 including battery
it's more direct
very nice critiques on here
let's try something I also focus on
apprentice Rijo sailors to me tell it to
me give me your knife doesn't act just
arouses in the earth okay there's one
box of trophies powerful pepper if you
can consider threatening very very steep
Bank of Italy everyone there's something
in the me
of course the river should keep this
level up to maximum which and all
success tillery's comes like this
reduction entire address of let's
increase volume again the river as well
so much louder
don't make those kind of completes deal
they're very very impressive for to get
for $90 here yeah I'm quite a bit
shocked if not this rattling here I
trusted it with some sentence so there
is some issue
let's try so this is obviously there you
are
no it's the door sound box so there's no
rattling and now it's touch I'm not I'm
not sure if this is really if this
affects all unit let's try part it still
is not the rattling it plays 42 Hertz I
mean it still vibrate I can feel it
shaking my hand so yeah check it out the
link is in my video description I think
for $90 it will be hard to get something
much better if you don't mind the
slightly another larger size but it's
not very heavy so it's much lighter than
the river I assume it will be one point
two three kilograms and so it's a really
great speaker let's test this this how
to turn it off some tones but not too
annoying I think this is the speaker for
summer 2017 definitely one of the best
I've heard in this price range if not
this wrapping issue I will of course
escrow replacement and I hope the new
unit won't have this but to check it out
for everyone who need something cheap
with great sounds I think that dose is
currently the best one so I hope this
was helpful and there is not only one
review here on Amazon so it's not that
now just well so his world about as well
you can see 34 head so it's really a
speaker that impresses I already noticed
that there is no dynamic bass adjustment
loaded but it still sounds full because
the bass has some slight hump so bass is
deep and and slightly boosted which
everyone probably likes also hurt it's
quite clear natural
thanks for watching and yeah check it
out see you in the next video bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
