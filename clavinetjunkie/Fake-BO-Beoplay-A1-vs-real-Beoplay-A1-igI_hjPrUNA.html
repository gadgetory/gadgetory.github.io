worry or some fake bangles from the play
once because they are still being sold I
saw them on any expression some other
Chinese online stores going for around
Hanna dollars or actually not that cheap
the meantime they are not that easy to
be found but I'm sure there are still
many allowed especially on the used
market so buyers beware here I have one
I got it from a friend who was taken by
some cheater pretending to sell Aaron
used one yeah in fact it's a copy
replica fake or whatever but it's not
that easy to discern real differences
compared to the real one you just notice
that the back material is more rough on
the real one but it also feels a bit
lighter maybe but even the packaging
they copied everything perfectly so
without that comparison it's really not
easy to say this one is fake you will
notice it if you turn it on and listen
to their first tones because it sounds
really crappy and here I would like to
demonstrate you how it sounds
we will also do some measurements later
on therefore is always I'm using
binaural microphones you should listen
at headphones to hear the real
differences so please put them up and
let's ever listen to both I will turn
both on first the fake one you can see
the LED is pretty dark the real one is
much brighter also the tones are
different and I will play some tracks
from so person√≠s latest band can
release which are some studio versions
of his fast and forward album I will
start with the fake one first so please
listen
[Laughter]
everyone
yes not even close
response winning tickets ready
imaginable and touch it evolved this
completely hollow and horrible yes
sounds just really ugly typical price me
make them volume this is an alternative
version of focus on of analog and that
face a one is already playing the close
for maximum is missing exceptional now
there everyone way louder
scared of God I think you could feel it
the fake a1 is nowhere close to the
original it doesn't resemble the
original venue dollars or something
anyway
it's right on the level of that twenty
thirty dollars because so pretty crappy
we can of course also have a look at
some figures response measurements the
fake one in green and the real one in
gray and you can see there is no bass
some strange dip in the needs and tread
is also quite undefined so it's really
extreme to ask hundred dollars for it
just because it looks like the original
so buyers beware if you are going to buy
a used a one be sure to get it from a
trusted source yeah I'm quite a bit
shocked how well it's made but how
crappy it sounds they all also try to
copy the status tones but you can hear
that already these sound it because of
course the Benelux annette doesn't
recognize the speaker so this is also a
sign that it's not a real genuine one
yeah i hope this was helpful in a bit
yeah if you purchase an a.1 yeah please
be careful otherwise it's definitely a
great speaker just having a big battery
problems maybe so thanks a lot for
watching and have a nice time bye bye
I will turn both on first a fake one you
can see there it is
quite a bit dark cherry one is much
brighter also the tones are bit
different and I will play a track from
soap it's the support of the key to
toggle the latest
Ashlock is much brighter also the tones
also the tones also the tones also the
tones about the problem we have the
different pounds for mouth to borrow
super we hope the difference cope and I
will play a track from so personas
latest when can release which is an
intro in the interesting shall get a
comment</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
