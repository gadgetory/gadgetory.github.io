chromosome maybe remember not so long
ago I already reviewed a camisa speak a
bigger one this one is more pocket-sized
it's called c9 so let's check it out on
Amazon first you can see it costs $15 so
not that expensive available in
different colors and here it says mini
size powerful sound fool high def sound
impressively crystal clear sound quality
robust bass and so on and so on it seems
to be quite popular there 167 customer
reviews most of them are five-star so
let's have a look at this this one says
what the peep how does this thing sound
so good or amazing big part from a tiny
package very good sounding micro
portable bluetooth speaker great speaker
for the shower
holy moly this thing isn't sad excuse
for a speaker not at all or like my keys
this beauty is compact but surprisingly
loud love this speaker love it awesome
so it looks quite promising and I
thought we should check it out how it
sounds as always i'm of course using
binaural microphones therefore you
should listen with headphones i will
play some tunes and we will hopefully
hear how it sounds in reality i will
turn it on yes sounds a bit broken maybe
and let's play the first team it's
already cut off the first second let's
try it again yes something is missing
maybe some noise gate switch here cuts
out the silent parts of a song well but
the sound is far from being amazing or
awesome it sounds pretty crap if you ask
me
very harsh soundings he needs no base so
really not what I was expecting from
these videos but maybe you can fix this
maybe remember my cover that I used to
mod my JBL Freeport will put this on top
and see if it becomes any better well
still not so let's pull up a second
layer yeah I think it's a bit better now
but I think it could still get along
with a third layer if we have three
layers no and now it sounds much more
balanced although upper treble is
missing so maybe let's check out some
frequency response measurements and you
can see it measures really funny like
some slight or something yo'ii the sound
only consists of treble and there is a
peak at 10 kilohertz
unfortunately no upper travel the basis
rather anemic I would say if we put up
one layer of this cover here it reduces
travel a bit but still not enough two
layers become even better and three
layers the sound becomes really balanced
still no real upper trail
so the speaker would definitely need
some modding in order to make it sound
good but I will play it without cover
now and let's compare it to something
else maybe this TDK track meaning here
ao8 i bought it for an 8 year old so
even cheaper than this it's maybe not as
portable and not that great looking I
mean vs. pink plastic but I think
despite not being something decent this
sounds much much better so let's listen
again starting again with this camisa c9
it's increased volume and it did
30 DK you can hear it sounds much more
make sure oh it's already mentioned it's
nothing special but simply stand still
way better this is just horrible let's
right now trick is more than obvious
yeah maybe ash another trick
this one is from so persona in princess
Frieza and unreleased track yes really
has a nice body nothing outstanding but
simply much more pleasant to listen all
you MS not synced by the way so we will
have to increase volume to maximum here
in order to hear how loud you can play
how you can call this combination is
really a mystery for me
trying to be good come on attract and
let's see if we can really play as loud
as the people claim so let's increase
volume to maximum yeah this is the
result decay track we need maybe not as
loud but here it's completely clean
without any kind of distortion or
so yeah it's what I would say a crappy
speaker yeah as crappy as it can be so
I'm really not sure about all these
ratings again I know that people are
therefore maybe they think that you
cannot expect more for $15 but this is
really horrible it looks great it's nice
and a mean finish also water resistant
waterproof let's see how this below here
just a USB I think it doesn't even have
accessory here it is but still a crappy
speaker I mean horrible sound is really
really belongs to the worst I've heard
you can all also check it out in my
speaker audio database I included it and
you will hear against some others most
because how crappy it sounds so I really
don't know how all these ratings can be
yeah I hope this was helpful a very
short review of the Camino c9 speaker I
would definitely yeah stay away from
this it sounds creepy I hope this was
helpful thanks for watching and see you
in the next video stay tuned and bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
