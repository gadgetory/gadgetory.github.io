the brand-new JBL charge 3 maybe you
remember last year I already presented
the JBL extreme and I think it became
something like a class leader for the
larger portable speaker market now the
JBL charge 3 will probably again turn
the smaller class upside down like the
JBL extreme did as you can see this is
the JV a charge - so the charge 3 is a
bit larger but still pretty compact it
gained also new features one of them
being completely waterproof so tossing
it into water shouldn't do anything it
should still work well it can charge
external devices just like the old
version did and new of course is JBL
connect so it can connect to another one
wirelessly for stereo it can also
connect with the JBL extreme with the
JBL pulse 2 and the JBL flip 3 and i
think it's a really great sounding
device i mean it's not what I would call
for analytical critical listening but
take it outdoors toss it into the
rucksack put it into sand and crank some
tunes and it should do the trick I mean
it's really loud it's much louder than
that JBL charge - we will test this
later on with a short track and I think
it sounds great at maximum and what I
also think is that it already scratches
a bit at the higher class at the larger
class like they both sounding 3 for
example the Huey mega boom which usually
costs twice as much the JBL charge 3
should cost 149 the original price for
the mega boom is 299 although the price
went down lately
maybe nobody wanted to buy it no I'm
joking but will you of course compare it
against some other speakers like the
maybe UE boom but I don't think this can
compete so I will probably put it
directly against their mega boom I will
put it if of course against the Bose
Soundlink mini - also the larger both
sounding 3 we will have a listen against
a charge tool for everyone who wants to
know
how much better the new unit is and what
surprised me really a lot is how
balanced it sounds compared to the JBL
judge tool we all know that the charge
too has quite a bit boosted bass and
lots of treble and at higher levels it
starts to compress so the sound is not
really loud but simply you get this
pumping effect but it sounds much more
balanced now at low levels all the bass
heads maybe even a bit disappointed
because it doesn't have this this I
don't know this drive at low levels but
crank it a bit higher when the JBL
charge to already struggles and this
goes still pretty strong
of course it cannot compete with the JBL
extreme then the base of the extreme is
much more boosted this is really
balanced I was surprised to hear that
JBL rather unit for a flatter response
not this Bumi smiley bass treble sound
but really nice and yeah I think this
thing will definitely turn the entire
Bluetooth speaker market upside down of
course I would like to show you how it
sounds against the JBL charge too when
both played maximum so please put up
your headphones and we will have a short
listen please put up your headphones
noise this is binaural recording I will
place them here the charge 2 is already
playing at maximum while the JBL charge
3 is at about 2/3 I'm starting with the
charge 2 first
you can already hear because volume
pumping the church 3 and I will start
increasing volume this is maximum now
the charge - yeah this is quite a
difference I think you are as impressed
as I was when I heard it the first time
of course this was not meant to be any
kind of full review just the very first
trod impression and to give you an idea
what to expect from the new version
compared to the old JBL charge - which
is so popular
of course many more comparisons will be
coming also against the JBL extreme so
please be patient a little bit stay
tuned for more have a nice time and bye
bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
