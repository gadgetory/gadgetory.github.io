bank you'll travel to electrostatic
portable speaker after the old bank a
pure water which I've reviewed some
years ago also they're smaller make you
travel OS this is the newest release
from them and it has some nice new
features like - therapy with another one
they're also claiming to have improved
bass response improved sound although
that acoustic design still more is the
same with two dynamic drivers to
electrostatic panels that you can flip
in for transport so it's smaller or free
ball for this multi rate magic sound
also comes with this nice optional
stance you can really aim it at you
because electrostatic panels are quite
directional and I thought we will take a
more detailed listen compared against a
more ordinary dynamics become this is
that
tribute make sound class but keep in
mind this is only 55 or 56 dollars why
this around three hundred dollars so we
will see if the electrostatic technology
has some advantage here I will put this
away and create my head cam for this
emergency first person view and sound of
course you should listen with headphones
if you haven't put them up already
please do now and let's have a listen we
will listen to a single one now is a
stereo setup with two is already around
$600 so 10 times the price of the trivet
a little bit unfair and I set them up
like this so we can sit exactly centered
I will play some music starting with the
banker traveler tune and the first thing
you notice is that volume is not in sync
so you have to increase volume to make
small the speaker to have the entire
volume range from here and Bank you
claims it to be perfect for acoustic
high-quality recording so let's listen
to something a little bit more jazzy
maybe there are three different sound
modes this is pure this is warm you can
see it flashes red
blue is vivid I think but the difference
is not huge this Bulls treble this is
again pure and you can hear it's quite
directional I will switch over to the
trivet you can hear the banker has more
emphasis on the upper mids but it's not
necessarily flat sounding the trivet is
completely flat has a flat response
while this sounds a little strange let's
write this track and as soon as you move
out of the sweet spot in spite the stand
here it's still quite directional and to
be lost all treble now although it also
plays to the back
you get the best sound exactly on axis
so have to get really gets down like
this nigga at ribbit here this nozzle
but it's not necessarily more detailed
or somehow faster
and all that travel was this definition
when I move around so it sit like this
attribute
maybe this
it's also directional but are not as
strong and you can hear that bass is
just some other bass so something we
follow there's also a nice our FIFA bass
despite being remedy one won't Curtis
sighs so I'm not impressed
change my sony this is the problem here
this is warm this is Phoebe
this one's my balance and let assembly
it's messy we also hear way more dynamic
you can hear all attacks while the bank
you somehow and swallows them the
hypostatic panels cannot reproduce those
attacks I will switch again to pure
which is their standard setting itself
despite the stand and helps to get down
like this for
so that private sounds way modified
without any electrostatic moodle going
around here
it sounds weird to me maybe this listen
to some more modern politician on top
volume while here we are tonight so
let's hear what happens if increase
volume this is the wave all up oh boy
what is some distortion at the base is
just droning so I'm really not quite
sure where the advantage of this
electrostatic technology should be here
I'm disappointed and you could hear it
as well this ordinary cheap Chinese
speaker completely outperform the
electrostatic one so I'm not quite sure
where the advantage of this
electrostatic technology should be on
the contrary it's quite directional so
you really have to listen
exactly Onix is to get the best sound
and even then it was not perfect it had
some issues with dynamics reproduction
it cannot reproduce as transients well
there is some dynamics processing in
reality it's not an acro static but an
electric speaker an electrostatic
spectrum would need an external high
power source to be applied to the panel
where here the electric source is
already within the speaker so it's not
an electrostatic but an electric one but
yeah the opposite of an electret
microphone but this doesn't work for a
speaker you could hear it has some
issues it can't play loud and the tire
levers there is some compression so I'm
quite underwhelmed to telephone I even
think that the first one sounded better
although it didn't have that great bass
that
electrostatic panel had some nice
resolution sunrise magic why this one
somehow lost it you can of course
compare it for my databases included the
first Thank You Tripoli tetravaal honest
and the traveler tool I only recorded it
with the normal what is it pure Sun
setting the other ones phone service
sound right vivid is way too harsh while
warm is to muffled and you could hear or
you would hear that the first one I
think even the traveler s sounds somehow
more convincing but the whole concept is
flawed in my opinion it's not an
electrostatic speaker but an electret
one I mean am i an electret microphone
works well but you cannot transform this
into a speaker so it's a little bit of
air yeah wrong wrong approach I would
say and even I mean look at the size of
the speaker it's nearly the size of a
FIFA stinky and it still cannot
reproduce wheelbase I mean this at
electrostatic panels they are quite
small but inside here this is still way
bigger than this and this is much nicer
base so I'm not sure why Bank you cannot
at least produce some real bass some
nice bass battery base you would hear it
hilarious it was just some droning and a
distorted one so yeah I didn't even
bother to measure it but you could hear
too much upper base also too much upper
mids it's not easy to measure it
probably have to measure only the panels
or outside out to us from some distance
but the trivet which is the completely
flat response yes sound it also when I
survey my natural so this is my take on
the treble of to I think it's even worse
than the first one
although maybe bassist improved slightly
its overall yes dead back what I would
say yeah feature is nice but who would
pay $600 for two of them
I'm not sure design-wise of course quite
unique so they look like some structure
they would look nice in some some
lawyer's office stainable desk also with
this golden ring here I think it looks
very nice but the sound is just not
worth it you can get much better
software $56.00 let alone from speak
like that they don't
I didn't want to include the denim
because the denim would completely blow
this away so I took this cheap speaker
here which is still one of the best in
this class in this anybody here it's way
way better than the electrostatic magic
speaker whatever yet check it through my
check it out from a database compare it
to some others because to the old one to
the treble s they also somehow different
I still think the first one despite some
dynamic issues which is born to the
volume to the same volume control so now
they got rid of this simple control but
there is still something exposition you
can especially do it with the first read
the hi-hats have some strange kind of of
reverb which is not included in the
recording compare it against some other
speaker then on variety will hear that
the traveler pool sounds yeah make
something completely different out of
this trap yeah I hope this was helpful
anyhow thanks all for watching until the
next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
