as you can see something is new this
time yeah the room is new no no I mean
something else okay my hair is also new
no but look again exactly the packages
are new they just arrived today and I
thought I would like to share the
content with you some maybe already know
what's inside but I would like to do
some kind of life unboxing but unlike
last time I don't want to use any head
cam to avoid showing you the messy room
here but I will set up the camera on a
fixed position but still use my binaural
microphones to give you a kind of life
impression so please put up your
headphones and we will have a look
inside
I thought we will start with well what
this one just might interesting
so this is their calf mule or how is it
called keV Muir the most expensive
portable premium speaker yeah
it looks as it was open it was not
opened so we will open it the first time
that I'm obsessed with high-resolution
yeah well quite hefty
wrapped into some oil or something what
else is inside we have there well the
power supply with different blocks and
so on some manual and what is this usual
USB USB wire nothing else so really
nothing fancy I think the most
interesting part is a Quadra speaker but
let's have a look what does it say
pure kept sound ingenious new miniature
unique you driver erase blah blah blah
powerful base so yeah of course we want
to hear this powerful base I think this
is the power button
oh how sweet they're dating
let's try connecting keV
Mew or more Moo no no keep in mind that
you are he you are hearing what I'm
hearing but the image is of course
coming from the camera so it might look
a bit strange to hear the sound I mean
it sounds nice but I'm not that
impressed and the volume is not even in
sync with with the iPhone so you have
two separate volume controls
this is mixing volume on the speaker and
now I can
it seems to be directional I mean why
having a unique uses and the best thing
is I can only hear something from here
it appears to be mono only this driver
is playing something interesting well
let's have a look into if the other one
what could that be
and what do we have inside mmm
valetti yeah they're good
oh no just kidding
I think you can already see it this is
their long-awaited Riva turbo no real is
sorry river without s River with a true
bond but with s so let's try this as
well also very premium one more
well not as expensive as their calf but
249 makes it a bit more expensive than
their Soundlink me for example or well
some other ones that I realize get
started turn on the unit by sliding the
battery switch to green press the power
button for one second
and wait a few seconds for the startup
tone blah blah blah but at least some
nice back here carrying back even with
some carabiner carabiner how do you call
it in English and a great manual with
all available languages Oh what is it
no just some Quick Start Guide blah blah
blah then what we have then there is
also a charger well this is pretty big
one this is really a big one unfortunate
cannot be charged through microUSB well
but let's have a look if it's if it has
some charge left so not to mix up
anything this is the rebound this is the
careful so let's look inside wow that's
nice it's smaller and then the calf it's
quite a bit smaller I mean maybe volume
from the capacity and volume they are
maybe equal but the calf definitely
gives a bigger impression so where is
this battery switch on/off yeah green
means full
Tim Tim
so pairing mode I am in pairing mode
I mean Perry moved hot mood so here it
is paired and let's have a listen again
and hear the volume should be
obligatory soap
I have the impression as if the river s
was really much broader sunrise the calf
gives a little bit of mono sound
let's put them like this yeah okay this
is just a first impression but you
already see what will be coming up next
yeah we have the camera here we have the
real s here we have some other speakers
like that Bose Soundlink mini the down
environment and so on and we will do of
course lots of comparisons so please
give me some time to prepare something
but yeah both are definitely quite
interesting and I look forward to offer
you some yeah some hopefully interesting
great videos comparisons and so on so
yeah this was just a short Intermezzo
thanks for watching and bye bye
