new anchor sound called spot excel I'm
also testing my brand new head cam the
yi4 K which has lens distortion
correction so you can see there is no
fisheye effect anymore
but the image appears a little bit
wobbly I'm not sure if you like this
more or if you prefer the Sony action
cam ahead before but this is nicely
small so yeah I can wear it comfortably
and yeah
it's about the anchor sound called spot
XL so let's have a look inside the box
ah what is it open but you can see the
packaging is pretty nice different than
the packaging of the previous anchors
because this is the speaker
yep se freighter at the back one at the
front I think to a full range drivers
there is something to it that probably
some kind of no belt or or loop a USB
wire and get there is something inside
let's open the other side so you can
really are yeah you can tether it here
and then you can walk around with it
like with the JB JBL flip 3 so of course
I already had a listen and before having
a listen let's have a look at some
frequency response measurements at
different loudness levels and you can
see that it's rather balanced but there
is a tilt upwards towards treble so it's
quite a treble heavy speaker and base
although reaching down to around hundred
Hertz with slight response below hundred
Hertz is not very present because of
this upward tilt so it's a rather tinny
sounding speaker definitely more
full-bodied than on the previous smaller
sound call we will hear this later on
but it's not in the same class as for
example a flip 3 or which is also not a
very base every speaker but anyhow so as
always I'm of course using high quality
binaural microphones to give you the
most
decompression you should listen with
headphones of course let's turn it on
and the first issue I found was that
there is some strange kind of well
compression or limiting going on
regardless of volume level I will start
with a track and please have a listen
here we are
maybe four thirds now we can see how the
volume is pumping here it is all the
disappearing
even at lower levels you will get the
same effect I will increase volume again
and let's try something else
as soon as some bass or some kid comes
in you can hear the volume goes up and
then it drops again then going up this
is well it happens with many tracks and
makes the speaker quite unusable for
really critical listening something else
this Nikita becomes quite loud
and dropping again
but to tell the truth the anchor Sankar
the smaller version did exactly the same
although it was not as obvious let's
have a listen how these two compare
starting with a track from savasana now
again a sound caused spot excel first
you can also hear the bass drum is
distorting slightly the small sound coil
is cleaner but also thinner I will
increase volume slightly because thanks
to this processing it becomes soft
there's no sound quite as well
yeah there is definitely some distortion
already at lower levels let's try maybe
the popular anchor premium which is
still a pretty decent speaker I will
turn this on I think they should go for
more or less the same price of course
this is a much more rugged speak as you
can see this is an auto model completely
waterproof
yeah it's connected and I'll start again
with the spot accel bank a premium
yeah I think you can hear that the spot
Excel is pretty treble heavy while the
anchor premium is more tuned toward
space but both struggled a little bit
with this heavy bass drum let's try
another track again starting with the
spot XL
but this sounds negatively more
full-bodied and more mature
despite some treble inconsistency people
can spot excel small and our track
if the processing doesn't kick in
it sounds pretty decent without this
volume pumping
I will put them far away and we will
check out how much difference there is
in overall loudness so let's crank them
to maximum both and the anchor spot XL
is claimed to be pretty loud so let's
have a listen if this is really true
again starting with this port itself
yeah the spot excel is definitely softer
let's try now effect
a little bit louder and more food more
full-bodied and seafood again hear the
volume drop maybe let's try the anchor
sound cord a small one how this one
compares is to this not a very soft
speaker despite being a lot smaller so
let's see how these two sound again
starting with the sport XL of course
yeah the sound cord smokin definitely
sounds much thinner so yeah I mean it's
an improvement over the small one or but
it doesn't have this mature sound of the
big sound core I mean the premium the a
3143 so yeah I mean let's have a look
here yeah there is this USB it is also
charging all I think the better is
pretty pretty big but sound wise doesn't
impress me that much especially because
of this really serious processing you
could hear this song going up and down
with loudness many songs are
unlistenable thanks to this maybe they
can fix it somehow but I doubt not sure
how how to how to tether this here let's
try maybe like that yeah so here you see
it you can some rubber you can let it
hang sorry I hope I could give you an
idea about the anchor sound cause spot
XL um it's not the best sounding speaker
it's descent but for $60 or I don't know
it's the current price you can also get
the premium which I think sounds better
especially if you add a little bit of
equalizer it sounds really nice but yeah
so thanks a lot for watching and we'll
see us in the next video bye bye
balancing join Kurt I'm blue da just dig
