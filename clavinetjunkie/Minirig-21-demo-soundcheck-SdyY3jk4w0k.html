you a short demonstration of the mini
Eric of the whole 2.1 setup that I have
here we already heard this against the
JBL extreme Otto's also a single one
against the clips groove recently but
this time I would rather like to
concentrate more on usage of this
speaker system also to give you an idea
how versatile it is but first let's talk
about mini Eric this is a very small
British company I think it's only run by
two guys so everything is engineered and
built in Britain by them definitely not
a low budget speaker but it's a very
versatile what I would call modular
speaker system you buy one mini week and
already have great sound although mono
you buy another one link them for stereo
and together with this up you have a
very really mature sounding system still
very compact and portable this is the
Bluetooth version by the way mini Rick
already had an older version without
bluetooth so let's have a look inside or
let's have a look what we have here it
offers 50 hours battery they have life
at half volume you will probably get
around 12 to 15 hours at maximum and
this is really really loud Bluetooth has
AB tech support multi pairing with two
devices it has stereo pairing so really
nice now what do we have inside a
speaker yep you can put it here and show
off and it comes with a nice carrying
case as you can see it comes with
different colors does it silver this is
an low green yellow gold whatever and as
you can see the interface is very
minimalistic you have just one button
that access power button or for pairing
and you have three ports
nothing else charging is done through
USB but includes an own port it needs
this cable here and you can see very
funny it has an output and an input what
for yeah it can act
also as
that's a kind of power bank let's turn
it on and I can charge for example my
iPhone with this I simply use this plug
here and as you can see it will charge
my iPhone both or all these three plugs
here work as input and output for
example let's connect let's turn it off
again now it's in Bluetooth mode if i
use it with wired i don't need to go
turn on anything just let's start some
music i plug it in one is low again and
high again so you'll have no volume
control you can see it turns on
automatically and this is the sound we
get we can also plug it in of course I
will turn volume down plug it in the
upper part this is high again
again you can also switch between Logan
and high-gain with the button here and
you see if it glows like this this is
low game if it becomes bright you'll
know that it's high again the button
also acts as better indicator green
means full up to 75% then you get cyan
blue purple and red means yeah it needs
to be recharged yeah I thought we should
yeah of course
as I as I told you all this works at the
same time as output and input for
example I could link it with another
mini Rick let's turn it on again
let's use it now you we have both
playing it's mono but you also get a
splitter cable which you can then use
left and right speaker system but of
course we would like to try bluetooth
pairing so let's turn both off again
simply pull all wires and it turns off
so now let's turn it on it jumps
automatically in pairing mode in my case
I'm already connected here so it works
through bluetooth no you also get an app
the song in the background is by soul
persona by the way you can also switch
between hi game and log in here or with
what we can do you can make it play left
channel only mono which means both
channels alright only and we can do
stereo pairing with another one they
connect automate of care of course I
have to turn the other one on as well
and they should jump into stereo pairing
mode and connect on their own
so now the app should show you're both
connected yeah
let's try let's start music again now
they are playing in 2.1 you can also
make mono this will boost volume because
both are playing both channels in this
case the left one only place left the
right one only right yeah and you can
turn it off through the F as well both
turn off as you can see so yeah very
simple to use and has already said very
versatile I would like to take my head
cam now and we will compare the single
mini rick against a flip 3 so please put
up your headphones as I'm using binaural
microphones and let's have a listen in
contrast to the old mini Rick the new
bluetooth version has a kind of dynamic
sound adjustment built-in this means it
doesn't sound tinny at low levels
anymore because you get some bass boost
at low levels which gets reduced the
higher you turn it this is achieved by
completely analog circuit there is no
deep inside because the DSP would add
delay and you couldn't daisy chain them
like you could with the old version when
looking at some frequency response
measurements at different loudness
levels you see a nice bass boost at low
levels and bass gets reduced the I
alternate but the overall frequency
response is pretty natural and flat so
what you get is really a nice clean and
mature sound let's have a listen
this is what I would call a more
omnidirectional placement this works
well when you are out with your friends
in a park and put it simply on the
ground and everyone gets a nice clear
sound but usually I would rather place
it like this I have some stands here and
the sound is more than directional
towards the listener so if I turn volume
down the sound remains simply nice
full-bodied and when I turn it higher
you'll never get a distortion but of
course we would like to know how it
sounds for example against the JBL flip
3 with which is a pretty decent speaker
I think I will start playing with them
in uruk
so let's have a listen
I will turn volume even higher
flip as well together
hey sometimes it seems like a game you
wanna play feeling angry with shell
maybe I got it wrong should just let it
go I look in your eyes
next let's try the clips groove I think
a pretty decent speaker although it
distorts too much at high levels and at
low levels it becomes a bit muffled I
would say I'm starting with the mini Ric
again here slightly more base but the
treble is missing this definition from
the mini
I will reduce volume to demonstrate you
it also has some hefty bass boost at low
levels this becomes a bit full marshy at
low levels
I will come closer it's much clearer
sounding I will increase volume again
Oh
yeah the Klipsch a small base but simply
distorts more but when you're out with
your friends for example you will
probably put them somewhere on the
ground and we can have a listen again
how this sounds
I will crank both to maximum by placing
the mini auric on the ground you also
get some nice bass boost and of course a
more omnidirectional sound what we could
of course do is add this up
where is the right here is the right my
own and now the clips I will chop it up
against
then all the clips start something well
funny
I think now a better contender would be
the JBL extreme but please keep in mind
this is I think 2.1 kilograms here we
have 1.2 or something and the mini Rick
is still playing in mono
let's have a listen anyhow I'm starting
with the mini Rick I get it on one touch
the dawn tarpaulins and reporting tough
loss in a foursome that's the dog horse
in the reporting time was an important
what we could also do is placing the SAP
on the ground which would of course our
boost face even more let's have a smoke
name is on Amazon so the file don't
enter the galaxy nobody in the back
makes reading range from ultimate sports
Optimus force activate you back the
energy energy going on the flame was on
the bangs Don certified
the galaxy nobody getting back and make
ready yet now let's add the other mini
Rick and I will place them far away so
we can also crank them to maximum of
course by placing the mini Rick's father
party will get the advantage of real
stereo separation especially compared
against the JBL extreme which will
appear rather mono I would like to
demonstrate you this with an all track
from the end of the 60s it was pretty
common then to put half of the
arrangement to the left side the other
one to the right side so let's have a
listen starting again with the whole
mini Rick two point one setup
JBL yeah there is hardly any left right
here not from this distance
let's try a more modern recording
you my love I do most anything baby I'll
do most everything comes I love you
buddy and I hope you feel the same way
you my sweet
he gave me milk let's try this can
tribute extreme
for some rock blues or something
just kidding no grief buddies over the
world
I will come on
was another man a dream but the Motown
let's try something even heavier
tribute extreme
I must confess that I'm a big fan of the
whole mini wick setup especially the
great sub gives me goosebumps every time
I turn it on the JBL extreme definitely
a great speaker simply cannot compete
against this even a single mineral and
the sub outperform the JBL with a finer
and deeper sound add a second mini rig
and you get a major stereo system it's
really impressive I mean of course you
have three parts to carry instead of one
but it's still smaller and lighter than
a single JBL there comes a nice back
with the sub as well
you can see it even has opened an open
part for the ports so you don't need to
take the sub out at all I think that
much thought went into this whole setup
I really loved it and I would recommend
it to anyone who has the money as you
get top-notch performance really great
refined sound the JBL you've heard it it
starts becoming a bit harsh
the bass is not really deep but simply
boosted here this would probably
probably satisfy even all hi-fi
enthusiasts so I hope this could give
you an idea about the mini Eric how it
performs outdoors as we've read it
against the GB extreme already and of
course it performs really well indoors
too so there is no reason why not to buy
it the battery life is really great the
sub should play for around maybe eight
hours at maximum you won't get this from
any other speaker system that small and
that loud I mean forget the mega boom
forget even larger speakers this is well
small and loud and simply Basie and fine
sounding so if you have the money yeah
mini Ric is probably one of the best you
can buy but you have to well to deal
with three parts but even just one
minute and one sub already do the trick
they sound amazing so thanks to anyone
who watch this I hope you liked it and
we will see us soon have a nice time
bye-bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
