greet all my Chinese viewers not sure if
they are really that many but today's
speaker is only available in China and I
think it's a really hidden treasure so
currently you can only get it through
some Chinese online stores that don't
ship internationally but it was already
available on EDX place some time ago
unfortunately they took it out of
program again not sure why because it's
a really great speaker but obviously it
was not that known so currently you can
get it from JD comm for example for 399
yuan which is around $60 but is some
kind of plus customer maybe you can get
it for 359 which is fifty-three
fifty-four dollars so very low budget
and maybe you already recognized it it's
a clone of the Kenwood bt 77 that i
reviewed some time ago and it's a really
great speaker so the dalton is the 806
is exactly saying just a copy with
another color another grill but sound
features is exactly the same so if you
want to have a listen yeah check out my
videos of the Kenwood also in my
database simply listen to Kenwood and
you will know how the DOS that sounds
against some others because but I
thought we should compare it against
some more expensive ones I don't think
you will find a small portable speaker
for 50 60 dollars that sounds as great
as this the only one maybe the downy a7
this sounds maybe a little bit better at
low levels but it doesn't have this
refinement this great stereo sound stage
of the door style or Kenwood yeah both
are the same so if I talk about the door
cell it's also it's also the case for
the Kenwood and I thought you should
compare it against some more expensive
speakers like them rear is which goes
twice the price and later on we'll also
compare it against the v-moda remix this
cost $300 so five times as much as
always I will of course use a head cam
for a kind of first-person view and also
binaural microphones so you should
listen to that for best results we will
get inside and have a listen to all
three let's start with the dough style
in the Kenwood so I will turn it on and
as you can hear no cheesy welcome tones
no annoying voice form stands on end to
this video I would like to dedicate to
so personal princess will jump and then
you pledge music campaign you can check
the link in my video description so all
music will be from them or some kind of
rain exists because they will be playing
first
I can witch
you can be a based on male sequel
next song will be from a life rehearsal
so personal recorded some 10 years ago
so soul person on drums Punk pepper on
bass and some other musicians again tour
starting first again here probably any
difference between a school yeah they
are really the same speaker just cheaper
let's try the revised now which is twice
the price of that those times around
hundred dollars really a nice speaker
but you cannot quite compete I think
yeah you can turn these tones off if you
want to
there are also some voice prompts but
thank goodness you can disable all of
them so realize connected and next song
will be a classic from George Michael I
will just play an excerpt its remix from
savasana with Princess Rouge on vocals
again perfect line first
always be close to some low volume
really gone
we could try me the surround mode is
also a photo frame with it with your
Toronto they think it sounds somehow
more open yet next song is some kind of
demo they are made within 13 hours so
from the beginning until everything was
recorded it just took 13 hours again
totally totally strange knowledge from
of this around
yet now let's try the v-moda remix which
cost I think $300 I mean it's not a bad
sounding speaker I just got it
but yeah and these welcome tones are
extremely loud so you cannot turn them
off
yeah I don't know what they were
thinking and again Dostal first this
song we already have heard also it more
from some years ago again postal first
we don't quite know what the basis will
be drawn my labels
hey Phyllis to me send it to me give me
your knife but the knife though my face
please as in the okay visit favor for
the postman to live it in to me to me as
I try to make it about making my fans
cousin ever be good to me don't care the
best of me tryna be gonna take you but
if China bigger bowls right and look
yeah probably because the place from you
think you mine difficult times as much
we can also check them at higher levels
so using volume to maximum on the docile
will notice also not a very meek there's
no chance against the doctor also
published in controlling yeah
yes I mean for 50 $60 especially for all
Chinese customers this is really still I
would say I will turn the v-moda remix
off so you can hear that tone again
sorry I think yeah way too loud so for
ambient listening you cannot quite use
it I think you could hear it that dose
is the 800 600 exactly the same as the
Kenwood maybe it was slightly clearer
because of the different grille but
features and everything else is exactly
the same color is different metal
relaxed is even better maybe because
they cannot battery is already a bit old
but you could also hear it that it
simply utters from the more expensive
offerings which are great speakers on
their own the reverse is really decent
but had no chance against the door cell
particularly this v-moda remix here
which costs $300 so 5 times as much and
I think it didn't stand a chance
especially at high levels it's lost all
punch and started to distort with bass
drums and so on yeah but we will of
course do a more detailed review about
the v-model remix just wanted to show
you how great they cost I agree for 50
$60 you get here so if you're in China
or if you have some friends who can buy
it for you here you should get it
it's a unique kind of even treasure so I
hope you liked this video about the door
style is the 806 check my other videos
of the kenwood again check the speaker
audio database where the camera is
already included I ain't found the same
you can compare it against any other
speakers compare it against a Bose
Soundlink mini I did a video putting the
Kenwood against the boss so you will
hear it's much better at low levels not
that much bass boost you can boost pace
with this sound mode with either with
bass or with 3d surround mode but still
it is not as full-bodied at low levels
as some others because that we need
boost bass to the extreme here the
packaging yeah 2.1 system it has a big
own woeful here at the center with two
main drivers and percy freighter at the
back yeah I think it's a really nice
speaker yeah if you are from China don't
look any further don't look any further
hmm for $60 or 431 this is definitely
the best buy you can currently get
Boston is the eternal six thanks to
Suleiman for sending me this and
otherwise I wouldn't have the chance and
possibility to try it out and really
check if it's the same as the candle can
do this only rarely in Japan for twice
the price volume or so for 50 $60 and
no-brainer so I hope you liked it until
say yeah I cannot talk Chinese I cannot
do you know what bye bye means no have
no idea so thanks to all and bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
