recording headphones and in-ear
headphones how to record them is it
possible does it make sense at all I
think most of you are not even aware of
it how much of an effort it is to offer
you usable repeatable results it's not
just that I take my banner on
microphones put the headphone up press
record and it will already sound like
itself no far off but I could also use
the ears measurement system not only for
measurements but also for encodings set
the headphone up here press record again
but it will sound again off not like in
reality it would need to be corrected
compensated calibrated equalized
whatever the ear system here comes
already with different compensation or
calibration curves for over years in
years and so on there may be good for
measurements but when listening to
recordings done with this it's not what
I hear in reality and this is where I
spend most of my time lately simply to
bring it to such a level where I would
be satisfied so I said there until 4
o'clock in the night tweaking my
parametric equalizers comparing back and
forth between my recording and the
original headphone and yeah I'm still
not quite satisfied but I think I
brought it to some level some status quo
that I would like to demonstrate you so
my goal is to offer you some
headphone recordings also in recordings
as samples simply as I think the
headphone market is a completely
overcrowded piece of also
reviews professional reviews are
praising headphones which I wouldn't
even want to touch because they sound
just horrible so headphones that cost
three four thousand dollars really hyped
brands you cannot listen to them it's
horrible and in future maybe I would
like or I would want to offer you some
kind of database with different
headphones also in years so that you can
compare them by yourself and still not
quite satisfied with with the results
also I found that over ear headphones
normal headphones give me better results
when recorded directly with my ears here
the year is quite quite stiff especially
this lower part here so with some models
I cannot get any good seal you can see
they stick a bit but also depending on
the position the the headphone will
sound different I
we need to clamp it down but how how
strong shall I clamped in order to get a
more realistic way
therefore for over years I think my
methods with binaural microphones does a
better job but of course I cannot record
in ears with my own ears I would need to
have the microphone circle at the
eardrum so I would maybe need some
operation let let myself implant some
microphones yeah that would be cool so I
have to rely on this year's system and
I'm still in the process of tweaking
optimizing there's really lots of time
therefore please understand that when I
don't release many videos I do other
stuff I know it's not that maybe the
effort is not visible from my videos I
never tried to offer you some fancy
looking great cameras lights
I rather concentrated on the audio
quality it really took me lots of time
to bring my traditional binaural
recording technique to such a level
where I will be satisfied but I would be
self-conscious enough to release videos
and say look I can tell you I know how
it sounds in reality I know how my
recording sounds so they are really
close of course there needs to be some
reference so Sennheiser HD 600 is my
personal reference together with sauna
works profile then city needs to be a
basis at which we can build up if you
use some crappy headphone from bits with
bass boost it's I don't know without
meat of course my recordings would sound
off it's way more bass heavy than mine
no it's not but there needs to be a
quite a neutral sounding reference so
what I wanted to demonstrate you here is
my current status quo I have three
headphones here this is the sennheiser
HD 58 x jubilee from mez drop I would
maybe want to make a review about it a
more detailed one also comparing it to
the HD 600 which is more or less based
on I think this is better it cost half
it's easier to drive as only 150 ohms
compared to 300 and it has better bass
while still sounding very very similar
to the HD 600 so really quite a nice
$450 I have the I've apology one here
two hundred dollars and
the tribe it ex-free tune I think around
$50 and yeah let's listen to this I will
just have maybe with the over here some
track from so person and princess
freesia it's a metal version by the way
of course I apologize when I put the
headphone up there will be the
microphone will be touched so there
might be maybe some distortion or some
bass usually in a review I won't do this
I will simply record it and cut it
together
afterwards but here I want to offer you
some kind of life feeling me so I'm
already wearing my banner microphones
they are equalized for over years
therefore a maybe appear little bit too
sizzling my voice yeah but let's simply
put up there
I reckon I think we're here it's quite a
bass heavy sound it's not neutral if we
regard the Sennheiser it's a s neutral
because here the bass really has a quite
a flat response unlike with the HD 600
which drops off slightly we can also try
the try bit which is quite a cheap for a
cheap one but I think it sounds quite
decent for this price
again
and last not least Sennheiser which is
our reference let's say so definitely
the most natural sounding wrong
the drive it is not that far off simply
more bass boosted with more treble but
the I wa I read some reviews claiming
that it has a natural sound on Amazon
flat sound no it's not quite bass heavy
or some meets slightly missing here yeah
I'm in the process of preparing a review
of it but it's not a neutral sounding
headphone so maybe not the best only one
if you read reviews there is lots of
hype lots of red it's okay but it's
certainly not the best and now again
it's which the initial I have some from
the cheapest one the ATR case at ATR I
also have included the creative EP 630
raved about quite a lot
some years ago maybe eight nine years
ago but a really crappy they sound
horrible good here's from recording was
around twenty ten twenty dollars the ATR
cost six you have to show me pro a show
me in year pro not the HD version I
think this one sounds smooth on some
college I think piston others colleagues
show me hybrid I'm not sure but this one
around 20 dollars untangle this year I
was included that 10 max although I'm
not sure if my unit is representative
the one for my friend also sounds crappy
but I heard that there are others which
sound better still my unit is really
horrible also are twenty thirty dollars
so the same price the case at zs6
horrible horrible really mark I'm not
sure how people can like this or listen
with this right here I have the brain
waves a zero at some positive reviews
just sounds I don't know like some you
have worse than this ATR here while
costing around forty dollars I think we
are approaching fifty dollars already I
tried different tips also stuffing any
deeper
listening at some
but never got any great sound out of it
it sounded just off to me so here we are
at the $50 class I also included the
South magic e10 that I only sent back
because it was crap so you will hear
this as well also around 40 $50 and I
have the Iowas unmod it so $50 you will
hear quite treble heavy although
definitely way better than all the
others
and I also included my modded one here
you can see mmm yes well it was not easy
to record because the I used the largest
tips here simply also to be able to
accommodate my fleece that I'm using to
filter out the treble and the year
opening is very small here so all the
time when I pulled them out the peeps
were made inside and I had I had to
reapply my mod which is not easy because
I have four layers here and putting the
tip on again was a hard task so I only
did this thing recording with it
otherwise I would have to make my mod
again again and again but at least you
can hear the difference between the
modded and unloaded one i have the one
more triple driver again with its stock
tips also quite nice response you should
hear it but definitely different to the
Iowas and i also included a wireless one
the Zola Liberty Plus through Wireless
so you get two separate ones I have some
models not all of them this is still
quite a formal four hundred dollars and
I think it's one of of the best which I
have tried so far from all these it's
not neutral but it has some EQ settings
available from the app there is some
solo app we can switch between I think
jazz
EDM pop classic and neutral or but
neutral is not neutral I would choose J
naught J solid classic with classic it
sounds best for my ears with nice travel
it sounds good signal Iowa although
without with slightly less definition
but for from all those true Wireless
ones I have tried I didn't test many of
them but this definition advanced also
very nice precious metal packaging no
problem so far except maybe some feet
because when your ears start to sweat
they tend to follow so press them inside
a
and you get some vacuum so they may
become a bit uncomfortable and last at
least I also wanted to include my
ultimate yes three four five ten which
is already quite old maybe ten years old
and also here it sounds a bit of I'm
using complex here for meas these are
the ones that come with triple driver
and because with normal seek on tips the
travel is too thin to seasoning and with
normal long accomplice it becomes too
muddy
so this is a nice compromise but it will
here not that satisfied with the
recording quality of the activity is
over my equalizing I mean it catches the
characteristics well but in reddit it
sounds better
it sounds more refined but yes so just
take this don't take this as hundred
percent but you should hear the relative
difference is quite well so we'll hear
the admit is simply like some lower
mates babe maybe they try to opt for
some some smooth response and took out
all harshness in the 560 others because
they definitely have some tip here right
all the others sound rather neutral so I
wanted to to cut it together again an
electric from surface on British
princess feature from the fast-forward
album I will play the four first for
bass will be do you the original track
then I will start with the cheapest one
the K is at ATR here and simply switch
over to the other ones and I will also
overlay some response some frequency
response measurement so did you get an
idea the response measurement was the
frequency was measured with their in
compensation curve I think I might do an
HA video on this topic because I'm not
that satisfied I mean if the
compensation curve
already screws up the audio so much I
would like to show you how it measures
with my own compensation let's say so
yeah let's start with the cheapest one
and later on we can maybe talk again a
little bit
you
so what do you think what's your opinion
which one did you like most which one
was the worst I'm still not hundred
percent satisfied with the result some
sound really quite close to anything
like the I was when switching between my
recording and the original one I'm
really close when others the argument is
sounds a little bit off it might be a
problem of this year's system that it's
not consistent with it with each of them
so depending on the India also depending
a lot how how high is that if the song
changes a lot the good thing is that at
least I can listen already live with my
equalizing superimposed how they would
sound so I usually adjust it by hearing
so when I just the left one I think so
so I try to adjust it to not pull it too
far inside because this will again make
the song boom yeah I'd rather press it
as far inside to get some seal and then
treble will still be nice otherwise it
will become some tamari so also that the
position inside the ear changes the
sound a lot so I have to experiment
maybe a little bit further but I was
quite shocked about the result of this
EP 630 also this 10 makes the song magic
based on just horrible maybe not as
horrible in reality but why do the other
sound great also quite surprised about
the solo liberty plus here which sounds
really nice also the triple driver but
tell me your favorite which one's only
best for you and in future yeah I might
really try to again to some kind of
database where I include all of them
maybe not as advanced just a measurement
audio recording and I want to limit the
audio of maybe three four minutes it was
way too long for my speaker audio
database with 10 minutes recording every
time
so I want to maybe make some simpler
with three four different tricks some
more danceable track with really heavy
bass that you can hear differences with
bass well some rock inspired track maybe
something from soul persona because I
like his recording a lot they are very
detailed from bass to travel everything
is there
very nice of open sounding also quite
quite powerful so maybe three four
tracks limited to one minute so I have a
sample of three four minutes altogether
and then you can switch between all of
them but of course as it is now with my
current resources and quite limited I
invest lots of time into all this
equalizing preparing optimizing and so
on while what's coming back from YouTube
currently this month
I'm not even approaching $900 a month so
imagine I have to buy measurement system
I have to buy some headphones in videos
and YouTube all the stuff is becoming
nearly a full-time job for me so I will
be depending on you mmm if you think
it's great what I'm doing here I think
it will be one one of its kind let's say
currently there is nothing nowhere which
offers you some samples realistic ones I
know many are trying to record
headphones I saw some video he recorded
the Iowas and compared against aha
it was not even something close to how
they sound in reality so I just keep in
mind there has to be a reference in my
case is that it's the HT 600 with sauna
Berg's profile but if you use some other
one also if sauna works profile they
should be at least equalized to such a
way that we use the same same target so
in future I don't know I will maybe
start some some other way of income
because just with YouTube videos I don't
get the amount of views I would need to
really afford all this to offer you a
new database also great recordings for
any kind I have all that lots of in use
rather low budget stuff all those that
were suggested to me from China
different models that in Tipu which
a bit more expensive the price of the I
were some other ones I don't even
remember so there is lots of stuff
coming but I'm reconsidering starting
some patreon stuff because I cannot
afford it with nine hundred dollars a
month it's impossible impossible for me
therefore if you think or if you want to
support me you will have to support me
either through party patreon I haven't
studied it yet I'm just thinking about
it but just with YouTube I'm not getting
the views that the publicity I would
need to really offer you something I
don't want to give us some wishy-washy
results with usual videos some whole try
ons take it millions of views some tapes
showing the boobs in brass I don't know
with 5000 subscribers and views 5
million views my most viewed video was
the one from the GBO boom box with 1
million views when I was inside the pool
and I never get this amount of views
ever it is about maybe 5000 views so
impossible to me to survive with this
and I may just stop all this because
YouTube becomes too exhausting too
time-consuming to to simply too
stressful
I have always limited time for my videos
mmm and very very nervous because either
my wife comes in half an hour and I have
to finish everything within half an hour
or yeah you probably notice then that
I'm really nervous it's this trust
because I'm stressed I want to I have to
talk in a foreign language I want to to
talk to offer you something and and have
a limited time have as soon as the
camera runs and I'm starting to becoming
Green Arrow's so hey it's really
becoming I'm really thinking of stopping
of this again because it it's in no
relation to what comes back what I put
in maybe it's not visible from my videos
because I don't have fancy looking ones
with great overlays and and I know some
move camera slides and I don't use
full-frame because yeah and whatever so
my videos I never concentrated on the
looks of my videos I really put my most
effort into sound quality already with
my binaural recordings for speakers took
me lots of time to bring it so far and I
know many apply binaural recording
technique meanwhile don't want to say
any names there were other videos before
using some Roland's the cs10 or
something I also started with these but
the results are not lifelike so I
started to try optimizing my technique
so that I can say look I can offer you
this because I know it's true if you
listen to a Sennheiser HD excited you
will hear how it sounds in reality more
less and others no simply press record
it's not it's not so easy to record your
ambience in a realistic way so that it
really represents the reality I hadda
still either record their speaker videos
with the camera microphone even mono and
I saw some video really three or four
times as much subscribers as I have and
he compared the CAF Wireless because for
$2000 again some two hundred and through
his video the 201 sounded better I'm not
sure what he was capturing what what he
was trying to demonstrate because with
his recording quality it was just the
cheaper want sounded better to me
therefore this is not what I want to I
want to really give you the best and
therefore I'm struggling because I'm not
satisfied yet so this is just my current
status I will try to optimize it in
future also experiment more with placing
of the in ears I really wanted to send
it back but maybe I will keep it it's
not cheap hearing in Europe 250 260
euros so also some investment but the
the YouTube ad sense I get is just
ridiculous compared to what I put into
these videos maybe it's not visible I'm
not sure so then your pinion about NES
how I should proceed in future
if it makes sense at all recording them
but also measurements just don't show
how they sound in reality tell me what
do you like what you don't like what do
you expect in future I'm really curious
to hear the new models that will arrive
soon
from China probably in one month but
lots of this stuff the case that are
cheaper in Aliexpress or somewhere else
so I will try to get these and yeah
until then I hope I will optimize my
recording technique to such a level that
they become all comparable so now I'm
still not quite satisfied and I'm not
sure if I will ever be
maybe it's the if the system's here
fault because it's not consistent it's
not a human ear the microphone is one
and a half centimeters behind this
opening here it usually you can tell is
much longer so I would like to try a
standard as I standardized IEC something
or a standardized system and also do
some recordings with it I cannot afford
it if I again had to spend twenty
thousand dollars just for this some
work I yeah I would I would need to be
some media yeah then I would of course
do this build up some studio here and
just to offer you some kind of best
quality yeah I think this was it nothing
else to say
coming lots of other stuff not only
headphones also some speakers that I'm
quite back just because I wanted to
invest some time into all this - to see
- also if it's possible because there
were some headphone recordings already
with a summer sense the out of business
I think not sure why so they did already
but I think I haven't seen any in life
like any recording so far so it made
might be one of its kind what I'm trying
to perfection eyes though to bring it to
perfection currently of course lots of
research is done another scientists or
from it's more trial and error but maybe
will be a will
get at this goal where I can say yeah
guys listen it's like it is in reality
or not so thanks for watching thanks for
our patients became a bit longer I
didn't want to bore you just wanted to
show you what I'm working on
so when there is some longer time
without videos keep in mind I have a
family whether it's great outside so I
prefer staying outside going into the
forest with my son spending some time
there and at night instead of sleeping I
try to he could have smell recordings
listening back and forth so it's really
it's really exhausting hence I'm at the
point where I think either I stop all
this or I look for another job because
it's it's impossible to survive with all
this YouTube income $900 a month come on
and feed a family buy stuff and so on so
if I didn't have another half-time job
it would be impossible so maybe I would
really start this patreon finding not
sure how I haven't even informed myself
but yeah this was it thanks again for
your patience thanks again if you stayed
until the very end I really didn't want
to bore anyone simply also talked a
little bit about my frustration thought
of this watched some videos lately
really millions of views for some way
stupid showing off their boobs and esses
I'm really wondering what the people
what people are looking at here you
haven't maybe if I was a girl I would
maybe also show off my great figure if I
had one when I was a young I didn't look
like this still had muscles you know
wouldn't become older everything becomes
old so I'm stopping now thanks for
watching and see you next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
