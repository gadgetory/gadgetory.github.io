brand new bomb box here together the
fire booster Excel and I thought today
we will do allow this comparison of
these tools so far the total boomstick
cell was the loudest portable speaker
I've tried and I really thought it's
huge but compared to the bomb box it's a
bit ridiculous I mean this is insane
this is a giant it has around 16
kilograms the perfect boom star around
10 so we'll see if the size and weight
difference also gives the bomb box some
advantage in sound and loudness as
always I will be using a head cam and my
binaural microphones to give you a
first-person impression so please put up
your headphones and let's check them out
I turn volume up to maximum left base at
neutral but I increase treble slightly
to make them more comparable now I can
control volume from the iPhone and I
will start with the bomb box and around
half volume
let's get a bit far away and increasing
volume maximum now
to me
yeah no chance some really lost against
the pump
special effects is the competitor human
activity of their horns
we have some nice eco as you can see I
hid myself here
but this is way louder
rock or metal and around 50 meters away
Lee
this is really mixing evidence itself
I won't try mixing the meeting I'll
reduce volume of a bomb boxer on report
it's alright maybe their quality hurt
loudness wise not the smallest chance I
would say there is no need for a final
statement as I think you could feel it
well this chain is insane with some
songs it was definitely twice as loud I
already thought that powerful boom sonic
said it's out but this is way louder so
if you need this power and loudness the
BAM box is the way to go it will be hard
to find something even louder and more
powerful in a portable form factor
although keep in mind this is already 16
kilograms so although portable it's not
really that easy to carry around
I really had problems bringing it here
maybe next time we will check it out in
the streets of Vienna and see how people
react although I'm a bit afraid as
people may feel this trip because it's
so loud and they call the police so I
get arrested so maybe we'll check it out
in a park or something I'm not sure but
I hope you like this very first and
quick loudness test yeah Tom store Excel
had no chance although we will have to
see about sound quality as it's loud but
I had the impression as if the boomstick
cell had a little bit more refined sound
so we will check it out in a more
detailed review of course until then
stay tuned have a nice time and bye bye
