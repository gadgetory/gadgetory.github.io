have a deeper look at the newest and
smallest portable speaker from Bangla
listen that Bo play a one this is of
course more of a premium model the price
is 249 so well not the cheap and
although Bengal Dolson claims it to be
the perfect auto companion I think this
precious aluminum finish is a bit too
sensitive for real portable use I would
have preferred it maybe with some kind
of rubber finish maybe even some textile
finish like the UE roll I have here
which is much more durable but yeah
their excuse is that every scratch tells
a story and yeah I don't know Bengal
Dalton often exaggerates a lot even they
claim to have the speaker 140 watts of
peak power and 20 hours 24 hours of
battery life well this is not quite true
I tested it at 30% and got yeah around
20 hours but as soon as you turn volume
past half yeah around 60%
I already got only four and a half hours
and at maximum it played for two hours
so yeah their values really are a bit
yeah so only for real low level
listening you will get probably around
20 hours
yeah but nevertheless it's a pretty
impressive speaker in this size and
category one of the best sounding with
really deep bass they claim 60 Hertz of
low base response but it really plays
down even at 40 Hertz so it's
outstanding for this size I have not
heard another speaker with such deep
bass although it's not without issues
which we'll hear later on for those who
don't know my kind of reviews yet I'm
wearing of course binaural microphones
and the head came to give you a kind of
first-person view we will listen to some
tunes later on and if you listen with
headphones you should really get a very
realistic impression of how the speaker
sounds will of course
parrot later on against the UE role
which is of course much cheaper but I
mean it's still you can still find it
for 119 euros so this is half the price
but let's see if it's really also if it
sounds half as good and I have the Riva
s here which costs exactly the same 249
also more of a premium model so we will
of course compare these two as well but
first I thought you might interested in
some frequency response of the speaker
the speaker is of course only
directional so regardless how you place
it it should more or less on the same
therefore I tried several measurements
one with the speaker standing like that
another one with the speaker in a 45
degree and some measurements with the
speaker line flat turned around so as
you can see in this graph here are all
the measurements and if we average all
of them you can see a pretty nice and
balanced response then treble usually
might appear a bit sharp or boost it but
in reality it's not because you will
move around the speaker will stand
somewhere so you really have to look at
the average response of the speaker and
it's really balanced the treble does not
have this strong boost also bass is not
really boosted but simply deep you can
see that it rolls off very smoothly not
not sharp like on many many other
speakers and yeah you can place it
usually would rarely place it flat on a
table like that or you can let it hang
around from a wall or even that way to
some rucksack so it's really flexible
and I will of course try doing some
further sound tests and and well videos
outdoors maybe with the speaker tethered
to the rucksack of my son I don't know I
thought about something like that we
already heard it in my car and this time
I will play some songs from the British
jazz fan group fo elements from their EP
it feels so good
and so that you get an idea how the
speaker sounds and this is 30 percent
volume so it's really low volume and the
only way to get more than 20 hours out
of it may be suitable for falling asleep
or or I don't know but it's not really
for serious listening but iOS comes with
a known vo play app which you can where
you can connect another one for stereo
but you also have some kind of equalize
it's not really equalizer you only have
some settings and the dots that you can
slide around but you can really improve
the sound especially for low levels you
can add a bit of bass and also treble
because the speaker does not do any
loudness compensation of course if it's
2 bass heavy for you you can you can
take away bass make it brighter or
something and I think the trick this
works really well especially for low
levels are even lower than that I tend
to to put the dot here then there is
another setting you can make the dot
larger which enhances the sunspace but
well with one speaker with one mono
speaker you won't notice that much
you'll notice more with the a tool for
example but here the mids are somehow
scooped up strangely so yeah I will turn
the volume up slightly
now we are at 60% volume and here the
speaker will already died after four
hours and a half so this is maybe enough
for outdoor use but still pretty low so
you would have to turn it even higher
but then you won't get more than three
four hours out of it so it's not really
the perfect outdoor companion how they
claim and this is 24 hours simply a joke
and only really reachable when when
listen at very low levels of course I
thought we will have a listen how it
sounds compared to the ultimate roll
ultimate ears roll this gets really
raving reviews I don't know it also got
some best speaker rating and so on
so I thought despite being cheap and
slightly smaller how these two compare
so let me turn it on and as you can see
the UE roll has also the same design
approach of the band also you can also
let it hang somewhere or put it on a
table like that it should give you only
directional sound and let's have a
listen how these two compare I will
start with the pew play a one first
it's not bad but hopefully Vinny
no base at home
yes
again
much food or something of course the
view all comes with them on it as well
you have an equaliser fee but it doesn't
really improve much I would take away
slightly treble and add face as much as
possible but there is no facial you can
revert back to standard
yeah it's I don't know let's have a
listen to another track the one with the
deep bass notes and you can definitely
hear both of them on the demo dolls the
note is around 52 Hertz
let's check the you roll yeah both are
missing the song comes with a base here
this is only a drum with a place it
sounds a bit weird to tell it all maybe
let's walk around and see how the sound
changes
but not that much change from the a1
let's try another track this is the you
you're all now and I will turn it for
maximum they're not very loud
I will turn there a want to make some as
well
and I think the difference is really
stunning
life and bed
here maybe let's try the Riva s instead
let me activate power mode first so that
the Riva is really placed with full
power and I will start with the panel
Olson again and if you listen close you
will hear that the base of the a1
reaches much deeper I will turn ball
slightly higher although the a1 starts
reducing base at higher levels and in
the liver does the same it still sounds
fuller
let's try lower levels where the diode
Olsen really creates deep bass I think
the difference is pretty obvious maybe
with this track the imagination are the
best to divine an election
everybody swell powerful
well while lie within just by saying
make us all
although that base of the bangle Dolson
is sometimes not hundred percent clean
let's have a listen to this track this
is an acoustic upright bass
and you hear some vibration or something
this has nothing to do that it's placed
flat like this let's try the river
it plays the bass completely clean yet
this is not really clean you hear some
dollar say simply that drivers not
pushed too hard probably with the DSP
the river most of the time remains
really completely clean but of course it
doesn't reach as deep
although the deep bass here is really
impressive just that it's not under
percent clean
let's try a track from soul persona and
listen to the bass drum here
hello we use volume and you'll notice
it's clean now and then you start
getting this power power effect the same
your we head on the a to advance but
it's much the cupboard sound a the pace
one is not really very clean see we
should hear it well I come closer and
increase volume very similar to to the
effect that a to was doing before the
update let's walk around again
I will turn both for maximum mice as
well course from behind there is not
much but yeah this is maximum this
sounds much bigger
yeah the river is really kind of
competed in over allowed a single also
power of sound and everything this is
much more impressive
so yeah the Bengal dollops and do play
one is maybe not flawless and also a bit
expensive compared to the Yui roll but
it's definitely worth it
it made the Yui roll sound a bit toyish
and also the reverse which costs exactly
the same it could not compete in any way
it sounded a bit more muffled also
loudness wise no chance against the Bo
play a one this is as loud as they
charge three with with particular songs
even louder with other songs a bit
softer but it doesn't have the extreme
punch of the charge three the charge
three retains more deep bass at high
levels this starts reducing bass up from
half volume but it's still very
impressive of course for outdoor use
I would definitely prefer the charge
three but this is still very very nice
indoors if you have a nice placement
also somewhere hanging on the wall it
will sound like a real big mature
speaker while he I mean this is this is
a joke I'm not sure why this gets so
great ratings but this is yeah I know
throw it away and the rivers cannot
compete despite costing exactly the same
so bang and olufsen really has something
great here it just that the battery does
not live up to its promise not 24 hours
but only at very low levels for outdoors
you need it about half I tried it and
you are mostly at 60 70 percent
otherwise you won't hear anything
hanging at your back I don't know so
yeah expect to get 3-4 hours but still
it's very impressive and if not the
battery and some slide bass artifacts
artifacts we've heard this would be a
killer it's already killer speaker I
don't know it's much better than
anything else on the market in this size
but it's not perfect
still I recommend it to anyone who loves
great sound this omnidirectional
approach is really great you've heard
the reverse from behind you heard
nothing and this
sounds the same regardless how you stand
so for portable use this is perfect the
only direction approach is really
welcome and Pendleton did a great job I
hope this was helpful to give you a
better idea of the a one I really like
the speak a lot although as mentioned
the battery is far not as great as
promised and sometimes with particular
tricks you may her hear some strange
stuff going on with bass especially more
bass heavy tracks but anyhow it's still
great and it presses a lot with its
sound and also design I mean it looks
really really nice yeah so thanks a lot
for watching and we will see us in the
next video bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
