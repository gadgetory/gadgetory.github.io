hi friends and welcome, I hope this will be the last snow-video this year
but obviously spring doesn't seem to want so well
I came out anyhow with the Teufel Rockster Air and the Soundboks 2
yes, this indeed the second version, it's the limited silver edition
I bought a second one, the first one is already sold
and this will be my last video with the Soundboks 2 as I have already sold this one as well
for me it's overkill, although it's extremely loud and great
but I don't really need this
but many had asked if I couldn't compare the Rockster Air with the Soundboks 2
it's maybe a bit unfair, because the Rockster Air costs around 600€
the Soundboks 2 850€, so quite a bit more expensive
besides the Rockster Air has way more features including a 3-channel mixer, XLR-inputs etc.
the Soundboks 2 doesn't have all that, but it has a swappable battery
it probably can also play a bit louder, that's what we are going to test
as you may have noticed  this time I selected a more static recording method this time with artificial binaural ears
simply because Bluetooth reach is that bad, I cannot go farther away than 5-6m
then connection will break up which won't sound that great
it's also quite windy here, so please apologize if some wind will blow from time to time, I am sorry for that
the speakers are standing around 5m away
1, 2, 3, 4, 5....
they are set to half volume now, the Soundboks 2 is now playing with its indoor mode
later I will switch to outdoor. The Teufel Rockster Air is also playing with neutral settings
bass, treble, everything neutral
also about half volume, and I thought we will have a listen, I will walk over
and when I have something to talk, I'll come back here because otherwise you won't hear me at all
and later on, I will put them farther away, 10, 15 meters and I'll turn both to maximum
so we can here which one can play louder and sounds better
of course you have to listen with headphones, this is a binaural recording
I equalized the recording so that it sounds realistic when listened through a Sennheiser HD600
also the recording gain remains constant all the time
this is the whole idea behind this recording method, so that you really get the impression as if you were standing here
listening to the speakers just like I am doing right now
I will start with the Teufel Rockster Air, half volume and the first track
I will switch to outdoor
bass at maximum
I think you can hear this as well, the Teufel Rockster Air is way tuned way more for hifi
although it sounds really fat, everything like mids and treble sound more real than on the Soundboks
but this one also kicks nicely, although it is not as refined as the Teufel Rockster Air, but this is half volume as already mentioned.
this is a volume level which you would still use at home
both sound nicely meaty
the nice thing about the Soundboks 2 is that it plays very controlled apart from some slight port noise with really heavy tracks
but with some tracks the Teufel Rockster Air can become already scruffy at these loudness levels
bass is neutral now, I just increased treble slightly
just a tad, like 2-3 o'clock
something else
but we have to agree without envy, that the Soundboks 2 plays cleaner here
the Teufel rattles already a bit
especially if I turn up bass
let's try something else
also here not perfectly clean
I will increase volume slightly, around 60-70%, let's have a listen how it will sound then
it was not that clean anymore
so I would suggest to put them away even farther now, like 15 meters maybe
and we will listen at maximum
first maybe at 80% the Teufel already has the latest update installed, which means it shouldn't distort as much as before
although you can still notice some scruffiness
this means first I will equalize both volumes to around 80% and later on turn them to maximum
so these are around 15 meters now, I will demonstrate you quickly
1, 2, 3, ......
14, so 14 meters
and the speakers are playing at around 65-70% now
and later I will crank them up
of cousre I won't run back and forth anymore
I'll have to stream from there, otherwise Bluetooth connection will be gone
so, ,let's go!
so at maximum the Teufel had no chance anymore
although it might even sound better at half volume and below
additionally you have the option to control bass and adjust treble slightly
this is not possible with the Soundboks, you only have indoor or outdoor
but with outdoor, oh my gosh, you could hear, it makes some serious noise
sound really clean, although it compresses slightly
but if you also need the maximum volume perfectly clean, the Soundboks 2 still remains unbeaten
I hope you can hear me well, I am sorry...
but I just want to offer you the most realistic impression here
I think this was it, goodbye to the Soundboks 2
sorry about the wind here, I have to cover the ear hear. please no wind, no wind...
the Soundboks 2 is leaving, in case I'd need another one, I may have to get one again
currently no use for it, I am simply too old, I am already approaching 50 soon
you don't need something like that anymore
it's great, you could hear, impressive the sound coming out of it
really a decent unit, also the Teufel Rockster Air
what surprised me is that it's really heavy, nearly 15kg
the Soundboks 2 weighs 15.4, so there is not that much difference
it's less than 1kg difference
although it is smaller, it is outrageously heavy
and without this belt here, you can hardly carry it
anyhow, I want to thank you for joining in
I hope it was interesting for you
for all those who wanted to hear the difference in sound
what bothers me about the Soundboks 2 is that it misses this refinement from the Teufel Rockster Air
it simply sounds more precious, more refined, more hifi
while the Soundboks 2 has this slightly hollow, somehow brutal signature
bass is really great, they obviously concentrated mostly on bass
but it needs a bit more finesse into the final tuning
but nevertheless both are somehow great
above all you can already get the Teufel Rockster Air for 600€
Soundboks 2 850€
I think there is not that much else to say
I hope you liked this video, also this static recording method
so many thanks for watching, see you next time, bye bye!</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
