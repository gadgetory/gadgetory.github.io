survives the heavy treatment of my son
easily and anyone has also arrived well
not to be treated as well but rather to
test the new JBL connect plug feature we
will do this in an upcoming video but
first I thought you might be interested
in hearing my model JBL flip fault
against the original stock one you
remember when I released my first set
for videos many complained about too
heavy travel too much trouble and so on
so I showed a simple mode by removing
the cover and putting in some fabric
like this and this improved the
frequency response quite a bit it made
it much flatter much more high file so
this might be an option for all those
longing for the best and most faithful
sound quality and I thought yeah I would
like to show you how this one this model
want sounds against the original of
course I measured both without mode and
well to make sure that both sounds
really the same unfortunately they don't
so when we compare the frequency
responses for both we can see that the
gray one has slightly less space this
doesn't look much it's just a 1.2 DB
difference but I heard this difference
before I measure them so to get you I
wanted to see if there is really some
difference and there is so the gray one
will sound even bit thinner and the
moderate one here with the fabric
applied you can see measures quite a bit
flatter so of course it would be nice to
hear this different life I would like to
demonstrate you this as always i'm of
course using the neural microphones
therefore you should listen headphones i
will place them as close as possible so
yes one shouldn't play too much to the
left or to the right and i will start
again with the same salt official track
as before and the black one modded one
first so please have a listen
the trick
I think you can give a different the
motive one found simply slightly
snoopers treble is not as pronounced
another trick
from rocks wet
or how trick I will increase volume
portrayed as the because starts with
your face already at this level and you
will hear that a gray one another one
will be completely shop of course all
cases the emotive one has an advantage
and of course you could test how they
perform at higher level when you crank
them to maximum base gets reduced even
more so the sound can become a bit
unbalanced this is the model one now I
will lose volume to maximum
and there is another one
some heavier trick so not so heavy but
also quite well already explained you
can definitely hear the treble emphasis
here on practice Topher this one
yeah I think the difference was quite
durable it's not a huge difference most
people before but I think it's worth it
if you are really longing for the most
HiFi sound the sound is smoother of
course of X is subtle suffers a bit more
than the original but still I really
enjoyed it's much closer to where we you
HiFi speaker like say if I thinking this
can be a little bit sharp especially at
higher levels at low levels it's still
fine but I'm quite disappointed that the
bass is slightly yellow on this one
there it's not a basically speaker to
begin with so one DB is less is already
quite noticeable yeah of course removing
the cover doesn't void any warranty it's
just a cover that anything it also
doesn't change the water proof ability
and the speaker itself is waterproof so
discover just protects the drivers and
so on yeah
I hope you like this of course it's not
for everyone and not just it was it I
really liked it
without mode as well especially if
listened of exes but this mode when
placed directly in front of you you get
a close to a high-five sound which is
quite impressive for a speaker this size
the wheels may be of course or let's try
comparing it against the C file syncing
next time in which of course at higher
levels can compete but at normal levels
I think very basic four sounds even
slightly more
convincing slightly more base yeah there
is some slight boost it before it falls
down the Helsinki rather flattens out
and the travel is also pretty nice not
as we find as the Helsinki but still
really really great for a speaker this
size in this price so they were watching
thanks for your attention I hope you
make my mod with this fabric cover here
and unfortunately it it yeah there's
some hair coming out but I think it's
really great and you can always remove
it again if you if you like so for my
next video we will test them in GDL
connects plus mode in Part II and stereo
I will show you how easy it is to
connect them for stereo or how is it's
not that easy a third one would be also
interesting to see how that yeah how
they react when a third one comes in but
currently I only have this tool also it
would interesting to see if both can
still claim stereo when I pass three for
example connects as well but currently
the pulse 3 is not on the market yet so
we will have to wait until this will be
released so thanks all for watching stay
tuned for the next video connectors
video and tell a nice time see you then
