to check out the dangle dollars in the
op lately - a bit more in detail we've
already heard it in AP and also maybe
you remember but in the meantime I
headed home for several weeks and I
think I can state now that this is the
best pocket size means because ever try
it it's really small so it's fitting for
any pocket but still gives you this
major full-bodied sound usually missing
from most mini speakers of course this
comes at the price hundred seventy
dollars of yours is not cheap you can
definitely find bigger cheapest because
it sounds better than this but if you
need this one small sector with that
best sounds currently on the market that
people seems to be the only one it's not
perfect though so pretty minimalistic
just has a USB c-type charging port no
controls it has some internal volume
control so when controlling volume to an
iPhone or an Android there is no problem
but I had problems controlling volume
through this xiangning m1s the speaker
obviously remained at the last volume
step so I couldn't turn it louder from
from this device apart from that yes it
has some gimmicky touch controls so
double tapping will start music shaking
will change flag and so on but okay
sometimes the husband 3 you see yeah you
can also turn it off through the app and
I don't want to go more into details
about how great it looks and so on how
great the design is of the product
concentrate on sound will also miss
complete compared to some others because
some news because like this JBL
clip here and but also because because
like the flip 3 and later on also the a1
is many very interested how these to
compare but before I think a listen
let's check out some frequency response
measurements I measured it directly on
axis and 45 degrees off-axis
and you can see it has like smiley
response but this movements out innocent
of X's at low levels there is some
dynamic bass boost and the speaker
sounds really mature then at higher
levels basically just more and more but
still it manages to give you the
impression of a really big sound even at
maximum
despite the small size
of course there's also an app where you
can tweak the sound so there is some box
you can flag around and have four
corners warm excited to be next and
bright and I try to measure this as well
so with warm you get an upward tilt
toward space right that's exactly the
opposite boost treble reduce bass
excited takes out mid slightly while
relaxed boost Smith you can also
increase the size of the dot which would
make the sounds most ratios but with a
mono speaker does result in a strange
response also bangle almost and decided
to take away the still apparent feature
so there is no option anymore to pair it
with an r1 for stereo it remains a mono
speaker but still I think it sounds
really great and I would like to
demonstrate you this
of course you can also check it out to
my speaker audio database compare it
against 200 different other speakers but
now I will take my head cam my Norrell
microphones you should grab your
headphones and we will check it out I
will turn the video play p2 on and first
I would like to demonstrate you what
kind of Santa can usually expect from
most music because of course this is
much cheaper than this the JBL click and
all aversion but I think it sounds even
better than the new JBL crypto compared
to the do play p2 it sounds a bit
ridiculous although really not that bad
actually
I start playing with a p2 and the song
from soul person in Texas Rita is
instrumental version so please have a
listen
to JBL contribute a bit ridiculous
compared to their $10 fee for to also
try the difference in loudness between
both
so the JBL cleat is already playing slow
supplements rooms with the maxim volume
with quite a bit of compression where
the tool also makes my mouth I can hear
much louder is not really comparable
what we could do is compare it against
some highly rated speaker on Amazon to
display UN's angular 3 from Cambridge
Audio I think it's something worse than
the JBL clip but people seem to be quite
satisfied with it and yeah we should
check out how this sounds compared
another song again starting with a b2
first
it's a world-famous mobile emulator
quality just horrible
of course we're and is much if I think
you know $30 per film I would like to
listen to music a bit also remember the
people is an omnidirectional speaker so
it will sounds great from all angles
there the one thing is really one of the
worst actors still I don't understand
all the people who create this so highly
applicable is of course try mixing
volume the anything list it's really
loud
regarding the style but it still sounds
like crap so increasing volume to
maximum
the first really hurt the PCs model
output remains nicely balanced this
sound to destroy them I think the people
sounds more comparable to the JBL flip
three of course the JBL fit three is
also quite a bit cheaper maybe half the
price of the p2 but still impressive
what can be achieved all the ways
because that small starting again with
the do play people video famous to me
tell it to me give me online but the
last drop of my face he says in the
elephant okay lower levels where the
people has some dynamic sound adjustment
they're slippery
positive scenic lower levels can
increase your volume Hezekiah will try
to match them
in a galaxy you can hear some very
slight vibration this is just because it
Mendelssohn plans to overdose they're
processing but most speakers you will
hear the clip three dozen on that slope
how do I be cheap
so this is really impressive for comment
also keep in mind an omnidirectional
sound from behind you can get more let's
forget that history
come along me
what loud advice that you could end up
complete with the 15
so I will increase volume
the maximum football
joy convinced much louder
there was something from multiple birth
tone but it's definitely not as loud as
they scream
and
but because many have asked to compare
it against a one who will do this no the
a one being one of the best portable
compact speakers around the p2 will have
of course a hard time to compete with
especially as its much smaller but still
I would like to show you how this
Poussin compared I will start with some
jazz pop or score so t7 listen
math can be special
just let everyone chriscommunity a one
has much more bass or so ignore
assignment to the songs are 30 2015 8 ro
vocals come better to the difficulty of
course it doesn't at this next phase of
the a1 song so by people sounds like a
mini version of the a1 maybe being less
than half the size it's really quite
impressive
something else here with really deeper
bass and more awful recordings like this
from some Poisson process which oh you
will notice the difference in bass
response between b-school a bit better
then a one has much deeper bass and much
more powerful baby I will increase
volume one not sure what's wrong here it
cannot compete with the a 1000 sounds
bad
that's okay pupils aren't quite similar
on complete Hopkins and lava types of
course no champion you can hear not that
much happens in this upper body we
really wanted much much lower much
talked about while you go in the sand
and they don't stand without you come on
lighten up we try to make my son ya know
like human surprising it's done there's
always challenges and you mentioned that
in the clutch so that's what this I
would like to compare it against a show
me me Bluetooth speaker which is maybe
the only mini speaker that can a little
bit compete with the pitot I will place
the show mean if I just like the p2 to
make the more comparable and now I'd
like to show you when the people can
become a bit uncontrolled toothpaste
especially admit volumes Oakley second
listen you can hear the bass drum sounds
quite a bit distorted the show me place
this totally clean
there is some maybe overdone processing
in the mid volume range this goes away
when you turn the speaker softer or we
can hear it drones
show me how we have the full-bodied
sound other people but is much the
control somehow another song can hear
this counts much chemo although it's
also much more directional than the
people so it happens around half volume
so 40% of the 60% where some songs can
start on your own or destroyed that's
why this house reckon isn't the best
time when I know it's Oregon ishani
place this normal thing just goes away
at higher levels but here at around 50%
it's quite directional
but then when the base starts becomes
cleaning insult this is just a matter of
processing because they show me also
becomes Olympic dirtying maybe not
effect there's also some earth change of
the torsional of course notice wise the
people will have a match again the show
me cannot play that loud but let's hear
the difference so increasing volume to
maximum
show me come I think you could feel it
they people sounds really impressed
isn't great for its eyes it can even
compete with largest because like the
JBL p3 here which is no slouch either
because because in this which sound
worse still it's not perfect as you
could hear may be some slight distortion
at neig volume levels base becomes a
little bit out of control you can tone
it down by the yet and still also
battery life is not the greatest at
maximum I didn't get two hours out of it
but I think it's still better than I J
bein clip which didn't even play one
hour and a half while being much softer
if it's worth one hundred seventy
dollars makeup field you can get a
better video maybe with the show meanie
it doesn't sound as great or as loud as
the people but it costs just forty
dollars so it's also a really great
speaker
it cannot compete with the a1 but it's
also much lighter and and smaller so I'm
not sure if there will be any other
really small pocket sites because
battling this Harman Kardon will issue
the new traveler which seems to be some
successor model of the Esquire Mini but
this guy a mini costing nearly the same
price is a joke compared against a p2 so
I doubt the new Harman Kardon traveler
will be much better
Harman Kardon wallop concentrates on
conference II functions and so on but
sound wise they people will probably
wipe it still I'm quite interested to
hear the new Harman Kardon pendulum and
if it will be released I will of course
compare it against a people currently my
wife is using it therefore I also put
this golden color as her iPhone is also
golden so it's her speaker thanks to her
for lending it to me I hope this was
helpful for you I hope you had a little
bit fun
and see you in the next video have a
nice time and bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
