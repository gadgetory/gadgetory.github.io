of the JBL Chari and the UE mega boom
some of you might have a kind of deja vu
as last year we've compared the JBL
extreme with the mega boom at exactly
the same place but many people got
pissed off that comparing the JBL
extreme which is larger heavier but
costs the same as the mega boom is still
unfair so this time we will compare the
charge free which is lighter smaller and
costs less against the mega boom yeah we
will play them at maximum volume and we
will see which one is louder which one
sounds better and so on as always i'm of
course using high quality binaural
microphones so you should listen with
headphones I'm starting with the charge
three and a level which is slightly well
above half let's have a listen track is
from Salta Sona together with princess
freesia and later on I will crank them
to maximum mega boom yeah with the mega
boom the problems always how to turn it
but I think one driver facing me is
Ferris let's say track three again stand
I will increase volume to maximum on the
megaphone as well
well not that much difference loudness
weighs only that the mega boom does
strange stuff here gets on spinner the
track 3 louder as well and nothing of
this strange whistling sound
mega boom yes
sounds pretty lost yes let's try not a
quick makeup um I will step back some
steps
Josh Megan
it sounds much clearer
although the driver of the mega bomb is
facing towards me it still sounds a bit
covered notice it's some droning mass
perfect some house it's ridiculous I
don't know there's this maximum range so
much more punchy the sound here
maybe I'll attract I mean they are both
not extremely loud but the charge-free
definitely appears louder here let's see
if we are releasing maximum I will turn
volume down again now it's definitely
maximum but the charge-free has this
clarity which is somehow missing from
the megaphone you hear this upper base
is pretty boosted but no punch at all
loudness wife's not that much difference
in our fact I'm spending way maybe eight
meters make a bomb
the charts free not being at 360 degrees
pika still pays pretty well
perfect for more extreme recordings from
NCS
makable it's only a mess
I will come closer
the confusion of culture
why this is just some so maybe another
trick for MCS
pick up on
you hear that loudness twice there is
not much difference just like the nigga
boom sounds much worse
maybe some kind of ramen base
it's only some drowning mess there is no
base just some upper base post which
makes it drone and covered
you can feel all the instrument well
yeah I don't think it makes really much
sense yeah so here we have it this costs
half is smaller lighter than the mega
boom and yeah it sounds simply better
loudness is comparable with some songs
the megaphone appears louder with others
the JBL charge 3 but the JBL chattery
has a much better battery at maximum at
this volume level we've heard here the
mega bomb will die after three and a
half hours although they claimed 20
hours but well it won't last more than
three and a half the charge 3 will last
over 6 hours at maximum so also this and
you can charge of course external
devices you can see it here both are
completely waterproof so you can let
them swim toss into water or something
yeah I mean if I have to pay 300 150 I
will definitely pay hundred fifty and
get a better sound not sure what what
your maybe all the UE fanboys will still
favor the mega boom but I really I
thought it will it would be louder but
it's hardly as loud as the JBL charge
free so I hope this was helpful thanks a
lot for watching and see you then bye
bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
