the new Vava voom 20 we already had a
short listen to it when I did my D boom
boom box
outro unboxing you can see the packaging
of the Vavoom 20 completely black not
that much inside but it comes with a
nice carrying bag as you can see here
there are two cables one for charging
one axillary but the most interesting
part is I think the speaker when I
unboxed it I really had the impression
of having something solid and
high-quality in my hands it has some
weight to it and design and materials
are really great this is some rubber
here design is simple but pretty nice
with controls on top at the back behind
some protective flap you have the
charging out charging with micro USB
auxiliary and I think it sounds and
looks better than the big
ba-ba-boom we've heard before because
when looking at some frequency response
measurement you can see that the valve
on 20 measures really flat with some
nice deep bass response but there is
some treble problem as the treble
doesn't reach that high so above eleven
kilohertz you don't hear or you don't
get really much response also when
looking at some other volume steps you
can notice that at lower levels there is
no kind of bass boost which means the
speaker can appear a bit tinny for low
level listening also noticeable is that
the area around five six seven kilohertz
is slightly boosted so the speaker
appears clearer than it actually is
despite the missing treble it still has
some nice clear sound I thought we
should check it out how it sounds as
always i'm using a head cam and binaural
microphones to give you a first-person
impression please listen Ed phones for
best results so let's turn it on and as
the volume 20 will cost around $79 it
should compete well pretty nicely
against the anchor premium which goes
for fifty nine so twenty twenty bucks
cheaper but the anchor has a more well
and more bass heavy sound let's say so
it's really tuned for low levels at low
levels you get some nice bass boost
comparable to the bows and so on the
volume is not in sync on the valve room
so it always after power powering on it
always starts at volume step 10 it has
fifteen or sixteen steps or and we can
have a short listen I will start with
the ba-ba-boom 20 and yeah let's get
started so there are still five steps
you will see when it starts blinking
this means we've reached the maximum and
I can still control from my iPhone I
think you can hear that the frequency
response is really natural the sound
appears quite mature and solid I will
switch over to the anchor now
you can maybe also notice that there is
a bit more bass post which of course is
nice for low levels as the human ear is
not that sensitive for low frequencies
when listened at low levels but you can
also hear that mids has somehow missing
from the anchor it appears a bit muffled
although there is it has better upper
treble it still appears not so clear
I know Trek we are according to the
iPhone we are already at well not 3/4
mark but maybe 2/3 the anchor has a very
strange volume control so we are below
half I will reduce volume on both so we
can listen to them at lower levels and
you can hear that the bar from 20 starts
appearing a bit tinny while this has
this nice bass boost similar to all both
speakers unfortunately there is no kind
of dynamic adjustment so you have to
increase volume to at least half or
above half to really get a nice full
bodied sound I will try another track
from sole person altogether princess
freesia and if you can hear it renders
that paste run pretty nicely why the
anchor starts doing strange stuff I will
increase volume is more
develop him again can hear Pok Pok Pok
Pok this is a typical problem of anchor
the gem heavy metal also the litany of
oiler which are all based on exactly the
same internals so there ba-ba-boom 20
renders this much better video is stand
up and increase volume to maximum on
both this is the velodrome now yeah this
maximum anchor
yeah there is some slight distortion
from both but let's listen to this track
kind of drum and bass and you will hear
that the lava boom really struggles
while the anchor plays this rather clean
so let's have a listen we are playing at
maximum volume the bass notes are all
completely distorted by the income we
have laced and clean it's driving with
the bass drum before but now the notes
are all clean and undistorted so I will
reduce volume slightly there you can
still hear the bass drawn slightly then
can slow
in this case the anchor is definitely
more convincing let's try now track and
pitchman I will increase volume again
for maximum so we can hear which one is
more punchy which one is louder banker
as well so loudness lights not really
much difference
yeah I think the treadle from the anchor
sounds a bit better maybe let's try the
taotronics pulse X no I have the
impression as if Baba intel tronics was
the same company because I already left
a not so positive review on their German
Amazon store for the bar volume 20 and I
was contacted back by taotronics so as
you can see they also look a bit similar
but this is maybe a kind of cheaper
version at the beginning it was $35 now
they increased the price to 40 so the
volume 20 is maybe twice the price so
let's see if it's really worth it if the
volume 23 that much better and I will
start with another track and again the
relevant 21st
we are playing at yeah according to the
iPhone it's around two-thirds but it's a
rather low volume to the Latrobe the
pulse tool is as X sorry is around half
volume here so you really cannot compare
the volume levels you have to compare
them on loudness but you can hear maybe
that the pulse X sounds more honky more
kitchen where you like while this s and
more serious son
I will increase volume slightly
Valon 20s well
aiming for $40 nice speaker but cannot
quite compete with them and is missing
here try gave us the vascular promise we
take an aphrodisiac using your glove
might as well face you a big love scene
a side of you
we're gonna check out the scientist
version of exes because I have the
impression is if travel was somehow
directional you can hear
so treble already are also pretty soon
but we have together with this direction
directivity it's really not that great
I will increase voting for maximum power
sex as well shut down some baby from us
like the Sun in the solar even much
louder the concept it's right Vince is
slightly on the table
so
it still sounds a bit more honky the
pulse eggs but it's also louder and I
think the difference in bass and so on
is not that big anymore maybe let's try
the JBL flip three as the price is quite
similar so let's check this out
the flip three and I surrounded also go
for around the same price so let's check
out this compare again starting to
develop on 21st takes a bit here the
base is there but not as deep as on the
bottom plenty
this sounds a bit more serious maybe
but I think it sounds really nice let's
try not a track flip three you can leave
it it fares pretty well although the
bass is not as deep it's tuned to give
the impression of a more full-bodied
song so maybe let's check out how loud
these two can play although as already
heard that treble becomes quite muffled
from the album when not this it exactly
on axis you can hear the feel free is
much better here I will increase volume
for maximum yes
it starts the sorting quite heavily
the flip three as well the FF III
becomes quite a bit tinny at high levels
but it compensates with a much higher
maximum loudness maybe let's try the JBL
charge three now which is of course a
bit unfair as it costs about twice as
much the charge free has exactly the
same weakness which is treble above 12
kilo Hertz there is not that much
response but the wave of 120 because of
this boost below at six seven kilowatts
may even have an advantage so let's have
a listen again starting with the lava
120
you
exactly
you can hear much more bass but also
treble or let's say clarity be slightly
missing here I wouldn't say that this
sounds more convincing
another track trash free again
it feels larger any DS as you can see
but the clarity is just not there
although it a kiss and then bit more
honky maybe let's try now track and you
can hear some issues with the bass here
this is where the charge-free really
shines the bass always remains
completely clean this is really
impressive
there is some slide well issue with the
base here let's try this and maybe let's
check out both compare at maximum volume
so I will increase again volume to
maximum not really bad loud now they
charge for you
yes considerably software and the chart
way yes start sounding a little bit
ridiculous to tell the truth so yeah
these are the issues one of them being
which I didn't mention yet that the
battery are not sure it's not written
anywhere that the volume becomes yeah
becomes reduced automatically after one
and a half hours so when you when you
play that maximum like this after one
and a half hour it will jump to its well
state when you turn it on which is
pretty low and I measured it until the
end until it died and it reduced volume
again after four hours and finally died
after four forty five so the GBA charge
replayed completely with maximum volume
for more than six hours I think I got
six hours 15 minutes which is of course
a much greater value I mean after one
and a half hour you don't get maximum
volume anymore this together with what I
would rather call low or maximum volume
and the rather tinny sound at low levels
makes it a bit questionable for me I
mean it's solid and it has potential
it would just need some slight dynamic
sound adjustment for low levels and get
rid of this energy managing management
it's it's horrible I mean the same was
with the pure play a tool which after
one hour suck cut the volume by half
this is nearly the same so for outdoors
if you need high volume forget the velum
the deivam boombox we've heard which is
slightly cheaper manages fares much
better for high levels also sounds more
full-bodied even louder than the flip
three with a more full-bodied sound so
it depends what you want for indoor
listening
it I'm missing slightly refinement
you've heard that treble is I mean it
sounds clear but upper treble is missing
when not listen exactly on axis it
becomes inverse so yeah
potential is there but yeah it's not
fully or 100% perfect therefore not sure
you've heard the GBH artery was also not
the clarity king but at least it has
pungent and can play pretty loud so much
better and also ragged speaker for
outdoors than this for indoors I think
there are even better solutions like the
anchor premium we've heard or maybe even
the gem heavy metal or or the fitting
royal er um all I think let's say most
users will probably prefer those because
this sounds rather flat without treble
the bass is deep but it still appears a
bit flat at all levels ever I'm not
quite sure about the volume 20 it has
potential but it should have well a bit
more work to make it really really
perfect
here is the anchor here we have the
taotronics yeah it definitely sounds
better than the taotronics pulse X but
yeah this is also half the price so
depends what you want for a low budget
still that Optronics shines this is not
so low budget anymore at the flip 3 is
also there not as deep full sounding but
still pretty nice with no distortion
this with bass heavy recordings distorts
quite a lot I was really a bit shocked
that there was so much Distortion yeah I
think I covered everything yeah I hope
this was helpful for you to give you an
idea about the 11 as soon as I manage I
will edit to the database currently I'm
still not there so yeah the next one who
will cover is the what's this the Razer
Leviathan mini yeah costs twice as much
so we should compare it maybe today
ba-ba-boom 20 thanks all for watching
and see you in the next video with the
Razer Leviathan have a nice time
bye-bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
