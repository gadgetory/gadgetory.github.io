driving test again last time we've heard
how the bangle dolls of you play once
sounds inside the car then people ask me
what about the mean uruk's
so I brought two mini rigs with two subs
here
I will set them up and we can have a
listen I also have a CD with the same
tracks here so we can hear how the mini
ryx compare against the internal
caiaphas system this is the original
system from BMW so not very decent but I
think it would be much more expensive to
exchange the radio for a better one with
Bluetooth also exchange the speakers
then simply put in some mini rigs here I
hope we can hear this difference well as
always i'm of course using binaural
microphones so please listen with
headphones the gain of my record is
constant I put it to quite a low values
to really be able to capture also a loud
noises
I will crank them up to maximum later on
so please be careful
keep the loudness of my voice as a rough
reference for the correct loosening
loudness but again I will crank them up
to maximum so it will become really loud
please pull up your headphones and let's
check them out I have placed 1min Eirik
here I clamped it in slightly so we
should move around the other one has a
sticky tape at the back so I can stick
it to my seat and I will attach the sub
which is located here the other sub is
here I will attach this later on as well
but first let's start with the CB
as you can see I have bass and treble
neutral so it sounds a little bit
dynamic let's change to the lyrics
based on the quite a bit measured
the CD again and let's decrease pace
slightly
the matrix again
right Mexico
I think you can hear that at high levels
the SAP starts to limit slightly so
let's try what happens if we attach a
second sub and let's crank them for
maximum again
this was maximum I will remove the
second sub again
it's really loud I mean Steve meet the
car high-five prophy would probably
laugh about this but I think for a
portable system this sounds really
impressive especially with the stop
place in the foot room here legroom yeah
I think it's pretty nice what I didn't
show you I also have the Harman Kardon
go and play here so maybe we can get out
and have a listen how this Harman Kardon
sounds against two minerals with two
subs as you can see I found a nice place
here
I turned both to maximum and I will
start with the Harman Kardon going play
first track is from elements
not really that loud vinick's can also
set them far apart to get even better
scale separation it's right on track
with two subs they remain pretty punchy
even at maximum
go and play
we have to come closer because it starts
disappearing slightly I mean pretty nice
base but loudness is missing
no real chance very nice yeah the place
has more punch but loudness is not
really that impressive mini wreaks again
let's run out quick
yeah not sure what I should comment but
yeah the mini reeks outperform the
Harman Kardon go and play at least in
overall loudness hope it became a bit
hard thanks for watching I hope you
liked this video then mini reeks
definitely kick ass especially with the
sub or even two subs they outperformed
this big Harman Kardon go and play yeah
it's not a cheap solution but definitely
one of the best if you want to keep it
small yeah will will see us in the next
video have a nice time and bye bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
