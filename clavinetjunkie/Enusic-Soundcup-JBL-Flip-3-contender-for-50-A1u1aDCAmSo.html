me all off but I made a voice plastic
surgery in order to have a deeper voice
some of you probably heard me singing
and here because of this no of course
I'm joking but my son brought something
home again and I feel a little bit sick
but that shouldn't prevent us of having
a look at this new release you from
music called sound cup currently it's
available on the banggood store only 450
yeah $51 let's say they say it's a
promotion sale from 15 to 22 second
November I'm not sure
otherwise the price would be $60 but I
think it's still a really decent speaker
it's waterproof or weather proof yeah
has some features and it reminds me a
little bit of the JBL flip 3 maybe yeah
but it also has some elements of the
phillips bt 6600 this is an
omnidirectional speaker so it has
drivers here at this island at this side
so opposite sides just like the philips
speaker but it also has a PC plate a
third one just like the JBL flip 3 here
um it also has 2 passive radiators here
and yeah of course it would be nice to
check it out how it sounds um but first
let's turn it on maybe and please hold
your ears yeah the welcome tones are
pretty loud but before having a listen
maybe let's check out some frequency
response measurements and you can see
one with the speaker plays flat measured
exactly on axis and you can see that it
measures really nicely balanced with
some deeper bass below hundred Hertz but
there is also something peak around 12
kilohertz which can be a little bit
annoying at low levels you get some
dynamic bass boost so the speaker
remains quite full-bodied at lower
levels and there is also an auto mode
which boosts volume slightly but reduces
base at the same time so the speaker
doesn't really sound that impressive
anymore we can also have a look at the
sound dispersion when placed vertically
and I turn the speak around for 30
degrees 60 degrees and 90 degrees so
there is some travelers but still the
sound disperses really nicely which is
what we will check out now as you can
see I placed it in a rotate
way so we can hear how the Sun disperses
to all sides so please have a listen
yeah I think you can hear that the sound
really disperses nicely I think this
works better than on a UE boom or a mega
boom what I didn't show you that volume
control is independent between player
and and speaker but you should really
keep the volume set here on the player
because if we max out the speaker and
listen at lower levels you get this
strange static and his which gets of
course reduced if we reduce volume on
the speaker and keep it high on the
layer so there is no hiss anymore but it
makes me own volume you shouldn't yet
you will probably listen at maximum
therefore you wouldn't hear this so this
is the only problem there are also track
controls here yeah I switched the mode
tool out to uh I wouldn't really use
this auto mode so swiping back swipes to
the previous track and let's listen
again to the outdoor and indoor mode
it becomes a little bit louder but
without any base so I really prefer the
indoor mode
and it's really strange that outdoors
always reduces bass on nearly all
speakers when they have some auto mode
the bass gets reduced but I think this
is because usually autos you
need more bass otherwise the speakers
will sound tinny but all companies do
the opposite they would use base for
auto which is really strange so let's
see yeah we are indeed in the law and
let's wipe again to the next track and
we could maybe listen how it compares
against the JBL clip here JBL flip free
let me try matching volumes for both
you can probably hear that the music
sounds fuller but also treble is not
that great here there is thus treble
peak and overall treble is emitted
nutrients
but it sounds quite a bit fuller let's
reduce volume and compare them at lower
levels the flip three it becomes well it
keeps the base level wide this boost pay
slightly let's increase volume again
and to fix this treble of course you can
use some equalizer I use EQ 10 as it's
nice to demonstrate oh I reduced 12 kilo
Hertz by me here 10 DB because we have
to overcome this peak at the same time I
raced treble with a high shelf filter
and let's check another track from soul
persona or soul / freesia which is so
passionately the princess region the one
which I'm using always for my database
and this is already with EQ and you can
hear that it sounds quite ok if I turn
off your cue it becomes really yet worse
again with so that treble peak has gone
and you get an overall Isuprel road at
the same time you'll get more based on
achieving a fig tree which for fifty
dollars is really not that bad so this
is without you with EQ
I think you can hear the difference well
yeah it would be nice to have some
further adjustment or but yeah not sure
if they really will do it yeah let's
check out maybe some other tracks again
starting with the music
some bluesy funk
Virginia takes a bit it has the slice a
travel but base is a little bit missing
especially at higher levels producing
space quite a lot
maybe something else
JBO fit free yes a little bit posh heavy
of course from behind that flip loses
any bit while this remains quite stable
regardless where you stand and flip free
again so the fifthly is not an
omnidirectional speaker
yeah I think you can hear that it really
disperses the sound nicely much better
than a Huey bomb which sounds quite dual
when not listen exactly from from the
side or maybe another track we also get
some form back stereo but also a little
bit of a left and right effect the JBL
flip free
something else also try placing it like
that lady
the GBO 50
compared to the big screen sounds a
little ooh maybe but again the salt
remains stable from all angles and you
can see the click three from behind does
it really sound that great anymore
Salalah track and maybe I will increase
volume here to maximum and you can later
on increase volume and check how loud
they can play as the fishery is known to
be pretty loud pick 3 again it would
need a little bit more bass than it
would be perfect and now let's go away a
bit father hand crank them for maximum
so this is the music playing at maximum
they flip three as well
it's a little bit softer
cause that flip 3 doesn't have that much
place anymore so we could indeed try
auto mode for the music of all I
wouldn't probably use it usually and
let's crank both again to maximum now
has even less space than the clip
preload
maybe another trick
fifty-three
the for my taste is low neither treble
or bass is great
therefore I really wouldn't use alpha
mode yeah it becomes a little bit louder
but doesn't really sound that great k3
again it should be slightly louder
but this sounds definitely cooler yet
one thing we could also tries maybe
compare it against the phillips bt 6600
yeah this is quite a bit more expensive
let's tell this off let's turn the
phillips as they share quite a bit of
yeah some similar design let's see if it
connects sometimes it quite a doesn't
want to you can hear this his i was
talking about before quite well here it
is and yeah maybe the check out another
track and we try to match volumes again
yeah I don't know I said
the Philips you can hear quite a bit
more refinement from the treble or
sub-base and so on
the other clever is the problem it would
need really somewhere to make it sound
perfect as a shoulder would be cute
but the Philips sample sounds is it was
struggling with the things I will
increase volume slightly yeah there is
some something going on both vibrate a
little but overall the Philips of course
does a better job being much more
expensive
I will tell both to maximum this is the
Philips plane now this is the mr. center
here get that mole is the same loudness
I would say
another thing and both remain rather
distortion-free at maximum the other
Phillips's of course much better clarity
but you can maybe hear that the village
starts to compress a little while the
music doesn't really apply any kind of
compression just yeah just some bass
reduction let's turn it off again
and these stones are much too loud they
should be really toned down for the
final for the final unit although I
think they're already sold like that let
me open this it's not quite easy there
is not that much just a USB charger
charging port and auxiliary you can see
this is impossible to open
no I don't manage and yeah I think it's
a nice speaker for $50.00 the treble
would need a little bit of work if you
have some nice EQ you can easily correct
this but apart from that for $50 it's
really nice and much better than many
others also pretty loud I tested it
outdoors and it sounds really nice it
gives you this full-bodied sound rather
missing from many others and it also has
quite a wide Bluetooth reach I could go
away I don't know 20 meters 30 meters
and it still played well while the
Philips yeah it loses connection of the
five six meters so it's a nice pickup
for $50 currently only available on
thank God I think there is a similar one
coming from Trent were also called sound
cup by but I haven't seen it anywhere
yet someone else to see here yeah it's
11 2 colors in black and red it has a
DSP chip yeah I hope they really take
this seriously and improve trim a little
bit it just needs some equalizer to make
it sound even better but yeah I'm not
sure if they will really do it so just
to give you an idea about the music
sound cup that I got from been good it's
a nice speaker um not as clear sounding
as template 3 also not as loud but
overall a little bit of a fuller sound
also 360 degree sound and yeah way
cheaper so I hope you like this I hope
yeah
it could help you to make some decision
if you were already interested in this
yeah maybe it will be reef also be
released on Amazon as I think it's
relief for this price it's really nice
even for 59 it's great compared to some
others so turns out I will have to cure
myself a little bit and I hope I'm yeah
I'm okay in the next video have a nice
time until then and bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
