gonna compare and also listen put two
speakers from all your pro that get
twenty and the drum file the t20 is only
a litte bit older that Ram fire is a
more recent one from them but both cost
more is the same so can already find the
t20 for around 600 euros or even below
why the drum fire being new is listed to
700 but concept wise they are definitely
different
so that t20 is a normal active speaker
system equipped with Bluetooth also to
optical ins lining some fault why the
drum fire is rather meant to be used in
a maximum setup maybe together with
album for stereo or with another speaker
from Bali pro like the c3 c5 c10 they
all have Wi-Fi included and it also has
bluetooth the drum fire comes as two
separate parts but you can also buy only
the main part which is called I think
Graham fire Devon here I have it with
the subwoofer and I would like to
demonstrate to the sound so I don't want
to show you the features has internet
where you included and so on so it's
really nice to have some preset buttons
I just press one and it starts my
favorite radio station this is not
possible with the t20 I would have to
attach some streamer to it
it only has bluetooth so yeah let's
listen to some songs you are already
listening to a binaural artificial head
so usually listen with headphones use my
voice as an honest reference I'm two
meters away from you so yeah raise the
volume to such a level that you hear me
realistic a I will set them up and we
can have a listen there you can see I
place the people is closer to each other
so they won't have too much advantage in
separation or the drum fire and should
become more comparable
both are playing with neutral settings
now later on well maybe try to fight on
them a little but however sit down
closer to you and let's listen some
music with 3020 Spain first
therefore I prefer not touching their
some falls at the back they are
exactly at 12 oÂ´clock so neutral it's
not reading the manual how to set them
so I think this is the normal setting
but here I will increase to ever maybe
most to make so it becomes a bit more
comparability twenties and at the same
time reducing Basel Committee multiple
still given support but is not a sixth
amendment context is now and I also
the more mistakes you can hear vocals as
well
another fight differently
I've got
on top of me waiting down so heavily
come follow me
yeah
as on also more acoustic
I actually like that
quite a lot in the traffic is also great
thanks
or she said the Apostle Peters
need a second polish
ready
we
it's good to shave
take it risk cats
I hope to show you the differences that
of course retains all its power orders
base up to maximum but you have to do
something against the sweating there's
already moved a little so you need to
put something some rubber met or
something and it's also loaded may be
completely loud but with full power for
bass so the twenties from some certain
point on there is some limited they will
limit based they are not that powerful
but I think for no man listening I
definitely prefer that three twenties
I'm not quite sure how to drum fires
would sound together playing in stereo
also if there is some delay I showed in
my previous video that the c3 playing -
none of the drums there was some slight
phase shifting between one and in the
other one maybe it's because two
separates because do it like this maybe
two drum fires would sound perfect in
sync so yeah this was helpful for you to
give you an idea as both cause small is
the same yeah it's a hard choice the 20s
with the same Wi-Fi functions would be
great also I mean like the the preset
buttons here just pressing one or two
and a radio station or some ladies
displayed
unfortunately Apple music is not within
so you have to use Apple music through
airplane unfortunate you cannot study
directly through the app and leave the
phone alone like you can do with Spotify
or with Amazon music so he for every
music you would have to use steal your
phone and string for a Bluetooth or
airplay but I would like some you know
some buttons here as well
thus yeah still I like them but I could
maybe add this this I don't know what's
the name this Wireless thingy here this
Tommy
got that great maybe I will try it once
and have the same multi
relative 30 twenties so I hope like this
video I hope you didn't boil too much I
try to cover as many different genres as
possible so thanks for watching and see
you the next one bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
