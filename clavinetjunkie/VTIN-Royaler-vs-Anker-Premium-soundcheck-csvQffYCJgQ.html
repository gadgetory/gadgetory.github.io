look at the vitinho roller roller no
idea how to pronounce it correctly but
many already asked for this and I was
contacted by vetting if I would like to
review it so here it is first let's have
a look what comes inside the box yeah
that speaker obviously then two wires
the charging cable micro USB and
auxiliary so not that much inside what
we have here 20 watts powerful drivers
with passive subwoofer high-strength
aluminum alloy housing eight hours of
playing time at 50% volume Bluetooth 4.0
frequency response it says Ian 90 Hertz
to 20 kilohertz but this is not true it
plays much deeper and looking at the
speaker it feels really great I mean it
has equal high build quality as the bose
soundlink mini maybe even better as this
this I know it's really sturdy and and
great so no errors here very nice edging
here on the aluminum body and before
listening to some samples also comparing
it against them Anker premium which
costs well more or less the same but
doesn't have this premium finish this is
just yeah plastic which scratches very
quickly but it's still a nice lead
decent speaker I thought I will show you
some frequency response measurements of
Delvian and as you can see it measures
pretty nicely nicely smooth frequency
response with some treble boost some
slight bass boost as well but it
reminded me quite a bit of the GM heavy
metal so here you can see the gem heavy
metal as well in gray and as you can see
the well measure more or less the same
just that the heavy metal has more
treble boost and maybe you remember it
suffered quite a bit from strange
artifacts at low levels so here you can
see
measurement of both at a very low level
and you can see some zigzag with the GM
heavy metal these were the artifacts and
the V team doesn't have this problem so
its place without strange I don't know
background noises the anchor or some
units had the same problem with
artifacts my unit doesn't do this but I
also had a unit which had exactly the
same strange noises we can also have a
look at the frequency response of both
anchor and Witten and you can see that
although both are similar the anchor has
much more mids
so the mids are pushed much more and
although the treble is similar on the
anchor and within the anchor simply
appears more dull of maybe because of
this highly pushed meat of course I
would like to show you how this sounds
in reality which sounds better and so on
so let's turn them on powering on
it should connect to my iPhone ready
today yeah this takes a bit and we can
turn on the anchor as well you should of
course listen with headphones as this is
the only way to listen to binaural
recordings correctly I will yes set them
up slightly better so that we can really
hear them well and I will play some
tunes starting with the fitting Roy Roy
Yeller I don't know how to have to call
how to say and let's listen to the first
tune the frequency response is quite
similar to the Bose Soundlink mini which
I don't own anymore
it can be much more needs here they are
simply pushed more on the anchor
Oh
although this of course sounds a bit
more pleasant immunity to the human ear
this is something else
definitely feels cooler stepping on the
nails and the rocks when they may be
told you not to lose it cheat you in
your SSN move it again Frenchie and if
they're believers were you looking for
this
I think that the base is a similar boat
just that they are equalized differently
the anchor has the meets post much more
forward here this happens sometimes
effect when switching between one and
the other seems to be some software I
don't know that's right this
and maybe you can hear that the bass
starts to roll slightly
the anchor remains more under control
profession to this track and listen to
the bass drum the anchor sounds much
better here the bass drum sounds how it
showed
maybe this track and listen to the bass
from here just some punk rock on it's
all it also starts but it still not
Paris pronounce the sound a bit in this
I mean I can reduce volumes lightly and
it becomes better but
the pad volume you do it starts to
become quite unusable let's try this
track this is really horrible
ha ha ha
anchor the anchor also does it but not
as strong I will increase volume on both
slightly here this is only the droning
distorted me I'm almost perfect anchor
is better in this in this case let's try
another trick whoa
just Distortion
also slightly also similar the effect
but modest for them again but you can
hear it doesn't go away on the anchor
defects disappeared while you can still
hear it
lamb-lamb I saw that blue let's listen
to this
yeah at very low levels it becomes clean
but yeah it's not really listen able
like that so harder recordings with much
bass starts to drown like that
another problem but yeah you can also
hit the based on sounds really strange
here
another problem both have the anchor and
the rhythm is that they have
as if it was some crows effect listen to
the piano
the notes are not pure but they have
some slight pitch variation all the time
let's try not attract you don't hear it
with every track but especially acoustic
stuff piano notes and so on
it sounds as if the piano was out of
tune and all these models they anchor
that the team that Jam heavy metal all
had the same problem very strange effect
I don't know maybe some side effect of
the stellar processing also this guitar
here
maybe let's check how loud they can play
I will go a bit far away so that we
don't get any Distortion and I will turn
it for maximum bank as well as both are
based on the same design I think there
is not that much difference
although the anchor appears slightly
louder I would say
yeah I would say that the witan Royale
has definitely the more pleasant uni
with some nice clarity that is missing
from the anchor and every every Joe
should be rather satisfied with this as
a kind of low budget Bose Soundlink
substitute but you've heard as soon as
you play some more complex material it
starts to distort this bowling verbal I
don't know I couldn't live with it to
tell the truth the anchor is a little
bit better although it does it as well
it's not as pronounced and you can
always add a little bit of treble with
EQ while you cannot quite well take away
this distortion the written and also the
gem heavy metal produces obviously they
are both based on exactly the same
design probably even the anchor just yes
some differences in overall tuning and
also yeah in the body here I mean it's
not a bad speaker and for $60 or
something really decent but I cannot
live with this distortion already at
half volume and and way below so it
becomes quite unusable as I hear it with
every track maybe I'm a bit too
sensitive for this but yeah so I hope
this was helpful to give you an idea
about the Witten nice speaker but I
think I would go for the anchor and add
a little bit of equalizing a bit more
treble it's not as premium it's doesn't
feel as great but yeah I think it has
over the more musical tuning or I don't
know it doesn't start as much so thanks
a lot for watching and we will see us in
the next video bye-bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
