have some speakers in my back and I
wanted to see if portable speakers can
fight against the traffic noise here I
brought some with me like the JBL charge
- which cost about hundred forty nine
dollars it can be here for less now then
I have the brand-new ue mega bomb which
costs twice as much with three hundred
dollars and I have a Bose Soundlink
wireless music system this is a
discontinued model now but you can maybe
once on ebay for about 200 maybe 300
dollars to get an idea about the
loudness of the noise here I thought we
will start a song pressure level meter
and measure the loudness
as you can see we are around 90
vegetables
I selected see waiting in order to get a
bit more of low frequency response here
so I will set up the speakers here and
then we will have a listen I am wearing
my binaural microphones as usual let's
turn them on
and start with the JDL first
well this is full volume
I'm about five meters away maybe let's
go over a bitch powder
now let's try the mega boom
hmm
No
again again JBL
in mega boom
a bit louder sure
no chance against the noise gift
again JBL
but the measurement
three meters is some noise but
at key memorial I think we are going to
try the boughs instead and see this one
is better
let's turn it on
let's start again with you mega poney
attacks you embroider
inaudible okay
variable
cool boy where's the boat
I switch over to their bows
I think it's more than places in
watch this heavy blush a flower
Christian mega boom no boom at all
lovely night and baby thing
no closet
I think it was pretty obvious that if
you really need some boom you want to
satisfy the Omega boom I mean it's
louder for sure than the JBL charge but
the GPO judge is not so much softer it
sounds much better especially at normal
listening levels so if you need that
kind of noise and loudness you will need
something slightly bigger unfortunately
those stops producing these speakers but
if you find one at eBay for 200 $250 I
think it's worth it it's more than twice
as loud it really has great sound great
bass
the battery is exchangeable you can even
buy a second a third one exchange them
on a go and have a full day of party
thanks for watching thanks for listening
and see you next time I say Cheers
and na zdorovie</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
