would like to start this new year with
the headphone with immediately a kind of
classics revival or maybe a look back in
time I'm sure some of you will still
remember especially the older generation
will do making the 90s or even earlier
in the eighties there were three
different headphone companies German
Austrian based ones which try to be the
best having the most neutral most HiFi
the best to do - on the market namely
the AKG K 701 they biodynamic PT 880 and
the Sennheiser HD 518 and although the
Sennheiser HD 5 and 80 was the newcomer
here was quite fresh on the market it
somehow managed to stir up its rivals
which were really classics
I think the seven hard one was already
dated back to the 80s and we still have
them around although with new versions
upgraded maybe slightly tuned here I
have the AKG k7 hard - looks a bit
different than the original but I think
the tuning didn't change that much
now AKG is not Austria anymore it
belongs to Samsung also none of the
original Austrian AKG engineers is
working for AKG anymore but I think it
still sound small is the same as the
original 7r1 which not sure when it was
released somewhere end of of the 80s I
think you have the dynamic DT eternal 80
Edition looks a bit different than the
original eternal ad also without these
retro patterns so the design has changed
a little bit but I think tuning is still
typical bhaiyya dynamic and here I have
the Sennheiser HD 58 X Jubilee I made a
review about it compare it against the
HD 600 and there are modest the same
price the Sennheiser HD 58 x jubilee
costs 250 on mez drop the bio dynamic
here in europe around 130 140 euros the
AKG is also around 30 although in the
USA it's a little bit more expensive
maybe because it's important I don't
know but I think this is the most
expensive one if you buy them in the US
so let's listen how these classic models
sound nowadays how they compare all at
unit rather neutral but you will hear
there are definitely some differences
and first I would like to play them
blind so you won't know which one is
play
so I would play at the very beginning
the original track then switch between
all three and at the end again the
original track so we have a reference
how how they should sound and later on
we will listen to them already knowing
which one is which and at the very end
we'll look at some frequency response
measurements and I will give you my
resume so first let's
we can't
I think it was quite obvious all free
try to offer you this neutral kind of
sound without any artificial bass post
also meats are really quite flat but
there is some difference with treble we
had some strange coloration see was a
bit sizzling way too much turbo boost
so now let's listen to them again and
now I will show you which one is playing
I will play three additional tracks and
again starting with the original track
then switching between all three and the
original track at the end again and the
next track I will start with our
headphone so we have the entire circle
so let's listen again
so if you ask me the bad dynamic is way
too bright for my taste it even appears
as if it had the least place out of
these three while the most boosted
travel there is some peak at around
eight nine kilo Hertz some call it that
by a peak yeah I don't quite understand
how people can like it without any kind
of mode there are some knots around in
different forums so putting some toilet
paper some tissue or whatever so this
will tame travel a little bit I tried it
it becomes a little bitter but still I'm
not sure why I shouldn't take the
Sennheiser instead I like it somehow
more it has nicer bass not boosted but
sent in more lower base while the AKG
had some left/right imbalance also
appeared the most colored one also has
some treble peak but not as strong as
the biodynamic so I'm quite disappointed
with the AKG and not sure how the
original they case and a hard one sounds
but I have another one the k612 Pro
which sounds better than this in my
opinion so maybe next time we'll compare
the the 701 against the k612 also quite
it's very very sensitive to positioning
so depending on how you wear them if I
wear it centered which would be there
yet a neutral the most natural way of
wearing it sounds off way too harsh with
with presence so I rather have to put it
upwards and to the front to get the
sound a bit better yeah the easiest to
drive is the Sennheiser it has 150 ohms
this has 250 ohms but it's really hard
to drive so impossible from a smartphone
you need really a dedicated time I used
the amp here for all three the EKGs
somewhere in between so it has just 60
or something homes but it's harder to
drive them that this hundred fifty on
Jubilee here looking at the packaging's
this the AKG case on our tool reference
Studio Headphones all of them are open
back so I think they are quite
comparable here some tests from southern
recording make life beat and ok so I
really don't like it that much
it sounds off to me especially
you really have to position it carefully
and because if you move it slightly the
sound or it changes so much this happens
with all of them but not to such a
degree here the Sun can change from
really nasty to have this scent while
here losing a bit of travel but it
doesn't become harsh like this one the
packaging of the GT 880 Edition looks
like this it's a semi-open designs or
comes also with this carrying pouch here
but it's the only one which doesn't have
swept the wires so this one is fixed and
yeah you have to leave with this long
cable here the Sennheiser has is famous
to to pull plugs not that great
sometimes they lose contact after of the
after some years but at least I can buy
a new cable so we can also have a look
at some measurements and I will start
with the Sennheiser HD 58 X and yet
don't take them absolutely they look
different then yeah
standardized measurements from a grass
system or whatever this use measurement
system doesn't measure them that well
but I think they should be comparative
or yeah they should be comparable
relatively so this is the Sennheiser I
will overlay the DP 880 and you can see
you know way more treble and there is
this peak between eight and nine kilo
Hertz it has more upper base in the 300
Hertz region while below hard hurts
there is considerably less space if I
overlay the AKG K 7 or 2 here you can
see that it has some strange deep at 3
kilohertz yeah ignore this deep at 6
kilos from the sennheiser you can see
the bio dynamic has it the same but
because of this boost the treble it
doesn't appear that deep but here
obviously there is some additional deep
which obviously it has in reality
through this probably makes it also a
little bit more colored you can also see
some traffic between 8 and 9 kilo it's
similar to the biodynamic but not as
high and it seems to have the least bass
out of these 3 so yeah I hope this could
give an idea about the three classics
new classics I am a little bit
disappointed with the AKG to tell the
truth it sounds quite coloured to me
when you compare it against the k612 you
will hear that the sun's just
much better without this harshness still
very position sensitive but at least the
sound is nice and smooth without
discoloration and it's cheaper the 612
costs here in Europe below 100 euros
still I think the HD 58 X is the winner
here because it has the most balanced
sound overall without any strange peaks
and bass you could see it's not boosted
at all it has most base below hundred
Hertz they meet at around hundred fifty
and above that the others had more bass
so I'm not a fan of upper base
everything above hundred Hertz can be
flat but below hundred Hertz that can be
some boost yeah this was it I hope you
like this little journey back in time I
would like to maybe compare a new 880
Edition against a classic 880 from 10
years ago would be interesting how they
differ but I had the BP 770 for quite a
long time and I definitely liked it
liked it more than this I don't like it
that much it's way too bright really
harsh and I'm quite surprised that
people can really like it without any
kind of mode because it doesn't sound
natural it's it's not detail it just
boosted boosted a peak yeah the biopic
their famous biopic most biodynamic
headphones have this I can't quite
remember that VP sir now at 70 was also
a little bit bright but I didn't hear it
back then as such how s so harsh as this
one so yeah nothing has to say stay
tuned for some upcoming headphone
reviews I hope you like this a little
bit I hope I could help you with your
decision the HD 58 X also the HD 600
appears slightly wilt compared to the
bright ones at the wrists term
Sennheiser will I'm not quite sure if
it's really this compared to the 612 it
also appears wheeled so we will maybe
compare the HD 600 which is not dead
wield against the K
612 together with the seven huh yeah
pencil for watching I hope you enjoy
little bit and soon the next video bye
bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
