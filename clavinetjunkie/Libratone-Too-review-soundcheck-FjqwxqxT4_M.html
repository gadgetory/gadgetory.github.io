would like to make a review of the new
liberal on 1 the smaller brother of the
liberal on two that I reviewed before
and as you can see the one is quite a
bit smaller more in line with speakers
like the Denon why I mean you can see
here the denim is even slimmer well not
that much longer and I also have the
phillips bt 6,600 which is bigger but
also offers this 360-degree kind of
sound which is a special of most
currently Burton's because I hope this
video won't become too long but I really
want to cover as much as possible as I
again have a kind of love-hate
relationship with the speaker test some
nice features but also some flaws
especially the sound doesn't convince me
completely so it would need some
slightly tuning but the 360 degrees and
is really great and to get the 360 only
omnidirectional sound Lee Burton went
for quite an uncommon approach I found
this graphics here which shows you the
internal architecture and you can see
that it has two main drivers which are
firing upwards together with a passive
radiator and yeah this is a bit strange
as the sound yeah project against this
top plate here maybe inside there is
some additional diffuser or some
acoustic lens but you get really a nice
sound everywhere except the treble which
becomes a little bit resonant you get a
peak at around 12 kilo Hertz 1213
kilohertz and you always have the
impression as if the sound was yeah
diffuse inside the speaker you never get
the impression like from normal drivers
which aim directly at you so yeah this
is one of the problems another problem
is of course that it has only one
passive radiator which moves up and down
so on particular surfaces the speaker
vibrates quite a lot and it starts to
rattle not on all surfaces but we will
try this later on another great feature
is of course
battery life I let it play for at
maximum for 10 hours and it still showed
more than 50% within the app others
because I mean this is not a very loud
speaker so more comparable to maybe a
Bose Soundlink mini but it both sounds
like me that maximum will die after
three hours three and a half also a
Mendelssohn do play one can play much
louder but match to the volume of the
Liberata no one will give you also maybe
for five hours only while this place for
15 or maybe even longer I think limit on
claims 15 hours so they obviously rate
the maximum battery life at maximum
volume while demo docent claims 24 hours
for the Biot play one and you get only
two hours at maximum what else to say
yeah I think I mean it splash water
resistant and the form factor is really
nice it's not too big so I sometimes
carry it inside my on the back inside my
rucksack so it doesn't need to dangle
around but I put it into some some some
side compartment and before having a
listen I thought you might want to check
out the frequency response measurements
I tried measuring it from front from
above and from below and you can see
that the sound doesn't change that much
yeah there is some change but it still
remains pretty consistent from all
angles but you can also see this
resonant peak at around 12 13 kilo Hertz
you can also see that bass doesn't
really reach deep you have some response
800 Hertz with some lower response at 80
but it would definitely need some boost
also when looking at all available
volume steps which are 10 you can see
that there is no loudness compensation
so at low levels the speaker will rather
tend to santini but on the other hand at
high levels it doesn't reduce bass that
much so it remains pretty full-bodied
even at maximum with no dynamic
compression or Distortion unlike some
other speakers which is of course great
and yeah it's not very loud but usually
it should be enough for for a hike with
the speaker hanging on the back yeah I
thought you might be interested in
how it sounds as always i'm of course
using binaural microphones so if you
listen with headphones you should get a
realistic impression and I will turn it
on together with the Libra tone one so
we can compare these two first as I
think the one sounds a bit worse the
tool despite not being as full-bodied
still sounds a little bit more
convincing I will start with a jazzy
track and the Libra tone - so let's
let's have a listen that you wrote on -
you have to increase volume slightly you
can hear that the treble is yet more
more muffled here although this may
appear a bit too sharp so in mix of both
would be probably perfect but all of 360
degrees on so if we move around the
sound won't change much even from above
you can hear that it sounds quickly
pretty nice
let's try not back
you can hear that the treble doesn't
sound right on there one
and unlike the de Botton one the tool is
of course a stereo speaker you can hear
there is some stellar separation and
regardless how I turn it the sound
remains very nice although a little bit
diffuse so it would get along with a bit
more bass especially at lower levels
then we have this limit own app which
allows us to link both speakers either
for stereo or I don't know this does not
work all the time let's see if I manage
now I will put one above the other this
will link both speakers when they are
linked they should become available here
yeah as a new symbol and if we try
another track now
I'm not sure if no both are still
playing left and right channel so
usually you you should be able to change
this but as you can see it doesn't let
me so sometimes it works when I restart
the app let's see if this will work no I
have it here so now it's it says stereo
but it still doesn't allow me anything
this is a pity because I wanted to show
you how I can make a left and the right
one let's restart the app at first time
yeah you know it doesn't find any
speaker yeah this is definitely not very
stable let's try again I'm sure you can
link them for left and right as I
managed but now you can see it doesn't
work
so let's unlink them again and this one
will continue playing and regarding this
strange treble we can try maybe retuning
it slightly so I will start my equalizer
app I hope you can see this according to
the measurement i reduced 12 kilo hertz
slightly around 70 B with a high Q so
it's really a kind of Nod filter then at
the same time I boosted five six kilo
Hertz
and I also boosted 80 kilo an 80 Hertz
so to get a little bit more bass and we
can have a listen how the sounds first
let's start without without EQ
and I will increase volume slightly and
listen to the treble I will enable
equalizer now I hope you could hear this
peak went away
again with a cure
without to get some let's try now track
maybe this is without EQ wish you
it gets a bit more punch and also Trevor
improves quite a bit
of course there are some settings within
the app a libertine app let's see if it
works now yeah it still doesn't find any
speaker so the app needs some rework as
I have this issue quite often now it
should see this bit no it still doesn't
see so you can see uh I would probably
have to turn it off turn it on again
then the app would recognize it again
now maybe hopefully no still not up here
it is and you have some tunings neutral
is listening soft and smooth oh sorry I
know it's English we have house rock
which boosts bass and treble but the
treble becomes too much then we have
jazz club video I think I like video
most as this time straddle slightly
boosts bass slightly but it's still not
enough yet the other issue that I wanted
to show you was maybe this red link here
it works okay but when I put it here for
example
you can hear it it dances around maybe
us on the floor it's okay it depends of
course on the surface but of course you
would maybe like to know how it sounds
against the Denon by a mini so we'll
compare this to the demon is of course
not a 360 degree of speaker but I think
it's one of the best sounding ones in
this size and also price range I will
start again with that - we'll try
matching volume for both so let's have a
listen
ya hear you hear another issue we had
the same on the anchor sound cause for
Excel you can hear some volume pumping
hear how it puts the volume down and
then it becomes louder again
let's try the done by a meanie
maybe another trick this also shows the
same volume pumping have a listen
the snare was something quite loud
the denim
you it appears softer now because the
the limiter I don't know it puts the
volume down let's try another trick you
could hear it the voice become became
very loud and then suddenly it's quite
impossible to match volume for both as
their tendon remains always the same
loudness
let's try the denim
another track demo
it's also some more direct of course
the sound will suffer when I don't
listen exactly um exists especially from
behind
please holiday yo Isis no last year's
when it agrees and just mistaken
salvatore ferragamo lacks Bellucci I'm
gonna do y'all wait to say sake here we
go people he is only that another trick
then
it sounds more full-bodied and also with
better stereo separation but of course
only on exes
this has this strange diffuse character
together with this sizzling ringing
treble no trick of course we could also
try mixing volumes so I will stand up
and go a bit far away to avoid any
distortion and let's start with a mallet
rack again Libert onto first and I will
increase volume for maximum return on
where me also maximum you can hear that
then the rotten remains pretty
full-bodied at maximum and what
distracted appear seems like a lot of in
the day
no compressional of course this changes
with more complex tracks like this for
example the where the limiter will start
to push volume down again
with them
yeah the denim doesn't have this great
some dispersion we could maybe try the
Philips on PT 6600 it also offers a
little bit of a 360 degree sound it has
one driver at the front one at the back
so we can hear how these two compare
I hope it will connect well it didn't
so no it should be connected and let's
try matching volume again for both and
another track is the little pond one now
the Philips doesn't play disappeared
again from my list
well it's connected ah no
I think you can hear that that Philips a
little bit more full-bodied and the
volume jumps are pretty rough this is I
will walk again
a little bit salt
another track the Philips it has nice a
treble also quite a bit of a treble post
but the treble sound smoother I will
increase volume to maximum and their
lipid on on the Philips as well
you can give us a report on is much
softer but it doesn't apply any
compression while the Filip starts
compressing quite a bit I think the
limit on to has some nice aspects I
think I prefer it over the one is this
is quite a bit larger and also heavier
this you can easily put into some yes
some pocket maybe even but I don't think
the sound is that great as for example
from the Denon via mini but the Denon
doesn't have this 360 degree sound I
think they could retune the speaker
slightly maybe put down the speak this
12 kilo Hertz peak and it would
definitely sound much better also boost
a little bit the presence area at around
five six kilohertz and add a little bit
bass especially at low levels then the
speaker would really shine I mean 450
you can already get the JBL charge 3
which is of course much larger more
comparable to the Philips but also way
louder
although the charge 3 suffers really a
lot when not listened exactly onix's you
could hear this sounded more or less
equal regardless how it was placed on
put I only hate the red link on
particular surfaces it really rattles
around and makes listening quite a bit
uncomfortable also loudness could be
louder but I think it's enough I mean
you could hear there was no compression
no distortion even at maximum but it
could be definitely louder so this is
not a party speaker the app definitely
needs some really some some rework as
it's very unstable let's see if it sees
the speaker now yeah now it's here so we
could try the other tunings but they all
sound more or less the same yeah
battery life has already set it's pretty
impressive I mean 15 or more hours at
maximum is pretty unique for a speaker
of this kind the Denon via mean is
equally loud or maybe slightly louder
and it will die after 2 hours - I was 30
maybe I think I got to 30 at maximum so
it's a nice speaker and it's a little
bit of a pity that Lee Burton didn't
perfection eyes the sound it could
really be tuned much better just taking
away the speak slightly and adding a bit
bass and this would make the speaker
really well not outstanding or maybe
class-leading but really really decent
it's already nice now but it's not class
leading in any in any way but I think I
prefer it over the one which is a mono
speaker here you get a nice stereo sense
of stereo it's it's it's really okay so
hope this could give you an idea about
the Riverton one I hope it was not too
long yeah I wanted to cover even some
other aspects but I didn't manage anyhow
thanks a lot for watching and we'll see
us in the next video bye
education as this tripod release of what
in case of what man got committed to mus
beta it pink eye fatigue it was not this
thing yeah a half day when we went when
they should come back mothers yeah in
case of what it'll ask me not this hard
a minute</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
