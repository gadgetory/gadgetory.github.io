is already sleeping so I want to keep it
short this time just if you're an update
about the current donation status but
first please let me say thanks to all
those who have already donated as we've
reached more than half the goal we've
collected two hundred forty-four dollars
and ten euros with eight dollars still
pending as it sanity check that I've
never got before and I received
ninety-one donations from all over the
world most of them donating $1 but many
donating much more like $25 $20 so
thanks to all those if you of course
accelerate this whole thing much more
otherwise I think we wouldn't have even
reached 100 dollars these are sports
Kibo apparently we haven't part so let's
see how hostage them finding hyung's
always keep love me and hear me to
Murray d'Italia non vedo nice uno
Malagasy que cosa che allotted I went by
or aqueon poly Onofre channel
specifically la serie C and thanks to
all the others but we need still another
200 $230 of course if you won't reach
the whole amount and willing to
contribute another 50 $60 from my own
and maybe you've already noticed that I
exchanged the PayPal donation link for a
more personal one so now you are sending
the money directly to me instead of a
donation because I noticed that PayPal
charges quite a lot of fees for
donations we've already lost around 10%
I think so now if you send me $10 all 10
dollars should arrive and not be here
charged by PayPal I don't know
so again there are some days left if you
didn't donate now we are pleased to so
you can of course donate another time
and some clever ones already did so they
donated five six times and in theory
this would increase their chance to win
the speaker because for the final raffle
I will print the whole list regardless
of name just take all entries print them
on paper put them in a basket and one
will be pulled out so
if one committed 50 times his change his
chances will be higher - to win the
speaker so you can donate yeah another
time if you want if you have the money -
I will post another update maybe on
Thursday on Friday Saturday Oh No
Wednesday Thursday Friday Saturday
Wednesday Thursday Friday said that they
not just kidding so thanks again but we
are not finished yet we have a bit of
time until Sunday so please to all who
think it's worthy to get the food excel
here for a review but until then thanks
a lot and bye-bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
