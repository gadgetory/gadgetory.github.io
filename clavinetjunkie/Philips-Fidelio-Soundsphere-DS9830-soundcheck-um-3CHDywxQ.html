probably already seen the video I
recorded at the house of my friend with
his high-end Philips Pierce once because
some liked it
others obviously not so much
unfortunately the placement was really
subpar because the speakers were
standing too close to a wall which made
the sound unnecessarily boomy but the
room didn't allow for a better placement
then some others asked for more videos
like this so I thought we will check out
my own Philips office because which are
a bit of a lower grade model but still
pretty interesting so what we can see is
not just some design gimmick but they
follow an acoustic principle called
point source acoustic radiator what does
it mean you can see their main driver is
tilted upwards so at low frequencies it
really acts like an omnidirectional
driver and then the higher the frequency
gets it starts focusing the sound but
before this happens the tweeter takes
over so it's placed exactly on axis with
the main driver and the distance is less
than half the wavelength of the
crossover so you can see the housing of
the Twitter is also pretty small
therefore you get a close to
omnidirectional sound which still has
great focusing sound focusing but also a
very wide sweet spot yeah it's a two-way
system base reflex
one is active the other one passive so
the amp has hundred watts in total they
are airplay speakers there this is the
new version
I had them also in black the new version
has also Spotify Connect which allows
you to directly stream from Spotify
without having to to be connected with
your phone what else to say here they
have auxilary in a remote and you can
also adjust the sound through an app
there is a five band equalizer and I
thought we'll check out the sound how
the sounds I will try moving a little
bit so that you can see how wide the
sweet spot release I mean they are not
completely only directional but you can
really move around and the sound remains
pretty stable so as always I will be
using
my binaural microphones a head cam so
that you can see what you hear and maybe
we'll check also check out a movie first
then I will play the same songs I
already played in the other video and we
can have a short listen please put up
your headphones now as you can see I
placed them with some distance from the
wall so now you can start listening to
some music a trek from Salta sauna
together princess freesia I will walk
around through the room and we can hear
how the sound changes later on we'll
also try the Philip step so please have
a listen
yeah I think you can hear that this whip
sweet shot is pretty broad there is also
a philip set which comes with some sound
settings for example we have a
five-point equalizer so we can either
increase treble or reduce slightly there
are sixty three hundred eight hundred
four K and 10 K and there is an own full
sound setting which is a kind of maybe
loudness or something you can hear it
boosts bass and treble slightly
again with all
again with cusan
when looking at the frequency response
of the speakers you can see the one with
neutral settings they measure pretty
neutral with some slight treble boost
but this is exactly on axis and keep in
mind and this is a near field
measurement so from some distance that
treble gets lost slightly here we can
also see a measurement with full sound
enabled so you can see there is some
slight bass boost and treble boost as
well now I thought I will darken the
room slightly and we will have a look or
listen to some movie and excerpt from
how full sound is still enabled and I
will increase volume slightly
yeah they are not surround speakers but
I think they give you a nice full sound
let's check out some music the same
tracks we've heard before and usually
they should automatically switch from
from auxiliary into yeah airplane mode
so let's have a listen
whole sound is still enabled I will
disable it now because I think they
sound more natural like this and we are
slightly above half so let's increase
volume
have it increased what a bit more
yes automation that is for sure can hear
hear
is recorded within the Dragon it's
masters too loud but this is a problem
of modern music
and last but not least the drum and bass
track
yeah we would use volume what we could
also do is maybe check them at maximum
volume although I will have to go
further away out of the room because I
mean they are not the loudest because
but they are pretty loud and even at
maximum not that much distortion so I
will crank them to maximum and let's
listen to some kind of electro stuff
here we go
and we pull out for my used game so how
did you like them please leave a comment
unfortunately meanwhile they are
discontinued maybe Phillips will come up
with a new version zone but you can
sometimes find the black ones quite
cheap on Amazon I found an offer below
$200 and I think they are really worth
it
I mean they are much better than any of
these single cabinet wireless speakers
like Zeppelin Wireless or any of the
smart stuff because you have two
separate speakers with great sound stage
and real stereo sound yeah the black one
had some issues at the very beginning
therefore all the bad ratings but the
speakers are really great and I still
have my black ones they were serviced at
Philips they fixed it and they work like
they did at the very beginning so if
you're interested I also have mine for
sale just drop me a line and yeah we can
deal something out but I wanted to have
them in white because they fit in much
better here the black ones looked a bit
out of place otherwise they are just the
same with the inclusion of Spotify
connect this is the only difference so I
hope you liked this video you enjoyed it
yeah this is my main listening system I
don't have any other hi-5 speakers but I
think they are really great I love them
I like the design as they look so
uncommon I don't
I hate fridges standing in a room or
youth boxes but they look quite decent I
think
yeah you can remove this this thing here
so you can see the driver yeah I hope
you enjoyed it and maybe I will have the
occasion showing some other high fives
because I don't have any connections
unfortunately but who knows if you have
an idea why not we will bring the
speakers here and we will do some
listening things about for watching and
see you soon bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
