thought I'll do another outdoor
comparison last time we've heard how
some portable speakers fared against
loud traffic noise this time I thought
we will hear how they sound in a more
ambient rural environment I wanted to
give the UE mega boom another chance and
decided to compare it against the
infinity one which costs exactly the
same it's also water resistant to some
degree and it's about the same size as
you can see I have a nice back for the
infinity one and I would recommend
anyone who owns an infinity to use some
kind of protection during transport
because despite being quite premium the
Kurama coating is really sensitive for
scratches I will set up both here
walking around with my binaural
microphones so that you can hear how
they sound
put up your headphones and have a listen
I will turn around the mega boom because
despite being a 360-degree speaker some
people will probably complain that it's
not facing the microphone let's start
with the Infinity and turn it to the
maximum
let's try another track and start again
with the infinity
I think it was clear that the mega bomb
had better sound dispersion at 360
degrees but the base was somehow more
boomy and the treble was a bit muffled
and it was a bit louder of course how
they will compare at normal listening
levels we will see when I do my indoor
test until then goodbye and have a nice
time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
