like to give you a first hand quick
impression of their brand-new Bose
Soundlink micro they soon maybe already
know I really love small portable
speakers that I can carry around with me
all the time maybe even would fit inside
a pocket but they should still offer a
serious and decent sound and this is
where the balls really doesn't
disappoint as we will hear later on I
already read a review I think from PC
Magazine they complain that it's too
expensive the original price is hundred
ten dollars but within this class there
is hardly anything that's more which
really offers decent sound maybe the
bangle doll of some pure play p2 which
is even more expensive but the p2 is not
as rugged the battery is far not as good
and the boss is packed full with
features you can pair it with another
one for us there you can even pair it
with a southern revolve or with a color
tool it's completely waterproof yeah it
has a rubber finish so it's really
rugged
nice is of course this clip way better
than some leather loop so you can tether
it for things like this to your belt or
whatever and what's most interesting is
of course the sound
I brought a similar speaker the JBL clip
too it's half the price so $50 but I
think this is even more disappointing
regarding the price so $400 or 410 the
boss is way better I thought I would
like to demonstrate to this I will
attach them to my scooter we will take a
ride and have a listen which one sounds
better and which one is louder and so on
of course later on will be a full review
comparing the bows maybe even against
some hardest because like they're fit
for at low levels the bows really can
compete pretty well very nice natural
sound is of course at high levels the
tiny driver cannot keep up and reduce
his bass but for normal listening levels
it's impressive what the boss has
achieved so far so as always I will of
course use my head cam and binaural
microphones to give you a kind of
first-person view first-person
impression you should of course listen
with headphones I will attach them here
and let's take a ride as you can see
despite the nice carabiner there was no
way to attach the JBL so I had to use
some power tape it's much easier thanks
to the skip of the bows here let's start
and let's play some music boss is
playing at slightly above half and let's
go
their debut
pimples
the JBL is playing close to maximum so I
will increase wanna maybe one much
you can use some compression still
reasonable
here with this engine noise gets pretty
low
so I reuse warning for the post to match
the middle interest
house is playing four notches below
maximum together
JBL really sounds tinny
you should give it boasts more to the
left that you deal more to the right yes
sounds just crappy despite the height
high price $50 for this sound is just
but again retire not a song from soul
persona
also compresses a lot but regardless of
volume level is simply compressing
so let's stop here and maybe listen to
them lying here on the table so I place
them here and starting in with the both
increasing volume added bit we are again
above our volume slightly so this makes
them for their debut but yes it's
maximum their first still some notches
below
right here you despite some base
reductions to delightful as sounding the
mid JBL this sounds get a little bit
broken not a song and yeah I will use
volume for both so we can sit down maybe
for a more comfortable listening so the
boss is on high volume now slightly
lower
this sounds really quite serious not a
song
there is some slight pebbles FX's
but still quite okay for TV oh yeah I'm
not sure why I would have to pay $50 for
this this is not worth even me 20
yeah of course such small speakers autos
and these high levels will always
struggle there are simply physical
limits they cannot be broken
rather bent a little bit thanks to the
use of some clever DSP processing which
the JBL doesn't have included still I
think you would hear that they both
sounded way more serious reducing volume
to around two-thirds give you this nice
bass full-bodied sound completely
missing here so it's more comparable to
a flip three maybe even flip for at
lower levels I'm not sure the $50 for
the JBL clip two are really justified
while I think the boss is definitely
worth the $110 if you want the best
sound in the smallest factor the only
one which can compete is the pen adolfs
in do play p2 but it's already mentioned
it has pretty crappy better battery life
been adolfs and claims 10 hours for a p2
while it only manages two hours Bose
claims
six hours for the Soundlink micro I
measured it at maximum and cut close to
five hours so at least the battery life
claims are really realistic also some
nice features it can be woken up
remotely through the app paired with
another one for stereo or for party mode
even with a sounding to evolve a
sounding color pretty rugged I think you
can drop it it's completely waterproof
so yeah of course there will be a more
detailed review comparing it against
some other speakers including the Ben
adolfs ability to endorse the difference
to the clip too is even bigger and maybe
we should compare it against similarly
priced speaker like the JBL flip 4 which
is of course bigger and not as portable
so you cannot put it into a pocket like
with the boss here so it's maybe a bit
unfair but cost wise yeah Bose sound
model is the same and I think the boss
can compete quite well at low levels so
I hope this was helpful to give you a
first hands-on first impression about
the Bose Soundlink micro I'm quite
impressed and it's definitely a keeper I
am thinking of buying another one just
imagine having one here and the other
one on the right side and you have a
real stereo sound without wasting any
space yeah
thanks all for watching and see you in
an upcoming video probably the full
review of the bosonic growth have a nice
time
bye-bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
