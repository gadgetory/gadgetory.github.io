unboxing this is the Liebert on one
click which has just arrived I had to
get outside well because it's quite
beautiful we have a sunset here no but
the real reason is that my son is
already sleeping and I didn't want to
let you wait and I thought you might be
interested in doing some unboxing
together with me so let's have a look
inside it's always I'm of course using
binaural microphones so we'll do a quick
sound check how the blood were found
compares I'm also using a new camera
from a head cam from Sony which I hope
will give better image quality than my
my old action cam which was also from
Sony so we have another package inside
let's open this as well yeah LeBron has
released two news because the 1 and the
2 the 2 is not yet available so I have
just received the one click here yeah
it's already 8 p.m. but my neighbor
still thinks he has to move now well hey
another nice package this goes for 199
there is another version the one style I
think which doesn't have all the
accessories like the clip which is a bit
cheaper which costs 479 of course I have
no idea what to expect from Leviton I've
owned the very first leviton's it which
was pretty decent but lots of distortion
high levels I also did a review of the
Lamb return of the new versions with a
zip and zip mini but well I was not that
impressed by them I think the old
version definitely sounded better ok
here we have some other stickers
but you can see it has two accessories a
handle and the lock which you can will
attach to some other objects maybe and
yeah this is the black version
nothing is attached so here is the
speaker here are the accessories what's
this some other handles or I don't know
a USB cable so it's charged through
microUSB obviously and the handle let's
unbox it I hope there is at least a
little bit of a charge so we can
hopefully turn it on no idea how to
attach from there I would like to attach
the handle maybe you should read the
manual first
ok no way to attach it so here is the
power button light brought home this is
the same button we had on the label at
home
zip on the new version so let's try
turning it on yet the same tones and
like Ron claims to offer 360 degree
sound let's pair with it or try pairing
here it is my bottom one so let's put
this away okay obviously impaired and
there is an app well ignore or install
so now I will I'm ignoring it let's
let's have a listen
there is a Twitter somewhere here oh
yeah it offers 360-degree sound let's
make it a bit louder
he I mean Macbeth but let's compare it
against their hyped bangles in your play
a one which is quite a bit smaller and
lighter but it costs a bit more 250
this is stea training all of snow
I'm already at about rapport memory
Mendelson again not a big difference
doesn't sound that bad
right is from so personas latest album
momentum let's get a bit of a sunset as
well here this is the live upon one
plane now let's try another track
somewhere acoustic Jersey smooth jazz I
don't know how to call it I think it
sounds pretty decent I mean pay what it
has a bit of an own sound signature
there a one has been nipped slightly
scooped out but there is some strange
I will turn them up slightly higher
while we are close to maximum already
this is the a one now
they sound completely different I think
is also a metal face
let's try some fusion jazz with some
wrestling all things who have problems
handling this track
anyone
let's fight some electro and I will turn
volume up to maximum yeah well this is
max him already
the a one as well the fierce light in
order I would say yeah definitely softer
maybe some hot attract the librarian
won't play
and one another
therefore the size their a one is
definitely lost looting regarding
loudness and so on more than 560 be
hitting so well for a first impression
should be enough I'm not quite sure what
to think about it to tell the truth I
mean it's already one kilogram or
something 900 grams this has 600 yeah a
real review okay that's enough I think
obviously you can start music
missing somehow no Unchained everything
it sounds a little bit endemic I would
say but maybe this is just my first
impression now it's also hard to judge
them outdoors no there is lots of noise
yeah my neighbor still most it's come on
what's that what's happening now it's 12
past 8 p.m. so not the time for mowing
but he still thinks he should do here so
a real soundtrack and reviews coming
soon I hope this could give you a very
first idea about the library Tom
one-click not quite sure how to attach
them yeah I have to look into the manual
but I think you have to remove them stai
Zitto and I don't know what it feels and
looks great I think it's it has some it
has some nice
feeling so yeah but now if the one is
not that impressive
like I really am I'm not sure if the
tool will be that much better so thanks
a lot for watching and we will see us in
the next video with a real review have a
nice time and bye bye
you
this video shows how I do
a little bit wet</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
