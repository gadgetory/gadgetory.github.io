have to remove this beard yeah I hope
everything is gone now and as it's so
close to Christmas I thought this time I
would like to do a best of low-budget
portable bluetooth speaker video I know
that not everyone is willing to pay for
500 or even more dollars for a speaker
like that but there are lots of
offerings below hundred dollars which
are still pretty decent so perfect for a
Christmas present or even for yourself
if you are on a budget of course I can
only recommends because that I heard and
tested by myself there are lots of fact
or bestseller speakers that I haven't
heard and I would rather avoid
recommending them as we've seen from
some previous videos and although I
already covered these speakers in some
previous videos I would like to cover
them again at once here to give you a
better overview about what is decent I
also added links to for buying the
speakers in the description of the video
of course prices may be different now
when you watch this video but let's
maybe start with the cheapest one this
is the TDK a 25 it's not the newest
speaker therefore the price is a bit low
you can get it for $25 and I think for
this price is really one of the best if
you compare it to some ones me3 which
sounds like like some tinny I don't know
Twitter this has some really full-bodied
nice mature sound it's not very loud but
still for twenty-five dollars one of the
best you can get let's try maybe the
smallest which is close to being
pocketable and for that size is
definitely one of the best because I've
heard this is the Xiaomi me the cheapest
price I saw was on gearbest for $35 you
can repeatedly find some offerings at
this price usually it goes for 38 up to
40 dollars if you buy it directly from
Amazon it goes for I think 50 $60 still
definitely worth the price it has
decayed playback and a really mature
sound at low levels it sounds definitely
better and more balanced than the PDK it
can also play just as loud although it
cannot pick this punch as it's so small
but definitely better than any other
small speaker I've heard yeah the next
one currently I think it goes for $30
this is the taotronics parsecs it's a
nicely sounding speaker at high levels
it packs some really serious punch but
at low levels it sounds a little bit
tinny so
definitely worse than the Xiaomi depends
what you like if you like lower levels
or high levels at higher levels this
shines and it plays pretty loud involved
with some slight compression kicking in
during the last volume steps next one in
this list is the I sound bar or SL
thousand I something I don't know
currently this is the newer model is the
key K err thousand but it's still
exactly the same I didn't notice any
differences and the speaker is not
without issues if you get a great unit
it's really decent especially the 3d
mode it has which opens the sound
completely it has some nice decent bass
really great sound sounds way bigger
than many other speakers but not
suitable for high levels it can play
loud but with some distortion so on and
also notice that when you switch through
the modes it has a normal mode that bass
mode and the 3d mode the 3d mode
sometimes sounds completely different so
try switching several times and you will
notice that sometimes the 3d mode sounds
great
other times it sounds off I have three
or four copies of this I even have one
which looks a bit like a wooden speaker
but this is not real boot rather yeah
some some plastic sticker I don't know
and the wooden one has even more bass it
distorts it half level so I don't know
it's not perfect you'd really need to
get a great copy the cheapest price I
found for this KF thousand kr thousand
was $33 on Aliexpress I think but maybe
you should try one of the more expensive
ones maybe they have better quality
control I'm not sure so what else we
have this is an oldie this is the clip
geek it was released three years ago but
still really decent it has no bass boost
at low levels but really a nicely
balanced not perfect sound but pretty
punchy legs that will be treble so you
can add a little bit with EQ maybe also
great battery life one problem is you
always have to be selected from your
Bluetooth list it doesn't automatically
reconnect when you turn it on also this
strange cover I don't know it's useless
but it's a nice speaker that you can
currently get for around 450 for maybe
$60 really great speaker for that
what do we have here yeah the bubble
room 20
I think it sounds a bit better than the
clip the first unit when I did my first
video about it
I think this had some issues it was not
okay it had some self discharging this
new unit I have here doesn't have these
problems anymore it was a sounds better
with better treble a little bit less
bass also no bass boost for low levels
so for all levels I think it sounds more
tinny than this show me me but at normal
listening levels you get really some
nice bass punch way better than the
taotronics although it cannot play as
loud and starts to distort as there is
no compression like on many bose
speakers which start to compress
dynamics and so on but a really nice
hi-5 sounding speaker for my taste it
lacks a little bit of bass at low levels
but you can easily adjust it with some
equalizer just add some bass boost and
it should be fine I really like it a lot
then we have the Blitz Wolff f1 here no
this is the f4 this is available from
different brands also as X power or
easyacc I think the little has the best
features included also nice bass boost
at low levels not perfectly sounding I
think the X power sounds a little bit
better but it doesn't have bass boost
for low level so it sounds again tinny
even worse than the volume but the blitz
wolf has this all so you have to try it
out I saw that this easyacc which is
looking exactly the same had some issues
there was some buzzing I think there is
another unit from piece Evo which is
available on UK store from Amazon I
haven't heard that one but I think it's
also similar you just have to try it out
the Blitz wolf is that is nice performer
not perfect there are some tribal issues
but it's a nice all-rounder for around
50 for $59 yen then we have the popular
and I don't know famous anchor premium
yeah $59 I think or $50 depends this
speaker is also available from other
brands with a little bit different
tuning may be the gem heavy metal the
fitting Royale are they all are based
around the same drivers with the same
basic radius and so on just a lil bit
tunic and a different hole the anchor is
maybe not the best sounding out of these
but the current units don't have any
issues no artifacts at low levels
also don't distort as much as the other
ones the other ones have so much base
books that at higher levels when you'll
get some some kicks they start to fart
and so on the anchor does this as well
but not to such a strong degree so
depends you might even try the
taotronics boom X which is even cheaper
but the unit I tried had some issues at
low level so they were definitely
artifacts it was not usable for all
levels their anchor doesn't do this it's
not perfect it would need some EQ to
really shine and come closer to the
others but the basics is the same as
with all the others because yeah what
else we have here flip three JBL flip
read one of their ya best all-rounder
still currently the price went down a
little bit so you can get it for $79 in
Germany some setter and stores headed
for 59 euros so really recommended
speaker maybe not as great sounding or
refined as the volume 20 but still a
better round as it can play louder does
not distort it's also rugged waterproof
or water-resistant a really nice speaker
that I still recommend a lot and yeah
it's nothing special but simply doesn't
have any any flaws except maybe the well
compounds like boom
so yeah the Libra tone 2 is maybe not
the best sounding speaker was not the
loudest definitely softer than their
flick 3 but I still like it a lot
currently you can get it below hundred
dollars for I think 99 it has a great
360 degree sound dispersion great
battery life at maximum way more than 12
or 12 hours which is impressive I like
it to be taken in a rucksack or
something you have it there for hiking
and it plays music really really nice
but the sound is maybe not perfect it
could get along with a bit more bass or
so treble is a bit harsh but when you
have it on your back it's it becomes
okay again and thanks for the 360
degrees on this version you get a better
sound than for example a free 3 which
gets a little bit lost due to the more
directional sound yeah this is the music
sound cuff only available on beg good
currently if
for $50 usual prices 59 it's not perfect
it has some travel issues sounds maybe a
bit muffled but has also nice 360-degree
sound half the price of the Libra tone 2
also pretty loud louder I think it's a
nice speaker yeah not the best but
definitely recommended here we have the
soundbot SB 525 which goes for 39 or 40
dollars it was already offered for 35 it
looks like a JBL charge - in reality
it's a copy of a JBL charge 3 sound wise
but it has some travel issues as well so
not as loud as they charge 3 but similar
bass punch and you may like it
it definitely shines with some addition
of EQ with some some treble boost and so
on yeah this is an oldie but Goldy the
TDK track max a 34 I bought this for 55
euros new currently it's not listed
anywhere but you should find it below
100 dollars
the only issue the speaker has is maybe
battery life at high levels it will
reduce volume after 15-20 minutes but
it's still a very nice sounding was a
powerful one of the loudest here
yeah great rugged nice speaker and an
evergreen let's say yeah then I have
here the Sony HD one I added it here
because you can currently find it as
refurbished for $99 on Amazon it was
already offered for 79 refurbished and I
think for this price it's definitely the
best here I mean it has lots of features
included like Wi-Fi you can you have
Spotify connect deal and a streaming it
has even Google cast and everything and
it sounds decent with a little bit help
of a cue so if you add some treble and
bass you get a pretty balanced sound
also nice bass boost for low levels
problem is here at higher levels it
starts to compress a lot you get an over
processed sound like typical for most
solid speakers so definitely not for
high levels but all of these smaller
speakers are not that great for high
level listening these are rather meant
for yeah for indoor listening for nice
levels except maybe the TDK this music
also pretty loud the flip 3
but all the others are rather they
follow a part at Highlands then here the
rear is currently offered for $99 this
for this price it's really a steal
although I think the sony is a better
deal because of the way more features
also charging is done through microUSB
while you need yeah appropriately
charger for the rear is it sounds better
at high levels than the Sony doesn't
compress at all but still I think the
sony is a little bit better if you can
get it for $99 even as is refurbished I
think it's worth it yeah I would have
liked to include the bass boom as well
unfortunately I got the info that it
won't be released anymore so you won't
be able to buy it on Amazon anymore but
another company will come out with a
speaker like that similar one maybe even
the same one but with another brand name
I have no details when this will be the
case and what the name will be but the
bass Puma is shown in my video yeah
doesn't exist anymore you can buy it
directly from them with some edit
shipping but the $99 price you had on
Amazon yeah it's not valid anymore so
maybe let's wait for the successor there
is the shockwave and some other speakers
which look similar or even the same I
really cannot say anything about them I
haven't heard them they are similar to
the bass Puma but I heard that the shark
has some issues yeah distortion issues
the bass BMO doesn't have them it's
really now it has some heavy bass so if
you like basically music yeah maybe
let's wait for the successor model of
course I will tell you them which one
how it's called and so on yeah and let's
bet at least we have the Archie a320
it's a bit bigger but also you can get
it for below $100 sometimes even $70 the
only thing you have to do is really
stuff the port with something here close
it because otherwise you get this
fighting it sounds better with the port
closed and although not balanced it has
a really basic tuning some liked it more
than the bass Puma I
I yeah I mean I like it but I prefer a
more balanced sound so for example like
the Sonia here or the device but it's
definitely a nice speaker some nice
stereo enhancing yeah then yeah what
else we could include I mean the Onyx to
do there the older versions you could
maybe get them for below hundred dollars
or close to 100 definitely a great
speaker maybe not as portable as it's
huge and and battery life is crap but
yeah it's a great speaker what else not
sure I don't have them but there are
definitely some other recommended
speakers below hundred dollars which I
don't know the creative for or two but I
think for normal use the Sony sounds way
better I compared the Sony with the I
roll go and for normal levels I prefer
the Sony it has better bass nice a
treble the arrow goes sounds a bit yeah
a bit muffled although it can play way
louder its place yeah louder than the
bass boomer but yeah it's also more
expensive so you have to pay a toll to
pay hundred seventy up to two hundred
dollars so I think below hundred dollars
these are definitely one of the best
I've found maybe there are other ones
that I haven't heard I don't know from
those those bows no dos I haven't heard
any speaker from them some are raving
about it also the shark what's the name
I don't know there is one it's called
masked boy there are some again the same
speaker off at other different brand
names for $50 lots of great raving
reviews but I haven't heard it so I
cannot say anything maybe it's decent
maybe not but these with some flaws
definitely recommended if I had to
choose and yeah one I would maybe choose
the show me me especially the new
version doesn't distort anymore and it's
a great sound for normal levels you
really have the impression of if as if
you already simple sums or some way
larger speaker but as an overall winner
maybe the Sony HD one maybe I raved a
little bit too much about this peak in
my previous video but it costs 250 euros
not $99 for 250 you can find way better
speakers but 490 $100 this is very
decent I compared it a little bit with
the Bose Soundlink mini it also has this
extra bass button which boosts pace a
lot that you even get some distortion at
low levels but even with extra bass it
still sounded way better than the boss
nice a travel nice a definition of sound
similar compression that both compresses
as well but the Sony overall did a much
better job for way less money and with
way more features so Sony and show me me
would be probably the my my picks here
yeah volume is really great I'm really
only missing some bass boost at lower
levels and at high levels it starts to
distort a little bit early maybe but
still a really great and balanced filmed
speaker yeah and this was it choose one
that you like most
I really cannot recommend you the best
one because each of them has some some
advantages or some flaws I told you I
really know the Xiaomi as you can put it
into a pocket the CL and walk around go
hiking and no traveling it's charged
through microUSB so you don't need an
additional charging unit but I also like
the liberal tone to
or hiking as I simply put it into my
rucksack crank it up to maximum it will
still play for the whole day and the
sound doesn't fall apart at high levels
there is no distortion no compression
really really nice yeah I think this was
it I hope you like this I hope I could
give you an overview of course all of
these speakers are edit within my
database please check this out you can
compare them all to each other I updated
the show-me me because the old unit I
had had some distortion at this
particular level
I'm usually recording them this one
sounds way cleaner
although the rock track and jazz still
distort a little bit but this is already
a level closer to maximum on the show-me
standard volume or standard volume is a
little bit higher so this is really for
serious music listening if you want to
sit down and crank the speak a bit
higher I also updated the I sound band
with the with this new unit here it
sounds a little bit cleaner maybe but
it's still not perfect so they really
need to have better quality control
although for $33 I mean what do you
expect I've heard speakers for 33 or
even more dollars that sound way worse
this for low levels I prefer it even
over the the leakage or even when I
compared it to the FIFA Oslo I mean this
is a pure hi-fi this is really it cannot
be any better but this cost five or four
hundred fifty dollars while you can get
this for 33 so still impressive what
they achieved with some clever DSP
processing yeah I wish everyone a Merry
Christmas not sure if I will manage to
do some further videos if we yeah if
this is my last video of this year then
I wish you a Happy New Year as well I
hope I can manage something else maybe
something you will will appear there are
some interesting speakers on the horizon
I don't tell you now but when I have
them I can hopefully tell you more about
it until then yeah thanks a lot for
watching enjoy Christmas have a nice
Fiesta fest hello Alyce scooter choose a
path and see
by
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
