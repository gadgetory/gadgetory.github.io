this has just arrived and you can see it
comes from Devon I have never heard any
speaker from Devon they just released a
new version of the warm outdoor which
has two drivers at the front and the
back which means it offers only
directional sound as you can see
security checked so contents of this
package package have been checked for
security maybe there is
hopefully no bump inside otherwise it
will have an interesting video and first
one is the time box
I thought we will do this later on the
more interesting one is the boombox
outdoor - I think so let's have a look
at this first
this goes for 69 dollars or Euros I
think and maybe some have already
noticed I also have the new valve 120
here I didn't have any time to cover
this yet but I will definitely do it
this is a pretty decent speaker it goes
for $79 so $10 difference and I thought
this might be quite comparable I think
the ba-ba-boom 20 is really really nice
for this price although it has some
issues I would like to cover these
issues in an own video currently I don't
tell that much time therefore I just
wanted to make this unboxing together
with you and as always and of course
using binaural microphones so we can
have also a short listen to the speaker
and we can hear how it compares to the
lava in 20 given given boom and
ba-ba-boom so here they're quite
comparable the Box reminds me a bit of
the gem box of the original gem box box
and it was exactly the same with this
with this plastic package and and you
can see yeah
one Twitter one Drive at the front and
the same at the back
yeah and I think they are symmetrical or
at least they should be their passive
radiators two of them so if they are
symmetrical the vibration is a bit
reduced while in this case I'm not sure
if it's visible there is one here a
smaller one and a big one it's offset so
there is a little bit of vibration but
their valve on 20 has nice soft feet so
it doesn't rattle around like many
others because with only one passive
radiator or a symmetrical ones I think
the ones from from the small fugu were
also a symmetrical although I cannot
quite remember so let's open this and
have a look inside I have looked at some
reviews and they were quite positive
although someone motion that he would
have expected more base so let's have a
look for listen and here is the D
boom-boom outdoor no deivam boombox out
to us or even voom and Bala boom yeah
size-wise not that much difference quite
comparable this is of course or it gives
a little bit of a more rugged impression
while this it immediately turns on so
let's look it up in in my bluetooth list
here this one box outdoor yeah and we
can have a listen immediately
a volume is in sync with iPhone so if I
increase volume here it increases on the
iPhone as well on Android devices that
is not the case and it should give
omnidirectional sound you can hear that
the trailer comes from here while here
and here at the hi-hats
we can of course switch over to the
ba-ba-boom 20 yet quite comparable
although I think this has small base it
sounds a bit more bass level to me or
not bass heavy because this is not a
bass heavy speaker it makes us really
flat surprisingly flat this gives a bit
more of a monkey impression may need
another track boom nice I mean it's not
completely omnidirectional as you can
hear on the side it gets a bit lost but
to get a nice sound from front and from
the back Nala home again that the sounds
a bit mysterious
sounds more boxy or funky because the
120 from behind doesn't make sense
it's not bad but responds a bit more
serious I would say it's more control
maybe to the LGPL lip 3 or something not
quite on the same level of the bottom 20
although yeah from behind the lava
cannot quite I think I will have to take
up that his umbrella here because it was
quite sunny when I started but now it's
gone so this is the Vava voom no this is
not bad there at all
I will try increasing volume for maximum
sister ba-ba-boom 20 now quite a bit of
distortion already the boom box also yet
leaner and even louder yeah at maximum
deivam obviously has big advantages
different lines remains pretty punchy
the end table of 120 has no chance here
especially from behind this is
definitely impressive let's say for
outdoors it's quite loud I think it's
louder even than the flip three or maybe
more full body that makes me maybe not
as loud but at low levels there doesn't
seem to be any sound adjustment so at
low levels I think it could get along
with a bit more bass maybe let's try
another track but I can hear that it's
not really I mean yeah there is some
bass missing at low levels you have to
increase volume
Rangeela vibration you have to increase
volume to half at least otherwise it
sounds a little bit tinny let's switch
over to the bow again and reduce volume
a bit this has no sound adjustment
either for low level but you can hear
and feel the vibration I'm already this
is not sync by the way yeah doesn't have
this full-bodied full sound on Bowl
quite a bit louder than the allowable
yeah I think it's an interesting speaker
and we will definitely compare it
against some others like the JBL flip 3
packaging again that's what we have
inside here only a wire manual so no
charge included but let's have a look at
the ports here come on
my nails are too short maybe yeah USB
and auxiliary in nothing interesting I
think I like the well that confront
approach it's not fully 360-degree sound
as we've heard from the side it lacks a
little bit unlike for example the demo
Dolf simply apply a tool which even
sounds great from the side the Twitter's
really disperse the sound nicely here
the Twitter's are probably a little bit
hidden but I think it has potential so
yeah for now I hope this was enough its
first impression and not sure if we
should unbox this as well this is that
time box which has some interesting nice
display
no but we'll leave this for another time
it's already long enough I don't want to
yet over am overwhelm you with my long
videos of course as soon as I will
manage I will put both into the database
database sorry currently I don't have
that much time or possibility to do this
but all this because I cover here will
be of course
included within the database okay you
can really switch between one or the
other I hope you like it so far it's
still not very very stable but I hope I
and my programmer me and my programmer
will manage as soon he is currently
studying so not much time but he did a
great work
with the database all my ideas he
managed to bring them into into life and
yeah it was not easy so I hope you liked
it and yeah I hope you find it useful
currently not much time to include them
but I hope during the next let's say 2
or 3 weeks I will manage to include some
others because as well I also have the
what's the razor Libya Leviathan mini
and I'm really disappointed by this this
will be of course included as well so
there are lots of other further speakers
coming to be included but as fun out
there or there are earlier I think
hundred thirty speakers some with
different sound settings or with
different modes like for example the
Harman Kardon go in play is included
with and without cover or with battery
or from AC power so you really have the
choice to listen to all of them yeah
thanks for watching this short not so
short unboxing I think it's pretty
decent although yeah I would have
preferred more bass at low levels and
maximum it sounded pretty punchy so
there doesn't seem to be much bass
reduction many others because sound
full-bodied at low levels then they
start reducing bass here it's the other
way around
it sounds full-bodied at maximum but at
low levels it doesn't add bass so yeah
it's a pity but well for maximum
outdoors why not it's nice but for
indoor listening yeah I think the Vava
voom 20 is pretty pretty nice really
nice full-bodied sound although at very
very low levels maybe remember my me I
really love this Xiaomi me
let's turn this off again and let's
compare this to adjust
yeah just for is it so interesting I
hope it will connect so yeah did it yeah
I think it did okay it's connected and
let's this is they're showing you
although it's already playing quite a
bit on a higher level of course the D
boom boom box outdoor will sound a bit
more pop and you can hear that this
sounds really nice for this size how do
we use volume slightly and let's listen
again
it's definitely more boxy also treble is
not as fine so for low levels this
really shines one of the best pocketable
speakers I've heard yeah sorry for this
Intermezzo just wanted to show you the
show me show me show me show me I don't
know how they how they call it or
pronounce it show me show me probably
show me it's really a nice speaker so
thanks a lot again and sorry for this
longer unboxing wasn't intended most of
my videos are improvised just to let you
know so I don't have any plans I get
this package unbox it and talk a little
bit so sorry for that maybe next time I
thought to prepare what's this neighbors
next time maybe I should prepare myself
a bit better I will do for the time box
maybe we will leave the the unboxing and
immediately go into into into a review
but it sounds really sounds it looks
really great packaging everything quiet
freshest here of course some was
probably nothing special but I think
this LED lightning here could be pretty
decent there was some other protection
yeah and okay look at this wow it's
Bluetooth okay it was not planned so
what's this it's seven no it's not 724
we should maybe time box audio pine box
audio but it looks really great I think
in the evening or at night as a
nightstand definitely nice so let's
listen to two the sound here ah the Sun
is coming at the back this is a bit
strange yeah there was no place for a
speaker I think it's not that bad
actually don't seems to be some
basically the inside because it vibrates
a little but of course here like this
not that impressive also synched
obviously
this is nice as many companies meanwhile
add volume sinking you can switch
between track spots you should listen to
it like that I mean still pretty
interesting and no idea how to maybe I
will need the app to adjust the clock
the vibration are the the flickering you
see is just the video it doesn't flicker
I see it on my on my remote that it
flickers where is it but it doesn't
flicker in reality it's not really so
there shouldn't be any flickering yeah
really really nice let's turn it off
again and this will be become my
companion for the night stand
definitely I have a very very cheap
clock but this looks of course much
better and maybe it can even wake with
some music I don't know let's see so
more coming up next it became even
longer than I intended
sorry for that but there is so much
stuff coming also the new toy for
Dempster Pro which we've already heard a
little bit hidden
so yeah I have to cover everything a
little bit which is quite heavy here the
valve room will be covered as well just
like the the Razer Leviathan Leviathan
mini which is really 460 or what they
are asking for it's pretty crappy if it
costs 70 $60 I wouldn't say anything but
for 156 days really
junk so thanks again yeah
and we will see us soon in another video
hopefully I hope you enjoy the database
and database database database database
and yeah if there are some issues please
let me know and I hopefully will manage
to fix its own but yeah it's been more
than one and a half years to prepare and
and it's really hard to get it that far
so I'm glad we managed to have it like
it's now here so things that I get again
for watching and we'll see you soon bye
bye boy</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
