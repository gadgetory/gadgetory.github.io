and look how much snow let's measure
this I don't think we have ever had so
much snow here 35 centimeters well not
that much but I think it's already
melting so it was so funny yesterday I
thought we will check out the smaller XB
XB s 30 yeah against the charge 3
outdoors and i think we can also check
it against the bigger brother i will try
to fight myself here to us no i hope i
will manage
what yeah and let's put them somewhere
here maybe okay so we really have never
had so much snow in April yet since I'm
living here and yeah we will listen to
the bigger one later on although I can
already tell you that they're big on is
of course much more powerful but the xb3
is more in the class of the charge 3 and
I set the equalizer similar to what we
had you can see it maybe not similar to
what we had passing this working strange
similar to what we had on the XP 40 so
bass and treble at maximum with extra
bass enabled I will start with doesn't
react to my finger slide my phone died
how it works because I'm connected and I
will start again with so persona and
princess we just track analog they are
playing it headed to third snow
trust me how to be different from the
basis of a honking nickname to the sound
I will step back and increase volume to
maximum hope I hope fall over with all
the smoke so clicking volume mouth
already brightest matically or I cannot
make it to any data at least Estonia at
maximum and the sharp three also at
maximum a little bit softer there is
lots of compression but still quite
punchy
oh I'm blown away here yeah Ashley
definitely loses here in overall
loudness perfect
I think this part on compression with no
distortion and it remains quite pancetta
it's better than the old xp3
this one bit strange the traffic
inspecting well yeah I was afraid of
falling so I have no ice behind me I can
hear their only first really well I
suppose X is let's check and we lose it
at the grid not rec have come closer at
least we can hear me
more different assess from far away they
are just loud I can hear is no
distortion I think the trust we need to
 you
let's winter before time okay we already
have spring much firmer
they're super phones are quite low here
market low the to do do a lot of the
definitely movie
aren't you seen are both have slight
compression
quite my face the GBR here also more his
imagination already here about from the
charge with no training doesn't sound
right anymore so I'm really quite
impressed what Sony did here at Tyler
was quite usable I would say let's try
the little brother and goodness they are
all waterproof or resistant the big one
is also set to two extra base and let's
try that rack
I will reduce volume again for the hex
bit sorry slightly and not afraid from
so personal princess freesia you can
hear sound quite nice the tie level
feels quite function they're hit before
it is of course more power
or in more powerful ways north how do we
follow more hollow meeting spot has
better life think about years outdoors
is not the curable mean you can use
revell some what similar to the charge
playing on the XP 40 why they xkey 30
have some really nice a Potrero so
increasing volume to maximum again with
five force but a good one
not much louder
we are quite comparable not rekt again
I'm also clean pay for that but it's
really an exception that whether you
so does it take the thirtieth maximum
take the 40 you can hear better bay but
loudness is not really that much
different
yeah real quite impressive run effects
via the does not disperse there xp3
distorted quality especially with extra
bass enabled for the spaces quite
natural from the DIY project twice the
size without magic
you can impress the Trillium I really
think I already like it more than the
charge with it will expect much more
difference between the two come on
effect this is the token base I will use
volume with this it's usually close by
you won't touch high levels because the
bigger one has more punch to the face
add some hollowness unfortunately very
happening it's lower levels you could
meet right running off excavation that
roof is linebacker
outdoors I think you will meet this
extra base if it really pushes pace a
bit more but I don't like the travel
from the XP 14,000 tons right it has
again its character
this sounds simply nicer view from
nocopyrightsounds
track and again increases volume to
maximum goal but level stood quite well
whilst have any distortions also no
intimate relations place why it cannot
compete with the larger one but I think
overall this town is better from the
smaller XP 30 yeah just a very quick and
short subject before the snow melts away
again but look into this looks crazy
yeah we had lots of snow this year but
not as much and Pauline April this looks
really really ridiculous
what is this are we built a snowman
yesterday it would fall off it fall over
it looks really funny all the plans yeah
are close to to die obviously they were
not such a such a coal here is not
expected anymore at this time so yeah I
hope you liked it anyhow despite lots of
wind now it stops somehow look night
became Karma so we can maybe check
another track with the charge three
years I think this both are more
comparable but you've heard a lot advise
that charge three has no change let him
try stepping back again here and let's
try a really large track from ultra
look I want to start music and wind
starts again no no I want to
yeah want to making crazy so explicitly
here it is let's try this comp
we lost here this city was also better
effective red Troy
yeah that's the deficit from Austria so
here you have it a new of my loudness
King but definitely louder than the UE
boom - and and with much more punch much
more bass at maximum so quite impressive
we will of course do a more detailed
sound check it was just because it
arrived yesterday when I did the outdoor
video my snow video with the X before so
I thought I will cover the expectation
as well as long as we have this nice
atmosphere so I hope you like this I
hope you enjoyed it a little bit I hope
you enjoyed the snow but next video will
be without again so thanks a lot for
watching have a nice time and bye
