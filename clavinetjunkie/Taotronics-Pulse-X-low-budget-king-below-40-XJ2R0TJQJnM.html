look at the new taotronics pulse x I got
interested in this one because we're
looking for develop one I noticed it was
sold by a company called Sun Valley tech
they obviously also distribute the pulse
X here it goes for $36 so more a
low-budget speaker probably comparable
to the witan panca we've heard before
this calls for 43 and the anchor sound
cross-product cell which calls for 60 I
was not that impressed with this to the
truth but when looking at all the raving
reviews of this one you can see most of
them are 5 or 4 stars only very few 3
star no single 2 or 1 star review so it
looks really promising therefore I
thought we will check it out have a look
inside do some short and quick unboxing
and later on we'll compare it against
some other speakers yes technology
enhances life that's true indeed here is
the speaker not too heavy
yeah design is really really smooth and
simple but has great lines just a box
with rounded corners here or edges yeah
you can see maybe I'm not sure if it's
visible there are two drivers yeah at
the back you can see maybe a huge
passive radiator so each foot maybe pack
some punch what else is inside yeah just
some wires charging is done from a
microUSB obviously and yeah what else
probably a manual yeah so nothing
interesting no charging lid but well for
thirty five for six dollars let's to
expect of course we would like to know
how it sounds
therefore I'm using binaural microphones
you should listen with headphones and
let's check out some tunes yeah nice
welcome tone
not too loud let's see if it connects
yeah and we can check out a first tune
from soul persona so let's have a listen
the volume is not synced with with knife
and so we have to keep it at maximum to
have the entire volume range here and I
think it sounds pretty solid
they obviously know dynamic place post
so at lower levels maybe a little bit
tinny but still sounds pretty decent the
depressive way that the bags definitely
contributes the sound but I think this
is more a speaker that likes it closer
to the wall so let's listen now
yeah I think it becomes more punchy we
another trick you can definitely feel
the punch of the bass drum here pretty
impressive I will turn it slightly
higher this is maximum
maybe a bit to boo me as close to the
wall but I think you can hear that the
sound is really solid
of course I measured it and you can see
some frequency response measurements at
different locus levels and although not
perfectly flat you can maybe notice that
the bass roll rolls off really really
smoothly so there is not a sharp cutoff
like on many other speakers but you even
get some response down to 50 Hertz
although not very loud so at low levels
it could get along with a bit more bass
boost the treble is not as fine as it
could be but I think overall it's a
pretty nice performer so first let me
compare it against the within punker
we've already heard it before and I will
start again with the taotronics pulse X
the fitting anchor yeah I mean I think
it's pretty obvious I will put them on
again away a little bit
and let's increase volume the between
Punk as well well solid at maximum lr6
yeah also maximum it's just no
competition at all maybe let's try the
anchor sound core excel we've already
heard some days ago so let's turn this
let's turn this off here doesn't want
and let's try the anchor should also
connect and I will try to try again
matching volume for both um and let's
try another track
Hey sounds pretty punchy
don't cry
I would increase volume again
on their anchor as well there is this
already mixed in here the context I will
increase it for mixing as well
you're not in the same class let's
reduce volume slightly for both it still
sounds much fuller and much better so
maybe we should compare it against the
flip three I mean the flip three costs
more than twice maybe the pulse ex can
compete here here is the flip three
check a boom and yeah I will try
matching volume again so it's connected
and let's try now track again starting
with the pass X here we are
lower volume now the flip three it
sounds a little bit more full-bodied but
also not as clean as the pulse X you can
only hear some strange distortion of the
based on I will increase volume slightly
and the flip three starts reducing bass
the Pollux
it keeps the level yet start sounding
more Keaney let's crank them to maximum
again this is their clique we know so
you can get all the base case reduce the
past X as well there is some compression
going on but it still doesn't lose its
punch get another quick drink all right
man I'm up next on the capstan show you
folks Melissa Lee now to come out with
the pin spider a slightly softer than
the flip three but has a much more
punchy more bass heavy sounded maximum
therefore maybe let's compare it against
the well TDK track max that a 34 and I
will put them again a bit far away where
is my phone and let's start with another
track again pass X first I will Chris
water
this is the track max now it's
automatically switched but you can
already hear some distortion a place
from is not clean anymore I will
increase volume on the car sex it's
louder but not very clean pass X again
and let's try maximum the track max I
will increase volume to maximum as well
doesn't sound that clean so it's
definitely louder doesn't have this
bunch of the perfection
track mix again I will use what in
flight baseball both become more
comparable yeah I think this sounds more
convincing let's try not attract the TDK
I think it's really impressive it has
much more lower base punch than the TDK
which were also pretty quickly so I mean
for $35 - this is really impressive I
mean it wipe the floor with the anchor
and I think this is what I would call
maybe kind of well a low budget King or
something not sure if there are many
other better sounding speakers than the
taotronics I mean it could definitely
get along with a bit more bass at low
levels maybe some dynamic adjustment I
don't know but you could hear it maximum
at high levels you had remained pretty
punchy with lots of nice bass no
distortion just some slight compression
so keep volume down two or three notches
and you should be fine yeah I mean I
think I will definitely keep it and use
it as my future reference for all other
low budget comparisons as this simply
wipes the flow with all of them I even
prefer it over the JBL flip three this
sounds may be better at low levels there
is some bit more bass boost but as soon
as you turn both past half this easily
takes over and I mean for $35 or 36 you
cannot expect much more so I'm really
impressed I even noticed that it shows
an on battery symbol here so yeah when I
when I get into my settings I see the
pulse x with 50% battery so yeah it has
everything you need
I'm really really impressed although not
the perfect sounding speaker for $35
it's maybe one of the best I've heard
definitely better than the TDK a 25 and
also maybe not cheaper you I saw the TDK
a 25 for 25 dollars already this cost 35
36 in Europe a bit more expensive with
for the 5 euros but still even any other
speaker I've heard below 50 euros or
dollars cannot quite compete with this
so I hope I could give you an idea about
the taotronics what you can expect from
it
is definitely a very nice speaker no
knick-knack but just simple design and
nice solid performance I cannot say
anything about the battery life yet as
it has just arrived but yeah we'll check
out this also soon so I can tell you
more but it looks really solid so in my
future tests compared against some other
low budgets because I will definitely
use this one as this seems to put the
level a bit higher than most of the
others especially this one is ready and
I'm not sure who wants to listen to
music with this so thanks a lot for
watching and we will see you soon bye
bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
