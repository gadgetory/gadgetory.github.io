Osmo plus quite an interesting camera
comes with this nice flight case like
pouch like one from a guitar and today I
wanted to talk a little bit about this
camera not in a kind of review but
rather giving you my thoughts about it
also showing you some of its flaws which
I think yeah a complete deal-breaker
I thought I might use it for my future
videos also as a as an alternative to my
usual sony action cam this is that if
they are XP thousand I usually have it
mounted to my head quite light quite
nice has nice image stabilization sony
calls this boss so balanced optical
steadyshot I think yeah but the lens is
has this typical fisheye effect also
image quality is not that great so I
thought yeah I would need something
bedroom and here it is unfortunately
yeah the camera is far from perfect
footage is really great if you yet the
deadness glide cam like stabilization
it's basically a camera on a gimbal but
here we have the first problem yeah in
order to use it you have to mount it
first so use your camera you simply turn
it on but here you have to open the
screw here this is the phone holder so I
will screw it in again otherwise the
phone will wobble around I will mount my
phone now turning on the camera you have
to release the lock here and I could
immediately start shooting the problem
is I don't see anything it doesn't have
any display so I don't know if it needs
any white balance correction or exposure
correction so you have to connect to the
camera first through Wi-Fi and this also
takes a while so let me see so here it
is so before starting to shoot yeah you
have to to unmount it to connect start
the app and this can take up to 1/2
minutes until the app now it's and we
can start filming so the app is quite
nice you can see you can eat say it has
a 3.5 zoom so you can zoom in here
through the app or through the buttons
and you can see the camera usually stays
level all the time so this is thanks to
the gimbal problem is it's not perfectly
leveled you will notice this when
shooting indoors with straight lines or
architecture outdoors it's not such a
problem but as soon as you are indoors
you see that it's after turning it on
it's not perfectly leveled so you would
have to let calibrate it but others
there is no possibility to do usually
you should put it onto some yeah some
horizontal surface start the calibration
which also takes one minute or something
and then it's perfectly calibrated but
doing this every time after turning it
on is I think a back yeah it's already
what I mentioned the phone holder is
also a bit clumsy I cannot yeah move it
anymore so if I want to shoot from above
I don't see my phone I would have to
turn it but I cannot because it's
screwed in I also cannot cannot turn the
screw because yeah it's quite tight so I
would have to remove the other default
again put it in again and if I don't
screw it in it's it remains a little bit
wobbly and also this phone holder it's
so yeah I cannot screw it in because
yeah it's too tight so everything like
this made shooting a little bit
frustrating
apart from that yeah the the gimbal
should be usually centered but you can
see it's not so you can reset it with a
double press of this front button here
problem is it doesn't remain centered I
had a gimbal before and it always of
course it stabilizes so it has some
delay but it remained always centered
this one doesn't of course I can also
move it with the joystick you can see
the the camera moves around but let's
say I don't want to use the joystick I
want the camera to stay always centered
if I move it around at some certain
point it won't be centered anymore but
looked somewhere to the side or above
let me see how it looks it's still going
but it still looks a little bit to the
right
so when I
when I press reset you can see there was
some movement if you do this during
shooting you will get yeah a movement
which destroys the the shot so I'm not
sure if this is a bug or some feature
but I think the camera should usually
stay always centered and it doesn't also
a problem for me the camera has a 3.5
zone I think I mentioned it
starting with 22 millimeters which is
quite a nice white ending not too wide
angles and it's Morris rect linearly
corrected so you don't get this nasty
fisheye effect like from the Sun here
and it is you can zoom in to 77
millimeters but the lens is not very
bright it starts at 2.8 and stops at 5.2
I think so when you shoot 60 P the
camera always tries to get double the
double the shutter speed so 125th and
with this battle ends it will
immediately jump into ISO 3200 thousand
six hundred or is already lots of detail
loss with 3200 the shot is smallest
blurry although you have like with light
like this you will get quite blurry
shots
therefore yeah I would have definitely
preferred a better lens or let's say a
brighter one or maybe not a 3.5 soon but
maybe two would be enough as 77
millimeters is already quite I would
maybe 222 up to 50 or something we are
zooming in the tip yeah I screwed it in
again so I cannot show that this is
ready this phone holder is a little bit
if you don't screw it in or if you don't
tighten it it will wobble around which
is also not that great so so you can you
can directly zoom through the phone so
the display here which does not work
always well so if you don't touch the
right area you will rather touch the
focus point which is also a problem that
I would like to talk about the camera
doesn't have any continuous focus
I mean it's a small sensor and the lens
is not as bright so the depth of field
is not really that narrow but still if I
for example if I want to shoot this this
area here I would have to refocus
because the camera doesn't during
shooting and it also refocuses
automatically after you zoom in or zoom
out so if you try to zoom during a shot
you stop zooming it will refocus and
it's not that continuous focus but you
get this hunting effect so it also ruins
a shot yeah what does to say although
the cards are formatted with X FET which
doesn't have any fine limit still the
camera
divides the shots into chunks of four
gigabytes usually not a problem many
cameras do this but in this case the
shots don't join seamlessly so you have
a break of or yeah one or two seconds
are missing between one single shot
which is yeah completely unacceptable
because this happens with with 180 P 180
180 60 P sorry you will get this after
every 9 minutes so after 9 minutes if
you do some longer shooting after 9
minutes there will be a break of one up
to 2 seconds then this is unacceptable
you cannot do longer shots with this and
the problem is it also starts shooting
after half an hour this is not true this
is the typical European limit that they
are doing here or because it's
overheating I have no idea but for I
mean this is a video camera so it
shouldn't have a half an hour limit
maybe you saw my my first forest walk
with my son I didn't know I didn't even
notice that the camera stopped filming
so I was talking talking and suddenly I
saw hey where is my footage so 10
minutes were because after half half an
hour it stopped filming and you also
noticed there was some black part yeah
this was where the chunks were missing
so also completely unacceptable my
purposes for my use 8
I cannot I cannot use this camera is
usually when I when I do my my speaker
test or something a single shot yeah can
even last half an hour or more and here
I would get a break after every 9
minutes I haven't tried for K it will
maybe even happen after five minutes
because 4k has much bigger pilot side
sizes also the problem with 4k is that
you get this this I don't know
pulsating effect maybe this is some some
codec error because of keyframes or
something but if you do for casual thing
I mean it looks great but every second
you get some pulsating effect which
looks also horrible so best is hundred
ADP with 186 DP gives you this smooth
great light came like Steadicam like
footage but overall to read proof I'm
not that impressed especially because of
the chunks which don't seem with don't
join seamlessly also because of their
half an hour limit already my camera has
this the Sony not I could shoot the my
scooter video from last time which was
more than one hour without any problems
I couldn't do this with the DJI Osmo
class it's a known error
I googled a little bit through different
forums and many complained about this
and this already the second generation
before was the normal DJI Osmo also had
the same problem so they could have
fixed it maybe but they didn't so yeah
apart from that really great camera has
this beautiful colors also you have
access to exposure correction directly
also to white balance it's a little bit
hidden everything not maybe you know the
app could be better because now the the
menus start appearing here but you can
directly select the temperature in
Kelvin or auto white balance
although automatic white balance
sometimes is a little bit too cold I
prefer it a little bit warmer so I
usually see what automatic balance
select in this case three thousand nine
hundred Kelvin and I do 4500 it will
become a little bit more man yeah I
posted some footage from the camera for
my forest walks and I wanted to see how
it looks
the footage is Anna dated so I only yeah
cut some parts together but I didn't
know any post-processing to it so it's
really out of the camera footage the
link is above or below in the video
description can have a look if you are
interested I really like the result at
the price $650 or Euros is a little bit
too much for all the flows especially
with this phone I would like to have
that I don't know maybe make it a little
bit recruit retractable so I can still
move the phone with a little bit of a I
don't know but as it's now from above
from below I would have to open the
screw again which is really clumsy you
you don't have a great access to the
screw so there are some design
oversights apart from that yeah you can
see now it looks somewhere it didn't
remain centered so I would have to reset
the position again pressing it three
times will turn around and start the
selfie mode three times again will jump
back to the normal position yeah
unfortunately I won't keep it I really I
loved when I saw the first footage I did
this smooth movement I was so impressed
also colors were great quality is really
great
4k yeah when the zoomed into on pixel
level looked a little bit maybe
artificial
let's say painting like so the my usual
camera makes much better footage in 4k
but still this pulsating was a little
bit disturbing maybe so 100 1080 60 p
with 6 60 frames per second looked best
for me and stabilization is really great
of course if your goal you will get a
little bit of an up-and
movement but we could maybe try doing a
short comparison against the Sony here
which I have which is also nicely
stabilized but of course not to such a
level or to such a degree is from a
gimbal we can also compare it with my
traditional camera I also brought my
wide-angle lens so we can check it also
has sensor stabilization so if they call
it ibis in internal image based sensor
stabilization but you get this wobbling
effect so I mean the other solution
would be I take my usual camera mounted
on a game board but the gimbal a great a
good gimbal like this also cost around
$500 but here I would have a complete
camera with me also lighter this says
maybe 400 grams my camera with lens
maybe 700 together the gimbal I'm more
than one kilogram and if you try to hold
the camera like this all the time for
half an hour or something when I did the
shooting with my son the forest walk
afterwards I really I got because of the
stupid camera I had it in front of me
all the time I got here on my left
shoulder
for two hours I couldn't really move my
shoulder because it really hurt yeah but
let's do maybe some comparison of the
Sony and DJI Osmo plus and also with my
traditional camera with the Lumix
Panasonic Lumix G X 800 850 I don't even
know so you can see the difference yeah
I think I covered all flaws yeah that
the audio is yes that the audio quality
sucks is not a problem for me as I
usually record audio separately but yes
still I love the gimbal I love the
output but it's not usable for me as you
get this break after 9 minutes with 1080
660 P it will happen after around 9
minutes I haven't tried it with 4k but
it will probably happen after 5-6
minutes this is unacceptable
not sure what DJ I was thinking here I
think this effects all their camera so
also inside their drones yeah but now
conclusion I will do some short shooting
with the with the DJI Osmo plus together
with my Sony camp also with the other
one you can check this out otherwise
check my sample footage from the DJI
Osmo plus an addicted you can find the
link in the video description yeah this
was it I will be mount it again although
it's nicely small so you have to lock
the gimbal into position open the screw
if the screw was at least a little bit
better not as tight as here it would be
nice but yeah overall I'm a little bit
disappointed to teleport despite the
great footage and I was thrown shall I
keep it or shall I send it back but for
this price 650 euros it's simply too
much with too many flaws yeah but now
some direct comparison of the DJI Osmo
placentae Sony and my camera check it
out and see you in the next video have a
nice time and bye bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
