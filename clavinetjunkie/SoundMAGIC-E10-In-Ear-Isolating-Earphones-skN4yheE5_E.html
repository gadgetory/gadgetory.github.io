was the sound magic II ten I read lots
of comments mentioning it also reviews
are mostly raving about it like here
what if I gave it D what two thousand
eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen
so it seems to be quite a popular one
around fifty euros so a nice price like
the apology one rather strange meze that
we heard before and the India itself is
quite nice tiny also fits nicely into
the year you can distinguish left and
right quite easily because they have
markings here red for right blue for
left but it seems to be a one driver in
here and like the new ones modern ones
which are dual drive a triple driver
whatever also cable is much nicer than
from the meze we heard last time more
professional late reminds me of this
secondary cables you can buy for
professional in ear monitors and so on
so I think it's quite nice
yeah how does it sound before I talk
yeah I'm not sure but I'm starting to
get really disappointed so with all this
waving all this hype and expecting at
least something usable something which
yes at least on par with the IVA or with
this triple driver in here but this is
far off somehow so I would like to again
give you some some samples let's put
them inside the ears here of course keep
my samples with a little bit of a grain
of salt because it's not easy to
equalize them but they should give you
an idea about the general tuning of this
headphone or in here it's all you really
have to stuff it inside quite deep to
get some nice bass response and most say
that it's balanced or maybe slightly
bass heavy I'm not sure I don't really
hear it that well sounding so I'll play
again analog from Sao Paulo and princess
fusion at the beginning you hear the
first bus is the original recording then
I will switch over to the sound magic
attend and we'll compare it to the hive
apology one it costs much the same so
let's start
I think you would hear it doesn't sound
really that great or not really that bad
either
but nothing to really write home about
so the only thing we could try is maybe
some equalizing this is without
without so what did I do
it has some peak at around 7 kilo Hertz
again I would use this with an odd
filter and then I boosted the entire
treble as it doesn't seem that doesn't
seem to be a trail at all the trend
rather seems like some pink noise so it
has a very strange characteristics way
off compared to an IVA or the triple
driver from one more day just doesn't
sound right
also when looking at some measurements
for the left and right channel
separately you can see that yeah there
is this strange peak which all the
others don't have so in the 7 kilo Hertz
region are triple driver and many others
have rather deep like this has a strong
peak and again hardly any treble above
that so yeah I'm not quite sure why all
this hype each sound just crappy average
or below average it's not a year that I
would like to listen to music tour or
with with - I don't know but for 50
dollars you can get Connecticut much
much better once I compare it slightly
against the knee in ear Pro not the HD
version I don't like the HD version it
has also too much in the 7 5 kilohertz
region the me the normal one sounds
smoother but it's also not not not
perfect so in switching back and forth
between both they sounded just different
but both were not not great therefore
still I mean the knee is less than half
the price so I'm not sure why all this
hype is about
why what I find why did they give it
some award
it doesn't deserve it yeah maybe I have
again some broken one or some fake one I
don't know but yeah why am I getting all
the fakes sorry but it's nothing really
special it's an average sounding ear but
rather on the
of the worst sight I would say so I'm
not really that impressed and I'm really
starting to become a little bit
disappointed depressed that anything
that they suggested to me sound so so
bad
while all the others seem to like it
therefore I'm trying to offering you
know some measurements which are not
let's say standardized or in absolute
value but at least we can get
comparative results to other in years
and you can see that the response is
just completely different with the
strange pick between seven or eight kilo
Hertz also some some deep at three kilo
Hertz yeah it's not my thing maybe
others like it but this is not how a
headphone or in-ear should sound
there must be some reference so when I
compare for example the IVA or the
triple driver from one more against the
sennheiser HD c600 which is regarded as
a neutral sounding or a good sounding
one without any artificial boost so the
Iowa and the triple driver are close to
this with maybe more bass slightly more
treble or different sounding treble but
this is way off this is different this
is nothing
yeah it's not even close to this to this
so yeah I cannot understand and I lost
somehow the interest in in ears many
years ago I had very early 15 years ago
or 20 years ago I started with this and
yeah then I got my ultimate ears triple
510 which I was satisfied although I
could hear that they are not right but
they have a pleasant sound that I can
listen to hours and I didn't follow this
topic anymore because I yeah i lost some
interest and then there I was again woke
up some interest as I noticed yet a
tutorial heavy for sure but with some
slight mods they sounded more
interesting to me than the Ultimate Ears
which cost the cost you have five six
times as much and then I started to
become again interested so two or three
months ago
is there something battery for this
price also thanks to you for giving me
recommendations suggestions suggestions
it sounds like this Trevor is some some
strange noise some pink noise it's not
real credible when I hear hi
it's rather here's some pink noise while
here I can hear a really a defined
hi-hat and cymbal or something so I
don't understand how such crappy in
years or creepy-sounding ones can get
such much such much so much pray a
praise
yeah yeah I hope this was helpful for
you yeah I hope you like my some samples
of course there are only approximations
also it depends a lot what you listen to
if you use if you listen with this maybe
this one sounds even better when listen
to itself then another one but you have
to use a very neutral sounding headphone
like the sennheiser HD 600 which i use
as reference so here I am still adjusted
working progress I hope I can improve in
future give you better results maybe
with an or that different I'm not that
satisfied with this it seems to have too
much resonance in particular frequency
areas something which I don't see from
other more professional measurements I
want really consistent results also I
want to offer you great sound samples
like I hopefully do for you with
speakers so I hope I can also offer you
this in future with headphones and
India's but so far I'm not satisfied
therefore this is maybe my last review
in your video except maybe when I find
something really outstanding which blows
me away like the I odd did at the very
beginning I got it I asked Joe Joe look
I would like to have a listen to this
could you send anyone he sent me two
pairs I put them on and I thought this
is completely different world compared
to this what I knew from 15 years ago
450 up to hundred maybe hundred fifty
euros or dollars
it was just crept very different
sounding to this year also with lots of
resonance in the five kilos region lots
of peaks I have one old egg from
creative the EP I think 630 was also
raved a lot about this one I try to
measure in it
you see a very big hump in this region
where all the others now have rather a
deep
so maybe the tuning changed over time
but this is really disappointing to me
it sounds just VL crappy like a 10/10
Bella but ear but I cannot understand
all the side from what high five year
two thousand eleven twelve thirteen
fourteen fifteen and then they stopped
to avoid it but yeah it's for me
unusable it's not as bad as they may say
or the sony which was this was really
this was unfortunately i sent it back i
would like to offer you some some sample
I just made some demo it was not the
original ear but playing but the sony
also very strange tuning maybe it's made
years but when I look at the
measurements of this and compare a
rather nice sounding one like there
either with a triple driver from one
more and then I looked at all these
humps from this it cannot sound good to
me therefore it's a work in progress I
will stop with this ear but this
nonsense here because everything
suggested to me is just crap and I
cannot afford some high five man for
$400 so I won't spend that much money
for it but as I get really great results
from the Hydra 450 and when this breaks
I have a spare one thanks Joe for
sending me them so yeah not going to
spend four five hundred and and I don't
even know how all those sound the ones I
heard from a TV how do you pronounce a
thematic at antibiotic please tell me so
when I heard them also rave typed for
four hundred five hundred us I couldn't
I couldn't live with this some very meat
for cues no base also Trevor was
something strange had tried all tips but
it was sounding horrible just like this
western model I paid a lot imported it
from the US because it was not known
back then it must have been around
fifteen years ago and then you know you
open the package put it in and a huge
disappointment I raved highly
yeah regarded in here which sounded just
like like some cheap resonant very picky
meats so yeah I will stop this nonsense
again there is so much on on the
market
I cannot test them all you can still try
to recommend me some really decent ones
something outstanding but this one isn't
this is just crap and and all the others
I'm afraid I won't yeah I will be
disappointed too therefore I don't even
want to order them I don't have that
much money to waste
yeah thanks all for watching nothing
else to say avoid the sound magic attend
if you want decent sound or at least a
sound which resembles a normal sounding
headphone or a studio sound this doesn't
sound like this sounds just off still I
don't understand it maybe my hearing is
off I'm sure but maybe the yes use
during is also of when looking at the
measurement I can see that something is
not right with this and the other store
that the Sony I still I got comments you
must have got a fake one because it
sounds great no it doesn't it didn't and
it was not fake it was it's a tuning
which I cannot understand it doesn't
sound like a normal headphone sounds
like some I don't know something
different so yet don't want to bore you
again let's stop all this and see you in
the not a video in de nada in another
video with maybe some speaker or
something else so have a nice time and
bye bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
