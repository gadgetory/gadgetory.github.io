two equal speakers well you can see they
look just exactly the same but are from
two different companies this one is from
easyacc and this is the blitz of f4
we've already heard before so far I only
found the easy akan the German Amazon
store for 46 zeros the blitz wolf is a
bit more expensive with 60 euros but you
can find an equally looking one from pc1
on the British MSN store for 45 pounds
and there is even a Chinese version from
wicking which is called bt 28 s and yes
it would be interesting to know if they
all sound the same I mean you could save
some bucks by simply taking the cheaper
one so we'll have a listen
as always I'm using banner on microphone
so please listen with headphones and
let's turn them on yeah take some time
and you'll probably know these tones
these are the same tones from the inca
premium the gem heavy metal the vitinho
royal cyclonic and everything this is
deadly 12 now so yeah just to not hear
these tones I would probably pay the
extra but before having a listen let's
have a look at some frequency response
measurements of both and you can see the
Blitz wolf in black and the easyacc in
red that there are some differences the
blitz wolf is has slightly more upper
bass boost and also more treble
extension the easy egg rolls off quite
steep with treble and the bass seems to
reach a little bit deeper but doesn't
have this upper bass boost of course we
should hear this difference also yet by
playing some tunes which I will do now
and let's start with a track from soul
persona and I will play the easy egg
first so let's have a listen
yeah I think you can hear a difference
the wit so simply has more treble
sparkles but also a bit more booming
bass easyacc again here the treble has
this character so definitely sounds
different let's try another track listen
to the high hats and everything
let's wolf
has more definition with high hats they
just sound clearer better easyacc again
I mean the difference is not huge maybe
not even noticeable that much through
the recording but it's definitely there
snow track you can hear it pretty well
that the travel year sounds has this
nice sparkling sound wild they're easy
egg sounds a little bit not covered but
not quite right
the game played off sounds simply more
high five if you ask me now track it so
you can hear more upper base but also
less distorted bass I will increase
volume slightly
the easyacc again can hit
there is some buzzing with the EDX with
the base notes again and the treble
doesn't really sound right it doesn't
have this yeah I call it Sparkle and
outwork and let's listen to the bass if
we can hear the upper bass boost from
the boots off
this wolf I would say that I prefer
maybe the base from the easyacc and the
travel from that little salt a mixture
both would be probably perfect
yet there are differences and overall
sound I will definitely go for the
little fish it sounds a bit more refined
I would say because of the struggle it's
not perfect it has some slight hump at
16 Hertz which we could try maybe to
reduce but the easy egg the travel does
foodist and right maybe can try if there
are differences in loudness which I
doubt but well let's turn both for
maximum this is the easy ignore maximum
volume let's work as well
you
so loudness wise not really that much
difference but maybe let's try improving
the blitz wolf with a little bit of a
cue so let's concentrate on that blitz
off now as I think this is the better
base to begin with as it has more treble
extension and well more bass so we can
take away bass instead of boosting it
and you can see I created a curve this
is around 200 Hertz 220 which I took
away by 5 dB this is 6 point 2 or 3 just
like with the measurement and I also
boosted upper treble starting at around
12 13 kilohertz we can have a listen how
this sounds with and without EQ first
let's start without EQ and another track
from salt asana
I will activate EQ you can hear this
droning bass was reduced slightly
forever has even more Sparkle but this
sibilance is taken away this resonant
peak at six killer again without I mean
the Sun nuances you will really have to
hear the different slide but it's
actually better with some slight
adjustment you can without listen to the
treble
with and without so yeah there is
potential of course I prefer the Blitz
wolf and I will definitely pay the extra
15 16 euros over the easier just to not
hear these ugly bam-bam-bam-bam tones
they are much too loud these tones the
welcome tones if you let the speaker at
well at minimum volume next time you
turn it on you won't heal any tones at
all I will try to demonstrate you I mean
this is often a deal breaker on these
loud tones so let's turn it on again yes
they are still there
but I think I reduced volume to zero no
let's try again and from what I remember
there were no tones at all no there but
I mean they are not as distracting it is
this Bam Bam Bam Bam so yeah of course I
cannot say anything about the PC tseebo
no no idea how to pronounce this from
from the British tour which goes for 45
pounds maybe this is tuned even better
but the the blitzwolfer for cost exactly
the same let's see if we can find it
here no it's not there I think I found
it before it costs exactly the same so
you could maybe try both and see if yeah
45 pounds just like the other one but
Viking seems to be the original producer
of this because yeah maybe we could talk
with them to improve the sound even a
bit more as I think this is really great
speaker for around 60 euros or dollars
definitely one of the best ones not as
bass heavy as a gem heavy metal but more
controlled it doesn't distort as much
except at very high levels it also plays
louder than the gem heavy metal or or
the other side Moloch and witting Royer
and so on so yeah I hope
this cleared up some confusion about
this because they are they look equal
just that this has a shiny edge here as
you can see the easyacc doesn't have the
shiny edge apart from that also sound is
quite a bit different I prefer the Blitz
wolf also although it's not perfect I
would take away this base hump at 200
Hertz
I think the ECX has slightly better
lower base punch because maybe the upper
base doesn't drawn out the lower base
that much but yeah this wolf is
definitely better here for my taste
maybe you prefer the easy ik am missing
a little bit of travel definition here
another thing could be may be that there
is some sample variation also involved
maybe another sample from the beautiful
sound would sound more similar to basic
and not sure I would have to ask for
another sample to really get sure but
yeah this is how it is how they sound I
hope you liked it and yeah see you in
the next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
