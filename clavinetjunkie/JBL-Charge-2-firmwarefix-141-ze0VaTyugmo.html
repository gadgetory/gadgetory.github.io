about the JBL charge - and all the DSP
processing and distortion issues I think
we can say that the topic is closed um
just be sure to get a unit with the
latest firmware how to check the
firmware on the JBL charge to some user
from Japan got this info directly from
JBL I'm not sure why JBL never
communicated this info if the speaker is
not connected to any Bluetooth device
and turn on press Bluetooth button and
volume plus button at the same time and
keep them pressed for some seconds one
for one and you hear the version of the
currently installed firmware as you can
see I have one for one this is the
latest firmware one for zero and
everything below has some issues this is
not a problem you can send in the
speaker to JBL or bring it to some
service center in fact I brought it
directly had a little bit of talk with
the technician it took 10 minutes to
update the speaker and he told me that
the latest firmware is already issued
since January this year so JBL was
pretty much aware of this problem they
just tried to hide it a little bit maybe
so if you have still a unit with an
older firmware well contact JBL Harman
Kardon and ask them for an update and
they will hopefully guide you to the to
the fastest way I think with the latest
firmware and the JBL charge 2 is finally
the speaker that it should have been
from the very beginning it's really a
very nice sounding unit even at lower
levels there are no artifacts nothing
else like that no Distortion
pretty impressive battery life I think
now that the JBL charge 2 plus is on the
market check out my other video which
compares
- I think you should go for the cheaper
model because it will be probably on
sale now yeah thanks for watching and I
hope this video cleared up all the
confusion be sure to get the latest
firmware which is one for one then
everything should be ok thanks and bye
bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
