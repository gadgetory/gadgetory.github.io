output test people were asking is the
charge three loud enough for a beachbody
can I hear it over the waves and so on
so I came here this should simulate some
kind of beach of course it's not summer
yet so there are no naked ladies laying
around yeah I'm sorry for that but I
brought it along with the sony SRS xb3
which is maybe the only one which can
really compete loudness wise also sound
wise it's pretty nice as we've heard in
the indoor test and I also brought the
trusty old JBL charge tool so that we
can hear how these two compare again
outdoors everyone knows how the charge
to sounds also knows how loud it is so
we can compare the charge three again
against the charge tool and you can see
how much of an advantage they charge
three heads in loudness so as always I
will be of course using my binaural
microphones also a head cam to give you
a first-person view so please put your
headphones up and let's check them out
so we are sitting here on the empty
beach with some noise of the street over
there also the water is noisy and as
always we also have some wind which
hopefully can simulate the situation of
a real noisy Beach I have set up the
charge 3 in charge 2 here both are
playing at levels above half so not
maximum later on we will crank them and
I will start with the charge 3
this should still allow for some wealth
talking with friends and so on
and it's definitely enough for
background music
a touch to know
sounds a bit clearer but I think the
charge 3 is a bit more pounding
so let's stand up and walk around a
little bit of course sound starting to
disappear so I will turn both to maximum
this is the charge tool well we can
already hear it struggle a bit
I will turn up the charge three as well
the end you can hear that it's louder
and more powerful
yeah this
cannot compete
therefore let's try the Sony maybe there
should be a better contender let's see
if it connects yeah the bit and both
playing and mix them again another song
this is the charge three no I mean I'm
standing away let's say six seven meters
and it's really loud the sonic yeah you
can hear the bear face from already
distorts it's not very clean
what we could also try is an extra base
button which I usually wouldn't quite
use but let's have a listen and let's
turn it for maximum again
there's too much
it's louder now but it's unusable I mean
they're the JBL sounds like it Ruth some
droning mess so let's turn off extra
bass again I don't know it's a gimmick I
don't not sure what they were smoking
when they did this but it's not extra
bass but extra noise
even without you can hear the distorts a
bit more than the track screen let's try
another song I will really try a bit
higher - we'll have a listen how they
sound off axis this is the Sony No
and both become a bit muffled let's
write a song
so you can hear from some distance
they are still pretty loud though
although you can also hear that the Sony
starts swallowing a bit of the drums and
and again
another song this has a pretty extreme
bass drum which makes all the others
most because like both sound opinions of
this thought heavily but the JBL manages
pretty well no distortion nothing
and maybe definitely the source more
much cleaner something just for fun we
could try again
extra base
this is really more of an effect but
it's louder yeah maybe we can try
matching the loudness of the Sony no it
comes better but the JBL still sounds
more convincing this is I will turn it
off again it doesn't make quite sense
it is not anyhow and also some classic
dis committee
I will aim them equally so that I can
walk away and we have a listen
the Sony appears slightly louder here
maybe let's try some red pageantry for
the fainter haunted eyes themselves oh
 your business the heavy profit but
also here's some distortion already
remains really clean let's try some more
noisy stuff so I'm exactly on axis with
both
the Sun it appears a bit more messy also
treble is quite directional the charge
there may be let's find on a song this
is a very loud recording and I will try
walking backwards I hope I won't follow
something let's see how I can get a
sonic we are also here even from 20
meters or something you can hear the
distortion this is a bit too much I
would say touch me again this sounds
really clean
okay I cannot go far away because I
think there are some bushes in behind me
this is the Sony no not that much
difference in loudness and I may be
thirty meters away
let's try another song also very noisy
one and you can definitely make some
noise and annoy the people around you of
a beach but it's not the boombox like
all the larger units especially this
distortion of the Sony is a bit well
annoying I would say the JBL really
means remains clean it's too much
distortion let's turn them off again I
think it was pretty obvious that the
charge - and all the other current
speakers in this class simply cannot
compete with the charge 3 in overall
loudness and also not in sound the only
one being the sony SRS xb3 which can be
in slightly louder with some songs but
it applies more dynamic compression and
it can distort more the big advantage of
the charge free is of course that if it
falls into water you won't damage it
it's completely waterproof the sony is
only splash proof also the sony needs a
proprietary charger while the charge 3
can be charged through microUSB I think
it's a matter of taste which you like
more the zone is a bit more treble heavy
but the charge 3 keeps a bit more punch
so yeah tell me would you like more tell
me for which one you decided I hope this
was helpful a bit I wish you a nice time
thanks for watching and bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
