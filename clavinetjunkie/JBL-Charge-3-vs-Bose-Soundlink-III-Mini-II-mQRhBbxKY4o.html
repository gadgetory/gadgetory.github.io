compare that brand new JBL charge 3
against their Bose Soundlink mini to the
JBL should go for around hundred forty
nine this is hundred ninety nine the JBL
is completely waterproof it can also
charge external devices it's a pretty
rugged outdoor model it can be paired
with another one for wireless stereo
it can also be paired with a JBL extreme
a JBL pass to flip three and so on so I
think it has a bit more features than
the post but I already see all the
complaints saying well but the post is
much smaller so you cannot compare this
to this unfair just like it was with the
JBL extreme and the mega boom also
because the mega one is so much smaller
and lighter and therefore not quite
comparable therefore I grabbed at both
sounding three as well and we will
compare these two later on first we'll
start of course comparing the JBL
charge-free against the Soundlink mini
to this will be quite a short comparison
as the bose simply cannot quite compete
it's always i'm of course using high
quality binaural microphones so you
really should listen with headphones and
i will start with a track from solar
sauna the same i used for the blind
listening test of the river s giveaway
maybe this will help you to judge the
sound a bit better so let's start with
the JBL charge three
opposed
I think it sounds quite a bit more
powerful maybe let's try this also quite
a heavy track the Soundlink mini always
Stratos with this both get sounds a bit
Alamo undefined
here this sounds much larger just as the
size suggests now let's check out how
loud both can play well no comment
the boss is really maximum I mean you
can see if this doesn't go any louder
yeah maybe we should check the sound
length renown the bow sounding three
wants to be some kind of premium model
at least this is what both tries to
suggest you they even increase the price
to 330 euros in Europe lately so it's
twice the price of the JBL charge three
let's have a listen how these two
compare whoa what's this rule what's
happening with the bass here
yet the tribute is clean
the basis unless of the boat
let's try not a trick
both also hear some droning and pumping
you
maybe some smooth jazz
yeah I think the JBL still sounds more
convincing but Bose is known for being
well natural sounding at least everyone
is claiming this so let's have a listen
how it compares with a more acoustic
track again starting with the JBL charge
3 let both should render this pretty
well I think
not that both what's this man it is
unusable if you ask me in business the
JBL again so yeah I think I know which
one is more natural let's listen to
another track pose
also droning here unusable horrible
leave this maybe some deep house or
something here what I like about the JDL
that this so controlled it does not
distort let's try the boss what's this
no I think this is simply a feature a
little it's horrible
maybe some other house here's some nice
thumping bass drum the pose for clock
get more interests me this is close for
sounding distorted
yet maybe we should put them a little
bit far away and crank them higher maybe
some will remember the following song it
has two bass notes a higher note and the
lower note the low note should be around
52 Hertz so let's see if this because
we'll render this I think you can hear
it well with the charge click and listen
again yes still noticeable let's have a
listen to the boat
well not ready the lower note is missing
barely there
you only hear some upper notes
maybe let's crank em for maximum yeah I
can hear the note well the post as well
nothing let's write out right both are
playing a maximum the boss sounds a bit
Hollow and funky and all the charge
three sounds more refined is fight
playing at maximum
the boss
it starts disappearing slightly
give you another prick
yet the charge tree is definitely louder
and more punchy than the boss the boss
is missing any lower base no punch from
the bass drum nothing
maybe a rock Trek
both should be good with raucous level
maybe or not
hippos no it's not good with rock
it's enough of something
boss again no doesn't 3 to help
it doesn't really sound good with
anything I'm not sure if it makes sense
to lose any further words but you've
heard it this is close to unusable it's
pretty blatant to ask so much money for
a speaker that distorts with every
second song that JBL played them all
clean with more punch although at very
high levels there were maybe some first
things of intermodulation there's
something me too had no chance loudness
wise it's a bit of a joke I mean this
sounded twice as loud and still cleaner
without any kind of strong dynamic
compression of course there is some
slight compression limiting but fan of
this extremis on the Bose Soundlink mini
- and also the sounding 3 it sounds
horrible at maximum so I'm not quite
sure if I should really comment anymore
that comparison should have shown you
which one is better yeah of course many
more comparisons are coming soon so
please stay tuned until then have a nice
time thanks for watching and bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
