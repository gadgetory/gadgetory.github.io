sound check of the new JBL flip 3 if you
want to know more details about the
speaker please have a look at my other
introduction video here I would just
like to compare it against the older JBL
flip 2 how both compare today the truth
I was never a big fan of the Flip series
neither the first nor the second
generation were sounding really good so
let's see if JBL may actually improve a
little bit on sound I'm wearing high
quality binaural microphones so if you
listen with good headphones you should
get a pretty realistic impression of how
both compare lean back enjoy and have a
listen I'm starting with the flip 3
first
you
mother flip tool
get a surprise you
come lay down deeper
makes you wanna fly
I would come both for the maximum
another trick played at maximum volume
of both
you
yeah
you
to
babies I think it was obvious that the
JBL flick 3 is indeed an improvement
JBL smoothed out the sound or there is
better bass deeper bass the treble is
not as harsh anymore maybe the old flip
was slightly louder but it also
distorted more and the sound was not as
pleasant as the flip 3 the differences
are even more pronounced at lower levels
overall I think the flip 3 is definitely
an improvement over the old model with
more features like JBL connect to
connect another one wirelessly it's
waterproof water-resistant also the
design is great I would definitely
recommend the JBL flip 3 over the old
model I hope this helped thanks for
watching and bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
