has nearly arrived and today I wanted to
present you a low-budget speaker which
you could maybe still uses a kind of
last-minute Christmas present this was
suggested to me by one of my viewers
it's from Culex and costs $14 customer
reviews are also pretty nice so I
thought we'll have a look
as you can see packaging is quite
precious so let's look inside and the
speaker also looks nice you can see it
has some fabric finish yeah nearly
fifa Oslo style let's say inside there
are only some other wires I think yeah
charging cable and auxilary and yeah I
thought we should have a listen how it
sounds so let's turn it on and as you
can see quite comparable to the JBL goal
so it would be interesting to hear how
these tools sound as always i'm of
course using binaural microphones
therefore please listen with headphones
and yeah we are connected so let's start
with the first track volume is not
mirrored between player and people so
you have to increase it on the hook at
the maximum and yeah you can maybe hear
nothing special but quite a punchy sound
the GPL go on the other hand sounds a
little bit messy there's nothing to have
this upper base post but the base has
some nice punch let's increase volume
slightly and their JBL goes well it is
symmetric response a bit strange I don't
know there are few people claiming that
their JBL goes sounds good but you can
really feel some vibration I think it's
also mono speaker but there seems to be
some Pasiphae to some hidden one behind
and we can have a look at some frequency
response measurement so you can see the
Culex at the higher listening level and
there is some significant bass loss but
you can see that bass which is quite
deep there is still some response below
80 Hertz even down to 50 Hertz but it's
not kept at the high level so the
speaker will sound best at maximum as
there is no bass loss at all but at low
levels it will rather sound a bit tinny
if we compare it to the JBL go in blue
here you can see that the JBL has much
more upper bass boost but lower base is
completely missing so the Culex will
definitely sound great with any kind of
dance party music and higher levels so
maybe let's try another trick again
starting with the collects
it moves a little bit so there is
definitely some lower base hydration
achieve your goal it's missing this
punchy song I relief is also maximum
collect as well limp likes to dance of
your
yes a potato sorry stranger
we have to stick with names for that
table otherwise it will in some way like
that the interests it is their vibration
that you can really feel so holding it
in your hands you can instead of hearing
the place you can definitely feel it so
I wouldn't say it's better than the JBL
but for $14 I mean yeah it's definitely
better than many others at this price of
course no chance against their show me
but yeah the show me costs more than
twice as much still yeah nice looking
speaker let's turn it off again has also
hands for included and everything
and yeah I think as a Christmas present
cause some friend or I don't know II
would definitely do the trick
so yeah it's Christmas is Sonia this is
probably my last video as I will be off
for holidays for two weeks I prepared
some other videos that I will upload all
the time but yeah still speaking related
but no reviews you will surprise
yourself but my next real video will be
probably next year
so until then have a nice Christmas I
hope you'll like this I hope you liked
my other videos and yeah we will see us
or you will see me I will see you in the
next year maybe I will manage something
for a new year I don't know but I'm not
quite sure is I I want to have some some
free time with my family now so thanks
to everyone thanks to everyone for the
support for all the donations
I got especially regarding my speaker
audio database I last time I didn't
really manage to add anything new I
wanted to update thief also as my new
unit is much clearer much much cleaner
sounding than the previous one I had not
sure if I should add the Culex but yeah
there is still lots of work I also
wanted to add measurements for all
speakers I have measured nearly all of
them so I can add them to the database
but of course if you still find the will
to donate you're welcome as this will
help me to continue with all this the
database is really very time consuming
in order to make so yeah I don't want to
leave it behind but like I did with my
blog I didn't have any time to continue
writing my blog there for YouTube videos
and and the database is one above I
would say I want to continue doing this
but it's only possible with your support
with your help and and yeah
so again thanks to all and I hope you
have a great a great know a great time
as well so see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
