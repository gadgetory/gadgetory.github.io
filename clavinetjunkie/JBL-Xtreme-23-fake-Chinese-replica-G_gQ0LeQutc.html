fake JBL extreme replica from China I
got this from Tom top normal price is
$40 currently even a little 423 here it
says new mini music box small war drum
bluetooth speaker doesn't say extreme
but you can see it's written on the
packaging looks exactly the same as the
extreme the same colors and so on
here it says 15 hours of battery life
and so on and so on
comes with a carrying loop so just the
same as the cable extreme but when I got
it yeah it's a mini extreme this is the
JBL charge 3 so they took the design of
the extreme and shrunk it to the size of
the charge 3 they even tried to copy the
logo but didn't have the guts to copy it
entirely just a jay from JBL but yeah
design is similar also has this zip here
it even has micro SD card playback but I
think you can hardly excessive so once
you put it in you'll probably won't be
able to get it out but it also is
charging out not sure it's visible
probably not very narrow here and yeah
probably $40 wasted but it looks yeah
looks and feels like original so let's
check it out I want to call my son I
told him that this is the successor
model of the charge free and let's see
if you will notice that it just some
fake let's turn it on first so we can
hear the well compounds yeah they took
the JBL tones probably recorded it with
some microphone and put it in as a
sample you can see there is some LED
lighting probably showing the battery
life and not really just fake some
decoration or if it really works
I'm not quite sure but I will call my
son and of course
this are just decoration
Oh
again I measured it and yeah you can see
there is some picot two kilohertz hardly
any treble bass also a 200 so it's
really hopeless keep such a dreamer in
harmony
thank you sure so yeah I would avoid the
speaker by all means it's not worth even
twenty dollars maybe if you want to make
someone angry can send this to him as a
present still I hope you liked this
video thanks for watching and bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
