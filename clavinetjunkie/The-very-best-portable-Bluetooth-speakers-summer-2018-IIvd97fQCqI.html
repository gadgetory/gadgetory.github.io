the Summer 2018 best of video again and
this time I wanted to concentrate only
on the very best ones from all classes
so from then our portable ones up to the
bigger ones and as you can see there are
not that many surprises here still I
think these are the very best ones
within the class and also my personal
favorites but let's simply start with
the smallest one here and this is the
immediate minute it's not the smallest
peek around so you can get similar sound
from the bosonic micro but still I think
they mean with mini outperforms it
easily overall sound is simply much
better and the best thing about the mini
existed it's a system so add a second
one and you only have a great-sounding
stereo system also with omnidirectional
sound of course with limited volume but
at the mini weeks up and it already
outperforms tangible extreme to hear I
also included the giblets from tool
simply as I know that there will be many
fanboys and why didn't you include it as
it's such a great speaker and it's
really a great speaker and it's a nice
complete package maybe better than all
the other ones because it's waterproof
has great sound great battery life
pretty rugged but it's not the best
sonic speakers of the ephors long easily
outperforms it in over loudness overall
refinement of sound already included it
two years ago but there is still nothing
that comes close within this class so
below to 3 kilograms the p4 still is
still king but of course it's not as
rugged and the battery life is not as
great yeah we forgot the Denon via here
so one kilogram I think this is the king
yeah there are alternatives of course
you can get the sony xba-40 which is
only an old model wasn't right cheap but
it doesn't come close in overall
performance to the danoi buyer it has
some issues I know many complain about
his I personally don't think this is
such a big problem also this some slide
self discharging but my unit doesn't
suffer that much for me so when I leave
it for two two weeks it's still full
and yeah last but not least a toy for a
boom store a new generation I think this
is a really great speaker easily
outperforming the JVM - but of course
it's ladder salt already close to four
kilograms I think three point four but
it has radio included great battery life
it makes him which is way louder than
the gym extreme - also more than five
hours and yeah you can compare them all
through my speaker audio database for
all those who don't know it check the
link here in the also in my video
description it's a database where
included all speakers and I headed home
so we can listen to them side by side
but yet to give you some sound samples
you're already listening to an
artificial binaural head I thought about
something new here I will set them up at
the end of the pool here this four
meters away
starting with the mini with meaning that
we will fight us to the down on via than
the 2.1 system Jamie extreme DeForest
and so on so you can idea about how they
perform outdoors of course they are not
playing at maximum volume there's
cinnamon Erick place it around 80% maybe
but these may be about 60% I don't want
to demonstrate you their maximum
loudness simply yeah how they sound out
was at a rather elevated level so I will
turn it on set it up here
so yeah I hope this was helpful about
the best whatever speakers for summer
2018
of course if you want to have it even
louder a bigger speaker like the diamond
box Muslim or the L - I won't include
the JBL boombox here as it doesn't sound
really that great also not dead loud
hardly the other than the thoughtful
booster here which is much smaller much
lighter so the JBL boombox hasn't cut it
to be included or to be a very best one
it might be a decent speaker for those
bass head so only listen to bass but
it's not a great sounding speaker at all
so yeah I hope this was helpful give you
an overview there are of course
alternatives not many for the minik 2.1
system but I think the JBL extreme 2
gives a really nice compelling package
just not very loud and this is the
biggest problem yeah nicest would be the
sound of the thief also in a more rugged
design like the tribute extreme also
with this loudness but we will maybe
have to wait until 2019 so yeah I hope
you like this video thanks for watching
and see the next one I wish you a nice
summer I</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
