superstar master blaster we already
heard it autos against the GDL boom box
also endure shortly and I think it
sounds a bit strange it's quite a loud
speaker so it was louder than the JBL
boom box but lacking any real bass or so
lots of distortion maximum so regarding
the size and weight it's quite
disappointing I would say also because
it has superstar and the hosta in its
name but there is no really blast with
the sound it has a nice idea so it has
drivers to the front and back so it
gives you a kind of omnidirectional
sound of course you lose quite a bit if
you listen from the side but still quite
nice if you are around with some people
place it in the center and everyone gets
some sound and like with a traditional
speaker that rather emits sound only
forward so if you are behind the speaker
he will get only bass let's have a look
pretty simple controls here at this side
you have their volume buttons also some
some LEDs showing you the actual volume
level unfortunately the volume stepping
is really rough so it's synced with iOS
devices and the first volume step is
already pretty loud and then the jumps
are also rather high then you have a
mode button so it can switch between
indoor and outdoor mode the only
difference is that how to reduce is
based slightly apart from that yet
usually for auto you would need way more
bass the speaker already has pretty
pretty little bass so without the mode
the only thing which is better is maybe
it didn't bit less distortion at maximum
volume apart from that I would rather
not use auto at all on this side you see
some better indicator below the flappers
this because to some degree splash water
resistant or some charging out it has
even microphone in auxilary in and this
was it and before having listened you
can also check it out from my speaker
audio database I recorded it with in the
mode for the normal volume and hot pot
for maximum to avoid any Distortion but
you will hear it still distorts let's
check out some frequency response
measurements and you can see indoor and
outdoor yeah the only difference is that
there is some slight bass reduction with
outdoor but you can see that bass are
the rows of at 75 Hertz so you
some response down to 60 but below there
really nothing also way too much 12 and
the meats are not really neutral either
at low levels no additional base
adjustment while it maximum there is no
base reduction either but the speaker
starts to distort but now let's have a
listen is always our use my banner on
microphones also head came for this
immersive 3d sound experience you should
of course listen with headphones so
let's check it out
I thought we'll compare it against the
new title boom star is both cost more
less the same around 350 euros although
the TOEFL is much lighter so nearly half
the weight of the monster originally I
wanted to compare it against the Harman
Kardon play but this is far not as loud
at TOEFL is much louder so will hear if
it has some chance against a master
super blast our superstar Master Blaster
but first maybe let's compare it against
a boss sounding revolve as both are more
or less only directionals because I will
turn the master on and you will hear
that it is some really annoying and loud
tones and voice prompts way too loud and
no way to disable them it's playing in
in the mode now and volume is around
half I will start with the monster super
blaster was superstar master blaster
like this
suppose
you can hear way too much trouble but
basis has me any better than from the
ghost let's switch to alpha and beta
comes in worse so I will leave it in the
door
and although they both appear slightly
muffled this is just because the master
is such a strong robust man attract cuz
there is some my stereo separation this
cannot be head from the bosses it's a
mono speaker
you can hear it sounds just as
full-bodied as this huge speaker here
which weighs close to six kilograms this
has a bit of a honky character let's
check them off exes so the monster
suffers and indeed when this is on the
side either sound of the ghost remains
always the same regardless of
not a song
 Febreze reduce volume slightly
so yeah slightly below half for the pose
this is the first bottom step it's
really loud you can hear those sounds
way more full-bodied way bigger somehow
but this is really it cannot be turned
any softer so this is really the first
volume spec so let's try that toilet
boom stir now the boom store has pasted
set to neutral later on we can try
increasing or decreasing it the master
is still playing with intro again master
playing first half volume
sizzling and insulting
here we can try and keep increasing the
sub-minimum and instill some some hope
for so let's visit 2 plus 4 TB and the
difference becomes really obvious
something else
at least that poster has some boom while
the plaster and small blast this is
already out with Indra with operate
something
so you go again you get some real bass
Harlem
I mean where is the blast where is the
superstar Sun Palace on
and maybe try of course the wafer is not
an omnidirectional speaker so from
behind it will sound a bit muffled but
this is the master
you hear the volume jumps are really
rough
for pay levels if you consider pattern
does not reduce phase
I still there Parker
so I will go out of the room and
increase both to maximum this is very
hard to allow maximum volume
turkleton
smarter
but we could do is turn it to outdoor
this will reduce distortion slightly so
within the last volume step it becomes
really not
come on
I think you hear it the sound is really
disappointing one of the superstar or
blast the sound he would expected this
name it's quite loud so louder than
powerful bumster but even then it
doesn't really sound that great so I
wouldn't really consider buying it
battery life was also not that great at
maximum I got less than 3 hours 30 the
title bumster is not as loud but manages
close to 6 hours so yeah I'm not sure
why it can get any decent reviews nice
thing is of course this omnidirectional
sound but overall the sound is just
lacking with way too much treble and the
bass is really an emic the hungry wolf
sounds even better especially at normal
listening levels this son just of like
some kitchen area I hope this was
helpful to give you an idea about the
monster superstar superstar monster
blaster what a name yeah when there was
at least some PLAs that there is none so
every speaker which with blast or mega
blast mega boom with woman's name you
can yeah you can be sure that there is
no boom and no blast yeah like with this
monster here yeah I hope you like this
thanks a lot for watching and see you in
the next video in the nice time bye bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
