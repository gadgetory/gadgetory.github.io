have a look at the Marshall stock well
we already heard the marshall clip and
before the stock well is a smaller and
more portable unit and beside the
kilburn the only one which has better
included the bigger marshall units like
this ten more and will burn and also act
on don't have any better included and
although it's not the latest model
anymore I think many rock fans would be
still interested in having a listen and
also have a look yeah you have to like
this classy look you can see this
leather cover which comes optional but
you can also buy together with the cover
I think this helps for placing the
speaker as otherwise it would have to be
placed yeah like that but it's not very
stable and besides the treble is quite
directional so it's really better to
pull it like that yeah you have this
analog dials here which you can put
inside for portable use so yeah now you
can close it and yet the look if you
like this classy look this retro it it's
really a great speaker also build
quality is really nice although the
grille looks a bit fake compared to the
other Marshalls because this is just
some plastic layer on top of some other
material but the other ones have really
some nice real Marshall grille yet
currently it goes for $230 I think
together with the cover so not the
cheapest speaker I would rather say it's
more in the inter premium class and of
course we would like to have a listen
how it sounds and so on but first maybe
some frequency response measurements and
as you can see generally I would say
it's a natural and flat response except
some really heavy bass post this is the
neutral setting with base dial at 5 if
we dial base up to 10 yeah you get this
hump which is yet more than 15 DB
compared to the mids and you can also
reduce bass here is setting with the
bass at 3 which would result in a more
neutral sound and we can also dial bass
back completely to zero so this will
result in this curve you can also
increase treble as you can see there is
some treble loss above 10 kilohertz
so yeah it doesn't sound really that
great for my taste but I would like to
let you judge by yourself so maybe let's
turn it on as always I'm of course using
binaural microphones so you should
listen with headphones yeah we will take
the dials out so we can I will set them
all to neutral first and yeah the volume
dial is of course nice but let's have a
listen how it sounds maybe with some
funk track so let's have a listen I will
show you the dials so this is bass add
new flow
yeah face completely down let's say to
the gamehole 5 treble up to 10 more
reduce completely yet it sounds a little
bit like some kitchen radio maybe I will
put the bass Puma
against it which costs half the price so
$100 this costs 230 and we can have a
listen how these two compare again
starting with the Marshall smoke well
have an increased voting slightly
yeah maybe an artwork Princess freesia
is too much I think you can get up it
sounds just better better bass get a
treble better meets everything this has
some nice picture Radio quality to me
but yet Marshall is known for rock so
maybe let's try to write some kind of
rock track there is some nice stereo
separation here although I think this is
recorded within deflect some very
handsome effect the bass boomer
also here's some nice stereo
yes aunt
then and properly that interesting
maybe let's try some kind of dance track
dance rock
there's still much more punch much more
sound coming out of this case unit
and I think regardless how you set
treble or bass it always sound a bit off
maybe inspector what is some distortion
although we are far from maximum
I'm gonna try them at maximum this is
that base cumin are increasing volume
yeah maximum stop well as well yeah I
have to increase volume first on the
speaker this is of course that robic you
have from non same volume control so
again maximum base kuma
I think the martially seems like a
louder you're struggling already
yeah maybe let's try another speaker
it's probably a bit unfair to compare a
premium 200-plus dollar speaker against
a $100 a low budget speaker so let's try
the shark beast now which is also around
$200 I will try some kind of hip-hop
track we will have to find some new
genre which the Marshall really sounds
good with and I'm starting again with
the Marshall stock well what you in the
moon lounge along the coast line
underneath the moon glow see the star
help help out sounds like something like
you down on the white sand so off you
migraine upset in drag their shock beach
house I'll touch you with my hands all
over your body yourself just enough ease
you're asking your old bass note itself
now let it go when your stroke yeah
slowly send up like a breeze caressed
there are some room people completely
missing from their stock repeat slow you
down in the ocean before we go to sleep
the lower stars
gentle as my fingertips oh you're scared
you set your mind to you let me be your
guy you need to reach for the stars
I'll bring you the sky we love it here
but Marshall should be known for good
rock performance so let's try another
rock track
here's some distortion already
yeah
not sure what's going on here but the
place is in neutral so let's try again
you
yes sounds really strange and I object
you can hear how direction all the
trouble is here I should probably listen
like that
boxing's could be yes Paranal
it sounds quite strange hello sir
let's try this and again turning both
for maximum this is the Marshall stock
well now you can play pretty loud
Chuck please
yeah but sounds really hokey
okay I think the sharpest it makes much
more fun to listen to
especially at mixing volume let's try
not a flag lots more punch yeah I think
the only thing the marshal can do well
is play loud but it doesn't sound that
good I mean neither at low levels no at
high levels it sounds quite strange I am
really not that impressed especially a
speaker with tone controls is I'm always
a bit skeptical because yeah you this
means that the speaker is not tuned well
and you will always force feel forced to
yet to change the sound because it never
sounds right I mean it doesn't sound
completely bad but I'm not impressed for
that price here you get this nice classy
look but yeah that's it let's put them
in again charging is done through an own
proprietary charger
I think charging took more than five
hours in my case but the great thing
about the marshal stock is that the
battery life seems really to be quite
impressive I let it play at maximum and
it turned off after eight hours yeah at
maximum other speakers don't even manage
this at lower levels for example the fee
file sync it will play for around three
hours
I let the the leakage play for two hours
and thirty the bellend all simply play a
to will reduce its volume after 50
minutes but this played eight hours at
maximum I mean doesn't sound great but
it's really loud so for making some
noise outdoors here why not I think it's
all about looks and the name but the
sound is not quite there yet let's turn
it off also this classic simple blue
tone tone tones Bluetooth tones make it
a little bit
APA cheap I mean it's looking great like
some book so you can put it into your
shelf the shark is a bit larger maybe
but you hate pegs quite a bit more punch
so I hope I could give you an idea about
the marshal Stockwell and I'm not that
impressed but if you like this design
there is some magnet so it sticks here
yeah we're not but you will get better
sound out of Cheaper and maybe smallest
because like the base Puma here also the
shark I would say makes the marshal
sound really a bit ridiculous so thanks
for watching guys and see you in the
next video have a nice time and bye bye
so here last and quick test let's
compare their martial stockwell against
the TDK track max or a 34 I bought this
for 55 euros so quite a difference to
$230 the TDK track max is nothing
special but quite a neutral sounding
speaker so let's have a listen how these
to compare starting again with the
Marshall Stockwell
the killer put the head down
good did he came oh so deep in the
sorrow
it's my beauty another ladies couldn't
stand up own reflection she cried alone
there's awakened yet that home controls
are really neutral and in records try
making the salt a bit more neutral by
reducing base but it wouldn't make this
sound much better 30 DK again
okay
he was a boy so insecure trying to be a
man don't cry
did you kill again so if you ask me
regardless which genre you play the
marshal Stockwell doesn't really sound
good so yeah it's really just for
fanboys and those who like the design so
let's turn it off and put it away</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
