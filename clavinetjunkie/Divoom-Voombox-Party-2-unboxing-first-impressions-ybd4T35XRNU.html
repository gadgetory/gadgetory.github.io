departure tomorrow for our holidays but
surprisingly a new package has arrived
from d1 I think I know what is inside so
I didn't want to let you wait and do an
unboxing despite all the packing stress
and so on
my son will help me a little bit with
this unboxing we will also do some with
some short very short first impression
soundtrack I think this is the D boom
boom box party to the new version from
what I know it was already released
yeah it was already released some time
ago but they still did some work on it
so improving the sound from what I heard
and yeah let's look inside I'm again
using my weii 4k camera to get the
gimbal although I'm not really impressed
with the stabilization the gimbal gives
me there is lots of micro movement which
is not stabilized I think in future I
will cannot keep step up ambition I
cannot quite take it out
let's automatically need surface so sure
in future I will probably go for the new
Sony X 3000 which has a active
stabilization and is looking pretty
promising I'm not quite satisfied with
the Kindle developer or for yi4 cake
I'm using a medium wide any now so this
is the speaker instead Charton I think
this goes currently for $99 yeah nice an
Andre show and I have the base Puma here
which goes also for $9.99 lengthier
shown some vision so they are quite
comparable $99 and I thought who do a
very short soundcheck how both compare
I'm really impressed by this bass Puma
let's look it up in the bluetooth list
boombox party tool but ostentation it a
sheep
and yeah what else is inside the box and
keep it charged through micro USB or
probably Papa clicks and stop shop
students names and mock off and we are
looking at the wires charger is
obviously not included we have some
manual here a charging wire and some
auxiliary obviously super so charging is
done through microUSB what else we have
here it can also work as power bank yeah
the base Puma needs an own charger but
can also work as power bank I already
measured the base Puma at maximum volume
for 3 hours of course I cannot say
anything about the boombox party yet
let's put this all the way positive
knife how's this video so gamer so it
didn't connect quiet let's try it again
hmm doesn't quite work let's disable
Bluetooth again and enable it maybe
oops meat meat so bluetooth is stuck
let's try it again
so two sixty times per year on your
hands and son
okay now I'm connected let's turn on the
bass boomer as well I have no life views
so I am not sure what I'm currently
filming if you see the speakers or
something over there
connected yeah that bass boom is
connected as well and I thought we will
try where is it here it is
we will try some kind of whoa this is
the first volume step one no gate has
gone and back sound a classic from
imagination let's try the bass boomer
I'm around half body now the boombox
party again if something's not right
with the water control here I thought it
should be get it get this in sync yeah
another track again starting with the
boom box party cool impression as if it
sounded
a bit more gloomy than the play schema
which already sounds quite blue making
pit stops
let's check the 360-degree sound if the
bass boom of course has no drivers at
the back there is some some slight
droning with the bass it seems it seems
there is some bass emphasis at 250 Hertz
or something or even above which makes
it a bit boxy sounding maybe the bass
team are already not very yet with some
bass boost at 200 Hertz sounds
definitely more balanced here more open
even let's try some kind of hip-hop but
there is some delay between and was
defaulted for money straddle the - the
more like a track
the vascular promise is I swear they
sport is a time we definitely prefer the
face cream on although their boombox
part is not bad but there is some delay
between changing volume here and on the
speaker you get a face fume up for my
taste
house a bit more refined tomato sauce
compact I will try increasing volume
slightly commit gimmick some mama huh
and she came here with atomic it's loud
okay mister to mommy and I will increase
volume this is the best human off the
boombox party as well as you can see
nothing happens something
Oh a big pillar base no I will show you
another trick again with the even game
box party - yes boom box pallet on the
base Goomer I would say both are just an
axiom all terribly loud maybe
they even has a slight edge
I think the bass commands more fun this
is the base criminal to get more
efficient
so yeah hmm
I think it's not bad 400 but I
definitely prefer the bass boomer here
you could hear with the loud recording
from no copyrights and saturation
comment via splenic smear with the very
loud recording from nocopyrightsounds
the bass boom was louder although there
was a hint of distortion the that boom
box party started to well to pump a
little bit it's also quite meat focused
I think there is some emphasis around
two three four hundred Hertz the bass
Pima also seems to have deeper bass but
of course we will have a much more
detailed look on both still want to
prepare a review a full review of the
bass Puma which I think performs really
well even against some more expensive
because like the Bose Soundlink 3 which
the bass Pima wipes away completely or
the JBL charge 3 it's a matter of taste
which you like more this has better
treble while the JBL has less boosted
bass but deeper bass so yeah a very
first impression of the Devon boom box
party tool from nice feature is of
course the back and front sound which
this cannot offer but I think I
nevertheless prefer the bass Puma I
really fell a little bit in love with
this for my wife it's two bass heavy I
wanted to take it with us on the holiday
but she said no no there is too much
bass I don't like it so it will leave it
on but I would have definitely taken
this one as my as my as my yeah that's
my only speaker what I like about the
bass Puma that also at low levels it
sounds very very nice let's try what
else we have
let's try princess freezer again with
with what is this the bass Puma
also at very low levels it has this nice
full-bodied sound sorry yeah this is the
first volume step come on it's booming
this is just some groaning and also I
can hear some distortion although where
is the Twitter and I can only hear sound
coming out from here but here is nothing
so let's try the base cream again yeah I
will have to match them a bit better
yeah this sounds quite a bit off
therefore I really love the base boom is
it sounds mature nicely not balanced but
it has a nice amount of treble which for
example the GBH artery is missing this
sounds a bit strange at low levels as
you've heard it's some drawing no treble
so it has to be seen what's up here so
guys I have to continue packing just
very first impression thanks a lot for
watching and we will see us after my
holidays bye-bye construct me have the
mistletoe canopy so have a nice time and
we will see us then bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
