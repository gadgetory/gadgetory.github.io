boring unboxing yet to make it less
ambling I can tell you that this is a
world premiere this package comes from a
British company called acoustic energy
and this is their first Bluetooth
speaker so I thought you would like to
have a look inside together this not
that easy to open this it's always fine
of course learning binaural microphones
so we will immediately put some
listening what you should look at that
phone for the best result here is great
everything okay there's another one yeah
and acoustic energy is a high high
company not some lifestyle company or I
don't know some mass production company
and they have their 30th anniversary
anniversary sorry this is the speaker
looks like that
yeah of course it would be nice to look
inside how to open this I think I left
manual or what is Bluetooth okay we hit
this and tables is European plug it's
nice not so and adapt twisting it more
is this pretty pretty heavy so what I
know or from what I read about 2
kilograms so comparable to a JB least
three maybe not a little bit smaller so
here is the speaker from 102 big drivers
and at 40 watts and here at the sides
are to passivate us working in autos and
in am proposing way so
hopefully no vibration you can see
adapter in I'm charging out auxilary
not as much just a speaker with probably
HiFi like to me let's look at the
Interceptor it looks like this 12 volt 3
point 8 em and and I think we don't need
the Box anymore we can also have a look
at the side from acoustic energy you can
see the Rada into high five speakers but
this one is called a ego bTW - from what
I know so little hook you wanna hear
this and yeah it will be released now I
don't know I think you can buy it online
from the store for about 250 pounds yeah
at the ex of course included bluetooth 4
points 240 watts out and the batter is
pretty huge so you get 36 hours or
better at its 30% and probably lots of
hours at maximum volume yeah I thought
we will check it out let's put this
divide away here the only speaker which
can really compete is less FIFA Helsinki
although a bit smaller so half the size
you can see this is a little bit thick
um as the FIFA is one of the only
portable Bluetooth because that gives
you this pure HiFi sound so without lots
of iteration no baseball's not wearables
just really high fives and also no
compression at high levels or at least
not not that noticeable so it never
tries to be louder than it actually can
play but it is still pretty loud and
really shines at high levels so we will
compare it against a FIFA maybe because
I don't think that the others can quite
compete here because of strong than any
compression or distortion and so on like
we've heard from the Sony x-77 so let's
try turning on
and I will try connecting here it is
luxury if the volume is synced or not
yeah obviously and connected and we can
maybe check out some music I will
immediately put the FIFA here beside and
yeah let's have a listen to some jest
you may be I think we will play some
more sophisticated stuff this time no
rock or hip-hop or something so let's
start with the ego BT 2 volumes
well yeah so we can directly control
volume from the iPhone and shadows begin
to creep rock me to sleep well add a lie
yes you can hear how it's really natural
a little trying to boost and consisted
of counting change
Rippey from rock me to sleep no cow holy
touch she just rocked me to antral like
gentle breezes in the night walk me can
I go to sleep in your
then I dream of your child in my slumber
deep roughly yeah I have the impression
as if they see far still found it a bit
bigger let's try maybe another track
increase 1/2 divine animation powerful
well while by vigil I can make a salsa
Oh
and the
with some classic tool from Edward elder
although British a guy FIFA somehow a
little bit more 3d a bit more open
although there is not much separation
because the drivers are quite close to
each other as well to be really more
spacious is something else maybe and
what we could do is maybe put them far
away close-up model is pretty heavy
not sure how to carry it and so we'll
have a bit more reflecting reflection
from there from the hole and let's
increase volume again
is
if you phone me
it also makes it more box that they open
the people operate under here
maybe let's see how the person is
affected as well
matrix as a FIFA definitely found a bit
more opened also bigger world
symmetric where you notice analog from
focus Chronicle decision the chief
explained it in late night mode so this
would be the time to switch over to
neutral
let's hope it works which usually
doesn't that open and you can see it
doesn't quite impossible to make the app
recognizes people yeah it's time for
people to really improve that possible
for you think it the only thing we can
do is here maybe try turning off music
part you can see doesn't see the speaker
yeah so we won't be able to play it at
maximum as there will be some distortion
it make activities yeah and we can start
in the game I will switch over to
neutral console we see no now but now we
can also increase volume without coming
to show no Distortion
the business rules are quite a heavy
recording the bass drum is pretty prone
to distortion Roylott include log
information and
come on you can already hear some type
expulsion of all those pretty heavy corn
don't know that you oh yeah it's
definitely more a high-five type of type
of sound I have to yeah my hand is maybe
too small so to carry it like this but I
think the FIFA still has the edge here
sound wise also it's like it's smaller
and lighter yeah maybe we'll also have
to play it for a bit longer yeah it's
fun all I think this is enough for a
first impression
let's see what else we can do here oh
it's I was I was hoping I could reduce
the volume but yeah here it is so let's
turn it off and we'll of course do
another more detailed video of it also
the frequency response measurement so
far I hope this was enough for a first
impression quite promising speaker from
acoustic energy let's look at the site
again also the other speakers won some
we bought a bar and we watts and what
let's see they have a very nice a a e1
active speaker different series and so
on so I hope you liked this little
unboxing with some short first
impression coming up next are some other
speakers but I had to preform this as I
think this is quite a bit more
interesting than for example the Yumi DG
i have here by the way this is already
included within the database we can have
a listen already there i also included
the pioneer what was the name xw or
something not xwb t SP 70 so this is
also included within the database you
can listen to both and of course also
includes this one yes nothing else to
say
coming up next will be there you need to
me another yummy yummy or you need EG is
the main yummy PG ss6 i think and BTS
six and we also have the what was the
name slang m8 with funny little yeah
speaker with open drivers so this is
coming up next as well and some more
stuff is coming so there's really lots
of yeah lots of stuff going on on the
Bluetooth speaker market and see let's
see if there is something interesting as
well until then have a nice time thanks
for watching and bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
