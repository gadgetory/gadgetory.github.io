Helsinki yeah clone or copy but as you
can see it looks exactly the same as the
original so same design same proportions
but this one is even more advanced it
has some nice buttons on top micro SD
playback even some USB charging out
something the fee facing key hasn't but
this one is of course just some cheap
Chinese copy I got it from the le
Express store for $22 it's railed in
different colors I also found it on
Amazon Kong but for $45 plus five
dollars shipping so it's a bit steep but
well let's treat it as some kind of
forty fifty dollar speaker it feels a
bit cheap so this is all plastic this is
some rubber so definitely not comparable
to the FIFA which is metal and and so on
and as some Madrid fabrics but I thought
we'll compare it against the anchor
sound quite a popular model I think it
goes for $40 as well and we can have a
listen how it sounds also wanted to tell
you I just got this new GoPro Hero 5
session which I will like or I would
like to use for my next upcoming video
because it has image stabilization built
in unlike the previous model and it also
has rekt linear lens distortion
correction so I hope this will be better
than the why I 4k camera but now I'm
still on my Sony camera unfortunately
distortion correction takes a bit of
time within the video editing but yeah
back to the speaker let's turn it on and
have a listen how it how the welcome
tones are yeah just like some email or
something and as always i'm of course
using binaural microphones so please
listen Ted phones and yeah let's check
some tracks and see how these two
compare I will start with the it's
called JKR speaker and then I will
switch over to the anchor and so on so
please have a listen
it's very treble heavy this one
definitely has the actual face it's some
mess this response but it's smaller I
think I can only hear something coming
out of here let's fly another SEC he had
a place response is really nice for a
speaker that cost well $20 or more but
for 20 days it sounds realistic I mean
there is maybe some slight treble
problem but the incus Hong Kong
the bass is definitely better idea but
it could get along with a bit better
Trevor also maybe some neutralizer let's
try something else
Phoenix wanna cap yet but really hear
that deep notes here thank a bit too
much sizzle and too little face I think
the JKR is even more balanced sounds
nicely full-bodied 4sp direct cheek an
artifact from the rock maybe
okay
they're pretty keen
three nothing spectacular especially
qualifies for $40 you can get much
better speakers JKR again and let's hit
this volume for maximum we are
they're just mixing No
I'm Ankur as well
you'd enjoy definitely Mulder here
they're dense but there's some slight
distortion and at maximum a pretty
punchy
quite a bit smaller and
maybe other people like the anchor
because it's so loud so I mean it's I
think it's a solid performer yeah should
we compare it against the FIFA yeah no I
mean this is ridiculous
or should we yes oh no yeah of course we
will
so we'll check how it compares against
the original and yeah let's see if I
mean this costs twenty times as much so
it should also perform a bit better I
will try to match volume for both and a
track maybe from from Princess Frida
let's increase volume slightly a FIFA so
here and here that their difference is
pretty obvious
the transcoder here yeah
becomes smaller an FM radio but still a
bet for $20
I've heard much less because for 30 $40
in this sometimes princes picture a
little bit of course
maybe he'll sink
here's a sweetie and night and day
difference
I will increase that coffee for maximum
and I'm actually helping yes so I mean
the cheap Hopi doesn't have a smallest
chance but it's still interesting I mean
it looks really exactly the same it
would be interesting how it would sound
if FIFA made it and not some Chinese
company I mean I think it's decent if
you can get it for twenty twenty one
dollars why not you can see JKR 3306 it
has six watts of power yeah not bad I
mean I've heard really much worse
because but nothing outstanding yeah I
hope this could give you an idea about
those who already found it or saw it on
on online I thought I would like to have
a try and therefore I ordered it because
it really looks exactly the same as the
original okay thanks all for watching
and see you in the next video bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
