special for you this is really exclusive
I was contacted by Debbie Ellie if I
would like to test the new upcoming
prototype speakers they sent me two
units of the new DVLA proton and even a
new portable speaker called the DVLA
mini which should be available this year
of course I was forced to buy even new
microphones I spent around thousand
dollars simply to be able to capture the
finest nuances in South because this
because sounds simply amazing of course
as always please put up your headphones
and let's check them out as you can see
they sent me a purple gray and the
yellow gray unit you will be able to
customize colors for the new upcoming
speakers and as you can also see the VLE
sent me this new great biological
speaker stands these are especially
impressive because they have this
natural resonance frequency which
improves sound even more but now as stop
talking let's check the sound
they're loud man let's look at the Sun
pressure level meter 84 DB wall keep in
mind they are still playing at just 1% I
cannot turn them any louder because
there will be too loud I tried them once
at hundred percent and they were so loud
that I could still hear them from my
work which is 30 kilometers away Wow
maybe we should check the frequency
analyzes oh you see great bass down to
10 Hertz a little bit well rather shy
but pretty nice meat wow that's a sound
never heard anything like that
whoa whoa I'm really speechless this is
pretty impressive but now I have another
one this is their portable they really
called divarella mini it has an on max
mode as you can see the battery life is
about 15 minutes and with Max enabled
you will get maybe seven minutes so yeah
but this is simply the price you have to
pay for this power i thought we will
check this out as well
yeah so let's turn it on
for you here you can really feel the
thumb war
let's try out many no oh
out of battery sorry I hope you liked it
I think you're as impressed as I am
especially this new portable the VLE
mini impressed me a lot
I hope they will improve battery life
even more but I already know now this
will literally blow away anything else
on the market so thanks for watching and
bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
