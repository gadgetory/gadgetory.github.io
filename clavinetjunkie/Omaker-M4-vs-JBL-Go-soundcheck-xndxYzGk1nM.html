video I recorded with their brand new
GoPro Hero 5 session was quite a
disaster I was really surprised by the
bed outcome I mean the room is quite
dark but it's not really much darker
today still this only gives a much
better image quality the image from the
GoPro was somehow dark noisy also blurry
so I'm really not that satisfied with it
I also had stability issues of the Wi-Fi
was enabled it never quite a pier that I
had to reset it so for $300 a big
disappointment so far I will continue
using my Sony cam and I'm waiting for
the new Sony X 3000 but today we are
going to have a look at the Omega m4 I
never had an occasion to have a listen
to it until now and will compare it
against the JBL go because I think they
are both quite comparable on Amazon the
Omega m4 goes for $27 while the JBL go
depending on which color you choose
calls for 25 up to 30 even $35 but you
can have a promo code which is in the
description and you will get it for $18
so quite a bit cheaper than the JBL I
also think that the battery is much
larger here the JBL at higher levels
will die after 2 or 3 hours maybe this
should definitely play for a longer it's
also more rugged pretty light so
comparable to the JBL maybe a bit larger
and before having a listen maybe let's
check some frequency response
measurement and you can see it needs
quite a treble heavy sound so the sound
has a tilt upwards towards treble but
this is measured exactly on axis if you
measure from an angle of around 45
degrees you can see that the treble gets
slightly reduced and when measured
exactly sideways so measured like that
you get a curve like this which is the
most balanced setting but there is still
this treble peak at around 14 kilohertz
which can become a bit annoying but I
think the best position for the Omega
would be placed flat unlike the JBL
which is more directional you can also
place the JBL flat like this but you
will lose quite a bit of treble
in this case it's even better so let's
turn them on both and let's have a
listen to some tracks these are the
welcome tones
let's turn on the JBL again as well yeah
and as always i'm of course using
binaural microphones so please listen
with headphones first maybe let's
compare how both sound when place like
that later on I will place the Omega
flat and we'll have a listen again I
will start with the Omega and a kind of
funk track so please have a listen
Radio it feels definitely more muffled
compared to the Omega button where it is
a bit more balanced the Omega is really
a very treble have a speaker so I will
place it slap now and you get a more
omnidirectional sound and I think it
sounds better because the treble is not
as harsh anymore
may another Freck we are already at
slightly higher levels so I will
increase volume if more these are both
not very large because the JPL go as
well and if we place yet flat it becomes
a bit more muffled than the Omega I also
think that uh maker has slightly bigger
base although the JPL has a more boosted
upper phase as we will hear how they
compare at higher levels in this case
the Omega sounds a little bit more make
sure I would say maybe not attract
it sounds fuller because of this upper
bass boost but the Omega has slightly
better bass punch Yates 20 for this song
it feels more muffled now so the Omega
has the edge here I would say it is some
kind of rock track
it's hard to choose the better one but I
would definitely say the Omegas sounds
more convincing positive like that it's
a bit maybe full details but you can
hear that JT Australians like them there
is some compression going on already I
will place both left and let's walk
around
yeah I have to place both to maximum
hello mate as well so not that much
difference loudness wise
you're slightly louder for the homemaker
and also more details although you have
to like the spread Ojeda son may not
attract some dance video in this case
the JBL appears louder I think there is
some compression dynamic processing
going on which depending on the tracks
makes it either louder or softer yeah
it's really hard to choose a better one
here they are off on a similar level the
JBL maybe appeals slightly more
full-bodied but has less slower pace
another track yeah I think the edge goes
to the Omega but both are not really
class leading I mean if I could their
show me me against them yes a bulk sonic
is ridiculous
maybe let's write a show me the show me
is not an omnidirectional speaker but I
can also try placing it like that flat
which should even enhance bass slightly
so let's have a listen again starting
with the homemaker and I will go a bit
far away get the kiss of course more
muffled but in reality it's more
balanced and we are hard from maximum I
will increase volume for maximum as well
Omega was much more base here so let's
reduce volume on both we are round hot
water now the one disturbing point is
are the blips when you change one we
always get a peep peep but now the
difference becomes much more obvious the
Xiaomi has loudness adjustment and
sounds much cooler now of course it
doesn't have this strong treble boost of
the Omega this sounds get quite a bit
harsher
so yeah I mean for 17 dollars or 18
which would be half the price of the
Xiaomi it's maybe not bad but I'm not
that impressed I mean depends with some
songs the JBL sounds more convincing I'm
here the treble is just too harsh you'll
really have to listen like that in order
to get rid of it and I would also have
welcomed some better bass it rolls off
at 200 no 150 Hertz which is not bad but
you generally you have a upward field so
would have been better to make it more
even maybe it's not a bad speaker also
nice form factor for carrying it around
or attaching to some some rucksack
backpack and it's rugged waterproof so
it's a nice speaker for 17 18 dollars
really not bad so take the promo code if
you are interested and yeah see you in
the next video I hope you liked it I
hope it was helpful and see you then
bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
