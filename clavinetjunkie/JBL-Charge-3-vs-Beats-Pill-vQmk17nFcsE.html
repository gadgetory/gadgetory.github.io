check out if the beats pill plus is
really worth the extra over the new JBL
charge 3 the original price for the
beats pill plus was quite a bit steep
with 230 meanwhile it dropped a bit the
JBL charge free should go for $150 in
Europe probably hundred sixty 170 or so
I thought we'll check them out see how
they sound as always I'm of course using
high quality binaural microphones you
should listen with headphones for the
best results I will turn them on now
yeah you get some welcome tones beat
like this JBL like that unfortunately
cannot disable them and the confirmation
point for Bluetooth connection is pretty
loud so I will play some tunes starting
with the JBL charge free so let's have a
listen
yeah no it's not broken it sounds like
that I think the kitchen area sounds
better than this
but me is is the sound signature people
like I don't know
that's for something else some bluesy
jazz here I think the GBA sounds pretty
nice and natural there are no frequency
strange stuff going on here while this
sounds off and I'm really wondering why
so many actually like the pill plus in
my flight listening test this is a
difference
I don't know I cannot quite describe it
let's for something else to base our
five day with funky Jones yeah I don't
know if it was standing backwards maybe
I should turn it around
no does it really improve the sound
also mole base simply some drawing let's
try something else
the table has with some nice punch this
is heaven I really have to laugh about
there may be some hip hop old school
well it should miss some good with rap
or hip hop
dr. grace I'm here papa isn't it oh it
sounds horrible maybe some other hip-hop
now we'll be revolving with things
involving you what you do in the bags
you all and I need some pieces so
sometime that leads to be about the spot
that I finally reach we thank you in
making this allows alone so you won't
see the truly in hospital when you blow
we laws like the Thomas promise I wasn't
thinking just soon wind Ivana to show
economy broke no underline Capone but
you change money to get something else
it sounds broken
again something else some house maybe
maybe let's put them slightly away and I
will turn them higher now it just sounds
like another trick let's try something
else
he's struggling a bit
maybe again something else some house
yeah pretty nice punch here appeal
I don't know this sounds really broken I
will turn it to maximum yeah this is
already maxing the JBL as well for
maximum the song still sounds like it
should why here you get some special
effects you could use it maybe in a
studio as some effects processor
maybe another track
so let's Friday pits affect more of a
few areas I always thought that p+ was
loud about well if you listen to the JBL
it isn't another track you can use some
nice pace from here appeal you can only
hear some chopped hi-hat yes I don't
know they are not even comparable maybe
something else
are you really here that aren't you
pretty well here
you'll pass again of all the recipes the
heap of bass is still there but another
more extreme recording
well not extreme but nice bass from here
but you hear that it doesn't sound right
I mean it produces something completely
different out of the sound effort you
could really use it SN processor or
mastering edit this is there are really
two different songs
this isn't scream
pretty loud and noisy
obviously it's on its limit
happy spring with solid
yes the loud beats pill is not really
dead loud better let's turn this crap
off immediately yeah I really don't
understand why you would like to pay
more over the JBL charge 3 I also don't
quite understand why people actually buy
this stuff I mean it has a nice app like
design but if you really want sound
quality this is rather a toy it cannot
be really taken seriously I also tried
writing a review for the bit site and
well give them my critique but they
didn't publish it and sends at it so at
least on youtube I have the freedom to
really give honest and unbiased reviews
but I think everyone should have heard
that this Suns off it sounds horrible it
doesn't sound like a real speaker this
is really more a some kind of special
effect so I hope you liked it the JBL
charge 3 is definitely in a completely
higher class we will do much more
comparisons many more comparisons I
don't know much more many more so have a
nice time stay tuned for more and bye
bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
