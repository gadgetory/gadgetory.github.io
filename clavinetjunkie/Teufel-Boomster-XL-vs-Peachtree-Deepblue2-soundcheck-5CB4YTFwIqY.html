Peachtree deep blue 2 against a trifle
boom star Excel Peachtree shows off to
have put four hundred forty watts into
the speaker white Eiffel provides 70
watts for that toilet boom star Excel
the boom stir Excel can also be taken to
the beach it has a battery built-in and
thanks to this carrying handle you
simply wrap it around your shoulder you
cannot do this with the Petrus it always
has to be attached domains both have
tone controls the joyful has treble and
bass but they are both neutral I also
set base for the deep blue tool at
medium I thought we will have a listen
how though how both sound am as always
using high quality binaural microphones
you should listen with headphones for
the best results I'm starting with their
profile boom start Excel first
V+ sounds a bit small Bumi let's have a
listen to another track also quite bass
heavy
the Pluto seems to consist simply of
base only but the base doesn't quite fit
in let's try to attract some smooth jazz
yeah I think the TOEFL sounds a bit more
natural
again another track you can hear some
port noise already I'm still not
convinced by the quality of the pace
here maybe we should turn days to
maximum on that boom store exit like
that
and on the deep blow - with the remote
okay and let's have a listen again the
TOEFL palm strike self still playing the
bass sounds a bit overwhelming
let's try another trick
this is the kind of music philosophy
always place
petty Pluto
you can hear the based on distortion and
I mean I'm far from maximum so this
robot doesn't sound that good that I
feel is much more control
this is really clean basin but that each
trail make some mess what else we can
try is how they sound at low levels I
will reduce the people as well because
then it has some loudness function
built-in you can hear there is still
some pretty extreme base while the TOEFL
doesn't have any loudness so at low
levels it tends to sound talk to Santa
Timmy a bit but you could hear I mean
you have some bass at low levels but as
soon as you crank it it starts to
distort and do funky things yeah maybe
we should check them out at maximum i
reduced base to neutral settings again
on both now I'm reducing the gain of my
recorder to avoid any distortion as both
will be playing at maximum you can hear
that my voice became softer so if you
really want to hear them at maximum
raise volume to hear my voice like it
was before I'm starting with a boom star
Excel first
the TOEFL sounds much more controlled
much more punchy and well nearly equal
loud let's hear another
maybe let's try some really loud track
again
boom star Excel first I use this track
for my village video with the Ibis 9
let's have a listen how both perform
with district
yeah I think it doesn't quite make sense
to really compare I mean the five foot
boom store Excel sounds completely
different you can hear that I raised the
gain of my record again to normal you
could also hear that the Toy Fair boom
star XL with 70 watts easily
outperformed their pitch free deep Pluto
with 440 I don't know where Peachtree
took this 440 volts but this is
ridiculous you could hear that it's
already distorted at mixing volume it
produced some strange bass noises while
the toilet boom store Excel had no
problems even at maximum no compression
no distortion a little bit of pot noise
but well I prefer this over this strange
booming sound of the Peachtree deep blue
- it's really nothing special I don't
know why everyone is raving about it
yeah it's not even portable and it
doesn't really sound that good will you
that later on I have been on Tollefson
via play s3 you can see how small that
is I think that this sounds much better
than the Peachtree I mean it's not as
loud but for everyday listening this is
much more impressive we will hear this
later on in another video but until then
stay tuned have a nice time thanks for
watching and bye bye
