hi and welcome and so many of you
complaining about where they this
business that they cannot any well I
cannot hear voice I can hear the music
well how do you think I can capture the
sound to the dynamics of a powerful
speaker like me on your program for by
not reducing recording game so you have
to increase
like all the others so increased game
for my voice you can hear me comfortably
but then when I increase volume on the
speaker it will become lower so always
to give you the most realistic sound
impression so if you are standing to
ever me in this room or instead of me in
this room of course with a speaker like
the drum fire which is so powerful I
have to reduce getting to a healthy
level otherwise the recording will be
completely destroyed at high levels
therefore you have to increase volume on
your computer and use my voice is an
honest reference of course I'm aware
that these videos are lower volume but
just because this peak is so powerful I
wanted to demonstrate you how it
performs in high levels and you can hear
it sounds really great let's try I have
to record for such a speaker with a low
again otherwise it will be completely
distorted if you if you don't manage
this game you have a screwed up setup I
can listen to these videos normally from
an iPhone at my Iowa in earphones works
well and still far from maximum and I
get a more more less realistic novice
level if you don't like it yeah tell me
but I always try to really offer the
best sound quality the most realistic
one so that you really get the
impression I'm sitting here with me and
not me
you are sitting with me and you are
listen for this because if you listen
with a decent pair of headphones like
the Sennheiser issues example you should
get a very very realistic sound
impression also a lot of suppression
just keep my voice as an honest
reference and to raise volume to such a
level bit I appear as if I was standing
directly in front of you yes sorry for
this
Intermezzo here
burning so this speaker really that's
usually my outdoor videos I would go
outside I mean come far away 2030 meters
but here we have five six meters so it's
hot not easy to really cranky to make
some and I don't want to use autogain
otherwise you will get the same effect
like from all the others like Flossie
Carter does he increases volume know
what makes him and the speaker still
appears just like it was before this is
what I wanted to avoid I want to give
you the really most realistic the best
sound quality on YouTube
and it cost me lots of time therefore
here if it's if one video is software
just raise volume slightly to make it
louder again if your phone is not
powerful enough use a PC or something I
also noticed that the YouTube app on iOS
compresses quite a lot when I watch your
browser it's maybe there's something
much better that maybe I will make and
about this sorry but thanks for watching
and see you the next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
