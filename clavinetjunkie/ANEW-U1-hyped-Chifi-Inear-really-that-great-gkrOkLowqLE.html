review that nu you won based on a
request from one of my viewers who or
that one thinking it's great because of
all the great videos on head fire or so
I think bad bad guy bad videos praises
it highly as well I told him it's not
that great sounding rather send it back
for $130 we can definitely find
something much better now he's in panic
therefore I make this video just for him
but first some story behind this I
contacted pan on audio who are the
distributor also some online shop
different in u.s. from China I asked
them if I could have a BMG vdm six
sample for a video they told me well no
it's not that great sounding they would
recommend it although it's also praised
by many they told me yeah I can have
something else instead that nu you want
and this beacuse I'm not sure how to
pronounce it
BQ e Y Z model number is KB hundred two
very proof both a disappointing but
let's concentrate on the Nu you one here
I mean the presentation is it's nice so
it looks quite precious if we open the
box so the manual mostly in Chinese but
here it's written yeah you have to use
have to use high quality files flag
files please ensure mp3 format more than
320 kilobits per second I didn't even
know that mp3 supported a higher bitrate
so it's probably high resolution and so
on you can see a nice cable
these are exchangeable by the way so
let's take this out here quite big I'm
not sure how many drivers inside and mm
of area don't care because the result is
what K what counts and the result is
really nothing to write home about
I mean it's not a great sounding one
it's a rather bad sounding one you can
see it's like those typical in-ear
monitors that you wear around your
around your ear quite comfortable
despite being so huge this N is okay so
no complaints here the problem is just
the sound it's tuned quite strange
really and I would like to let you
listen and this time we will compare it
against this
Samsung is eight bundle yeah you have to
be careful to find a really genuine one
I ordered a second one from eBay just to
have a look it looks genuine I think it
even is but it plays all the face again
for a left and right there is something
wrong so it definitely doesn't sound as
good as this one here this was the first
one I ordered maybe I will try ordering
another one but this one is definitely
nice so let's compare it against the
samsung kies 8 band that you can get for
I paid maybe 10 maybe 12 euros on eBay
it was for 7 so yeah maybe pay a bit
more but then be sure to get a really
good one so let's compare how this sound
later on we'll check some measurements
and please keep my son samples always
with a little bit of a grain of salt
they captured just the characteristics
of a headphone they cannot capture the
nuances well it's really hard to capture
the sound of an in-ear there is lots of
processing included a lot of
equalization which I apply simply to
bring it as close to reality as possible
also depends a lot on which headphone
you are using so don't listen with the
Nu you want but rather some neutral
sounding one even the Sony image 1
although it's slightly bass boosted it
should still because the overall
response is run neutral so I will put it
inside here and then we will first hear
that nu 1 then the Samsung s8 and at the
very end of each rec you hear the
original track so you'll know how they
should sound in reality I will play more
tracks than usual you really only want a
track because it should be already
enough to judge the sound but many
complain I used some acoustic music some
vocals whatever but I think a vocal has
such a limited bandwidth or even
instrumentals like for example a
saxophone many many claim yeah if you
know how a real instrument sounds you
should know if the in your colors the
produce already the recording can be
colored I can record a piano in thousand
different ways and it will always sound
different so I think it's more important
to get a general idea of the sound with
really some music that contains
everything from base to
treble and then
compare it to the original source then
you should get epithelium but let's stop
talking I will play the Nu now then the
Samsung then the original thread and at
the end I will
am i touching you I wanna feel every
part of these me
I can't
shoo
to
I think everyone should have heard that
the sound of the Nu one is not quite
right there is something wrong
the Samsung is eight battle or let's
call it Samsung in your earphone to buy
AKG or whatever have a much nicer
response it's a little bit travel heavy
also bass is slightly boosted but still
it sounded normal closer to the original
source than this and when looking at
some measurements here the left and
right channel for the anyone compensated
for the diffused field target and in
gray and compensated and you can
immediately see there is some peak
between five and six kilo Hertz also way
too much responds in the two kilohertz
region which makes it appear somehow
Hong Ki somehow yes strange sounding
treble is quite boosted but I will
overlay the Samsung s8 bundle here and
you can see meets our way more neutral
there is a little bit more upper base
less treble in the 10 kilohertz region
but a higher peak at around 13 kilo
Hertz so yeah it just doesn't sound
right this peak at five point five kilo
Hertz and makes it appear sound really
strange I'm not quite sure how people
can praise this or recommend it because
it just doesn't sound right it has some
of some colored especially a meets a
completely colored way to honky sounding
so yeah I'm really shocked how some
people some highly regarded reviewers
like this good guy bad guy how he can
praise the staff
because it's really crappy the same goes
for this beacuse beacuse whatever which
is maybe slightly better but still far
off maybe worse than those TR NV 20 the
v20 was quite okay the v8 he was also
crappy but this one so I'm not country
it even looks like those look it looks
like those TR n the same design
maybe we'll compare these but it's
really I don't know maybe some reviewers
should really stop reviewing in ears and
headphones because or maybe they should
learn how to listen
this is unlistenable if you want music
on a high level this doesn't cut it this
is just some some strange whistling
honky sound so even such a crappy in
your like this Samsung is eight bundle
which yeah you can get for the tenth of
this sounds way better or way more true
to the original source than this here
yeah there are people complaining at the
mhm one sounds boring it but it is like
the sound was you call it of course it
also colors to some degree it is it has
more bass motorable than the original
recording but it sounds still coherent
like this doesn't I mean why why would
anyone suggest and hype this I cannot
understand it and I'm really shocked
again how some reviewers praised jank
and I've definitely heard worse ones for
sure but it's not a great sounding one
therefore there are so many others yeah
high resolution back and forth I don't
get it I don't quite understand it it's
nothing really special on the contrary
it's rather bad if you compare it
against all those I read it recently
like the MH 750 even this JBL T 110
which is also at the edge of being not
that great is better than this so I
suggest this $430 I mean 450 you can get
there
atomo tech ER 3 ER or XR if you prefer a
little bit more bass take the XR and
this blows away everything else up to
500 maybe even thousand dollars
regarding
neutral it yeah naturality of sound how
how true how flat came in in your sound
you get the automatic and then you
should know yeah
sorry that you ordered it yeah but I
need some time to to review all them
still many people complain you are

you have no idea because they are great
no they aren't they are not great and if
you have some clue about sound about
music I mean you should hear immediately
that that the sound is wrong that is of
for both of their beacuse because I'm
not sure maybe there's some some
wordplay because because because because
no idea or this nu u 1 nu nu nu nu no
idea so there are definitely more decent
ones coming half decent ones it's really
hard to find a perfect one because they
all sound a little bit if you want the
perfect one
take the a thematic even the mk5 for $60
blows away all the others it legs may be
some slight resolution but regarding
tonality it's so so much better than all
these also better than this sony MH 1
but it's not as fun sounding here I know
many complain the Sony is boring so I
really I would like to hear them talking
a talk about the automatic MK 5 how
would how they would perceive this song
because it's even more boring but it's
not boring stiff solid simply flat and
true as if you're listening to some
studio monitor in front of you without
any culinary coloration so the meats are
maybe slightly boosted but everything
else treble is just how it should sound
and not some sizzling mess or some
whistling junk like this here so yeah
this was it about the Nu one I'm not
sure where actually I really I want to
cover that good ones first so first or
half decent ones and then maybe when I
have some time when I'm bored I will
review all the junk because it's waste
of time I also hope to get the BM GV d
m6 and BMG which is highly hyped by many
as
this good guy bad guy and also many
others it's the best
I cannot quite believe I have some other
ones also to arrive in the same price
range around $200 so it will be
interesting to compare them to the DM
the PM g v BM GV i think it is less than
in vm6
if it's really that great because i
highly doubt it I haven't heard it yet
but from what I know those highly
regarded people who I really appreciate
who helped me also with finding some
decent Indians they know it and nothing
I mean it's not even known in China as
this brand comes from the gamer scene so
they'd rather produce some game of stuff
and suddenly they have some in here so I
am really not sure about all this hype
but I let myself convince differently
when I get it
maybe it's really decent although from
those people who designed their own in
ears they told me forget it it's nothing
so stay tuned for some upcoming videos
until then have a nice time and bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
