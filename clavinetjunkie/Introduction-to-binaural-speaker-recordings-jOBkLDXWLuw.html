junkie on YouTube it's the first time
I'm showing myself here on YouTube and
this is because of you because I want to
thank you all my subscribers all my
viewers all the ones who support me
because without you this wouldn't be
possible I've been doing lots of speaker
reviews you can have a look at my site
this is a loves gadgets dot blog
spot.com the link is below and currently
I'm reviewing quite interesting speakers
the Bowers &amp;amp; Wilkins t7 and the Bang &amp;amp;
Olufsen do play a - usually I do all
speaker recordings in a special room
this is our gallery it's a small room
with with a particular acoustics and
well I care a lot about the setup so
it's always the same distance always the
same position of the speaker's also the
measurements frequency response and
everything is done there when I finish
the recordings of the Biot play a - I
noticed that they didn't do the speaker
justice this speaker is different
because it's a omnidirectional speaker
this is you basically get 360 degrees
sound at the front and at the back are
the same drivers so regardless how you
listen they say that the Sun is always
the same the problem is for the
recording half of the sound is emitted
backwards so it comes back as diffuse
reflections to the microphone and the
speaker sends sounds somehow more
distant diffuse so I was not satisfied
with with the recording then I thought
how can I record this speaker to make it
really sound how it sounds in reality
and the idea I had was to try binaural
audio recordings basically you have two
microphones I mean I have two
microphones in my ears
and when you hear this recording with
headphones you should hear what I was
hearing well in theory of course the
microphone has set its own frequency
response but these recordings a much
more real realistic than the ones I do
usually in my recording room I would
like to show you the difference between
you
no microphone in this case the zoom h1
and my binaural microphones which
currently I'm using s voice mix and I
will record my Philip sounds with
speakers and then switch between the
zoom h1 and the binaural microphones of
course don't forget to wear headphones
so to get the most realistic sound image
let's have a listen
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
