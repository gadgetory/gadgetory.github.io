speaker video for a change
after all those headphone reviews I want
to open something different again and I
selected the XS 9 I read some comments
claiming that it doesn't sound that
great there is too much upper base and
so on but I think it sounds quite
balanced I learned how to make some
measurements in how it's snowing like
hell but weather was fine and I was low
in so I did some 3/5 measurements from a
distance of around 50 centimeters we
still have that ground influence what
about from that yeah I think it's quite
representative and you can see it made
us quite flat but there is indeed too
much upper base and food elements but it
was man has a five-pin equalizer built
in which is quite nice then I came up
with this setting here so boosting will
always spend by 2 notches then reducing
the next belt by one not again they meet
went by one notch and Trevor by what not
and we will get this curve the blue one
and you can see we managed to increase
lower base while reducing this upper
base and we also got a little bit more
mids and I would like to listen how it
sounds with this EQ setting or if it's
better without you are already listening
to an artificial banner ahead so you
should get some virtual reality effect
no I'm just kidding but you have to
listen with headphones by no reconyx we
carry headphones for the best results I
will play some random tunes and we'll
switch between equalizer off and my
settings so let's have a listen
so raise those been promoters we use the
next band 1 and the mid band 1 and also
for everyone not I wouldn't post it too
much because it became it can become a
little bit too harsh then I think it's a
credit sounding if not the best for
around $300 in this in this class also
performing their JBL boombox and most
others not the smallest one yeah quite
recommend it especially if you tweak the
sound a little bit yeah I think it's
nice just wanted to follow this as I
heard repeatedly some criticisms all
that weight but you can make it for
sound really close to flat like a knife
i speaker which is of course quite nice
there will be more videos with the eye
becoming so stay tuned some surprise
maybe yeah thanks all for watching and
see you then bye bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
