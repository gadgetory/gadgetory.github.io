going to a deeper look at that
all your ebooks that are already unbox
before it took me a little bit longer to
come up with something but simply
because it didn't allow me as much as I
would have expected given the strong
military look the heavy weight is only 8
kilograms so quite surprising for the
size and also price is it definitely not
that cheap speaker folio is a small
company from the Netherlands they
produce customs because like this a box
or ammunition box and they also have a
larger wooden version called a box which
is probably in the area but 8 kilograms
for this size it's heavy it's three
times heavier than the ephors long so I
would expect it to perform at least
better but in reality it doesn't so it's
not even that much louder because there
is no DSP inside no limiter and it
allows its earthly stored it could play
maybe outer but then you would hear some
crackling and strange noises so I
probably wouldn't buy it for the sound
but maybe for looks if you are into
military gadgets so it's a book maybe
it's a standard ammunition box with cut
out holes for those speakers here at the
side you see the controls so this is the
control button to select between
functions Wi-Fi bluetooth and so on this
is a heavily customized version Phillip
the one who borrowed it to need built-in
everything so there is Wi-Fi included
optical in alone it has the biggest
battery possible here on this size you
can see the power knob which is also a
volume knob and if I turn it on you see
some kind of status light which
indicates the battery life no less it
becomes I think orange later on red and
this flashing I didn't really bring it
so far is the battery inside is really
good you see a twist system with two
drivers which has the tweeters built in
from the tweezers are aiming slightly
outwards so this would maybe improve
saturations also dispersion
and you could of course also have a look
inside
and you can see X quite gently and
additional auxiliary input optically and
also a wired network but let me close
this again as we would of course like to
have a listen
ya have to be careful around you can
help yourself
and I also included it within my speaker
audio database you can compare it
against any other split up and you will
notice that it doesn't sound anyway so
the sound is don't fairly new 12 but it
likes an excitement so that bass doesn't
have any we aren't clever missus some
sparking and overall out I couldn't
record it at mixing volume as there
would be too much distortion it was
really heavy crackling so I reduce the
volume to get a sound which was smaller
less distortion free and with this
loudness it was hardly any louder than a
fee for slow wiser if Oslo still picked
way more time somehow we can also have a
look at some frequency response
measurement and you can see that overall
it is neutral there is some dip in the
pro 3 kilohertz region but this could
also be a measurement error because of
the new field measurement and you can
also see that upper base at 200 is
boosted at mid-ohio health base is
simply too soft it rolls off quite
smoothly but in reality bass only drops
at 75 Hertz also at low levels no DSPs
or no additional adjustment and that
Alastair doesn't seem to be any limiter
so the speaker simply stops this thought
when it becomes too loud but now let's
evolution is always I'll grade my
binaural microphones also my head cam to
give you a kind of first-person view
will compare it against the AC force law
which is lighter smaller and also
cheaper you should of course listen with
headphones so please put them up and
let's have a listen I will turn it on
and turn it to maximum although you can
hear this funny old school noise like
from an auditorium
let's put the also right beside and
let's start with the trade from sopes
man princess region and the story of
epochs planes are so let's have a listen
now slow
Oh
[Laughter]
[Laughter]
yeah I won't comment back from the sound
so you should hear it bio so let's try
not trick me what do you want when you
want to feel great volume you want to
feel great
some Twitter's the first expression will
done sounds dead great from the a box it
becomes quite muscles from a high angle
while they're authorized only foolish
drivers where the roofer but still give
secure impressions around so it
disperses the sound quality better
despite still being quite a directional
speaker already from front it's okay
while still that rather if you said it's
not email its essence is a different
experience from the oil
not affect me let's sit down back again
okay
the track has some artificial still
enhancing included Sonia and smoking on
unpretty
that this comes from both recording
within the track so I think overall you
can hear the differences in industry
again lifting off excess and maybe let's
increase volume slightly this is around
half volume for course now
tell us law despite the smaller size
smaller overall to maturity
come on more punchy economy amorphous
and maybe some people ordinary
disrespect homie just line up it's been
a while I'm updating my bra wear a
bikini shines like designers times up
just edit give me the mic when you
finish the browser
are you messing your mind up judging in
from the house while you only know sighs
let me go there without a small role
okay come on racking up it'll complete
your it's not gonna char committee
railings not yeah nice soft on door oh
nothing just a job
those are you mentally its up your
brother struggling tensed up with the
club's it is a protector on any mapex
oldest 1902 come on man so we just give
the best fat cap and and you smell
awesome
you will never and I want regret - what
I now feel ready okay but you owe me one
okay damn yeah I'll break them damn wash
off damn damn place up there what's all
this damn
also mention another far away it quite
shocked to hear also a nice pounding
loud but unusable at maximum why those
laws we found quite okay with some trip
to get some kind of parting because of
the specified us which are sandwich type
but apart from that I think they're
whore slogans here I think you would do
if the total ebooks liked any refinement
of the people's law while at the same
time it was agreed that much louder into
thick plate louder there was too much
distortion so overall I'm more impressed
with the TV also being waste model
lighter and sounding better and I don't
think they use the full potential here
there should be some PHP included which
controls the something will be better
for low levels more bass books at high
levels limit the peaks in order to avoid
any distortion but currently there is so
much rattling I don't know if it's this
is driver overload or I don't know so
it's not as bitter for a critical
listener and also for the auto body
maybe not loud enough the FIFO is just
as loud so you would need probably
something bigger like the sound box to
for example which really kick set it's
not that much more expensive but way
larger of course so I hope I could give
you an idea about the audio a box not a
bit bigger but simply that hasn't used
this full potential which could be
included in inside this size and weight
it's way too heavy for what it is but
which is because of the metal housing or
because of the drivers are so heavy but
it's way too heavy nearly as heavy is
the powerful boom store Excel this phone
is twice the size so overall yeah if you
like military look may go for it but
sound wise you can definitely find
something better I hope you like this
and see you the next video
have a nice time bye bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
