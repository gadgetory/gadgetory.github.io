to dedicate some time to the ultimate
ears boom - quite a highly-rated also
hype speaker gets lots of place from
everyone I may be the only one who
thinks it's nothing special I mean it's
not completely bit so it has nice
features it's waterproof pretty rugged
but I think the sound is rather average
and the only thing it can lead with play
pretty loud but in them it doesn't
really sound great
I thought we'll compare it against some
other speakers much cheaper ones lenders
showing images also way smaller form or
pocket sized goes for around $40 this
hammer 30 currently then I have the lava
room 20 which calls for 60 and a pretty
cheap one like this tall Tronics plus X
which costs around 26 currently all of
these cannot play as loud as the
ultimate ears boom boom but for normal
level listening all of these are better
I would say so this can really only play
loud but even then the sound is nothing
special so if you really need loudness I
would go for something else something
bigger or even a charge 3 which sounds
much better it makes it more sony xba-4
and so on but before hey listen let's
check out maybe some frequency response
measurements and you can see the
ultimate ears boom on axis so measured
exactly with the driver and if we
compare it to the old ultimate ears boom
you can see that not that much has
changed the bass is really equal the
only thing they did is movement out
treble slightly so it doesn't have this
lower treble boost anymore but even off
axis the sound didn't improve that much
so here both again measured many degrees
of exit from the drivers and you can see
there is significant travel loss
although ultimate ears claims 260
degrees and for a ue boom the Santa
comes redo when not listen with one
driver aimed directly at the listener it
makes them there is not that much
difference between the old and the new
version both are quite loud
although with lots of dynamic
compression etive m√≤r bass reduction
but now let's compare it against a
strong mini is always amusing binaural
microphones so you should listen with
headphones I will play them at normal
listening levels and we'll start with a
Huey bone tool first so please attention
yes you can see I already turned it with
one driver go at me this way it would
become even worse so we have to listen
like this otherwise you get quite a
diffuse and holy sound
come on a song and a quick jab maybe
it sounds a little bit hidden here in
Russia speaker this omnidirectional part
doesn't really work that well
not easy to make volume football like
this we can also place this show me for
a more directional sound so I will
increase volume slightly Yamagata
Oh our business and cancel make another
phone and see what happens when we
reduce volume so this is more background
kind of listening this becomes much more
full-bodied let's increase volume again
and of course the reason tree sway
powder you can let's go again it may
come you evolve who will be twice as
loud or even louder or business - I mean
you know oh yeah if you really need this
high loudness the show-me cannot quite
compete but let's try maybe the volume
twenty
you can hear a much more refined sound
overall deeper bass simply notice
booming honky hollow this bass boost
here at around 200 250 Hertz makes it
really sound quite a bit strange not a
track but something like this
you could maybe hear some slight
distortion from the place already from
the Vavoom 20 it's also not a very loud
speaker but let's try maybe the
taotronics parsecs may remember this
cost 26 so really wait cheaper than the
ultimate ears boom - and it should
connect hopefully ya know and let's try
the same track again with the UE boom -
first you can hear it unravel slipping
too much meat
while a more funky phone and on the
secret ultimately this is the Optronics
our techmount you can hit keep the base
wiser
- McQueen doubters are with nothing near
the people lose weight outer doesn't -
something like this from no collection
oh yeah as I told you if you really need
maximum volume in a small form-factor
Yayoi boom - is definitely nice but for
a normal music listening there are much
better choices this taotronics is simply
the cheapest one I found which can
really sound still pretty decent but 430
or even higher price
I bought it 450 years yeah completely
overpriced you can find it for lower but
still even four hundred dollars I
wouldn't probably buy it so yeah I hope
this could give you an idea about the
ultimate ears boom PO
nice features great design but sound is
simply average or below average I
definitely prefer a ShowMe as I can put
it into the pocket and it sounds way
better swallow a little listening so
thanks for watching and see you in the
next video have a nice time and bye bye
