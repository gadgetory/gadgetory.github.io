should check out the new speaker from
TDK this is the GDK a 28 or crack flex
this is a pretty Rock model it is
waterproof shock resistant it has 360
degrees sound well at least they claimed
this as you can see there is a flap
which covers and protects all the ports
here there is also a main battery switch
we will turn this on now ok
it is NFC for pairing speakerphone well
let's check it out how it sounds it
should connect automatically here and
usually it plays or it starts playing
this time not so let's start the song
you can put it up like that
like this even a small people can do as
you can see the drivers aim outwards and
there is something like an acoustic lens
that projects the sound out words I'm
not quite impressed with the result to
tell the truth
the travel is a bit resonant so I
thought we will check out another
speaker the den on bio mini and see how
both compared the denim is a bit smaller
or well let's have a listen starting
again with the track flex not a denim
baby baby
Hey
maybe baby
okay I thought we should check out some
songs that I selected for the upcoming
speaker comparison tool or speaker
database ah
so I will present you the first song
which is from constant English Ronnie
this is a smooth jazz track he sent to
me uh and well it's a let's have a
listen and compare both how they sound
you
the next song is from Tom O'Grady's of
jazz funk bands resolution 88 this is
for jazz funk genre so let's hear on
this track
okay the next track we will be hearing
is from Seoul / freesia this is a new
soul R&amp;amp;B track which soul persona
recorded together with princess freesia
this will be the next song for the tool
let's have a listen
it's you hello they complain just
okay I thought we should have a listen
how the TDK compares against the JBL
charge too which is well it's in the
same class I would say they are both the
same size and so on and the next track
we will be hearing is is from inner
smile and this is a kind of dance house
track well let's have a listen again
starting with the TDK this is maximum
volume of the JBL
I think the champion truck can play a
bit louder
okay the next track is a kind of
downtempo trip-hop track from Fredrik
Karlsen this is the guitarist of a
legendary fusion group metaphor and he
is having a known group or let's say a
known series which is called a chill
music and this is one song from him the
JBL
they're both playing at maximum water
there will be more pieces of course but
I thought we should check out how they
both sound with classical music this is
a romantic piece from Tchaikovsky and
again starting with the TDK
okay I think you've heard how both
sounds or how this TDK sounds compared
to the denim and to the JBL oh well nice
try to DK but next time try harder
thanks for watching and bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
