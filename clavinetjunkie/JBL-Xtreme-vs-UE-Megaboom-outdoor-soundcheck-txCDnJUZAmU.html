please welcome to an auto comparison
between the JBL extreme and the e we
make a bomb this time people were asking
for an auto comparison between these two
speakers but outdoor recordings can be
quite a bit tricky because of wind and
also planes that are passing by and
cause lots of noise I hope it will work
out this time anyhow I'm wearing
binaural microphones as always I will be
playing the speakers at their maximum
volume so please listen with headphones
to get the most realistic impression
this does not work when listening to
speakers because binaural recordings do
sound distorted I'm starting with the
cable extreme then switch over to the
mega boom and please have a listen which
you like more mega boom I think the
difference is obvious
well no punch just a bit of noise
now the big string again
a mega boom there is a bit of a sizzling
sound that's called intermodulation
Distortion the JBL extreme is clean this
is because of missing freezers for the
mega boom
let's run out the back you can hear it
follows the first attempt with iOS
devices but 1 megaohm minutes pretty
loud but it just missing any sound
quality again the extreme
the extreme is not a 360-degree speaker
so let's listen to it from behind
that's the mega boom yeah there is some
lack of treble but I think we can help
here I have the flip three Google simply
connect vote and and use this as a big
speaker yeah now the clip is doing the
treble for the tech side
committable
extreme together with the flip what we
could also do is simply hanging the JBL
flip flip 3 somewhere example here at
the tree like this and then let's place
on track now both are playing the
extreme and that you also hear the clip
I switch over to the mega boom it takes
a bit and I think it's pretty impressive
hearing two speakers like that let's put
it somewhere else
the mega bomb again
just imagine to jdl extreme connected
together unfortunately I don't have that
much money for such a comparison but
already the extreme together the clip
shows the potential I mean they are
playing mono both one is playing both
stereo channels the other one too you
cannot connect them with stereo you can
do this if two extreme or two flips are
connected together then you can switch
between party mode or stereo mode but
when two different speakers are
connected you cannot do stereo but
anyhow it is impressive I think it blows
the megabowl away okay thanks I hope
this was helpful it was just a short
video but I have to go back and play
with my son now he is already waiting so
thanks for watching and see you next
time bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
