trials have the same has a HD 50 takes
Jubilee sounds naked well not
necessarily naked but without these felt
English here it's run as some kind of
foam or sponge now you can see the
drivers unprotected so maybe not that
great but I read comments repeatedly
suggesting to remove them because the
sound opens up look at more treble
although I'm not sure if more treble is
really that great because I think it
sounds already quite neutral so boosting
treble even more would rather make it
appear maybe harsh so let me listen if
the difference is really significant I
will put it up here and we're playing
two or three tracks and we'll switch
between the naked one and the stock one
with the English inside so
am i searching you I wanna feel
I hope you would hear it there was
definitely some noticeable change in
sound but also some slight difference in
imaging someone appeared slightly
shifted towards the right side but this
would be probably because I didn't
manage to position them exactly equal
just a slight change here already
changes the sound quite a lot but now
let's have a look at some measurements
what really changed here so this is the
original HD 58 X and this without felts
so the biggest change seems to be that
you get about 2 DB less bass when the
files are removed at the same time upper
mids are boosted you can see there is
some peak at around 3.5 kilo Hertz this
guy's definitely more pronounced at the
same time upper tribal gets boosted with
a peak at around 11 canards so I think
the original 58 X has a more neutral and
flatter response here I will now overlay
the HD 600 here compared to the naked HD
58 X and you can see that the HD 600 has
even less space and even more boost in
the upper mids so 2 3 4 up to 5
kilohertz are more boosted while it
doesn't have this peak at 11 kilohertz
so removing the felts rather makes the
treble appear a little bit grainy I'm
not sure if I really prefer it without
always but we could also maybe compare
how it sounds now naked against the HD
600 again the same 3 tracks and hit on
you can tell me what you liked more so
let's have a listen again
my fantasies come to me you are in my
thoughts I never stray from the heart of
you come to me
we can't be
am i searching you I wanna feel
me
so please tell me your opinion but I
would say the original 58 X with inlays
sounds best and smoothest with the
flattest response also compared against
the HD 600 although some seem to differ
they prefer the HTC Sonic although it
appears a little bit harsh so how to
remove them we have simply remove the
ear cups here put it inside and it
should be like it was before already
they should snap in on their own with
that with this unless it's not that easy
you don't hear them click but now yeah
it's like it was so I hope this was
helpful for all those who wanted to hear
yeah if the increase in sound is
significant you get some more treble a
little bit closer to the HT 600 but you
also get this peak at around and 11
kilohertz which makes the travel ap a
little bit grainy so a post in that
thank you a swing is not really that
great yeah thanks all for watching and
stay tuned for some upcoming videos have
a nice toilet bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
