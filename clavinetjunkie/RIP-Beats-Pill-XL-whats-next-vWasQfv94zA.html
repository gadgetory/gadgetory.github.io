get serious now
now that Apple started the callback
program for the beats pill Excel many
seem to be a bit in panic they don't
know what to do which speaker can I buy
which is better than the pill Excel let
me tell you the pill Excel is nothing
special I mean it's a loud speaker but
it doesn't sound good
you really don't get a good quality
sound out of it so I would recommend
send it back take the money and buy
something really special now JBL came
out with something new this is the JBL
extreme and it puts the pill Excel to
shame sometimes loudness wise they are
about similar so you won't lose much but
you will gain really high quality sound
with lots of base powerful sound nice
smooth treble not this real strange kind
of thing you get from the pill XL so to
give you an idea how both sound and how
both compare I thought we will do some
sound check I will wear binaural
microphones and if you listen through
really good headphones you should get a
pretty realistic idea of how they sound
later on please
use my volume of my voice as a guide for
the correct listening loudness as I will
turn both up at the end so we will also
hear how aloud they play in reality I
will set them up in my in my room lean
back and yeah we will have a listen I'm
sitting around three meters away from
the speakers and instead of wearing a
head cam I set up the camera on a tripod
this time to avoid any shaky image the
speakers are set to about two-thirds of
their maximum volume and later on we
will turn them up I'm starting with the
JBL extreme and then we'll switch over
to the big spiel Excel so have a listen
member
I'm turning volume up now this maximum
volume</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
