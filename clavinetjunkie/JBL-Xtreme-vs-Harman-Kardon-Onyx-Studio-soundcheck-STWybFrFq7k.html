comparison of the JBL Xtreme against the
Harman Kardon onyx to do some people
already asked about this comparison I
think that both are really great
performers and keep in mind that both
are from the same company I mean JBL
Harman Kardon infinity it's all the same
maybe they are tuned by the same people
I don't know I would say that the Harman
Kardon Onyx to do is rather suitable for
home use why the JBL extreme is better
for outdoor I mean it's waterproof it
has a much better battery the Harman
Kardon went down after half an hour when
cranked to the maximum while I could
play the JBL for more than five maybe
even six hours at maximum as always I'm
using binaural microphones for the
recording so if you listen with
headphones you should get a pretty
realistic impression of both speakers I
will play some tunes and you can
hopefully judge which one you like
better I can already tell you now that
the JBL has a more boosted sound it has
some bass and treble boost while the
Harman Kardon on exterior has a flatter
sound also basses reaching quite a bit
deeper but it's not as boosted we will
have a listen I will start with some
acoustic songs first let's try some jazz
let's try some small chairs
the
maybe something a bit more funky
or some kind of rock
or a little bit more electronic
for some house
Allen is one medic
Oh
as you can see I put them aside now and
both are turn to the maximum so we can
hear how they perform at their maximum
volume I'm starting with the JBL again
another trick
I think they perform on a similar level
I mean you hear the difference in sound
but if this changes when the Harman
Kardon Onix to do is attached domains I
will attach both now so we can see if
there's really much difference when they
play from battery or from means both are
still playing at maximum a JBL extreme
first let's have a listen
I think you could hear that the Harman
Kardon onyx to do was quite a bit louder
when played from mains this was an old
trick with old JBL and harman curtains
because they simply didn't perform that
well when played on batteries the JBL
extreme is different it sounds nearly
the same regardless if played from
batteries of remains this is definitely
the better light portable speaker while
I would maybe choose the Harman Kardon
Onix to do four for home use
if battery mode is not that important
it's not as suitable for portable use
you can see it has some sticky feet here
that you cannot fold in I'm not sure why
why the Harman Kardon went for this
design the more expensive Harman Kardon
Onix also had this steel grip which you
couldn't rotate or fold in for transport
use so if you need something for the
beach go with the JBL otherwise the
Harman Kardon Onix to do is much cheaper
and sounds maybe even slightly better
depending on music style and genre I
hope this was helpful I hope you could
get a little bit of an impression how
both compare see you in the next video
until then bye bye and have a nice time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
