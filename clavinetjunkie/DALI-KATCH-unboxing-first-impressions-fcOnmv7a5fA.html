see we are back from our holidays we had
a great time in Italy and I'm already
missing the fritto misto but a new
package is arrived which can hopefully
compensate for this therefore I would
like to share this exclusive and special
unboxing with you the package comes from
Delhi which is a Danish speaker company
and the new catch is the first portable
unit which is quite promising maybe one
of the most promising portable speakers
currently so let's look inside
I followed the catch since the very
first announcement and here it is it
will be released I think in October but
yeah here you can hear and see it first
it's always I'm using binaural
microphones we will also turn it on
let's hope the battery is charged
somehow I'm snow inside or something
it's not possible to take it out without
making some dirt so let's put this away
here and here is the dahle catch in
admiration of music it's available in
different colors this is green moss so
yeah you can see very exclusive
packaging carrying back which is of
course nice quite small it's not too big
it's wrapped into some other yeah and it
looks really nice reminds a little bit
of the Bang &amp;amp; Olufsen pure play a - and
when looking at what high-five they
already gave the speaker a five-star
review powerful full-bodied sound great
sense of timing dynamics long battery
life against nothing at this price yeah
what high fire is maybe not the most
trustworthy source as they also gave the
Bowers and Wilkins d7 five stars and
some other junk like the Cambridge Audio
minks goal so let's see this is the main
these are the flux for the main adapter
obviously it needs an own charger so no
USB charging here this is the charger
quite big so what do we have here some
short quick manual maybe
and well yeah let's turn it on I will
leave this one here so we can maybe try
connecting and having a listen the
speaker has front and back drivers so
just like the panel of Scindia Plato
which offers you a 360-degree kind of
sound let's see how this grip here works
huh
it's a leather grip I think it's nice
that you can pull it out or put it in so
it doesn't disturb the design of the
speaker not quite sure about the grill
we made a little bit of the micro
metrics from Bowers and Wilkins maybe
it's even exchangeable I don't know so
could be interesting to have other
designs but I'm not really fond of this
hexagonal design here
yeah but the most important part is of
course how it sounds so let's see if I
can connect I think the speaker should
be already in pairing mode yeah here it
is Dali
catch yeah it's a bit maybe too bright
my phone it's already connected and you
can see there are some buttons it has an
own EQ button I think there are two
sound modes a clear mode and another one
I don't know how how they call it which
should give you a bit more full-bodied
sound so let's check it out yeah with a
first more electronic kind of
song and let's have a listen this is
obviously the more bass heavy yet this
one is definitely clearer volume seems
to be sincere
I think I prefer the warmer children
somehow yet the only other speaker
comparable one I currently have at home
is their fee fie Helsinki calls for 399
euros just like a dolly catch not sure
about the price in America and not sure
if it will be released it's nothing new
is the battery indicator so all four
lights should mean it's obviously full
and we can do some switching between
both and have a listen which one sounds
better the FIFA Helsinki yeah one of my
favourite ones although at very low
levels it tends to sound a little bit
tinny so let's start again with the
catch and then I will switch over to the
FIFA else in game
if you found
maybe a trick please volume slightly
Helsinki let's see in a 360 degree sound
wave ca us so get a nice sound from
behind
the Helsinki of course has no drivers at
the back our increased volume is more
pumping the base on the middle
I will maybe change the cumin which of
course reduces face lightly
if I think again quite a big fool alone
no Trek just fine from resolution 88
they just released their latest album
you should check them out on Benjamin
some dispersion seems quite even
Helsinki and Helsinki suffice of course
more from Lionel's
again the leakage but yet a missing base
somehow a bit more often in the Helsinki
maybe we should try some kind of well
disco house or something this is the
coming H now a few fans in here there we
are in late night mode now so we should
maybe change it to normal to neutral
tuning and yeah let's increase volume to
max mumble is still the Helsinki playing
maximum volume of the hell think you can
hear the compressor
yeah
yeah I think we could hear it it's
pretty loud but doesn't really sound
that great on maximum while the Helsinki
with this very loud recording from
nocopyrightsounds still sounded like a
normal speaker this started to sound a
bit over compressed over-processed I
think I prefer the the bomb tuning but
yeah it starts to already pump at high
volume apart from that yeah seems quite
natural and neutral sounding maybe not
as exciting as the Mendelssohn do play a
tune what is this here
yeah we have a USB port this from what I
read this can also be used with some
chromecast Donald's so you can include
it into your network not only bluetooth
yeah I think it's a nice speaker
although yeah we have to do some further
testing the Helsinki yeah doesn't have
this strong processing it rather
distorts then starting to pump why this
tries to to be loud but well cannot so
yeah if you know where the limits of the
speakers of the speaker it's it should
work but it's definitely not a party
speaker it that sound became a bit thin
at maximum from what I could hear now
but yeah we will have to test this much
more in detail what else is inside the
box nothing congratulations
some small manual let's see how it turns
off
yeah with in the rest home so we can
take it back in maybe with the grip here
and check it out in a more detail to
review soon I will also try to edit to
the database as soon as possible the
FIFO of course is already included with
neutral end with late night tuning or
what maximum late night doesn't quite
make sense so it should be brought to
neutral when listen to higher levels
other otherwise it will result in some
distortion what's this some military
going on here so thanks a lot for
watching I hope this was helpful to give
you a very first quick and impression of
the Dahle catch really a promising
speaker and what HiFi is pretty
impressed with it I think that's their
favorite now so yeah nothing else so st.
for now and see you in the next video
until then stay tuned and bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
