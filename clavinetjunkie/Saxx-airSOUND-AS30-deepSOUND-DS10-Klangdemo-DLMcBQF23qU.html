today we will take a look at the Saxx AirSOUND AS30 together with the sub deepSOUND DS10 a bit more in detail
later we will of course also take a listen
but maybe you can remember that some weeks ago, I already unboxed them together with my son
we had a short listen, but I couldn't really warm to them
in the meantime I tried them out repeatedly
but they didn't manage to convince me
but I also have to send them back, they were provided to me by Saxx
it's a German company from Saxony, the name suggests: Saxx - Saxony a nice wordplay
meanwhile I also included them into my database
for all those who don't know it yet, try the link below
it is a database with various speaker recordings, speakers that I already had at home
starting with the smallest Bluetooth speakers for 10€ up to floorstanding speakers like the Teufel Ultima 40 Aktiv
even the Audio Pro Addon T20 behind me are included
and the Saxx AS30 too, so you can compare them against all sorts of things
and you will hear, they do not sound really that convincing
I made some frequency response measurements, and you can see that the upper bass area is much too pronounced
at the same time bass doesn't reach that deep and already starts falling off above 100hz
then there is a slight dip in the upper mid section which overall doesn't make the sound convincing at all
although the user reviews on amazon are quite positive, which was also my main argument to try these speakers out.
but let's take a more detailed look, one is always active, the other one passive, like with most other similar speakers
as inputs you get 2 auxiliary ports, 1 as 3.5mm plug, the other one as cinch
a subwoofer out, otherwise we couldn't even try the sub out
then there is an optical digital input and a USB port
I haven't even tried it out, but this probably acts as some USB-interface I assume
which means you could attach them to your PC directly
they also come with a remote
here you can power them off, switch between different sources
a speaker wire is also included, quite short, I assume 1.5m
and the subwoofer which was also included is the smaller model
there is also a bigger one, I think it is called DS12
here are several controls as well
this is the input, here you can find an additional low-level input
here we could wire some other speakers inbetween
then there is of course the master volume
here the crossover frequency which even reaches up to 200hz
here the phase, switchable between 0 and 180°
then an auto standby and actually that was it
and let's have a listen to them
compared to the Audio Pro T8L
which are indeed quite comparable, also regarding price
you could already get the AS30 for 200€ I think
right now about 220, on amazon a bit more expensive with 260
the Audio Pro should also cost around 260, thus not that much difference
I will wire everything and then we can have a listen
you are listening through an artificial binaural head
of course you have to listen with headphones to get the most realistic impression
such recordings do not work well through speakers.
so please put up your headphones and let's try all this out.
so as you can see I put the AS30 closer to the TV-set, equally how I usally have set up the T8L
I know such a placement may be acoustically not ideal, but these are ordinary bookshelf speakers
therefore I don't think that someone would set them up on some special stands
moslty they will probably stand like this, to substitute some soundbar or in a shelf
right now the subwoofer is turned off, later we will turn it on
also try out to integrate it into everything, but now I will start with the AS30
both speakers are playing with neutral settings now
in fact the Saxx have no tone controls
if you want to boost treble or something here, you would have to use some app or some external equalizer
directly through the speakers there is no option unfortunately
the Audio Pro
I'll sit down a bit closer to you here
and you can hear a slight coloration of the mids, also upper bass is clearly too pronounced
and this particular brilliance is missing
also here the bass clearly deeper, but not as boomy, but simply more pleasant to listen to
they really do not impress me at all
really not at all
maybe another title
yeah and here you can simply notice that the treble doesn't sound right
the bass, the upper bass is too boosted
the Audio Pro
although they are not neutral either, they are simply way more pleasant to listen to
particularly with the placement, closer to the wall
if one could at least raise treble a bit
but...
they sound a bit &quot;boxy&quot; as you would say in English
let's try this
a track from Soulpersona and Princess Freesia, from their latest album &quot;Sunset City&quot;
highly recommended if you like this disco style
the Audio Pro
yeah, and here you can really hear the difference well
the bass has way more kick
doesn't boom that much as with the Saxx
I will turn down volume slightly
what we could try is to add the subwoofer now
but as the upper bass area is as pronounced
it hardly makes any sense
because the entire rest is off
so if I add even more bass
this will boom even more
thefore I tried to add the sub with inverted phase and a higher crossover
the highest crossover frequency is 200hz I think
also the area which is quite pronounced
this way this area should cancel out
I will increase volume again
this would be with phase at 0°
bass has even more boom
like this I think the bass cancels out a bit in the upper region
but instead you get more below
I will switch again to the Audio Pro
but it still isn't right
you could maybe make the sub a little softer
louder doesn't make sense
and a lower crossover doesn't make sense either
yeah, it is not easy
I will turn off the sub again
again the Audio Pro
they simply sound more pleasant
something else
you can hear the treble doesn't sound right, it's rather some kind of sizzle, not a real...
I will try turning on the sub again
the sound becomes fuller but not really better
of course I could also turn up bass for the Audio Pros now as the sub is turned on
I turned it to maximum
I revert back to neutral and turn off the sub here again
in case of the AS30 the subwoofer doesn't help that much
as the basis is not really that great to begin with
let's try this
also here you can notice that the mids are slightly colored but considerably better than on the Saxx
an old rag from the 60s
half of the music is mixed to the right, the other half to the left
so we can also hear the stereo imaging quite nicely
the Audio Pro are standing a bit more narrow, but the sound is still just as broad
and are not droning that much with bass
the hi-hat here: shh shh shh...
here it sounds normal: tsss tsss tsss...
and here it is rather some kind of tshhhh tshhhh tshhh...
let't try this
I think now it's time to turn on the sub again, you can notice against the Audio Pro they have not the smallest chance anymore
although the Audio Pro do not have any subwoofer either
with a similar enclosure there is so much more
I add the sub again
it is a bit more fun like that
maybe the volume a bit higher
here we can of course also add some bass
maybe midway between maximum and midway
I don't know
this here
it is much nicer here
without this box below there
without sub
there is  nothing
let's leave it like that
let's try this
here they need the sub again
I will make it a bit louder
ah, I don't know
something else
no, that's a no-go
that's a no-go, this is...
maybe like this but..., anyhow
maybe even a tad louder
yeah, I think it doesn't make sense to compare any further
I think you could hear that the sound was not really top
regardless of all the great user reviews on amazon
I think even AreaDVD gave them quite a high rating
but I personally didn't like the sound with subwoofer or without
especially when compared to some similarly priced speakers like the Audio Pro T8L
which even size wise are maybe a bit smaller, as they do not have this length
I think the Audipro are considerably more convincing
you can of course always listen to them through my database
I would even say that the Steljes NS3 offer a more convincing sound
the upper bass region makes the sound a bit hollow
so it doesn't help to add the sub
because then the bass becomes even more hefty
if at least the entire rest was ok and more neutral
or maybe even a bit more sparkling
I also miss tone controls
so if you place them badly, it would be great if you could optimize the sound a bit
many thanks for providing me the test units
unfortunately I cannot really speak out a positive conclusion
they are not bad somehow, but not really top either
I hope you liked the video, I hope it could give you an impression about the...
Sexx, erm... or Saxx, Sexx hehe
Saxx AirSOUND AS30
there is also a bigger subwoofer, I mean the subwoofer is great
but together with the AS30 it didn't play that nicely together
I should have maybe tried it together with the Audio Pro
but I do not think they really need any, they also sound voluminous enough without
the bass reaches down below 50, 40hz
while here below 100hz most bass already falls off
thank you very much for watching, and see you in the next video
bye, bye
thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
