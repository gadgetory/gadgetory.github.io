yeah!
so there you go
tell me afterwards how it was, OK?
OK
and what did you get? let me have a look!
such a blue one
wow, can you already read this?
try
ermmm
Thonet and Vander
try turning it on so you can compare it
can I already take this away here?
yes
look, here you have your Sony
and how does it sound?
look, here it is already
did you already connect? ah, now!
wait, wait, what does it want from you?
what nice music do you have here? try something, but not that it suddenly starts to scream
hmm
it has hardly any bass!
hardly any bass? I have to continue, compare them a bit and tell me how it is, OK?
OK!
how can I switch over here?
and how does it sound?
how can I switch between this one or this?
I already showed you once
and this is the other one here
wait, let me see
you can hear nothing from this one. what trash is this?
ah, it was completely turned down
boom! pfff
this one has no bass at all, and this one sounds...
no bass... what do they send us here?
listen a bit, I will come to you in a second, I have to look something
I am hearing some beat! and which one is better?
this one of course!
yeah?
it sounds like nothing
maybe it has some additional bass mode or something?
did you already turn on extra bass?
no
it becomes even more extreme
and do you like it or not?
sounds somehow not that great, let me see
well
let me see what else do you have here?
without bass is better, isn't it?
with it sounds really weird
now switch over to the other one
sounds a bit hollow I would have said
not that great
well, so if you don't like it pack it in again and we will put it away
Ok, wait, how to stop...
where again?
where to put the cable?</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
