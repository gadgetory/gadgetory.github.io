you the latest batch of laboratory kurz
this is the new model of the elaborate
on zip and this is the completely new
lebreton deep mini the greatest feature
about these speakers is that they can
form a kind of multi-room system
lebreton calls this sound spaces or you
can use them as usual portable bluetooth
speakers as both have a better insight
but they are not water resistant or
waterproof so you should be careful if
taking them outdoors I will turn them on
immediately so that we will see and hear
when they become responsive because it
takes a little bit of time and as always
I will be using my binaural microphones
and a head came to give you to give you
a kind of first-person view and
first-person sound so that we hear how
both compare I also thought we will
compare the librarians if mini against
the river s as both cost exactly the
same they cost around 250 and I thought
about comparing the big tip with the
fugu XL as these cost around 300 so now
you saw how long it takes the problem is
even outside if you want to use them as
simple Bluetooth speakers you always
need to wait this time until they login
or I don't know until they start up I
will of course want to show you the
Leviton app how to set them up and so on
so yeah let's have a listen both are
already connected to my network so when
I start the app they will appear as two
separate speakers I will show you how to
link them but first let's have a look
inside the settings here you see the
playback control Wi-Fi signal the
battery each speaker also comes with own
voicings and room settings but they
don't change really much you cannot
change the sound completely these are
only nuances and what's also nice is
that each speaker has five user
selectable presets for web radio
we can start one this takes a little bit
of time here and we can have a listen to
a radio station and every speaker has
its own presets so you can you can if
you have three four speakers you will
have more than five presets but maybe
you see that the volume control although
it shows steps in between it always
jumps every ten steps below I will play
something else from my hard disk maybe
you will yeah this is also quite an
annoying every time you restart the app
it has to well reset itself or something
I don't know
and you see when I control the volume up
it only jumped every 10 steps
so in reality the zip and seed mini only
has 10 volume steps of course I can also
control independently from my iPad but
anyhow it's a bit annoying is either one
step is too low the other one is already
too loud but now let's try connecting
both this is pretty simple just drag one
at the other and they are connected what
we can do is control volume separately
for both but as you can see both still
play left and right so you have to go
inside here yeah it's a bit I don't know
like a labyrinth or something we can say
for the zip to play the right channel
while the seed mini
should play the left one so and now if
we control if we control volume for both
both are becoming louder or softer
but of course I can I can make this one
software
still they are a bit in an imbalance
volume-wise one becomes always quicker
in this case both are different speakers
but I think if you have to tip Mini or
Tootsie this should be okay this case
it's always a bit either the one is
louder or the other one is softer
and linking them is also pretty easy but
there is one problem if I unlink them
immediately from here with one playing
the left the other one directional the
seed mini will continue playing the left
channel well to prove this I will start
the typical song from Pink Floyd and
let's have a listen
yeah half is missing so the problem is
you have to make it you have to make
them again and make the seed mini play
left and right again this is really now
it's playing finally place the whole
signal yeah I'm not quite satisfied with
VF sometimes it doesn't quite work or it
shows your stuff that's simply not
present this is a new song let's get
sure that really both play left and
right yeah they do this one and the seed
mini also
yeah both play for them so let's and
unlink them again sorry this is a bit
confusing to unlink them you simply drag
it like that you can also manually link
them with the button also here are some
presets the the radio button presets are
available through the heart here if I
press it a radio station song should
start yeah
or another one okay I'm switching
between different stations next I would
like to show you how both speakers
compare sound wise I prepared four
different tracks and acoustic jazz track
a new soul track from soul persona a
rock track and a house track we will use
the same tracks to compare the seep mini
to the revised and the big zip to their
footwork cell I'm starting with the zip
mini first so let's have a listen
now what you maybe notice is that the
treble of the big tip
sounds a bit strange it seems a bit
subdued not as clear as that from the
tip Minnie
of course both because have 360 degree
sound which really works well much
better than that what ultimate es is
trying to sell your as 360 degree with
simple to drivers facing the sides but
this really works well here there are
some sweet spots but it's still pretty
nice I think again the big tip yet what
I don't like is that the treble is
simply a little bit yeah too soft not as
clear as I would have liked it over
despite being a mono speaker
I think the tip mini sounds broader and
more open than the big tip which is a
stereo speaker but well you don't get
any kind of stereo separation again big
tip
let's try another trick
you can maybe hear that that bass is
fuller deeper slightly deeper from the
big tip but overall I prefer the sound
of the tip meaning it's much you're a
much more open yeah it sounds a bit
muffled what we can fry is changing the
sound settings of the big tip as it
starts again every time he looks for the
Sun spaces here this
let's try another voicing is he
listening but the difference is
rock the house boost trade levitate
let's try the room settings as well for
example through our should usually post
travel more but is still too soft
I will switch again for this evening
let's try again and up okay Rock Creek
I will increase volume for maximum on
both
this was the wrong side so this is XML
of its agreement
separately slightly louder
but both are not very large
let's try the prospect maximum volume
photo nice thing is that both do not
destroyed at all even at maximum volume
more compression but they are not very
loud
you can hear that the base of their big
tip reaches deter is more powerful
you know
now let's try the same with the lab
returns ik mini and the reverse
yeah it sounds deputy Kira
we can try turning on surround on the
revise this broadens up this sound more
you
let's try sulpice on again
now there it is
the table so treat me like a bitch stop
no one can
and maybe without surround me it was a
destiny Lions great home us to be under
we go I speak to me
let's try the rock trick
and I will start increasing volume to
maximum again
by the house track still put on from a
leprechaun's it mini everybody's it
starts reducing base slightly but still
no distortion and just wish but Cellini
manages more basics
yes start sunning a little bit lost in
the against exceed minimum it's a small
speaker so last but not least the big
LIBOR tones if against the fool Excel
both are 360 degrees speakers by the way
let's start again with the jazz track
yeah I think you can hear that the full
Excel still sounds more open with a
broader soundstage
this son somehow boxy trapped inside the
speaker
let's try the track from soul persona
we are better mates the basis I think
even deeper and not as boosted another
table me
yeah the mall it has some box character
me wondering what to do to me let's try
the rock trick
and I will stop increasing volume for
maximum
you
you
never forward cell is definitely
daughter
try the house
nothing some porridge
yeah I hope this video was helpful I
definitely prefer the laboratory mini
over the lab returned zip although The
Fool Excel sounds definitely better than
both of them
I think the Riva s despite being well
quite a bit smaller can compete pretty
well with the small mini but the zip
mini R is I think quite a bit better
still a mono speaker so you would need
to for real stereo yeah thanks for
watching and we will see us in the next
video have a nice time and bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
