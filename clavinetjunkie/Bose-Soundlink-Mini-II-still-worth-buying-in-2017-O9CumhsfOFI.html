figure out if it's still worth buying
that both something we need to in 2017
worldwide this is still one of the most
popular and best sold Bluetooth speaker
UNIX errors but now even both came up
with a new model or a successor the
sounding revolve which I personally
liked much more because of the 360
degree or a directional sound also
better and more rugged build quality but
it's not that great for critical
listening or if you really want to sit
directly in front of the speaker the
sonic mean might be better but now there
are many other speakers much cheaper
ones this sounds better but before
taking a look at these some history
first when the Bose Soundlink me the
first version was released on years ago
this was some kind of revolution this
was really the first because it was able
to produce some big full-bodied sound
that many others or all others were not
able for example the gem box was popular
back then the beats pill they claimed
big bass heavy bass but in reality they
both on the very first which really
opportunities this heavy sound
especially at low levels all the others
have skinny created sounds and it was
unique back then so it was the only one
and there was no real alternative but it
was not without flaws when I bought it I
went to the Bose store the very first
day they released it
I played too young to die from
Jamiroquai and I already could hear that
there is something wrong with the bass
it was there was some distortion the
bass sounded uncontrolled also treble
was a little bit yeah muffled still I
bought it immediately because it was so
impressive I came back from the store
wow I've never heard a speaker so small
producing such a big amount of bass of
course I knew that there were many
traits to achieve this I had the Howard
opposed computer music monitors at home
one of them is not much larger than
something mini maybe even smaller still
sounds better it would be a mono speaker
but it's constantly better more
controlled bass nice a treble my hope
was always that both would release
something like a portable
in music motor that was one version for
the Japanese market with which took
batteries but this reduced volume and
they didn't really last long so they're
still the Bose Soundlink mini was quite
unique and great but it was never
perfect then those two years later they
released the solving clinical which
really didn't improve much on the sound
so they just added USB charging some
voice prompt nice bluetooth pairing
features and so on but the sound didn't
change a lot they just reduced based
lightly but the trebles feel was muffled
about 10 kilos is hardly anything and
too much intimate relations on at during
the time the other companies simply
caught up they they tried to copy this
design and offered better results for
exactly the gen heavy metal or the
cyclonic getting reuler are all blatant
copies of the Soundlink mini but with
better results they sometimes we better
have better treble I'm not sure why both
never took another look at this and and
to achieve a better sound also the
Kenton music excess is more or less
based on the boss but with better
results with better treble so now
looking at the Soundlink mini - now it's
a little bit disappointing and i thought
we'll compare it against three speakers
that i prepare a very cheap from the ice
sound bar this is the SL thousand or the
older of model there is a new one
I think kr thousand which I also have
but it's going to be improved in reality
it works there is some distortion with
base which there SL thousand doesn't
have the most impressive thing is this
3d mode which is included with some some
next audio algorithm which opens the
stereo feels quite a lot and also bases
deep but not as boosted as with the Bose
so it's because as you can get for $40
especially for lower levels delivers
much better results than they both sound
with mini if you really want to listen
directly from front
unlike the summative off which sounds
the same regardless from where you
listen then here I have the anchor sound
caboose and you release currently $80 so
less than half the price of the boat
most perfect but with this base top
feature you really get this full-bodied
sound of the Bose at low levels at
mid-level is there is some slight
distortion with bass top so it's better
to maybe turn it off but it's also a
louder without the strange compression
which kicks in on the both at higher
levels you can hear it rather and there
is some volume ramping also much better
battery life is also more rugged
physically so I think that the anchor is
also a better alternative and last but
not least the henwood 8's bt 77 this is
a Japan release only Japan or in Japan
but there are some Chinese versions that
you can get on the Chinese local market
for around thirty forty dollars I'm not
sure if they are really completely equal
they look exactly the same they have a
different brand a friend of mine is
trying to get hold of such as because in
order to really be able to compare them
but still you can get one of these also
similar ones on the canadian amazon
score for around $120 settings and also
much better alternative than they both
this has a completely - like flex tuning
also an edit surround mode similar to
the them I found by here but with better
results it also kicks up well it holds
up well at high levels so even as
maximum still sounds normal
unlike the power switch just does really
strange stuff so I thought will compare
the bowls against these three doesn't
really make sense to compare it against
any other speaker like a one from Dino
dilution which is much better or the
Riva S which is also better so I really
want to concentrate on these three years
simply to show you that there are better
alternatives and it's not really worth
spending $180 for a speaker like that
which has so many flaws and doesn't
really sound that great so it's always
only of course using a head cam to offer
you a first-person view also my general
microphone and you should of course
listen with headphones this leather the
headphones are tuned the better I use
the Sennheiser HD 600 as reference so
with these you will get the most
realistic impression so please put your
headphones up and let's check them out
first let's compare the bosonic me to
against the chip a sound bar
displaying with its 3d mode which is I
think the most impressive one I will
start with the boson Tecna - and the
trek from supersonic princess feature
laughing
Oh
her phone
oh yeah also its lower levels and you
get this incredible sound stage with the
high sound bar here
now let's compare the sonic me to
against the Incas on caboose switches
around half the price the entice playing
with its base up mode and the boss will
begin first competitive ear be six seven
eight zero eight emphasis which tries to
simulate some clarity the Inca is a much
meta tuning without result which pays up
some other phone something could be
there
it won't get me
the song
and let's write how they perform at
higher levels is the suppose increasing
volume to maximum maximum now
the ink as well mix them
and quite quite obviously proposed from
restraint is not much louder but it
keeps all dynamics and while they both
compress this LS anyway and last but not
least the Kenwood PT 77 this is not me
anymore
in fact it's older than the sonic me too
and was released one year after the
first version of the balsamic meaning
they can would explain with its 3d or
surround mode and the boss will be
playing for so let's have a listen
you
don't turn off this the remote is
aspirational I think the project
equipped to do
the song
you can already hear lots of distortion
coming from the boss here the camera
what a song
another thing we never change I love my
girl goes to me again
and let's check them to higher level so
this is collectibles
increasing volume to maximum maximum
babies French
it is toxic appropriate right
I think or I hope you could hear that
they're both really struggled with some
tracks there was some strange distortion
you could hear some interrelation bass
bleed him into the treble so most of
them simply outperformed it the ice
sound bar doesn't have this boosted bass
so it sounded maybe a bit flatter also
more pronounced with treble but still I
really love this 3d a mode which gives
you the effect of listening to to
difference because a much more open
sound and they both which simply sounds
a little bit muffled and undefined also
the anchor is better it still would be
better without discover or grill
I hope anchor will have a second look at
it and maybe boost treble slightly but
it could maybe hear that that anchor had
a letter response were headed boss as
the strange presence boost at five six
seven kilowatts which adds the squishy
sound so it doesn't really sound that
great they try to simulate some some
clarity thanks to this boost but any
real upper treble is simply missing and
I think there can would completely
outperform the Bose and it's maybe one
that is not a real copy of the boss it's
a two-point one system and it came
shortly it was released shortly after
their first bose soundlink mini so I
don't think they tried to copy the post
like many others did but they went for
something completely different
also didn't try to go with this very
basic sound but much more I find also
add this 3d mode I'm not sure it's not a
next organ fact it's something from
Yamaha and maybe I will get some more
info when I when I get the Chinese
version
unfortunetely it's only available on the
Chinese market so it's not exported but
I had some talk to the two main bank
good context maybe they will try to sell
it through banggood and then you will
have the option to buy it abroad as well
still I think the Kenwood or the
look-alikes copies if they are really
perform the same is a great deal and
much better than the both battery life
is
all that great but you can also use it
as PC audio speaker so simply place it
in front of or below your display with
this edit 3d mode you have the
impression as if you were listening to
two separate speakers while still having
something portable with great sound so
just to conclude I don't think it's
really worth spending under $80 for the
song ignatow today it was great four
years ago when it was released the first
time it was a revolution I really loved
it but when I started to listen more
critically I heard distortion with every
second track it couldn't handle any any
bass drum the book did some really
strange stuff they improved it a little
bit understanding me too on the
Soundlink meaning of the first one it
was unbearable but it's still very very
subpar so the anchor offers you a much
better performance and many others
because as well which I cannot
presenters I don't own them anymore but
for example the taotronics boom eggs it
cost I think 32 dollars and still sounds
better than the boss while trying to
imitate the boss so there are a lot of
alternatives and the speaker's become
better and better
while both and not sure if they will
release a sonic mini 3 I personally
really like the southern quiz off and
seats really doesn't make how you place
it I had it in my scooter like this
upside down and it sounded great
regardless if it's played if it's placed
in the center of a room outwards and it
placed nicely control and nicely
controlled something that sounds like
you need to cannot so it does just hope
that both will release some success or
some real successor the sounding minute
read maybe with a comparable sound to
the computer music mojitos which sound
really great I love them
also none of these strange distortion
issues or the strange droning bass
effect I don't know so I personally my
opinion is that it's not worth buying it
there are many better speakers and new
are coming out every day so let's see
what's coming up next
I hope this could give you some idea and
a nice Oh Rhonda is definitely the
anchor below hundred dollars but maybe
anchor will even tweak it for an even
better sound so let's see I'm awaiting a
response from them the only thing it
would need is a little bit retooling of
base up it becomes too uncontrolled at
mid levels and maybe a slight level
boost then it would be really killer
great battery life also loud enough way
louder than the bows and without strange
compression issues or something so
overall I would probably take the the
anchor sound code boosters your world
winner I even like it more than the JBL
flip for which is very very hard sound
and loses bass at maximum it's louder
than the anchor but actually this
battery is worse and at low levels it
doesn't give you this full but it
sounded to get when you enable bass up
here yeah thanks for watching I hope you
liked it anyhow and not trying to bash
both but I think you think the hype is
outdated
it doesn't need any help anymore is
there are so many alternatives now but
back then I remember four years ago it
was so laughable comparing the Bose to
the gem box it costed the same it cost
$200 the gem box was released the same
price from the boat it sounded like a
complete array here like a disaster and
they look any big bass jam box the name
alone it says it all
the bows were the first ones who showed
what is possible with some clever DSP
processing some clever tricks the
drivers are not great they try it or
they they they claim that they they
their drivers push twice the air of
normal drivers they have some strange
dual membrane I'm not sure what's for
because they are pretty crappy the
anchor is very normal drivers and sound
better with better travel dispersion and
better 12 / so the boat is really dated
now and should need some some we tweaked
or I don't know I definitely prefer the
revolves but for normal listening let's
say sitting directly in front of the
speaker which
of course also good question for a
portable unit that you place somewhere
walk around still I was probably get the
anchor the Kenwood is only ready Japan
so far but maybe we'll find the Chinese
versions the cheap ones $40 and if you
really get this performance for $40 this
will be incredible
I hope they mean I cannot say if it's
really the same speaker it looks exactly
the same the same features the same
Yamaha processing but maybe they use
some cheaper drivers I don't know yeah
so now I'm finished again thanks a lot
for watching and see you in the next
video I hope I didn't bore you too much
this time but some interesting stuff is
coming up next so stay tuned and bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
