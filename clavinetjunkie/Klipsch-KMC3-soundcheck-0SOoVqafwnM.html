you something for all those who always
complain that their speakers are not
powerful or loud enough here you have
the clip KMC three many maybe already
notice km c stands for clips music
centers so in reality it has a double
name and it's called clips clips music
Center 3 I also have the real turbo X
here it's one of the best well smaller
portable speakers but the clip makes all
of those sound more or less like toys
it's really powerful the only problem is
that it has to be powered by eight huge
D cell batteries and the batteries can
only deliver 12 volts while the AC
supply delivers 18 volts so it is not as
powerful from batteries as from mains
but what maybe many don't know you can
also power it with an external power
bank this is the XT power and has
switchable voltage between 12 and 20
volts and you can switch it for 16 volts
so it simulates an external power supply
and sub supply and the clip will play
louder and more powerful
I thought we will have a short listen
here in my garden how both sound
I cannot crack them to the maximum
otherwise my neighbor who will come over
and hit me but later we will go to the
forest and crank them to the maximum
also to hear the difference how loud it
sounds from batteries and how loud it
will sound from the power bank so I will
put up my my head cam and my binaural
microphones and we will have a short
lesson ok so please pull up your
headphones and I will start playing a
track from sole persona starting with
the clips and then switch over to the
leader turbo ex
descry something else
okay now let's go to the forest okay I
set them up here then walk back ten
meters and we will have a listen how
both comparator mixing volume with the
clips playing from batteries first so
let's have a listen okay I'm starting
with the clips first
people come people go now I'll attach
the power bank which is set to 16 volts
and then I will do some switching so
that you can hear the difference in over
loudness between power bank and when the
Klipsch is playing from batteries
you're not
that you play
your life you know
the
okay guys I think it was pretty obvious
that the clips played quite a bit louder
from the Powerbank I think it's also
more convenient to use a power bank
instead of having to put in batteries
all the time there was a bit more
distortion but I think nevertheless it's
quite a powerful great speaker the river
turbo acts despite being one of the
loudest in its size Specter has no
chance against the bigger clip I hope
you liked the video I hope it was
helpful
stay tuned for more have a nice time bye
bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
