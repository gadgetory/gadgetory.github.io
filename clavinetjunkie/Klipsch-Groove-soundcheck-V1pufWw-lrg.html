I thought we should check out the new
clips groove today the clips groove is
the first of a new line of portable
speakers from clips and really curious
to see the other ones and it's pretty
interesting so far it's only available
in the US so I bought it from there I
haven't found it in any shop in Europe
yet but I think it's a really decent
speaker the only problem is it's mono it
seems clips took the KMC one cut it in
half and yeah the result is the clip
groove it resembles sound wise more of a
PMC one then the clips gig but the
difference of the clips groove is that
it applies some kind of loudness
compensation for low levels if we have a
look at the frequency response you can
see that it measures really flat this is
typical for clips with some slight bass
emphasis at 200 Hertz and if looking at
the KMC one in green here you see that
both are really similar at the meats and
bases well nearly equal just the highest
sound a bit different but as already
mentioned the clips groove applies
loudness compensation which you can see
here so if you turn volume lower you get
a more full-bodied sound the clip KMC
one didn't do this and sounded quite a
bit
teeny at low levels I thought we should
check it out how it sounds as always I'm
using my binaural microphones and the
head cam so that you get a kind of
first-person the person impression let's
turn it on here these are the new
hardrock tones from clips but thank
goodness you can disable them simply
press aux button for about four seconds
and the tones will be gone yeah
now and just to demonstrate you the
loudness
compensation I thought I'll play a track
from soul persona this is original from
coolant again and you can hear it
already sounds nicely full-bodied at low
levels I will increase volume
you
and reduce it again and you never get a
teeny salt maybe at low levels it could
get along with a bit more treble but I
think it's pretty decent the only
problem it's a mono speaker and clip you
didn't include any wireless pairing with
another one this is a pity and well one
of the biggest flaws if someone really
wants stereo sound so you really only
get mono it's pretty loud and we will
test this out and I thought for
comparison we could use the calf Muir
it's also a mono speaker despite having
two drivers inside so the calf neo costs
more than twice but you will hear that
both sound pretty similar both are more
tuned for high five we will lay down
here the clip groove against the JBL
charge too and you will see that both
sound completely different but let's
first start with the with this tool and
have a listen to the clip groove first
okay I have to increase volume to
maximum so let it control it well from
my player
you hear that both have a very similar
sound cap always takes a little time to
reach the final loudness let's listen
for our track
and I will increase volume comics mumbo
this is
yeah I think it was obvious that the
cleave groove could even play louder
although the curfew is not a very soft
speaker but you could maybe already hear
that there was some slight distortion
creeping in during the last volume steps
with the clips groove now I thought we
should check it out against the JBL
charge - - yeah there three was already
announced but well it's not out yet
maybe the three will sound completely
different I don't know but the charge
tool is a kind of reference for this
size and price and you will hear that
both sound well quite a bit different
the clip has already mentioned is more
hi-fi and the JBL is rather tuned for a
smiley response with quite a bit of bass
and treble boost so let's have a listen
I'm starting again with the clip group
first and a kind of jazzy organ track
you my love I do most anything you sweet
baby I'll do most everything cuz I love
you and I hope you feel the same way my
momma Swift the ocean blue just by you
my blue I'll take Mary lovin sweet daddy
better huh I wouldn't be you
you gave me milk sorry something else
this is from resolution 88
this was the kV oh by the way it turned
off automatically with a home you
already hear some compression maybe we
should turn on maximum to hear the
difference in overall over loud nests
also sidewalks the JBL does probably
have a bit better dispersion
it's already struggling a bit I will
turn it for maximum JPL as well yeah no
chance
the table is much softer with much more
compression
let's try something again here this
becomes a bit ridiculous
I know I know someone mentioned some
other youtuber that the JBL in charge to
is louder but yeah I don't know
there is simply no difference between
the store the clips does not compress
maybe there is some slight distortion
already but the difference in loudness
is extreme it tries keeping all the bass
but you hear what it does with all the
rest becomes the kind of pumping effect
here you can leave you this time
distortion let's see what the GBO I will
reduce volume slightly so that we match
hole with mobile you're wrong
let's try aspects and lists somehow
there
Jamiel charge to renders the bass drum
and pear for the clip radially spanked
maximum the clip was reduced to match
them both more or less
I think you can hear the obvious dynamic
processing of the video I will turn the
clips again to maximum well this portion
is not going to be comedy I will go far
away let's try a rock track
there is this night and day difference
I will reduce the tips again
yeah I think the clips group is really
impressive I mean it's not a boomy
boosted a kind of speaker but I would
call it kind of mini high file system a
pity it's not stereo I mean you cannot
pair it with another one maybe the
hardware would even support it but clips
well didn't enhance anything this is the
biggest flaw and the other one I think
it plays really loud but you will get a
little bit of distortion not with all
tracks but with very heavy mixes you
will definitely hear distortion at
maximum level and slightly below reduce
it some notches you will be still louder
than the charge - or even the Bose
Soundlink mini I'm not even talking
about this assets you cannot quite
compare these two as we've already heard
the groove is rather comparable to to a
hi-fi speaker like the cave newer but
still I think it's better I mean it
costs less than half of course you can
pair the cave with another one but this
is rackety test I think IP X 5 or 4
rating you see it has it has a flap but
it's quite hard to open i I really
hardly managed to open this there is
nothing just yeah here you have there is
the USB micro or for charging am
auxilary and a small button which is
probably some kind of reset yeah
track controls play and pause and you
can also a double press or jump to the
next track with three a triple press
back yeah and nothing else volume
control is not synced between iPhone and
speaker but you can leave it at maximum
and control volume through for the
through the player yeah I think this
could give you a first idea about the
clips groove I think it's really decent
speaker for the price especially for one
who likes real true and more HiFi sound
not this boosted compressed stuff you
usually get from all other manufacturers
clips is a company who really take
sounds seriously they don't try adding
funky effects you'll get simply pure
sound if you like it or not this is well
it depends on you sure the JBL charge
too can sound better I mean I say better
but more true is the clips groove it
sounds like the original source why the
JBL adds bass adds treble and adds
compression if you turn it slightly
above half there is no compression at
all you really get the kick even at
maxim's sure with with a bit of bass
reduction but but yeah level as the
result is impressive I think it's a kind
of small KMC one so yeah I hope it was
helpful for you I thought we should go
out but it's very windy today and I
cannot do any recordings so maybe next
time we'll compare but you heard
wellness wise it's no different I mean
it's not not a comparison I tried the
clips groove against the river s as well
I mean the rivas costs much more and
sometimes I like the clips more
sometimes the river it makes them of
course the clips hadn't had an edge
because it wasn't a louder and outdoors
you could hear the sound much further
away so yeah I don't think a different
comparison against the real s makes much
sense as it's a different category of
speaker also get much more spacious
sound with the river s but maybe next
time if there is enough interest I will
try comparing it against the US as well
so again thanks a lot and we'll see us
probably yes soon in another video have
a nice time and bye bye
