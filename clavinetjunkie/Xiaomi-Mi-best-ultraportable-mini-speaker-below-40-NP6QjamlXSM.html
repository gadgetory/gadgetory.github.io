already know it I've mentioned it
several times now I've always been in
search of really small portables because
once that you can put inside a pocket
carry around with you all the time and
still get decent sound you know that
kind of thing like the JBL go here or
the JBL clip the I love odd mini or the
anchor sound core although this is not
that pocketable anymore but they are all
rather pretty crappy I mean the sound is
really teeny some can play loud but it's
the sound you get is still not really
satisfying then I found this on audio
transit access I mean it's better than
the others but still not really great
and maybe a bit too expensive thanks to
the sharp edges here it's not that
comfortable to carry around and finally
I found this Xiaomi me speaker this is a
Chinese brand this is the newest model
they already had I think two different
ones on the market I bought it from the
bangles store for 35 euros it was on
offer but you can still find it on
gearbest for $34 on Amazon com it will
be offered for $44 there is some other
marketplace dealer which offers it
currently for $44 so it's what I would
call low budget you can find it
definitely way below $50 and I think
it's yeah one of the best I mean when
looking at the design it maybe reminds
you and reminds me as well of the mini
jambox but this is how their mini jambox
should have been from the very beginning
I mean you don't get this strange wave
patterns or something this is really it
looks really exclusive also build
quality is great
but the sound is what counts and I think
this is where the shower Mimi beats all
the others we've already heard the Blitz
Wolff f1 and I was quite impressed by
the potential let's peek ahead but it
needed some additional equalizing
probably to really get decent sound out
of it this is where the meat comes in as
it exactly has DSP included which
adjusts the sound
to the actual volume level so at low
levels you get a nice full-bodied sound
quite comparable to a JBL flip 3 or
maybe even that then on via Mini at
higher levels its start reducing bass
but still quite satisfying and it's
pretty loud for the size so about as
loud as the Blitz Wolff f1 although at
maximum the blitz wolf still sounds a
little bit more punchy of course I
measured the me already and you can see
a measurement at high volume and you can
see it measures like a straight flat
line it's really impressive I mean the
treble doesn't extend that high but you
still get some nice bass hump at around
80 Hertz so when looking at all
available volume steps which are 16 you
can see that at low levels there is
indeed some nice bass boost and at high
levels the bass starts getting reduced
of course I would like to show you how
the sounds as always I will be wearing
my binaural microphones also a head cam
to give you a kind of first-person view
so please put your headphones up and
let's have a listen so let's have a look
at the speaker it comes in three or four
different colors this should be gold but
as you can see it's more a kind of
brownish tone so I think it looks really
decent and it has a really high quality
premium finish rather lacking from the
others even the packaging remains a
little bit of Apple so completely white
not that much inside justice carrying
bag but it's really nice that they
included this so you can protect the
speaker during transport the manual is
in Chinese only and there are also some
voice prompts which are Chinese as well
we will hear them now I will turn this
beak on so you hear the welcome tones
and if it connects she will tell me hey
Dre yeah um no idea what this means
probably paired you also have a battery
button this tells you the actual battery
status i'm delia bagajeeba TomTom Gionta
type it down
this means probably 100% full and as you
can see it also has micro SD playback so
this is really nice charging is done
through micro USB but no wire included
yeah the volume should be usually in
sync but when after turning it on the
volume rather jumps to a high level so
let's see what it does
yeah and as you can see when I change
volume on the speaker it changes on the
iPhone as well
this way they can of course t own the
DSP perfectly nice so that it really
gives you this full-bodied sound at low
levels as you can see we are rather low
now but it still sounds pretty
full-bodied at higher levels it will
start reducing bass but I think it
sounds really really nice we could
compare it of course against the JBL go
and highly rated speak although I was
never that impressed with it and many
people always complain that I don't play
any hip-hop so let's start with a kind
of hip-hop track again with the meek
first increase one in sideways which you
were surgery but for the bad cancer kiss
my girl on the cheek I see you later but
never run where the Detroit changes the
JB go it's already and things the
difference this morning I guess like you
provide the water lean I got a stopwatch
one o'clock it was fine ago by you O
Muhammad where to go back no better if
to walk with the window walks the sun's
rays
it's a completely other sound much
fuller and much mo Mitra let's listen to
another track again with Demi first did
you go okay sounds a bit ridiculous
let's turn volume down slightly I'm
below half now we will do this with the
go as well to hear how they compare at
low levels yeah and you hear you get
this nice full-bodied sound especially
at low levels when you don't need
highest volume in an office or yeah it's
background music this gives you this
full sound that most other small
speakers are simply lacking again go you
only hear treble it sounds like a
Twitter we could of course also try
maximum on both at higher levels the me
starts may be struggling slightly with
really bass heavy recordings so I will
increase volume to maximum now
you hear some slides poshness let's try
the go on Maximus where we have this
maximum it still sounds louder and
fuller let's try the anchor sound corner
it's larger social to peck definitely
more punch than the JBL go and I will
start again with the me and a rock track
you can hear the volume pump in here
also here much fuller sound
let's reduce volume slightly and this
becomes pretty teeny while the new shot
still sounds pretty full-bodied
he also becomes more of the Twitter so
let's try now track and I will increase
volume again on their anchor as well
let's try maximum again so any person
willing to make someone like me on the
Sun press home
I think you can hear that the anchor is
slightly louder and it manages to get an
equally full but it sounded maximum this
is yeah there is simply no DSP
processing no equalizing nothing inside
so at maximum they equalize a one to
each other maybe let's check out the TDK
a 25 the TDK can be sometimes already
found for around $25 so even cheaper and
definitely one of the best low budgets
because but as you can see it's quite a
bit bigger and heavier so not as
pocketable as they me let's have a
listen if the me can compete here and I
will start again with the me and the
smooth jazz track
to decay
he has the meet slightly subdued
day
although you can hear the knees slightly
starting really a kind of first
intermodulation probably because their
DSP is pushing the driver so much
Hey
and I think it sounds anyhow better
especially if I reduce volume again
the GDK doesn't add anything so let's
listen to both no I think it sounds a
bit more mature
so let's increase volume again and maybe
another rock okay have to increase
volume is likely the meats are so soft
here with a few software although
you can hear their high heads already
scratch
let's try maybe a dance track and let's
try both at maximum again I will
increase modern this is maximum on the
knee the TDK as well it should remains
rather punchy but doesn't get that much
louder yeah there is more punch more
bass but it's not really that loud the
knee starts reducing bass at higher
levels as we've seen from the
measurements so maybe let's try if there
is still some potential and let's check
out the blitz wolf f1 I think this one
sounds a little bit well more maybe more
full-bodied at Mack mixing volume it
should connect first but the treble is
not there the treble is much weaker on
the little f1 so now we have it we have
it here and let's start with another
track and again with the me first so we
can hear how they compare at normal
levels
you can hear this sounds more like a
family or something but with very basic
recordings their knee sometimes gets
this harsh sound I think this is a first
internalization issue you can give this
this missing Frederick's missing bass
just made i'm increase volume already
here it's likely that little fat low
field sounds cooler
so let's try this to at maximum and
increasing volume again
the beautiful force well
and maybe another track all coupling at
Exim um you can give a sound similar
although the Blitz will appear a bit
cleaner maybe maybe the intimidation
comes because of more treble boost on
the meek but I have the impression is is
that this wall was able to weaken even
slightly more based on actions I mean
the meat is definitely not perfect but
among all those small pocketable
speakers I've heard so far the best and
most satisfying one until now of course
your expectations have to be realistic
this is not some party speaker but
rather meant for personal listening when
you're on the go in a hotel or something
and I think it does the trick at low
levels
it sounds really mature and nicely
balanced much better than all of these
of course the TDK is bigger so not
really pocketable like that one but I
think at low levels this one performs
even better it gives you a better
mid-range the treble is slightly thin on
the on the TDK so for $35 if you can get
it or if you wait until amazon gets it
in stock for 50 even for 53 $54 it's
still worth it if you compare it with
the mini jambox which currently costs
around the same maybe even slightly more
at the gem box the medium box is a joke
against this it cannot compete loudness
wise not even regarding sound yeah and
it doesn't have these nice features like
SD card playback so the me is really
really promising they are on to
something
maybe upcoming models will become even
better I love that they keep this format
so small you can really put it into any
trousers pocket without problems it
looks great it sounds great it feels
great I mean what's not like about the
speaker sure there are some problems at
higher levels the DSP maybe over the
it slightly pushes bass too much but I
mean this is I think this is the third
or fourth generation or who knows what
they will come up with with the fifth
generation I really like it and I
recommend it to anyone who was always
looking for some really really small
tiny speaker which still pumps out some
serious Sun so the me is the only one
I've really found so far that can
satisfy my personal needs it's not a
bass heavy speaker but we've seen the
frequency response was really really
imbalanced and natural no boosts nothing
some slight hump at 80 Hertz which comes
probably from the passive radiator which
is maybe tuned for 80 Hertz so yeah it
gets my high highest recommendation I
can give especially for the price if you
get it for $35 you won't find anything
better in this size I hope you enjoyed
this video I hope it was helpful I hope
it could give you an idea about the me
speaker it's not that easy to judge from
from a recording but I can ensure you
this is one of the best currently so
thanks a lot for watching and we will
see you soon in the next video have a
nice time and bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
