little bit about my maybe cheapest in
the headphones that I currently own
which I also rediscovered just now and
doing all the other in reviews recently
of course I'm not talking about this
edit crap that you usually get with any
new smartphone I throw this away
immediately
but this seal is the case that ATR so
definitely not unknown you can get them
below ten dollars or Euros so definitely
lowest budget
therefore how great or how bad can they
be for this price maybe some story
behind it first a friend of mine mark
from mini clang guna suggested them to
me only one year ago yeah this is Jesse
yeah you may be noticed I wear my been
on of microphones not because I wanted
to give you some binaural effect or
something but my normal microphone yeah
it has some bad connection here yeah all
microphones I bought from some
professionals in the u.s. ending
shipping costs and Texas also this one
you can see I tried soldiering it
already three times it lost connection
again how it's great so I'm using this
and you you will hear every voice
surrounding me so you can hear the the
aquarium or how do you have a fish tank
you can hear Jesse behind me yeah she's
not feeling well maybe you remember the
story from Christmas she nearly died and
yeah she has this hot car or not not
sure how to call it but back to the ATR
here in mock from unique language check
out his youtube channel also his side
but he does it in German still he
reviews lots of Indians headphones or
some more high-end stuff and about one
year ago he told me that they are really
great for this price I think I paid nine
euros meanwhile you can get them for
sexy girl sex for six euros yes sex also
no and when I tried them on they arrived
from China I think one month later I
thought what is he talking about I mean
yeah okay but still you have to consider
the price and I somehow forget about
them
I left them somewhere and yesterday
found them again tried them on again and
after having heard all this other crap
from some magic meze and so I Sami
thought yeah and not
than men actually but treble was somehow
lacking and I tried other tips and here
the 10 Marco tell maker comes in also
one from China suggested to me by
another friend he heard a model from
again another friend and was quite
impressed so he ordered one also told me
to order one because it's really great
for this price I think they cost 125
dollars from any Express and then when
he's arrived he said yeah based on
different it's not the one his friend
head it is some sure copy obviously
maybe I don't know but it sounds really
bad but finally the tips supplied are
quite usable I already used these tips
for my IVA prodigy one mod because they
have quite a big hole here so they can
accommodate even some paper I'm not sure
if you can see this and they also color
the sound slightly especially treble so
not you can hear cars passing by I hope
it's not too distracting but you get
maybe also if you live smooth headphones
you get a realistic impression of this
room ambience and so on there will be a
tractor spacing by really horrible
annoying but yeah what can you do so
what these tips and Li yeah they became
better still not far from perfect but
really balanced sounding there is some
slight resonance also upper tribal is
missing but they can be brought to some
really high level with very simple
equalizing just take away you hear our
neighbors our neighborhood just reduce 5
kilohertz with some not by 6 maybe 7 DB
and boost
treble starting from above 3 4 key words
and they will be fine they sound much
better than these 10 map here also
better than this this sound magic music
and I contacted mark again a look I
rediscovered your ears that I somehow
didn't like at the very beginning and he
also didn't listen but
he claims them to be to basale yeah mine
are not they are really flat I'm not
sure maybe there is so much sample
variation like with this 10 mark here
how can it be that friend of my friend
has a really great sounding one while we
have a pretty crappy one they sound it
sounds really bad although there are
reviews raving about it 10 make pro I
think it's the name the only thing I
already wanted to throw it away the only
thing I used are the tip so I'm using
them for this year really improves the
sound a bit and the nice thing is that
they are usable now so the sound is not
cut in any way like with the meze or
with the Sony horrible its current
coherent this is the right way and this
is why I enjoy them although not perfect
for 6 euros and they are really great I
thought I would like to have you I'll
let you have a listen also comparing
them to the 10 Mac's here which close
the end three four times as much over
gear you have to remember not sure if
all of them sound like this I just
ordered another pair just for fun from
the same dealer because it's offered by
many different ones so maybe one dealer
is from another factory with more bass
but these are really balanced with some
slight equalizing they sound really like
like studio monitors tent
yeah I'm pretty impressed let's say so
the although he being claimed to be it's
also written here somewhere 80 altra
bass well no there is no a trapeze the
bassist really is really nicely flat we
have got back to the some samples
yeah I was trying a lot with this minute
ESP ear system but I'm not satisfied it
doesn't give me consistent results and
this is what I wanted to offer you
I could equalize each of them but when I
really let's say 200 in years I would
have a process to equalize it to bring
it really as close to reality it takes
hours and then I'm still not satisfied
so what I did is
do a basic calibration or let's say
Equalization the calibration fact
recording with the calibration file
provided here it sounds it just way to
train having everything so I try to
bring it a little bit closer to reality
and make a kind of general tuning for
all of them the problem with this use is
that when I equalize the sound for one
particular model that's a half flat
sounding one to bring it as close to it
as possible and then I record another
one with exactly the same settings the
other one will sound off just because
yeah the ears here is just a very short
you can know maybe two centimeters long
it doesn't react as the human ear so
every in measures differently compared
to a standardized system from crass or
brilliant Kier and so on
so just for fooling around but I wanted
to offer you better quality so something
more than this and therefore I will
probably send it back maybe I will do
another video demonstrating you how it
recorded maybe ten or something
different in ears with this general
tuning let's call it calibration so that
you can get a get an idea how all these
compared sunrise they all have exactly
the same settings unlike with my
previous videos I try to bring them
closer to reality but if I have to do
this for everyone
it becomes yeah I mean so it's a lot I
live here in the Vienna forest but it's
loud as hell it's louder than if if if I
was living in Vienna so I will maybe
make another video just recording
showing recordings of some in yes and if
anything is it it accelerates so when I
when I'm in here has some particular
boosted frequency this comes even more
too so maybe it's good to compare
differences although don't take it as a
and is an absolute sound so it's not how
they sound in reality but you will
hopefully hear the difference the
relative difference quite well so yeah I
will start again with the original track
from so personam princess freesia from
the fastforward album and I will play
the case at 80 our first then I will
switch over to the 10 marks back and
forth and you can hopefully hear
yeah how both compare and how crappy the
10 marks sound against this and later on
we'll maybe try to equalize them all so
slightly so
you gotta believe me baby I want you
thinking about you
today
you could maybe hear that they sound
definitely way better than their 10
marks maybe also try to equalize to take
away the strange present harshness so I
will play again the same track without
Equalization
so you can hear with EQ they become
really usable they already now in
reality with the ears yeah they
exaggerate all frequencies a little bit
so it will be quite funny to hear the
other ones so when I try to record the
case at ts6 haha with this strange
treble boost why it sounds really
horrible why other ones you will hear
sound really great so yeah when looking
at some measurements you can see that
yeah the wrist is 5 6 kilo Hertz boost
apart from that the bass is really
balanced and overlaying the 10 max here
I will again make an average for left
and right for both you can see that that
10 makes somehow like this treble apart
from that yeah also in that presence
region there is not that much so these
are really usable with some slight
equalization for 6 euros I mean way
better than then the Sony which I had
for 50 euros or that ms e mezzo mezz neo
11 so quite impressive a pity yet it
could be definitely improved with some
stretching they have some whistling if
you put them in me there actually if you
can see it there is some this is the
left or this is the right one so they
are really one like like real
professional custom monitors you have to
read this I don't want to put it aside
maybe because I will touch the
microphone but you RepRap it around your
ear here and then they are quite small
so fit really nicely but if you move
them around to get maybe a better feed
you will hear that there are some ways
so this noodle here is there is some
resonance
I think they could have been improved
but still for this price is really
outstanding
they didn't even come with any packaging
just some bubble envelope and and
additional tips and the tips are no yeah
I have some tips but I didn't use them
the tips on the 10 bucks 10 max are
really great so just wanted to show you
the case that 80 are definitely not an
ultra bass master really balanced sound
which surprised me a lot and just need
some slight work on travel and much
better than many others does this sound
magic attend with what high-five Awards
any combo whoa what do you I bought some
creepy junk this date funny thing is
that they don't cut out the sound that
much I mean this year and just have this
strange whistling peak a person that
really nice awesome
they seem quite sturdy cable is in a bit
a bit tall I don't know too rubbery so
it's you can see it tends total to
remain in some particular form but this
so disappointed just like my friend he
got him we were expecting so much after
he heard this a unit from his friend and
I think he still uses it for drumming
monitoring as you only need to hear bass
they're quite bass headed so yeah I hope
I didn't bore you too much check them
out for 6 euros on Amazon I think it's
around 1011 dollars but I think you can
even find them for cheaper so next time
maybe I will try again to use my my
clip-on microphone the problem is I
already lost many many recordings
because I thought I'm recording and the
connector he had a bad bad connection
the plug and I was not recording
anything just noise so this time I
wanted to get true to record everything
also outside and Jessie coughing Jessie
I hear some hum all the time from cars
of tractors passing by so hard
especially when I try when I try to do
recall it from a database so I have to
stop and restart again so to record a
speaker a single one from maximum volume
and normal volume including editing and
everything if everything goes right
maybe half an hour if not one hour one
and a half for one single speaker so
imagine if I have to record one speaker
with two or three settings and another
one so twist because it's a whole day of
recording stupid there4s I don't get any
income with the database and if you like
it then you can of course support me
with some donation yeah but I will talk
about years and recordings of headphones
more in my next video so stay tuned if
you're interested if not yet wait until
another one comes with maybe again some
speaker have a nice time thanks for
watching and see you then bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
