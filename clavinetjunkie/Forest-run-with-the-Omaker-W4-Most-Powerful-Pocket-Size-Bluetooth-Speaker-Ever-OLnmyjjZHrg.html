running time during the last years I
became so fat that it's not funny
anymore but running without music is not
funny either and running with headphones
or earphones with all the sweat is not
quite enjoyable but I got this Omega w-4
recently they claim it to be the most
powerful pocket-sized speaker ever with
3 watts of power I thought we'll check
it out I will fix it to my belt i will
use some binaural microphones and the
head cam so please put up your
headphones let's start some music and
let's get started so it's dangling on my
belly now volume is around half let's
increase it likely yeah now we are
around 34 pretty loud but let's increase
one mid morn this maximum mouth
cannot hear any distortion so even at
maximum it's quite usable the others
probably pop and crazy yeah it's pretty
loud it's definitely annoying for the
others if they don't like this music
let's try now
I will reduce volume again otherwise the
people will get pissed off Ravi I think
it's really long I may not flip three
level what quite ok i will turn it even
lower
lots of people today it's Monday so
either they're all on holiday or without
work so let's pump up volume again
slightly okay time for a short break my
microphones are getting loose yeah here
we have the homemaker yeah I think it's
a nice speaker also loud enough for
running as we've heard although sound
wise I'm not that impressed you know you
still get the skinny sound you usually
get from most other twenty thirty
dollars because and you can see the
carabiner broke immediately so not quite
usable anymore but we'll of course do
another sound check indoors against some
other speakers under more controlled
conditions so stay tuned for more but I
still have to do some further miles to
get rid of my belly so have a nice time
and bye bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
