says FIFA and maybe you already know
what is inside here this is the FIFA
Copenhagen and I thought we'll do a
short and quick unboxing we've just
heard the FIFA Helsinki and for me it's
definitely the best sounding portable
speak I heard the Copenhagen is the
bigger brother of the Helsinki which
will probably sound even better I
expected a little something larger this
is still quite compact the box for the
total boom star itself was really large
I thought I got some some furniture but
this is really well not much bigger than
the box of there I don't know Jenna's
dream 17 side Scandinavian sound since
1933 the a FIFA is not an unknown
company although it's still a bit
unknown for the mess but everyone will
know something about HiFi sound noise
FIFA they have been building speaker
drivers one of the best drivers
definitely yeah and they have an own
product line now of speakers the
Helsinki which you can see over there
this is the Copenhagen and they also
have a kind of sound bar like a long
speaker the Stockholm but this is the
medium model there
the Copenhagen so let's have a look
inside
nicely wrapped into some into some sack
or something
Copenhagen let's unwrap this yeah it's
on that packaging it was gray but inside
is more a kind of blue it's a little bit
different colors let's have a look again
I think this black one or looks pretty
cool although we have red grey yellow so
this one is the blue model what we have
here a power switch some connect button
it needs an own power cable maybe we can
try turning it on not sure if it will
work or if it need some charge obviously
it will need some charge so let's take
out there are cables it's a portable
speaker here with battery built-in okay
what the cable is unusable for me I need
this is an optical cable it has also an
optical input this is the auxiliary and
well this is British maybe yeah
but we are in Austria here so we need
another cable and let's try finding some
block here you know I can turn it on
let's see how I can try if this is the
Bluetooth connect button or something
let's see if I connect if I can connect
from my iPhone already something is
blinking at the front yeah it's here and
I thought we will do a short listen I'm
not sure what to expect from the speaker
but well now after having heard the
Helsinki
I think the Copenhagen will sound even
better I also set up my Philips sounds
via speaker that I'm not using that
often anymore there also they cost
around five six hundred euros so quite
comparable so maybe we can listen to
these two
obviously the volume is not in sync so I
have to turn up from here first
The Sands view
Copenhagen again very clear sound
sounds fear again they give a bit of a
muddy impression although they also
sound pretty clear usually but against
the Copenhagen let's try a track maybe
this is pretty punching sounds fear
again no where are they yeah this is
typical with AirPlay yeah this does not
always work this is the Copenhagen
let's try come on Ethel and
Copenhagen again for this
Anabella I look at the tires sounds for
you again let's hope they every some
vibration I think this is a cause of the
low board they're simply too much stop
standing on very nice meet definition
let's see if we get the app to work well
I have to restart it if it sees the
Copenhagen here but doesn't seem so
maybe I have to connect through Wi-Fi
first in order to make it work
of course the sound sphere are a
stationary speak I mean not quite
comparable to a portable one maybe let's
try putting the big powerful boom star
XL against this although this is a bit
large here I don't know if it cool if it
fits here yeah we managed and maybe
let's listen this is the cartridge
booster now
fee fie cam so volume is down the
another track but you can really hear
the lower notes pretty well here
boom store Excel again
sounds a bit more relaxed I would call
it maybe like that and I'll turn it even
higher this is a softer recording
maybe let's try max a moment
follow some excellent
yeah they're FIFA appears a bit software
but we know that the boom star Excel is
pretty pretty loud louder than their IVA
excess line so I mean if you look at the
size difference it's still pretty
impressive let's try another track when
I think the sound is really quite
impressive
maybe it will work without cable now
yeah yeah obviously game volume is not
saved of almost we could have a listen
how the Helsinki the little brother
sounds against this
your father size is a bit impressive
what's running out of gear
okay got stuck
why yeah I lost Bluetooth connection to
the Helsinki maybe yeah this is Apple I
know this is Apple FIFA yeah we have one
here and the other one got lost
something is not working well yeah but
well for the very first impression I
think that's it
pretty impressive speaker it's I think
four and a half kilograms so not too
heavy you can carry it around like that
I just like this little hand back here
although we will have to check it out
more in detail after this unboxing I
hope this was enough as a first
impression very very interesting for
sure also because it's so small much
smaller than the Ivor
but it seems to pack a similar punch
even maybe more HiFi yeah I think that
was it I hope you liked it so far there
will be more videos about the Copenhagen
also more of the Helsinki we'll try
maybe a speaker shootout like I try it
with the extreme at the very beginning
so stay tuned for more be patient and
yeah have a nice time bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
