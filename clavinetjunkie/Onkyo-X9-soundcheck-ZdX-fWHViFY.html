new Onkyo x9 this is a kind of premium
model it should cost around 350 euros
and although it's not really small you
can see it's pretty slim so you can toss
it into some rucksack or something but
you have to be careful because this is
all aluminum and it could be easily
scratched or dented you have the passive
radiator here at the back there is also
one at the front and the special of the
speaker is that it supports high
resolution audio this is only supported
through USB which will try so you need
some computer and let's check how high
resolution audio sounds I have
downloaded a track from HD tracks with
96 kilohertz and 2024 bits so we can
also compare it to a track to the same
track I downloaded from the iTunes Store
which is of course AAC with probably 256
kilobits but first let's have a listen
to the HD track
this is blukic now
maybe let's try again
the HT track but I'm not sure there is
that much difference
maybe the treble has a little bit more
definition but to teleport for everyday
use yeah high-definition audio is
probably overkill especially with that
kind of speaker
I thought we will maybe check it out
against some other speaker a comparable
one for example the Bose Soundlink 3 and
as you can see bose increase the price
for the Soundlink 3 in austria and in
germany it costs now 329 so I think they
are pretty comparable I think this is
really steep for the speak I mean this
is not the newest model anymore and they
still charge a lot of money for it and I
don't think it performs that well
especially compared against their Onkyo
x9 so let's have a listen let's turn the
boson and as always i'm of course using
high quality binaural microphones not
some for $30 from amazon you should
really listen with headphones to hear
the differences I'll start playing with
the entre x9 so let's have a listen
keep it workin baby the pose
yeah it's a boomy mess I don't know
maybe let's try another track I think
their uncle sounds quite a bit more
balanced and much more controlled and in
the bows does this strange staff pose
you can also hear already some kind of
Inca modulation distortion this sounds
much more natural let's try a track
listen to the base brood
horrible and they really wants more
money for this I mean missus maybe some
jazz funk I think there's also some nice
terror separation with this I mean it
doesn't have any wow factor the place is
not boosted or something but it sounds
simply nicely controlled and natural
Nepos travel is very directional with
the boss thank you again
some a suggest maybe
it's more coverton are not a
space-saving let's try this
yeah maybe let's try my favorite the
favela sinky Nephi facing key is
original price for 399 so 50 dollars or
Euros more expensive maybe let's check
this out the fever's Inc is definitely
one of the best sounding speakers in
this class I've heard so far so let's
check how they're on here x9 compares to
it I'm starting again with the onkyo
switching takes always a little time but
I think we can get a difference pretty
well
I mean much more definition I mean this
sounds like high-definition audio and
dislike some mp3 let's try not right
yes this is animal the curtain has done
you're a prick
I think you can also hear the different
bass quite well
Hey
the FIFA reach is quite a bit different
smooches song
I mean it's rated for 55 Hertz or
something but it doesn't reach that deep
maybe 70 a FIFA
you can hear the deeper bass pretty well
here this really reaches below 55
yeah what we could also try is maybe
compare it against the JBL extreme as
you can see I put them far away and turn
the volume in a bit this should be one
of the strengths of the JBL extreme so
let's have a listen how the onkyo x9 can
compete here there is not that much
space but it sounds still control the
medicine the much more capable
sound quite a bit clever an idiot let's
try this you can hear the bass pretty
clean
let's try the JBL get that is already
thanks the bass post it starts to
struggle a bit but now I want you again
it's like this
that doesn't sound then it's like this
it's like that it's difficult again I'll
be doing hands fingers have a drink at
ten oh it broham rekt man I'm up
next on the keg stand
sign down to it since I doubt it show
you folks what it's all about now JBL
again I will stop maybe turning them for
maximum that makes
Hotel Collection what am i - don't kicks
well I'm gonna be able to sleep not make
it sounds better get cleaned up what are
they surprise me
for some women alone shindig no matter
when it starts below a thousand
one-on-one ahem one with things they
can't reveal things well no one unless
you want to clean this here work quick
just work
I'm Kim
freedom what the word
that jr. becomes a bit harsh
the loudness wise it cannot quite
compete but I think it's still pretty
controlled at maximum yeah I think it's
a nice speaker nicely balanced but not
quite in the same class as the FE files
in keep but I think it easily
outperforms their bows we've heard it
already they started and the JBL is a
bit more booming so if you don't like
this booming sound maybe the onkyo would
satisfy you more it's also quite a bit
smaller as you can see I mean it's
slimmer it's also lighter I think 1.4
kilograms while the JBL has more than
two but it's simply not a speaker that
allowed me in any way I mean I get
goosebumps from the fever I think every
time I turn it on but the onkyo didn't
manage this it's nice and decent and
everyone wanting some some great sound
will be probably satisfied but I think
there are better speakers for similar
money so I hope this could give you an
idea about the Anka of x9 there are some
other audio speakers coming like the XC
x six yeah and I think there is even a
smaller one maybe I will manage to grab
one of these as well until then thanks
for watching have a nice time in 10 bye
bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
