North from River audio and with
Marilyn's son who is also a big boom ba
fan boomba is his own word for speaker
yeah here you have so Don you just came
from the IFA in Berlin can you tell us
something about it how was it yeah so
I've been in Europe for the past two and
a half weeks and we went to Eva to meet
with our distributors and in different
PR folks we're getting a lot of interest
here in Europe for different countries
to to carry the reefer products there's
just been a lot of interest people in
the sound quality of the turbo X and now
the coming little Reba s and people want
to come onboard and it's pretty part of
it they're they're really impressed so
how was your how was the reaction on the
and everybody yeah so whenever we would
open it up and take it out of the box we
get a lot of smiles from people because
they're familiar with the turbo X and
they want to see the the little s they
like get real happy yes it looks just
like a baby brother to the big one
and we already met four months ago you
told us it will be ready end of summer
yeah it's still not quite ready is it
almost only weeks so we're very close
we've been busy all summer long working
in refining the product from improving
the transducers further especially the
magnetics to get more bass out of it
we've been working on the amplifier
design to get more power as well as not
waste energy and we've also been doing a
lot of work on the battery management so
that we again we can get the longest
playing time we can out of it both at
normal levels in a maximum long as well
as adding some new features since we
last met yeah what's for example yeah so
with the S you'll be able to come over
and while it's playing music press the
minus and plus together for a second and
it skips into next song press the mute
and - together
for a second and we'll go back to the
beginning or the previous so a nice easy
transport control then we also added the
multi multi pair functions so you and I
can both sync up to it and pair up and
you play your song that I can play my
song so it's really fun for people who
want to get engaged and especially with
the sound quality of the Reba speakers
people say oh that sounds fantastic let
me play my song let me play my song so
it's very social that way and you have
stereo pairing with another one yes
exactly so we can link up to these via
bluetooth and then the person can play
their music and have it come out left
channel 2 1 and right channel through
the other and it's very loud in yeah
impressive but it won't be as disturbing
as this what's going on you know we have
some event here in Vienna going on yeah
great story you know sports event so you
say MIT in one month yeah so we're gonna
have production of late September early
October we'll have it in the stores
second half of October okay so wait
finalizing the firmware right because
people are I think people are already
becoming a bit impatient yes we have
talked so much about the realize when do
you think can we present the first the
first sound check sound sure I think we
can do that probably in like middle the
second half of October so guys you've
heard it still yeah please be patient a
bit again two or three weeks and we'll
probably hear how the river sounds
compared against the competition against
the Bose for example against the denim
don't make the if our IFA I don't know
it's all in English we color Ethan feh
what was your impression my impression
is that there are different categories
of companies one company or very few
companies concentrate on the most or
best possible sound then there is
another category who try to catch up
with both they are bringing their
speakers which are obvious and blatant
copies of Bose design but they are still
playing catch up I mean there are
nowhere close let alone being better and
a third category is something like I
don't know rocked ultra rocked models
that you can toss around like footballs
that are loud but
they simply don't sound good what was
your impression is there something else
I I'm missile there is a wide variety of
products and so it just depends on what
each consumer is looking for if they're
looking to rock out there's those
products there's a lot of people who
were trying to make just small speakers
that go boom boom boom and in trying to
get a lot of bass out of it with Reva
we're trying to maximize the sound
quality over a wide variety of different
genres of music so whereas some speakers
they sound good on a few types of music
we really tested it with a whole variety
of music from pop to rock to funk the
classical to hip-hop to jazz to
everything and just trying to be as
honest authentic as we can and they've
never distorts it doesn't distort we
spend a lot of effort to make sure that
even at full volume it always sounds
clear and it's beautiful as we can for
the full size because the boast I mean
it has an impressive amount of bass but
if you go past half volume distort it's
not clean sound anymore that you are
getting so I'm really curious to give my
viewers some first impression what we're
looking forward to getting you a unit in
a couple weeks when it's all finished
yeah so you've heard it lots of boom bus
but there is only one best which is
probably the revised thanks for joining
see you in the next video bye bye bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
