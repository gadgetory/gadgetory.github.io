brand new shark beast I don't want to
get much into details and features of
the speaker but simply give you a rough
idea about its sound I'm always using
high quality binaural microphones so you
should get a realistic impression of its
sound with the only premise that you
listen through headphones binaural
recording stuntwork well through
speakers so please listen with
headphones but first some aspects about
the speaker it's as you can see it's not
very big and not too heavy I think it's
below 2 kilograms but it takes some
serious punch although it's not perfect
and I would recommend any Wi-Fi
enthusiasts who longs or who is longing
for a really high 5 sound - we have to
avoid it as this rather a speaker for
fun yeah and we will try it out now what
I have to tell you is that I haven't
charged it yet when I unboxed it some
days ago I already used it for several
hours close to maximum but I cannot
charge it yet because I have this
original British plug here I need an
adapter but this hasn't arrived yet so
it still has the rest charge inside I
hope we will manage to finish the video
but battery life is still at 40% since
the very beginning so it seems to have a
pretty nice battery but now I stopped
talking so let's have a listen to a
track and yeah you will probably hear
how it sounds and how much fun it makes
as you can see the sound is pretty
punchy with nice deep bass not to
exaggerate it nice travel and everything
so this is really a nice speaker for
having fun really nicely nicely pounding
oh it's not and of course I measured it
and you can see a measurement at a well
higher volume level and you can see that
there is some there are some hills and
dips so it's not perfectly flat but you
can see that the bass which is nicely
deep and the only problem is this
emphasis around 2 3 &amp;amp; 4 kilohertz which
makes the sound a little bit harsh also
the bass boost at 300 Hertz is what I
would usually take down
I prepared already an equaliser curve
which I will show you yeah you can see
it hopefully this is we are here at 300
I took away around 3/4 DB and here we
are at 3500 Hertz with also 5 DB less so
we will have a listen how this sounds
first I will turn it off Yates turned
off already with stock settings and then
I will show you how much better it would
sound if we take down this 3/4 kilo
Hertz boost let's have a listen first
without any cue
there's some hotness with the left and
snare
you can hear that it sounds much
smoother now
there is some mountainous which simply
well makes it a bit not good this isn't
another track also without the queue now
this is now with you you hear the needs
the upper mids become too boosted but
the other problem is that the treble is
fifty directional have a listen
so it sounds best if I would sit exactly
like that it has no no Twitter's just
just this who main drivers here with
with the subwoofer below and he simply
cannot disperse the sound that well
upwards and to the side so the sound
suffers quite a bit if you don't listen
exactly on axis again with the queue
the saxophone becomes much too much too
loud
yeah of course we would like to compare
it against another speaker we've heard
that the bass which is nicely deep but
for example the fugu Excel has even
deeper bass I tried to match them in
loudness so let's have a listen I'm
starting with the shark beast first you
can hear a more power and a bit more
refined sound off with the k√∂gel has
the saltiness and the treble is a bit
harsh
comparing the beast against the JBL
extreme is not that easy simply because
the JBL has such a crazy bass boost that
it always sounds full and and powerful
but the bass doesn't reach that deep in
reality let's have a listen to a drum
and bass track so you will probably hear
the difference in bass I'm starting with
the shark beast again yet what you also
notice here maybe is there is quite a
bit of hiss isn't the bass house
movement
now in terms of volume to demonstrate
your hiss and it's well it's quite loud
so here you can hardly use it at really
low levels so this is not a speaker for
background listening and following a
sleep I will try to drawn there yeah you
would need at least third fourth volume
steps to really make his disappear but I
will put them far away so we can crank
them a little bit more and let's listen
some dense tracks now by placing them
nearer towards the wall
we will probably increase base quite a
bit in case of the shark beast this will
maybe improve while the JBL might become
a bit too balmy let's have a listen
let's listen to another track into the
bass drum how deep is with the urine
probably standing inside the room also
increase will increase more the deep
bass the JBL doesn't have
you can hear this crazy to meet the
right
finding the right position already yet
it's pretty loud already really not that
loud
this isn't some kind of jazz funk and I
will reduce volume again slightly here
you can hear how different they both
sound if not this funkiness with the
needs the fraud this will be pretty
decent I think just need some slightly
tuning
there is some nicely face this isn't s
it sounds better if you don't crank it
to maximum
but maybe slightly below give it to me
how much space especially with this
place man
now I will turn it to maximum and look
how the subtle change
well what with the strength is the
maximum five notches below maximum check
out long
there anymore
Patapon not just you know of next 90
both are not great of exists although
the tibialis twitter also suffered
quality
yeah but I would also like to show you
how it compares against my favorite the
FIFA Helsinki but you have to keep in
mind that the FIFA Helsinki is more than
twice as expensive still it's smaller
lighter and packs more punch which is
impressive what FIFA has achieved here
let's have a listen this is the shark
piece now slightly below maximum the
FIFA more punch simply more refined
sound I mean much more high five I will
increase volume slightly
much more punchy much much
so yeah my son likes this boomba as well
this is the book bomba which means yeah
it looks like a book this was it for the
very first sound impression of I hope
you liked it I hope it was helpful I
think it's pretty decent for $200 but
yeah not perfect as we've heard the hiss
is a bit too much at low levels and the
sound would need a bit more retuning I
think but it's promising I mean the
potential is here and maybe shark will
come up with a second version but anyhow
for fun this is already now pretty nice
and the battery battery life is
outstanding I mean I haven't charged it
yet and it's still 40% so thanks for
watching uh yeah unfortunately I
couldn't continue doing anything because
of my son it would be too loud yeah but
maybe next time I will go outdoors and
check it out there but anyhow I hope you
could already get some rough impression
of the shark beast so thanks for
watching and see you in the next one
have a nice time and bye bye
try this a kind of hip-hop hello
but for now thanks for watching I hope
you liked it and see you next time
yeah tall Vatican squats okay I think
it's a pretty impressive speaker I hope
you liked this video a very short first
impression about it sound maybe I will
do Sasha Peter Gunz quotes Liza
eating leafy Ithaca yeah
a stink fountain never the Bourdon
Valvano the prognosis oughtn't and
benefit it is not a minute this ultra
brothy yeah concerts the header the
Lucinda hear sets name is awesome video
