going to fool around with them in your
except a little bit usually the mini
Eric is of course meant to be used with
one mimic or with two mini rigs in 2.1
mode or you can also use two subs with
too many risks in 2.2 mode for maximum
power
I think two mini Eric's with two subs
should outperform two JBL extreme
playing in stereo and the price is also
similar for both I hope we can check
this out in future when I have another
sub but well now this content
concentrate on this up here as you can
see it has two ports which both act as
input and output so if I input some
signal here it gets passed through here
and I can attach some other speaker I
bought a cheap Bluetooth receiver the
sub doesn't have Bluetooth included so I
would have to attach it through wire but
when I plug it in here the sub becomes
well a kind of Bluetooth speaker both
but of course only one that can play
just low frequencies how the sounds here
we will hear now yeah and I also have a
cheap anchor sound cohere and we can
check this one again now first there is
no bass and the sub has no treble so it
would be cool if we could combine both
which will do now I will attach it here
the SAP should cost around 160 pounds I
think which is maybe $200 I'm not sure
about the conversion rate the anchor
costs I think 50 so we are around 250
maybe $60 still cheaper than that a bit
extreme yeah but first let's have a
listen haul this both sound and kazanka
first and then together with that with
the sub
yeah nice travel and everything but no
base now let's listen to both together
yeah some play it makes quite a bit of
fun again without sub get in the sub
yeah maybe we can try how this setup
sounds against the JBL extreme I had to
break up the connection to the Ankara so
I'm connected to the sub now and to the
JBL extreme first let's have a listen to
the sub together with the anchor I think
that sounds pretty mature let's try the
extreme
well quite soon
but I think this has a bit more
definition let's turn it a bit higher
this would be the next thing water for
the anchor I mean this the sub can see
play louder but I will crank the
tibialis as well
Oh
I think this song somehow Victor
yeah
what we could also do is try the stereo
cable which is also from Minich it has a
left part and the right part as you can
see so we will take this cheap newer
tech speaker that costs $19 we'll attach
that one here the other one there and we
should have a left and the right speaker
yeah there is some static but I think
this is coming from this cheap music
speaker here I will crack it to maximum
you know volume is of course independent
so and now let's have a listen how this
sounds compact the J bit extreme we are
still way below $300 so let's have a
listen I'm not sure if the anchor is
also crank for max
the daily extreme let me get a bit
louder
you can already hear some distortion
with the face from here
of course the sub is still in low game I
could turn it to high game to make it
louder
but then the speakers would become out
of balance I mean the anchor and the new
tech cannot play that loud so the sub is
louder now but let's have a listen
anyhow how this sounds again JB extreme
generating
again to extreme yet
but of course as already said they these
are the limits for maximum loudness
let's maybe take another speaker the TDK
track max or a34 cost around 60 $70 is
pretty loud but doesn't have that much
bass so we could maybe try it together
with the sub and see if this one
outperforms the J bit extreme in sound
let's turn it on to Maximo of course you
can see the bars here so and let's have
a listen again first D DK together with
the sub and then JBL extreme there's
this not maximum volume by the way JBL
extreme
how's a bit different but the base is
definitely better here maybe we will put
them away and turn them completely to
maximum the JBL is swell we can put this
up behind and let's turn them to maximum
now the JBL as well
quite a bit nicer bass louder bass
let's try not afraid from savasana
trivia no yes
not a bit want to compare for the mini
rip stop together with a PDA some freaky
Pistons I would say and we are still way
below 300 father you get really nice
punch with the bass this is missing a
bit
another by another quick trivial no
where's the thing
pickin JBL it's missing this no one face
punch
yeah so you've heard it you can misuse
the MINIX up with some other crappy
speakers like the mute a key for 19
dollars and still get really nice punchy
sound of course not as loud but together
with the TDK the sub outperforms the JBL
extreme while still being maybe a bit
cheaper I don't know I got the TDK track
max for 59 euros while the sub cost
around 1880 so the price should be
around 250 maybe $260
you can also maybe get the extreme for
269 so they are quite comparable but of
course it will be pretty interesting to
hear how to mix together with two subs
compare against two Jabil extreme I'm
waiting for another second sub so we can
do this comparison a friend of mine has
a blue or is it red I cannot remember
but he has a JBL extreme so we can
connect them and we can do some
comparison price-wise there is not that
much difference I mean to JB extreme you
are around $600 while 2 mini reeks with
two mini Rick subs should cost around
650 maybe of course in America
everything is a bit more expensive when
it's coming from Britain but I mean this
is really high quality this is not some
junk from what I know
mini Eric tweaked the support here for
two years to really get great the
greatest out of it it doesn't have any
pot noise like the clips KMC 3 in which
whistles and I don't know many others
because as well but this is really
impressive for this size what you get
here
what kind of basis is amazing so this is
not cheap but even the sub alone with
some crappy speaker already makes a lot
of lots of fun so I hope this was
helpful I hope you liked it I definitely
love the mini Eric sub and also the mini
Eric's so stay tuned for a comparison of
the two point to set up against to jail
extreme until then have a nice time bye
bye and see you then
okay so you are still here
you watched it to the very end so I have
a big surprise for all the trusty
subscribers and real fanboys look what
has just arrived yeah this is the new
and upcoming jail charged three it has
been not released yet but pretty soon I
think
end of April yeah this is the old JBL
charge tool and well I think it sounds
really impressive I mean it's not
perfect but it's really a game changer
how I would call it of course now that I
have teased you that much I would like
to demonstrate you a little bit I'm not
allowed to but well I thought we will
have a listen to this tool very shortly
let's put them here and let's have a
listen to a short song starting with the
JB charge to which is of course playing
at maximum
yeah this is really maximum or you can
hear some pumping and let's switch over
to that JB trash free this is not
maximum by the way far nor this maximum
again charge tool
you can hear how it goes down and now
the charge three at maximum
you
charge to again yeah something it came
sounding ridiculous
yeah this is just a short teaser of
course much more coming up soon I still
have to wait to get the okay to be able
to release something I hope you can be
patient until then oh yeah thanks a lot
for watching have a nice time and bye
bye again</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
