the FIFA sinky compares against some
other comment speakers smaller ones
bigger ones or very big ones like the
Peachtree deep blue 2 over there I know
that the FIFA I think is a bit more
expensive than this it's about twice the
price of the Bose Soundlink mini for
example but the turbo X costs 300 in
Europe you can get the V fighters in key
for 350 and many asked me how it
compares against the revised for example
so I thought we will do a short
comparison with all these speakers I
thought we'll try with the smallest ones
well then I'll buy a mini and the FIFA
Helsinki first as you can see I placed
the Denver I mean front v I think it has
its main drivers here somewhere so it
shouldn't cover anything as always I'm
of course using binaural microphones so
you should listen with headphones to
hear the real sound of these speakers I
put them like this to be really centered
so you can judge also some stereo
imaging some soundstage and so on and I
will start playing with deaf events in
keep that denill environment is already
playing it about 70% maybe why the FIFA
L think is still way below half volume
but let's say listen anyhow I hope we
won't have any noise outside well the
weather is pretty nice as you can see so
all bikers are outside and driving
around like crazy but has already said
let's start with a few fighters in key
first
yeah you can hear pause sound pretty
balanced but the p5 sinky is even more
open better base its primary crack
babe come on Atticus it was sounds a bit
more muffled but the the environment
sounds really balanced I mean for this
size it's really a great speaker
definitely still one of the best I would
maybe even call it a meal Helsinki or
something but the FIFA you heard it this
is simple is if you are listening play
much more higher classes because now
let's try the Bose Soundlink mini the
boss plays at around 60 65 percent so
not very loud but you will immediately
hear that it already has some problems I
will play a jazz funk track from
resolution 88 again starting with F if I
think you first
it's all mush the base of the bass drum
the hi-hat saxophone but the most
horrible thing is the bass drum this
rubber Cup
it should sound like that
yeah this is simply no comparison let's
try a track from savasana maybe I like
them because they have this really nice
strong mastering the pose yeah you can
also hear your blabber up I don't know
and very mushy song if I again
yeah we should try the Riv is the
reverse sounds definitely better than
the Bose Soundlink mini but against the
FIFA I think it doesn't really have any
chance I'm starting again with a fever I
think you first you can hear that it's a
little bit well covered the Helsinki
simply sounds is if you were standing in
front of the recording I don't know
all right
it's much more definition from the
favela stinky maybe we should try the
big brother the turbo X you can see I
place the one beside the other the turbo
X is simply too big so we would cover
too much of the Helsinki drivers and you
maybe already notice that I increased
volume slightly on the river as compared
to the others that turbo X is even more
powerful so I increased volume even more
I'm starting with the FE file sinky
first again thanks to Trillium we'll
have a nice staging here there is no
detail with travel nothing
maybe let's try not a trick yeah you've
heard it there is some tribal problem
with the 2x I complained about this
already from the very beginning I hoped
my replacement would be better but it's
even slightly worse now let's try the
Helsinki against the big deep blue -
yeah they both should cause small is the
same the difference is that deputizing
is much smaller and portable so let's
have a listen how it compares against a
huge monster deep blue
if you
because it
yeah the depo tool has simply only bass
and treble but it doesn't sound really
right maybe we should check out how loud
they all can play so let's have a listen
although the reverse is set to power
mode it will be still much softer than
the few file syncing again if I think
you first now although the reverse is
better and louder than the bosonic mini
it simply has no chance against their
fever I think let's try maybe the bigger
turbo X you can see turbo mode is
enabled for the turbo X so it plays at
11 out of 10 yeah let's see how loud it
really is compared to the female psyche
yeah the turbo X is no slouch but it has
no chance against the Helsinki yeah last
but not least I grabbed the total boom
star
well not the excel which we've heard
before but the regular version this is
quite a bit bigger and also heavier so
it should be louder than the few files
in key let's have a listen I'm starting
again with a few files in key pageantry
for the faint of heart about yourself
the whole ship the business the shoes
country cousin Queen Maria for which
brotherly mother supply 530 hands in the
sky think it's a good bargain yeah
more than a thunderstruck you're not
saving they way does it
the taste and touch your magic weigh
heavy your weight it's a database for
the rim was a reason to spank was it
many pairs with it
yeah the powerful boom store has more
pungent is slightly odd I would say but
I mean if you look at the size
difference this is not surprising I hope
this video could give you a better idea
of the qualities of their CVS inky I
think it's in a class of its own on its
own well I don't know but it's simply in
another class compared to most this yet
I know the denim is much cheaper as is
the bows which cost half the price but I
mean this is all so much you've heard it
it's much louder it's simply a much more
high quality sound it competes pretty
well against the toilet boom star as
we've heard it's well nearly as loud but
much smaller the toilet boom star ways I
think two times as much it also sounds I
would say better than the deep blue -
and really not impress the more I listen
to it the less I like it so it's a
speaker that will be well probably sold
pretty quickly I don't have any reason
to keep it so yeah again it will be hard
to find anything
well better at this size it's not cheap
but it's a very decent and and
extraordinary speaker design yeah I know
it looks like a handbag but well I don't
care
the sound is what matters so again many
asked how does it compare against this
against the other one here you have it I
hope you liked it yeah see you in the
next video and bye bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
