blind listening test isn't getting so
many smartest comments you should have
played the speakers through wires also
with high-resolution audio because over
Bluetooth you lose way too much quality
I read this particularly with the TOEFL
altima here but you can read this
everywhere in every hi-5 forum every
comment you can hear the same bluetooth
sucks so especially the audio files yeah
they don't like bluetooth at all but I
thought let's try it out if the
difference is really huge I selected the
anointment KH 80 studio monitors from my
friend which are really resolving so
much more than the toy files are also
placed quite close around one meter you
should really hear the difference I will
play a high resolution flag file with 96
kilohertz 24 bits from this jangling and
one here with a wired connection and
then I will also try to string the same
file of course somehow town sampled from
this iphone over bluetooth to this old
Logitech Bluetooth receiver I don't
think it even supports epics but the
iPhone doesn't support it anyhow and the
file is divided in 9 chance each of
these is either streamed through higher
or through bluetooth keep in mind this
is a high resolution audio files so over
Bluetooth the difference should be way
higher or much more noticeable so please
put up your headphones and try it out
so what is your result which one was
streamed over Bluetooth which with a
wired connection hmm of course I'm aware
that YouTube also add some strong a
compression to the audio so from the
video you probably won't hear any
difference at all but I can offer you my
original audio recording uncompressed as
flag file you can find a link in my
video description it's also 96 kilohertz
24-bit so high resolution among all the
files obviously the most important
slogan and with this you should
hopefully hear some difference I divided
all 9 chunks with a slight pause you can
hear the switching better and the very
first one who can name all nine
correctly which one is Bluetooth which
one is wired will get a little present I
will give away this anchor sound car
booster it's not new anymore but I
hardly used it only for the videos I
have another one the naked so I don't
need this here if you don't want to
influence the others instead of leaving
a comment send me a private message or
an email and the very first one who has
online correctly will get this for free
yeah I think you could see or hear that
the difference is really minimal maybe
for some it's huge but I'm a bit older I
can hardly hear anything above 17 kilo
Hertz
I made a test when I cranked volume 2 to
Mexico I can hear still 20 but when I
was young I could easily hear 21 kilo
Hertz so now it's not possible so I can
hear the difference but it's so minimal
I wouldn't bother with wires if I can
stream over bluetooth especially there
is no ex involved nothing it's a and
compared to a high resolution file the
difference is simply yeah Mahajan a
negligible
minimum if not for you yet leave a
comment tell me that it's huge and I
will believe you but for myself it's
it's there but not that I say oh they
are worlds apart so I hope you liked
this little test of course many more
yeah not only giveaways but also blind
listening test will be coming I simply
want to get away of this hyped rumors
Bluetooth is so bad he only wires and
thick wires like this all you
should try it by your own ears so I hope
you liked this little
paracin and see you in the next video
have a nice diamond bye bye
he had good luck with guessing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
