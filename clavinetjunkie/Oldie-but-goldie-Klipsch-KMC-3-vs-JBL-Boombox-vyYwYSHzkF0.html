yesterday for 70 years thanks a lot
Martin and the clips came she free is a
real oldie I think it was released
around five years ago so I was
interested how such an old retro speaker
would compare to a recent release from
JBL the JBL boombox of course they are
not quite comparable so the clip James
III needs eight huge D cells battery for
portable use it cannot swim it cannot be
paired with another one but still sound
wise it would be interesting if there
was some progress during the last four
or five years so if the JBL is really
much louder sounding much better and so
on
as always I will use my banal
microphones also had came for this
immersive 3d sound experience you should
really listen with headphones
otherwise it's waste of time for watch
this video please put your headphones up
and let's have a listen one is slightly
above half of books because the Jay
Bilas set fits in the mode and I will
start with an unrestricted person amuses
region a kind of 70s retro disco the
kv-3 will be playing first so let's have
a listen
when Toby Toby it sounds a bit cooler
but also maybe more muddy but also just
because the JVM is so boosted in the
travellerbruce region
has this nice extra pasty this knots
more natural black also saw us on
princess freesia based on some sample
from the 70s as well and yeah that's
increased volume is not just maybe the
moon box as well here it has this bass
kick which can sound a bit artificial
media
still this one Santos will find more
balance
but the basis yeah rather in the lower
region midbass is somehow missing from
the GBR here
and
because almost with us but what a 4-inch
I was eligible for it why the JBL has
tweeted we should have an advantage of
exes still lips on somehow smooth I will
say I will try to step back in my father
yeah oh to find a better place here and
let's try another one from no correct
but the base is really nice you can hear
some lower base
this also gets some and if it's digital
fault
but with beep some recording significant
for despite some pasta
there is some limit on which sending on
a battery tries to control volumes on
JBL not much louder
the meets are definitely this
over-exaggerated here
this indifference is hearing it's Prada
and becoming a bit scruffy maybe some
rock
more dynamic somehow but still it is
cool
it's on super so I reduce volume and
as a fuller but also maybe more boxes
song also quite a big collection also
becomes exactly on axes
what I would like to leave me analog
from savasana Pacific princess puja I
know that the cliffs suffers from some
pot noise
there is something but you will probably
hear it more from the back but not that
strong so let's increase volume slightly
and see what happens again more than
four euros because this is quite
impressive
so yeah the JBL definitely won here with
more bass modern emic sound also more
controlled although the overall tuning
is not an impressive I definitely prefer
the smoother sound of the Eclipse cream
c3 and I'm a bit disappointed that
during the last four or five years JBL
didn't manage to squeeze out more
loudness out of it they are comparable
in loud over here the JBL is a bit more
controlled but also bigger and heavier
yeah I'm not sure why clips didn't
release any successor because of these
batteries it's quite a bit subpar for
portable use you can of course power it
by some power bank I don't think that
the clips the three or the one real
success models thanks to this wooden
enclosure also hard edges so you really
cannot take them around they don't have
any grip like this here so this is at
least a little bit portable so I'm still
quite impressed with this old speaker
you can find it here four hundred fifty
two hundred dollars is new used I bought
it for 70 euros and definitely a keeper
really great also at normal levels
sounds quite a bit nicer than the JBL
you could hear it from my Soundlink
micro video which was not meant that
seriously but they're both at low levels
on somehow or under better than the JBL
and at high levels it makes me it gets
this harsh sound this this yeah so yes
still old but great and quite surprising
that during the last four or five years
there was not that much progress if you
compare for example the very first JBL
flip to the flip phone they are worlds
apart but here yeah not that much
difference yeah I hope this was helpful
I hope you liked it anyhow a full review
is coming soon but it's definitely not a
keeper for me maybe there are some who
like this tuning but it hasn't sound
great so for normal music listening it's
yeah it's a bit annoying and for making
noise okay but still it's not really
that great selling it would need some
slightly tuning taking down this five
kilo Hertz 7 kilo Hertz boost maybe
there is something wrong something went
wrong it also has some slight hollow
character to it if you compare it to
some others because you will notice this
probably well so stay tuned for a full
review until then have a nice time and
bye bye
you
for this I will try to step back here a
little bit father here I couldn't find a
better place so let me stand here and
increase volume to maximum again
