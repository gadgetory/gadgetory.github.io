replacement is arrived for the posts on
box except I had requested it because my
first unit have shown some rating issues
which comes out to be not an issue at
all because by opening the grille
removing this every purchase inside
the issue is completely gone so if yours
has the same problem open the cover
remove this as I don't quite think it's
necessary and it should be fine but now
I don't have any use for the replacement
and I thought someone from you will have
more fun with it and that's why I wanted
to start another giveaway but one this
at the end of the video I got it all so
guys lots of questions to compare it
against some others because below
hundred dollars like the flip for here I
also have the Sony Xperia ray which is
usually a bit more expensive but you
could already file it for 99 98 dollars
also if the the only a 5 here looks like
the base prima also the ggmm b5 which is
quite comparable in size a little bit
slimmer with wife I think it goes 450
without so only Bluetooth like the DOS
it should be the same price so around 98
99 dollars the dose is 89 and also the
riveter wax is a little bit more
expensive thing hundred 50 but maybe you
can also find it close to hundred
dollars and yeah I wanted to follow how
it sounds compared to all these you are
listening with artificial ears this time
as I think you can judge the loudness or
the speaker's much better this is not a
lot of steps or something but I simply
want to give you a very realistic
impression so I will turn it on will be
the first compare it against then clip
four which is the most popular here
maybe so this problem will be around
Navy
I know 2/3 so cool so I will increase
volume to make zoom here oh and we can
maybe have a listen I hope they are
centered and I would start with the dose
on box XL and first I thought you should
I play different tracks for all of these
because but I decided to play analog
from some personal pieces which are
if this really represents all
frequencies quite nicely so they have
really deep parting bass with the bass
drum which distorts on matrix when you
have nice treble nice vocals yet so
let's start with the song Box Excel
thank you this is simply completely
different class of speaker let's try
maybe the GT mf5 which is quite popular
it's also raving ratings this is more or
less a copy of the marshall stock well
that we've also read before so that's a
very simple peaceful in starting the
dots on box excel
okay you've heard it
so also not really quite there that the
only a life is a bit cheaper I think
currently 469 so $20 cheaper in the dose
for box exam it's a pretty decent to
take apart it starts to fall apart at
higher levels too much distortion
especially first it was also just the
boundary more bed so let's put it away
and the Sony Xperia which is a pretty
decent data but Sony as always squared
up slightly
Brutus already come to my pleasure
settings so bass and treble maximum two
level extra bass enabled as otherwise it
will sound to thing it's at this level
so nice playing also slightly about half
and again some books etc
the eggs with certainty Diesel's because
simply making elliptical treble which
finally the river arena has corrected it
sounds much better in my opinion is also
much more expensive with battery $350
you can get this 450 let's see it seems
to be connected and again does interest
me
for normal listening I mean it's not a
speaker for polymerase there are bigger
ones boomboxes like the geoglyphs screen
which is but in the end it's not really
that much louder and doesn't really
something much better also interesting
is that if you place it into the corner
you really get the the low frequencies
enhanced because the base is not used at
all so that's what is here and we could
may compare it against the vertical
connected
then we okay to have a little more
slightly
one of the really big but it's on our
speakerphone on here amply compensated
me this person every connection possible
so airplay which sometimes doesn't
really work but yeah um so how two
windows become you know simply need a
message you have to be of course
subscribe of my channel last time the
last giveaway I noticed that the winner
hasn't in subscribe to my channel I mean
subscribing doesn't cost you anything
and it helps me to grow my channel a
little bit bigger so I will shoot this
way worldwide except Germany so Germany
is excluded this time yeah why because
lately I get I got lots of stupid
comments because of my English because
of my bad english yes sorry I'm not a
native speaker I just tried to be
helpful with all these pickle reviews
and I get again and again strange
comments of stops talking English or
Hindi a solid or something and funny
it's always Germans that complain no
native speaker no one else complaints
just German so I thought yeah Jemmy
sorry but I prefer giving it to those
who deserve it therefore simply leave
some comment why do we want a dose or
why do you like Michelle why do you hate
it why do we all hate my English yes
sorry I learned it in school 25 years
ago so this is the only yeah my only
base I I was never a brought in a new
speaking country so I'm sorry but I want
to reach as many people as possible as
there are so many junks because around

you so we will do the peak that will
pick the winners maybe first of august
august august am anguish is dead sorry
but i'm trying again
so everyone who subscribes to my channel
leave a comment except germany
yeah has the chance to winters I will
shoot this of course worldwide so I hope
this was helpful also given giving you a
further idea about the those sandbox
Excel
qualities it's simply a great-sounding
one of the greatest in this price when
jewel
if you won't find a better sounding one
the Onyx to do which is also sometimes
discounted below hundred dollars is
quite muffled and its louder but also
not by much and and it doesn't have this
hi-fi quality to the self so that those
from Box Excel is and when I do further
videos with selecting or electives
because to best get this will be
definitely on top so enjoyed for
watching and good luck seal that ends
bye bye
