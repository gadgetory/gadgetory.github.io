Omega W for outdoors in my running video
this was of course more meant for fun I
rather wanted to show you the nice
landscape but the camera failed
completely with the high contrast team
also all the movement without gimbal
made the video quite unusable especially
with YouTube's strong compression so I
thought we'll have a listen to the Omega
W 4 again indoors under more controlled
conditions yeah you can see it's pretty
small fits into hand easily it comes
with this carabiner but I took this off
because it already broke during my
running test and it also vibrates or
rattles slightly we will hear this later
on so the carabiner would would cause
some noise
yeah the Omega W 4 comes with some nice
carrying bag pretty simple design you
can see just one button we will turn it
on immediately charging is done through
microUSB yeah the second that I'm doing
shows you that it's connected and before
having a listen comparing it to some
others because I did a measurement of it
which we can see here and yeah nothing
special some treble boost with a peak
around 11 kilohertz maybe and the bass
starts running off at four hundred or
three hundred fifty Hertz so he had
nothing really that special quite a
tinny sounding speaker but we will hear
later on there is some trick how you can
use its vibration in order to enhance
the sound maybe slightly the problem is
I have another speaker here this is this
kind of music angel or in my case it's
ROG NT or Roland I don't know how to
pronounce this this has no bluetooth but
it has SD card there are of course also
Bluetooth versions and I was never that
impressed with it they are around on the
market for I think two or three years so
nothing new anymore but I think it
doesn't really sound that much worse
size-wise also not that much different
so I thought we'll have a listen I will
take this off so nothing short repla and
always of course I'm using vanilla
microphones and you should listen with
headphones let's start with the Omega
here I think this button also works as
playback button or we will hear this
let's see yeah it stops and resumes to
play back and already see that it moved
slightly it starts turning around
but if you listen to this music engine
and say it doesn't sound really worse
maybe even slightly better treble I will
increase volume so we can hear how they
performed and higher levels this should
be a maximum also starts jumping around
lightning and Omega again also maybe
this one D starts slightly more but as I
already mentioned you can use this
vibration in case of the Omega in order
to enhance bass slightly it depends a
lot on a surface I mean we will here on
this surface there there is not much
bass enhancement but when I put it here
you can give it this time to come slap
in your full body of course when telling
somewhere this won't help much so you
have to find some resonating surface of
course this is not a clean base will
here with normal songs it starts
rattling slightly and let's hit listen
to this it works a bit like all those
vibrating speakers I don't know if it if
it was really meant like that I mean
it's a nice side effect but at higher
levels it definitely starts to rather
become worse
this is maximum no of course finding the
right surface outdoors it's not quite
easy
probably you it will sound just teeny
like that I mean so it benefits from
from some placement I will turn this off
here but I was surprised that it didn't
sound really that that much better let's
try this tone box the tone box without
any enhancement the tone box doesn't do
any rattling or vibration the comm box
is smaller but costs I think even less I
think you can find it for $15 so let's
hear how these two compare
I'm starting with the Omega again and
another track
there is some I think some Zuppa things
our friends
the Omegas sounds slightly more
full-bodied but yet also not really that
much better this is half this side isn't
smaller of course we could try how it
compares against the JBL go for example
let's turn this on the job you'll go is
nothing special I mean there are lots of
raving reviews but it's really not that
now both have gone completely from my
Bluetooth list nothing not a single
speaker anymore let's see what happened
where's the JBL go and what happened to
the Omega Bluetooth went away okay this
was a crash from Apple obviously and
something like that can also happen
therefore maybe this interference before
I don't know that is this Bluetooth not
very perfect either so let's listen to
the Omega again with maybe another trick
it's nice but really nothing outstanding
the Cole sounds definitely more serious
I would say more body to the sound not
as harsh the treble is nicer of course
the small omnidirectional surprising
placing the JDM like that
it still sounds better I will say let's
try mixing bowl doesn't really seem to
benefit a lot from the placement this is
awesome JBL here sounds worse maybe
let's try how it performs with some
resonating surface in quality but still
the JBL is a bit more convincing
let's try slightly normal levels without
any base enhancement yeah I think that
JBL is still a bit better I mean the the
Omega is not that bad but if you look at
the reviews they are all 5 stars
I mean it's decent but nothing five-star
with I mean it's nice but nothing
outstanding as always so thanks to Omega
for sending this I hoped for a bit more
to tell the truth I definitely prefer
other speakers it's nice but for being
really really small I like this tone box
even more as you can easily put this
into a pocket without noticing it this
is a bit larger so yeah in this
carabiner with all this rattling around
no not this one
you always hear it rattle when it
slightly higher levels so yeah I hope
this could give you an idea of the Omega
it will of course be included within the
database soon so you can hear how it
compares against some other speakers I
will call it maybe yeah like this more
dampened maybe with something some cloth
underneath and also on a more resonating
in a more resonating way but yeah you
could hear it rattles around so it's
more of a kind of effect not real based
it rather works for dense music but with
normal music where you have real clean
bass notes
it wouldn't work that well you will hear
it rattle instead of here so if you have
a bass drum that pumps you this enhances
maybe the sound but with normal music
not so much so I hope you liked it my
video about the Omega w-4
nice but nothing special so thanks a lot
for watching and we'll see you soon in
that video bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
