going to look at the boom box more
targeted at professional users or
musicians entertainers and so on no
kiddie stuff this time this is the
Mickey free play life recently Mickey s
released three different speakers for
the free play lineup this is the biggest
one the free play life there's also a
medium sized one the free play home and
the small one I only have these two but
this time we will concentrate on the
biggest one next time we will check the
free play home so what is this here it's
not a boom box it's more like PA speaker
equipped with XLR inputs also a monitor
out so it's really more aimed at
musicians but it has a battery built-in
also Bluetooth so you can misuse it as
some kind of boombox apart from that
there's also some EQ mode music life it
also has some user adjustable EQ through
the app also some free channel mixer
which is quite nice I would like to show
you this also demonstrate with a sound
first we'll get a listen here indoors at
normal levels I thought we'll compare it
against the powerful booster which is
the closest competitor and fuses around
$400 this is around 300 to 350 euros so
quite comparable so first how do they
sound indoors at rather normal levels
and later on yeah it's currently snowing
so let's get out and listen at higher
levels at maximum which one is louder
and so on I already included the Mickey
free play home also the life if life in
the home both are included with my
database unfortunately I yeah I didn't
quite notice that volume control is not
synced therefore the maximum volume
recording is not playing at maximum it's
way louder I noticed it up afterwards so
I will correct the recordings but yeah
as for now let's check it here with this
video I will use my phone or microphones
also head cam for this kind of first
person impression and 3d sound put up
your headphones and let's check it out I
will start with analog a song from so
persona impresses freedom as you can see
the actual volume level unfortunately
volume is not in sync so I will increase
it to maximum so we have the entire
volume range from here
you can also switch between two
different EQ modes this is life which is
more neutral there's also a music EQ
which beats bass and treble slightly
life against and I would also like to
show you the app you can also switch
between music and life here and you'll
see the three channel mixer each of the
channels has an on 3-band equalizer and
a reverb sent channel but bluetooth has
only the 3-band equalizer so you can
also increase travel needs or bass and
this also works on top of the music mode
so you would get even yes double the
base maybe here there is no real lower
base that place rather starts to roll
off at around 80 Hertz so I will again
reverse to life
let's increase volume slightly and let's
compare it to the quarter
so I want to switch to a music balls as
this yeah it makes them a little more
comparable
let me see yep again we reduced a
slightly so also increase Trevor and me
like this I think can still hear that
their voices sound somehow bigger so
more sparkling
more kick more lower pay this is a
little movie because of this strong bass
boost this right now
- you can hear way deeper bass acoustic
50s a little bit near boring it's quite
a new first song but simply without any
any amateur side trains or whatever not
work I'm switching him back to life mode
maybe here
it sounds more like some kitchen review
like this so music definitely makes it
sound better but also a little bit more
booming
something else
it's quite a new person's accelerate of
extension both traveling days
that's right
something else
the Sun is the neutral not come up in
any way
it's not really impressive let's write
history listens let the apexes can hear
the dispersion is quite nice but on both
so the sound doesn't become much worse
of X's but you can definitely hear if
I'm standing in the room mode you can
hear a much lower base from the talker
yet the ponies the taifa will start to
reduce base from some certain point on
so let's increase
Piper is already lost two three fourth
meeting
this maximum reduce space quite a bit
replaces I think my recordings were
distorting and way too much way so let's
go out and compare them out to us volume
is set to maximum both on the iPhone it
slightly below half for the Mickey above
half for the type of bumster and the
free life is playing with its life mode
and let's start with the track from
Sovereign Prince region and they make
you playing first
if our friend it sounds a little bit the
appalling Midland let's try this music
mode which is spaced slightly but it's
rather only some mid-face for similar to
the severe extreme still has way more
kick somehow doesn't sound bad quite
neutral but simply without any any lower
base
so here can hear more refinement for the
sound simply nice hula ma Mitra
now track but let's see what happens if
you increase volume so us you are still
below half it starts reducing base and
doesn't sound that wait anymore
so for high levels this still keeps the
kick so here for Mama levels I wouldn't
choose the Mickey while at high levels
it definitely sounds quite a bit better
they're still in above half so there is
way more volume let's write this right
and thus increased way more - this is
mixing call it - sir it has to sound
like a kitchen video so increase the
Mexico may come as well hand it in here
quite loud peace all over again yeah
this is the maximum so it has no chance
against regarding
some Rock Creek so not sure how I can
get without falling over so I may be 15
or 20 meters away no - you can hear it
start sounding really lost
you could try also adjusting basing I
hope to say work my own is completely
wet we have the option for some
additional fertilizer so we could make
it even louder let's increase basing now
although you can you can hear the
limiter already working so look like
that layer again Pfeiffer this is it
sounds like a clock rate you know at
this distance you can hear it sounds
quieter see for Tyler's
maybe let's make some slides my respawn
base around half Mary no chief it's
better when okay if you the limited
Aussies were that much here it's
something more regular if you it like
that
can't I play yeah come closer again
but people tell us also this is not your
fault you can manage this version seems
quite nice from both so more base to the
site somehow every play you can hear it
has no base to the side
not sure why I mean some panel here some
other side it something better than
confirm up and not sure why the base
doesn't go to the front
really let's try maybe not rec let's
listen to the base
so purposes full of homicide
by freak you know voice a great speaker
has no chance against their and make you
feel like they're not perfectly clean
thoughts really not if you consider that
they're horrible Sanji's nearly as loud
as the JBL home box so the neck is way
louder
there's some nice low base but simply a
consult
this doesn't have this lower base
everything from the side identity some
fuller somehow maybe cause mids and
travel is not as pronounced anymore
so I think there Mickey Freda life does
a great job for high-level some nice
party speaker this was sounded like how
much watsonater
all the drag it's not hundred percent
clean but still I think quite useable so
when I reduce volume to same level it's
appropriate parties have mixing now
while they make nice it hurts so quite
an impressive Palace because if loudness
is important I figured here out was the
title had no chance the hotness wise not
enclosed if you keep in mind that the
GBI boom box is about as loud as the
powerful boom stir they make is way way
louder yeah I'm quite impressed although
at normal levels you could hear the
sound is a bit underwhelming it's quite
neutral so let's check some frequency
response measurements this is with its
life mode and if we switch to music EQ
you can see it boosts bass with a peak
at around 80 Hertz at the same time
there is some slight treble boost but
overall the sound appears a bit more
booming then how does it's may be nice
and you could hear it didn't reduce bass
at all even at maximum we can also check
out the 3 band EQ and you can see all
settings with bass mid treble at maximum
and at minimum so the bass control X is
some kind of low shelf starting at
around 500 600 Hertz trailer control is
a high shelf starting at around 1 kilo
Hertz and meat is a simple band pass
filter so overall I think it's really
nice it's not for normal listening but
for others making some party it misses
this lower base so the sound is not that
exciting but here the XI loudness is
really impressive maybe you should go
out and do some SPL measurement I think
it's even louder than JBL party box but
of course without this impressive bass
still I think it's quite a nice speaker
not too heavy maybe not even 4 kilograms
so much lighter than this Bose
s1 or something but of course without
this this this bass still you could hear
quite control after make some very
slight distortion so it's really
impressive and next time we will check
out the free play home which is also
nice but maybe not as impressive as
so I hope you like this video again
sorry for my database I will have to
rerecord the maximum volume setting yeah
I because here volume is in sync so when
I confirm free iPhone it also controls
here my heat was set to some some level
I turned volume to maximum and thought
it was already at maximum
I was surprised it's not louder nothing
really if it was I should have turn it
to make some directly on the speaker so
I hope this could give you some idea
about the sound was about the loudness
if you want next time I will go out and
do some SPL measurement please tell me
if you need this but loudness wise they
are not comparable so it should be well
other than a total boom store Excel I
think it should easily reach more than
hundred 10 decibels from what I could
hear now so thanks all for watching and
see the next video probably with the
free play home to realize time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
