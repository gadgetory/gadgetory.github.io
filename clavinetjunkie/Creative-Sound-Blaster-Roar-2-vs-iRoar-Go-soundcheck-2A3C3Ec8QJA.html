we'll compare that old creative
soundblaster or two against the new IRL
go as many will be probably interested
in hearing the difference between the
old and the new model currently the
Sound Blaster O'Toole is listed on the
European creative side at $99 while this
is listed with 169 reduced from 199 so
quite a bit more expensive so it would
be great to see where the differences
are as you can see the our goal is
claimed to be splash resistant so all
the ports are protected
probably the drivers are also different
the track controls here also work for
Bluetooth while these track controls
only control a SD card playback
otherwise not really that much
difference one big difference is that
the road 2 can also be charged through
microUSB while this micro USB port here
does nothing when you attach it to two
mains so it's rather only meant for
connecting to a computer and work as a
digital audio converter or something
this needs a property charger which is a
pity I'm not sure if it can be enabled
as well as I think it might take too
long to charge from usb but in case of
emergency it's also great to have this
option as well other differences are
maybe that you have an app for the I'll
go now which gives you some options you
can control music that you have saved on
the SD card directly from the iPhone so
we can start David from here
so switch between tracks and so on
alright here you can also change volume
remotely which is a nice feature of
course but of course it would be
interested to know how both sound
compared and first before having a
listen I thought we'll check out some
frequency response measurements you can
see the old Sound Blaster roar tool
which measures quite flat but nothing
exceptional so there is already based
roll off at 80 Hertz and rebel doesn't
extend rate at that time and if we
overlay the eye or go here you can see
that it has a slightly wider frequency
response so there is slightly more bass
treble extend slightly a father but they
still sound really similar so the
mid-range is small as equal the only
thing you get is quite likely more
powerful sound here with roll or Tara
bass enabled you can see that both start
to boost bass for lower levels but this
is only a fixed boost which doesn't
change dynamically so at very low levels
both can still sound a bit tinny maybe
the I roll go can play quite a bit
louder but it also starts to distort
earlier than the old sound blaster -
probably because of the stronger bass
post but yet now let's check out how
both sound live if the difference is
really that noticeable as always I'm of
course using high quality binaural
microphones so you should listen
headphones I will start with the sound
blaster roar and a kind of acoustic
track so please have a listen
you're not that much difference the eye
or ball maybe sounds slightly more
refined let's try something else
here's some Mississippi music you can
maybe hear that the treadle is slightly
finer also bass is a bit more from the
IRA goal but they still both sound
pretty similar something else
maybe let's place them flat
I think the our goal has slightly better
treble dispersion of exes although yes
sounds a bit nicer I would say something
else so on this issue mentos for those
wonder dancing for you here close again
romance and ranch home grown man died a
slow game for my girls aiming my cocaine
the monkey it's cool game take my would
change premise that we won't change so
me love loves movies
sixty miles of track so you remember me
you started with a microphone when I
wasn't on God
yes long fitfully sound with better
treadle from the i logo but the
difference is not really that huge they
both are playing at neutral settings now
what we could do is enable roll first is
there are bass roar in this case
includes Tara bass together with some
further processing
while the our goal doesn't have Tara
bass anymore only roll which includes
therapies it broadens up the stage the
Sun stage makes the sound to 3 DB louder
therefore we will reduce volume one step
in it yeah obviously it lost some
connection it sometimes does this yeah I
which it's gone oh it's here and we'll
check out maybe another track again
starting with the sound blaster roar
tool
this is even after all that soundstage
you
this is slightly more on strange
some said to do the other thing
you
another trick
I will try this is entered here get this
definitely sounds a bit broader as some
more powerful
although you will hear that with some
stronger mixes the I will go will
distort earlier here the Samba throw
tool sounds still clean why the IRA gold
starts to have this strange distortion
with the bass one maybe let's listen to
them at maximum or let's say at higher
levels so I will increase volume on the
aisle or gold on the Sound Blaster road
to as well so we can also hear the
difference in loudness it's not really
that clean maybe something else and
let's increase volume and switch it to
maximum
on the IRA boys well although it takes
some second time feel
get the sound of fun roar creepiest s
loud although he another fact
the obviously tries to be louder I think
this is because of because of a role
mode let's turn this off again and this
one moves obviously because when
stronger base is coming in and I will
increase volume again to maximum so we
get a difference again
yeah I will go if you flatten order
opening you
the difference is not that big maybe the
our goal slightly more powerful at
maximum but you can also see that the
Sun pastor or two moved again yeah it
doesn't really have feet although it
sounds better one place like this they
now edit these rubber feet here so you
can really place it and it remains
stable when placed upright
I mean 499 dollars or Euros
I'm not sure it's a nice pickup but I
think the I'll go sounds a bit better
also you have much more options to tune
the sound let me try to demonstrate you
this uh here we have the and we can okay
it didn't find it's always a bit no and
when I switch to to my user EQ which
looks like that it looks quite extreme
but these are only three DB range so I
reduced 250 Hertz which because there is
some boost I increased 125 as me as high
as possible also it used 500 a little
bit increase treble and then we will get
a much more neutral sound if if we
compare I will have to reduce volume on
this one again and if we compare again
both let me try to match them a little
bit better for example with this smooth
just like you will hear that the sound
blaster roar
the IRA gosari will sound a bit more
refined now
it sounds fuller more sparkling
you're not easy to match them now it
definitely sounds much better thanks to
this adjustment here equalizer so if we
turn it off again it becomes again a bit
flatter sounding yeah of course I will
prepare a more detailed review of the
higher goal also comparing it against
that JBL charge 3 and maybe some other
speakers this was just to demonstrate
you the difference between the older and
the newer model as yeah I currently have
this at home and I also wanted to hear
the difference by myself I didn't I
didn't have the option to listen to it
yet now I have I definitely prefer the
IRA go although it's also more expensive
it's smaller as you can see a better
design these track controls work for
Bluetooth and SD card playback only pity
is that it cannot be recharged through
USB anymore
I don't know if they can enable it with
some future update I hope so because if
you don't have any charger you can still
charge it or maybe even with some solar
panel if you are outside otherwise you
will need the the power brick so yeah
not sure if it's really worth nearly
twice the price of the original sound
blaster roar - I prefer the I will go
also because you have lots of
adjustments with the with the app the
sound blaster one doesn't have any app
and it looks a bit I don't know you see
this as if it was not ready or if it was
not finished or if something was missing
here you have the protective covers so
yeah it's definitely the better speaker
although the Sun blaster or $4.99 is not
bad
both are more - sounding what I would
say and not really boosted
so don't expect any miracles although
the iron or gold really can can impress
with some adjustments like I'll show you
with the app so if you increase
based slightly and increase treble as
well you get this nicer sound although
you are missing therapies so base
adjustment at low levels is only
available with roar but you cannot
enable role together with equalizer
which is a pity
also there is some stronger distortion
at levels around half with particular
tracks I will demonstrate you this with
my with my full review later on which
for example the Sound Blaster roar tool
doesn't show to that amount because it
doesn't for the bass is not as big as on
the arrow go yeah for all those who are
interested in hearing the new one
against the old one may be thinking of
an upgrade yeah I hope this was helpful
I hope this could give you an insight
about the higher goal it has more
features better design slightly better
tuning although still not perfect but
yeah this is much cheaper therefore why
not go for this one so yeah thanks a lot
for watching I hope you liked it and see
you in the next video
have a nice time and bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
