I want the color blue
Uno, won!
great, again! you are always winning, I think you are cheating
do you want another round or enough?
enough!
then you know what? we will unbox that huge package that we got, ok?
I will bring it here
it's huge isn't it?
I think we'll need some scissors
no let it go, it doesn't work without
paper... paper
put it away
wow but these are big boxes
so you take one
there is another one
let's have a look: D Fine plus
but Daddy how will we wrap that foil again?
we won't! what for?
if it doesn't sound good?
Daddy, but why two actually?
we will also check why two
probably one for me, the other one for you
exactly, then both can do some noise
let's have a look
wait we can put this back again
we'll leave the manual outside
what's here inside?
smells strange
look
hey we already have this one
really? where?
inside
here look, over there
that's the new one, the successor model
wait, shall we open the other one too?
yes yes yes
again scissors
doesn't work
here we go, open it, I will bring my phone and then we'll try to connect immediately, ok?
do you manange? carefully!
it's quite heavy!
I think it weighs more than 2kg
but I can still carry it
you know, it would need some belt here, so that you can let it hang or something
so, we don't need the manual, we already have one
but turn around
hey, it's baby light!
let's turn one on
only one
but these are loud tones, aren't they?
here it is
let's put this away, I think we can also put away the box
wow that's loud
it's quite annoying such loud tones, I don't like it at all and you?
and now we could actually have a liten
look, volume control is in sync this time
that means...
there are no 2 separate anymore. bring the other one here, the old one, let's listen to this one too
if something has changed sound wise or not
but it has no logo... oh!
sounds decent!
this one sounds the same!
look, you have to turn it to maximum, so that it gets more bass
let's see if it sounds the same
this sounds a bit better I would have said, what do you think?
yes...
although, actually the same
something else
how loud is it?
well, they are actually pretty loud
I think this one booms more than the new one
shall I bring some underlay?
no
sounds a bit better with bass I would say
but hard to say, somehow they still sound quite similar
I'll have a look how to connect them for stereo, so we would have two
you have to press the power button twice
so, now press twice
did you or not?
now! not sure what you have pressed
wow, look now they are playing in stereo
come here, have a listen
this doesn't sound that good now
we can put this one here maybe
and, what do you say?
so,... what do you say?
yeah...
look this... hmmm
something else
quite decent
wow
look, it is still not at maximum, you can turn it even louder
not bad, not bad
listen
now we will disconnect them again
maybe press power again twice
yes, very easy, great!
so let's turn this off
you know what I would be interested in, how it compares against my favorite speaker here
let's hear which one sounds better here
I'll start again with the Dockin
this is a sound, isn't it?
watch out, the white one
and?
I think this one sounds a bit better
this one sounds better?
yes, this here is so strange and it also has way too much bass
I would say that this sound a bit more refined
wait I'll make it a bit louder
another title
I like that volume is synced now, this is really great
the white one
here the bass is not so intrusive, is it?
let me listen from farther away
both sound good though
let's try this
the bell!
never mind, doesn't interest us
please go, have look who it is
go have a look
and, who is it?
another package
but this one's for mum
it sounds a bit more controlled, I would have said
it also has wider dispersion, this one
well, so which one do you want to have now?
this one
ok, then it's yours
but daddy, how to connect it with my phone?
bring your phone then you can connect
how?
I am not sure if it is even here... my phone</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
