this time but funky speakers with funky
music this is the comparison many were
asking for the JBL flip 3 against the
Denon and via mini I think that both are
on the same level both are really great
performers although I would say that the
Denon has the edge at lower levels while
the JBL sounds better at higher levels
it can also play quite a bit louder as
you already heard maybe the Denon might
have some battery problems the JBL has a
much better battery life it is also
better features like parable with
another one for stereo you can also pair
it with a with an JBL Xtreme so it
really depends which one you like more
for outdoor use I would rather use this
one the denim rather for low level
listening because it creates an
impressive soundstage the JBL sense or
other mono you would need another one
for for real stereo sound i thought we
will check out some tracks indoors now
later on I will go outdoors and we will
have a listen how they perform there so
as always I'm using binaural microphones
you should listen with headphones to get
the best impression and I will start
with the JBL
no the denim
the JPL is a bit clearer
while the demo has slightly more punch
this difference increases at lower
levels but disappears at higher levels
let's try something smoother
you hear a much broader soundstage to
JPL again
let's try another quick something more
acoustic
let's try some just funk from resolution
88 I will increase volumes lightly
I think you here a better 3d kind of
sound with the demo okay now let's go
outside interestingly outside the
impression changes quite a bit the JBL
becomes more punchy while the
demonstrated higher levels about 3/4
we'll start with the JBL and then switch
over to the denim and later on I will
play both at maximum let's have a listen
so directionality is quite a bit better
with the JBL you can listen from higher
angles while the denim becomes quite a
bit door I will turn them to the maximum
now sister denim another JBL you hear it
it's really louder then on again this is
quite a difference in overall loudness
let's try another trick
the denim tibial again let's try another
trick again just the JBL
to JBL all right then I'm sorry
you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
