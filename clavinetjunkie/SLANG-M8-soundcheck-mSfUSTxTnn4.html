we already had an unboxing of this if
you haven't seen it yet please check
this out first here would like to go a
bit more into details including
frequency response measurements also
Tucson trailer listening
so this is the Langham 8 available on
your desk around six to eight dollars
also al in three different colors this
here is black golden you can also find
it as color mix which looks really funny
has it bit like graffiti and apart from
the design the speaker also has micro SD
playback charging out but I think the
sound leaves a lot to be desired
first I would like to turn it on to
demonstrate you all the Welcome poems
and voice prompts and so on
they are pretty loud and clear annoying
I don't know who needs all this do you
smell so now we are ready to lift them
normally still some tones but no I think
I'm connected here and before sing a
listen maybe let's check out some
frequency response measurement and you
can see not really balanced and the
problem is also pretty quick baseball of
at around 200 the bass rolls off quite
smoothly so not as steep as most else
because but still there is no DSP
processing for at low levels the bass is
not adjusted accordingly
it makes them on the other hand it does
not reduce bass any further so that
sound remains really punchy but you also
have this 12 kilo Hertz peak with treble
which makes treble a little bit harsh
so overall the sound is not really that
impressive
except maybe if you listened at really
high levels which should give you a
better sound than most other smaller
speakers yeah I thought it would compare
it against the Harman Kardon Onix mini
which is a smaller speaker but you can
also find it from 60 $70 but before
checking this pool yeah let's compare it
against the taotronics parsecs those
costs twenty-five twenty-six dollars I
think it was already available below 120
dollars you can see the size difference
is really significant but you will
notice that
that sounds quality difference is not
that huge as always i'm of course using
binaural microphones
therefore you should listen with
headphones i will start with the slang
m8 so let's have a listen you have to
turn up volume here from maximum in
order to have the entire volume range
and you can hear sound quite singing the
perfect we speak we have that one also
increase to maximum with some french
stereo within the threshold either as a
column somewhere beyond the left side
listen give it
the bling matrix oddly any advantage
another trick of course there I'll take
you to get more muffled here under the
spread of football
so somehow rounder matrix which we it's
not a bad time part completely boring
come on attract analog from so persona
you can hear that that cellphone it has
no response here the base is somehow
more funky I will put them slightly far
away I think this looks a little a
higher level and let's increase volume
to maximum where the pling m8 will of
course get quite a bit of an advantage
so increase in volume mode here becomes
better and better
the politic here there is some sort of
compression and we are still not an
excellent mentor project over being an
author speaker has no charter
you can hear the popping right up here
there might employ different regarding
oh the whoops all the reduced volume
wrong promoters in order to make this
sound cleaner now let's try maybe the
Harman Kardon Onix mini of course the
normal price for the Onyx means you
really retire but now it can also be
found for the same like 60 70 some even
got it below 50 but when looking at the
size difference also the size of the
drivers look how tiny these are compared
to these so you would expect a much
better performance def work let's check
out some other tunes again starting with
the slinger mate
has the meet emphasis or 50 making base
different okay
you want to battle me disrespect I'll
just light up it's been a while our
monkey in my prime yeah they crap it's
getting shots like this every time so
tonight when you finish the lineup of
kind of thing you might have liked you
very much Peter described being out why
you want quite a bit more they go down
without a fight for cricket all right
sir
a rat Chris let's go we try to miss my
job yes so much more power all of this
changes again if we treat volume the
onyx mini will start to compress and
produced based why the plenum a will
improve until it reaches distortion so
with the spare on it you know
they're slinger made they also love this
life no real competition with
so yes if you need this loudness it's
pretty impressive although you've heard
that's not really completely clean the
only thing we could try
is yeah the charge 3 which is also
pretty loud a bit louder than their Onix
me and so yeah to hear how these two
compare adding the charge to is also
twice the price although also smaller so
we will hear how these two sound
um yeah both are connected let's start
with an electric so we are around 3/4
maybe here want to check the charge to
it yeah Gordon committed to making the
opposite come before smaller anymore
explain to me can you keep all the
clothes are touch based on some horses
hopefully not victim money
where the concrete that we mix in it
becomes quite a bit lost against our
enemy
things like vision of the windows I
don't care what of infinity it has
variable culture that's always like the
hat or the delivers the fluid on the
home ribbon in blood of the person or us
suppose on the machines ever completed
by me on the beam oh yeah like me too
much distortion may be at maximum the
most important thing the slang mate is
missing is a DSP which would control the
sound better for lower levels it makes
you that need to be some stronger
limiter as the distortion is too strong
although make some volumes of course
pretty pretty impressive still I think
the usage is quite limited for normal
levels it sounds pretty crappy you would
be better off probably with some cheap
speak language for $20 let alone a
speaker like this Onix me which is
comparable price also smaller so yeah
not sure what to think about this limit
I really like the design but it makes
much more work for tuning and also sound
processing would simply speak up without
any any kind probably I think so so it's
not much maybe not even some limiter
which would reduce this Distortion apart
from that it's looking great and this
was it also these some signs here which
are pretty cool so get away so yeah this
is everything I have to say about this
limit definitely not a recommended
become but nice design and and I think
yeah let's turn it off again for you
here and all the display by PS car come
on and yeah off have a power of bit too
loud tones unnecessary I really don't
know why they listen you can see it
excited strange yeah this was it
thanks for watching I will collect it
despite the something creepy and see you
in the next video have a nice apartment
bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
