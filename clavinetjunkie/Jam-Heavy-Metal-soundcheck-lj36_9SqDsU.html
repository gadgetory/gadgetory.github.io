video no sorry
as promised I would like to show you the
GM heavy metal this time in reality that
gem here metal is pretty similar to the
anchor premium bluetooth speaker just
that the gem is even more premium it
already starts with this fancy box it
comes in while the anchor comes with
some simple and cheap paper but apart
from that oh also the gem it has a much
more expensive finish it's aluminum here
while the anchor is rather yeah plastic
and so on but we will see how they
compare I will turn both on now now the
anchor and you can hear the same tones
so they seem to share something
internally the difference is that the
gem also can switch to voice prompts we
can try this with this needle this comes
included by the way English you can
switch between English conse conse
Deutsch Jorge italiano Medaille and of
course the tones again which are simply
much too loud compared to the anchor
well I already find the anchor tones to
be too loud but the that gem is simply
unbearable um if we have a look at the
frequency response of both you can see
that the basic frequency response is
still pretty similar but the gem has
more bass boost and more treble
something the anchor is missing as it's
a bit recessed with treble if we have a
look at the entire volume range of the
gem or you can see that there is a nice
bass boost at lower levels which gets
reduced at high levels something most
cheapest because don't apply they simply
some tinny at low levels and start to
sound more convincing at high levels but
the anchor and the jam compensate for
this
of course we would like to know how both
sound and I won't emphasize anymore that
you have to listen with headphones to
these recordings these are binaural
recordings and binaural microphones I'm
using so please don't use any any
speakers because it only sounds right
through headphones I will start playing
with the jam heavy metal and we'll have
a listen to some tracks let's have a
listen the other anchor sounds of course
on it covered
but you can already hear that the bass
boost of the gem makes the bass from a
bit distorted together with the bass
let's listen to a chest wreck the anchor
sound smooth ER somehow more relaxed
while the gem sounds as if someone
raised bass and treble on an equaliser
with the bass already starting to get a
bit out of control on the gem for
example we will hear this with this
track you can hear the bass rubber
bomber the anchor has it better on the
control
another problem many already noticed is
that both anchor and gem have some
problems at low levels the unit I got
here from the gem is particularly
affected I will stick it to my ear and
we'll have a listen
yeah you can hear add the fact or
something as if a noise gate was yeah
bad it reminds me a bit of what the JBL
charge to did at the very beginning but
it's it's more severe with the gem so
for low levels yeah
you cannot quite use it the the anchor
doesn't have this problem at least my
unit yeah it sounds pretty clean
although you hear that bass that there
is some noise floor some yeah they both
have the same problem
but that gem is not usable at low levels
I think this might be simple variation
as I already had a anchor unit which had
exactly the same problems maybe not as
severe as the jam but it was noticeable
of course we would like to know how it
sounds compared to the Bose Soundlink
mini which we will do now and I start
again with the gem and another track of
course
yeah opposed is a bit mushy let's leave
something else
it's pretty directional still the Jamis
cleaner overall
let's listen to this heavily some of the
bass drum now that both the bass drum
starts getting a bit distorted boo boo
boo maybe a smooth jazz track
just a mess
it's unusable let's listen to our strike
if you can hear the bass from already
starts for the jam that boss is cleaner
in this with this track but you already
hear that the compressors started
kicking in and reduce the volume this is
just another house record and later on I
will raise volume for maximum on both
it's very covered no treble definition
at all
and I will start raising volume as this
maximum boss as well Crysta
it's always funny to hear a result
I think it doesn't make sense to
continue any further yeah what bother
does here both sorry is yeah unusable oh
yeah
I hope this could give you an idea about
the GM heavy metal especially compared
against the anchor and also the bows if
not the problems at low levels I would
say this is really an impressive speaker
but maybe it's just my unit but from
what I heard many unique units are
affected so you would probably need to
exchange more often to have to get rid
of this problem I like it
generally I'd like it more than the
anchor it has better treble but the base
is already a bit too much I like the
more neutral sounding base of the anchor
but apart from that yeah this cost
around 60 I think the 70 $80 so yeah you
have to decide which you like more yeah
thanks for watching guys coming up next
I have another low budget speaker here
this is the AES 200 from from how do you
say Eris Park I don't know so we'll have
a listen to this next and maybe in the
meantime we will manage to reach our
donation goal for the fugu XL we are not
far away but there is still some missing
to really have that five hundred dollars
collected so again thanks a lot I hope
you liked it
I'm sure two guys will directly vote
down because every video I put up I get
two votes down immediately so there seem
to be some who who don't like it at all
so you're welcome guys
to give your thumbs down again all the
others I hope you liked it and yeah see
you in the next video bye bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
