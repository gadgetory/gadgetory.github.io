time that the small portable speaker
impressed me as much as then you would
then on environed here we have the
overall Rena 2017 for the best portable
Bluetooth speaker and I don't want to
talk around how great it sounds how
great it looks and so on simply let you
listen by yourself you can of course
also check it out through my speaker
audio database compare it against any
other speaker like that Bose Soundlink
mini or the old and I am what I also
prepared some contenders here most of
them are top in their class like the JBL
charge 3 quite highly rated also their
band or simply play one one of the best
sounding ones and I think that they
don't can even compete in the higher
class like with the effacing key here
which is larger also way more expensive
or the Riverina
thanks to this optional battery pack it
becomes also a portable bluetooth
speaker and also quite popular the Bose
Soundlink revolver as always I will be
using binaural microphones so for the
most realistic sounding question you
should of course wear headphones please
put them up and let's check it out first
let's start with the Denon buyer in the
JBL charge 3 and it read from soul
person and princess freesia the dinner
we'll be playing first
the JBL it sounds a bit couples is it
was broken or something the trade wall
and this yes if some weed was taken away
or so much broader soundstage
it's quite a different experience you
are getting from the denim another quick
also listen here to the definition of
the drums hi heads and everything chari
regardless how you turn it
I think it doesn't make sense to
continue in further with this right
that's why this
in here is if you listen for some long
betrayed mp3 without any detail in the
trash thinks of intermodulation at
around half volume and here the travel
is not clean anymore
although the JDL maybe appear slightly
more punchy so it has this artificial
trick but when we decrease volume like
this for example for more ambient
listening let's do this on that tragedy
as well I think this is already the
first volume step after the update they
really changed everything even the
volume stepping is different now so this
really becomes quite a bit kitchen area
or like sounding let me try matching
then roasted peppers
and an outright system here as if to
speak up we're playing some effects
coming from here and here that radio and
not sure why there has been put into
drivers course we can also try what
happens when we increase volume and the
nice thing about the denim is that the
sound remains small is the same of
course with some base width option but a
decent
main characteristics remains remains the
same when I do this with the trust way
way more you still get some nice error
here with the demand let's final track
so the JBL will definitely appeal or
simply also because it pushes meets way
more and higher levels
this still sounds a little puller maybe
also softer but apart from that let's
try some rock track both are playing it
makes you know this is the denim this
modification here
so the venom definitely remains cleaner
at high levels now the Riverina but keep
in mind that together with the optional
battery it's quite a bit more expensive
and also way larger let's start again
with the end then on
it's simply way more defined especially
made and travel sound much more direct
by the river appears with diffuse
it's why this
listen to the sound of the violin which
starts to have a disappear on the river
it's not easy to mention as the meets
are simply way more yeah
of course at high levels that demouth
cannot quite compete anymore the reverse
way more powerful but let's check them
at higher levels I solve X's so this is
the Darren in it has more base the river
there not surprising but still the venom
appears clearer so let's tell them for
maximum becomes infamous sounding but it
seems as if the treble beginning
software it was before
not sure which is better here this fight
the river being louder it's louder more
powerful
so face his home quarter
but still there then on somehow sounds
nice and more - for some it's even close
to blasphemy to compare the smaller and
cheaper than on via against a fee for
anything key which is something like the
king of portable speakers still let's
try again then I'm playing first
fee-farm
not a crack
Yeji file appears even more we find
somehow multi paint
film is somehow small find another style
a little track both shoot very well with
more acoustic stuffs or not dance crap
and so on just really detailed and great
recorded music here that all sound great
on their own just a little bit different
so this has more meets maybe this sounds
a bit warmer
you can hear this pipe something
different that venom can easily compete
here you know you think inference has to
be come in a bit too sharp I'm drowning
the keeper for neutral I'm not sure this
will work
it usually doesn't they works better on
Android but iOS check is still quite
unusable
here it is and goodness and let's try to
turn it to neutral and have listen again
but this will make the salt also cleaner
try to make sure that it is better then
also at low levels yeah
now with neutral is it more pronounced
this becomes simply too thin even with
late night to the FIFA still sounds
thinner if this is more and more
compelling may eat more I don't know
more exciting maybe increase again game
or less equal loudness let's try this
with SOPA soma you'll hear really the
difference in Jason
yeah I would say that demo who's here
especially a FIFA with neutral get stats
to sound great at high level let's try
this and of course he had been on will
start to reduce base from here on why
the FIFA will become better and better
than higher we turn it so let's try how
they perform at higher levels so there
is at maximum and yeah is quite a
difference we can again check taking the
same from sunchaser how this performs on
both together they don't despise
something great notice over I'm not sure
this is vibration now something is
vibrating too much
over here something is a grating here
yeah that's the problem of the passive
Raiders as they are so close just
emitting through a slit so we can hear
some airflow already here then on
doesn't maybe a comparison against an
omni directions because a little bit
unfair but still both Coast mode is the
same so let's compare them anyhow again
then I'm playing first is quite
impressive it's not there a one plane
here but this is the stereo imaging from
here
one and you can again these typical
Randolph's target it tries to push
lower base way too much and this results
in this kind of this motion so the denim
that listens myself costs only direct
direct sound but still not rack and here
you definitely benefit from this great
soundstage a one he would need a second
one but from what I heard the connection
is not very very stable
still I think this sounds a bit more
defiant with more definition now track
from Simon gray and his life group
Facebook operation funky maybe let a
wonder what maybe some better and less
like this let's hope it will remain like
this is somehow better let's try this if
it starts the a1 now
now the denim gives a little bit more
covered impression but this is just
because the a1 is so boosted in the
trail region
way too much trouble like this so they
obviously tuned it for a net placement
let me a bose sound a little bit well
let's call it high five this right is
every suffering place like this
none attract pain a lot from circus on
faces fever
the lazy clean it's a listen which one
is louder and of course of exes that
then one cannot compete the a one
remains small as the same so increase in
volume to maximum 31 right loud maybe
softer but also more natural no bass
sounds my mama in effect also from sofas
on princes freesia based on a thread
from the seventies
anyone is definitely not a year but
responsible process
so as part of this we could try the boss
southern revolve plus the boss is again
a 360 degrees because just like labia
play 1 so we got this from where listen
you will get more less the same sound
may be a little bit unfair but let's
compare this to also remember the boss
is quite a bit more expensive then I'm
playing first
opposed
yes I mentioned eccentric I'm cami
result may be racial hood there then I'm
like this
now that post becomes Elba traitor
so you see where the advantage of
accommodation speakers but if you want
to sit directly in front of the speaker
that then gives a better result
so the demo it sounds equally bad from
behind and you can hear the song remains
the same while the down on the hoses of
course so this is not an option
omnidirectional speaker but at least it
sounds really great exactly onyx is why
this becomes a bit strange sounding so
you can give a sound just strange so if
you don't intend to walk around your
speaker I would definitely take the
denim so let's increase volume I'm not
sure if the denim can be as loud as you
can hear the sound remains nicely under
control doesn't change or doesn't appear
compress the bows
much more compressed
so now the spice kind of compete with
the pros let's write something else
you can hear
see also progression but also way out
while this is of course softer but still
sounds normal
I must confess and not only press but
simply blown away it's been quite a long
time I have heard such a nicely and
tasteful tone sound natural sound out of
something that's more it sounds great at
low levels and high levels even up to
makes me it's not the loudest you could
hear the charge sweet would play louder
but it's a little slower so there is
some intermodulation distortion the
treble becomes quite scruffy also it's
trying to push meats way more to appear
louder why the Denon maintains the same
quality up to maximum there is some
slight limiting so it's really high
levers with particular songs you would
maybe hear how it becomes soft we're
doing some parts but it's already not
enough like this the a1 quite hydrated I
think the Denon sounds way more natural
if you sit exactly in the sweet spot
then a1 has of course the other the
advantage that it's an own directions
because you get the same sound when you
walk around the same father both but you
could hear it sounded really strange
compared to the den on the FIFA yeah it
would need a little bit more warmth it's
still more precise more detail than the
diamond but it's also twice the price so
for this size it's really impressive
what they don't squeeze out here with
clever DSP processing psycho acoustic
tricks and so on yeah I'm really
impressed and I would get so far that I
would like to compare it against the
FIFA Oslo in my upcoming video still one
of my very favorites because but it's
quite large I think that normal levels
this can easily compete even maybe
exceeding the pifo Oslo in of course in
sound stage and also a little bit more
warm there also of course can play much
louder and maintains the quality up to
maximum but I mean size-wise they are
not quite comparable also priced $200
against I think 500 so it's quite a
difference
still for me the worthy winner of the
best portable speaker 2017 no other
speaker comes close in sound to this in
this size in also in this price there
are of course larger more expensive
speakers that are better I mean no I
always asked which cheap speaker can i
buy forget all low budgets because
invest some money and buy this one
we'll be definitely satisfied it's I
mean it's a sound you won't get from any
other speaker simply because of this
openness this depth warmth
it has everything it's not exaggerated
at low levels it has some nice base
books but not as strong as both usually
does with there's something new which
tends to sound really boo me you can
place this in a corner and it will still
sound really powerful right impressed
how much dynamics it maintains I compare
it a little bit against the Oslo yeah in
my upcoming video I really want to put
it against it and because they also had
higher levels it meant it manages to
retain more dynamics more of the
transients their texts but they have
this impressive don't forget these are
two tiny 40 millimeter drivers two four
inch drivers with one huge messy
freighter at the back while the FIFA
Helsinki here has two woofers two main
drivers and also to Percy freighters and
the denim at normal levels somehow
manages to get to exceed the if I have
sinking I'm not even talking about the
arena whether all Soundlink revolve to
us and so on so yeah for me definitely
the absolute winner 2017 I was impressed
by the diamond box but the sound is not
as we find let's say is from the denim
so at normal levels at home you take
this from the bathroom to the kitchen or
your living room or whatever and I think
a much better solution than a multi-room
system with having to buy five six
different speakers this sounds
definitely better than this almost play
wander just yet no no you would need
pool and then they are stationary but
this is portable you can take it with
you you can get go traveling and so on
and so on
so yeah I think that they don't really
deserves this I'm so impressed really
it's been a long time I have heard such
a great speaker overall gate has some
slight flaws with volume control and
also it'll be too much this may be but
for normal use it's simply amazing
really I'm blown away so I hope this
could give you a fair idea about the
denim and via
get really a huge step above the old
denim via which was already great but
this is
yeah even a glass higher so thanks all
for watching and see you in the next
video probably against the FIFA Oslo
thanks a lot</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
