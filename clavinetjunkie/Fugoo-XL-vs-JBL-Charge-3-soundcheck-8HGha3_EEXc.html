that JBL charged three against the flu
Excel so I would like to cover this with
a quick video playing some tracks and so
on I also thought it was pretty obvious
that they charge three despite being be
sent cannot quite compete with the flu
Excel which is in a higher class I mean
it's bigger more expensive and the
tuning is really impressive it's not
perfect but anyhow more comparable to a
speaker like the Harman Kardon go in
play as always I'm using binaural
microphones you should listen at
headphones for the best results and the
very first time I would like to play a
track from myself which I did well more
than 20 years ago so it's not a very
good recording but well why not this is
the same track I'm using for the intro
of my videos I will start with the food
excel first
charge three
I think you can hear that therefore
Excel sounds bigger also bass sounds
much deeper and that level has this
slide sizzling character not very clear
and our track not from me
also here very nice sound stage
something the charts we cannot quite
offer
it's all set against a recess yeah this
sounds much more serious let's try
something else
right from sole persona
there
let's read this I mean it sounds decent
for the size but that for Excel
definitely sounds bigger so much more
depth to the sound gives you some kind
of 3d effect let's are something else
and now listen here
I had the songs a little bit
you
else
let's write this do use some lower base
with the base from some group the charge
stream definitely doesn't reach that
and all track of course a great feature
plan to excel is that it has 360-degree
sound also better treble dispersion the
charge Lee definitely becomes a little
bit muffled from behind or from high
angles I will increase volume to maximum
if you really hear that dupa bass notes
here the track 3 as well
the full place in normal mode now it
would become a bit louder with alcohol
let's try maybe a rock Trek
- three
we could try turning on outdoor mode and
it should become louder now
you touch them
Oh
we're still
Donna makes it
make a second to me
Oh your birthday becomes classic disco
also it's ridiculous against pay for
itself
trust free
you can hear some small Distortion some
breaks definitely make their quirks Elsa
Peretti
it's whooping some punch of the maximum
you'll notice I used the flu Excel
without jacket because I think this
jacket design is a bit of a fail it
compromises the sound too much and makes
the speaker unnecessary big so I
definitely prefer it completely without
jacket and as long as you don't toss it
around it should work pretty well I mean
the passive radiators shouldn't damage
much and the Twitter's have protection
here also the main drivers it's still
wet from the bath it took together with
the mega boom so yeah I mean the charge
3 is a nice pickup but the food web
search is definitely nicer more serious
sounding louder a bit too much
distortion for my taste at higher levels
but still outdoors you won't notice that
much of it if it is thoughts or not
there is so much ambient noise and yeah
I hope this was helpful to give you an
idea about these two speakers if you
have the money yeah I would go for the
full XL but the charge 3 is definitely
the smaller more more convenient speaker
to carry around equally a rugged and and
waterproof with equally great battery
life both so to give you more than 6
hours at maximum I think I measured the
Fukui XL with 6 hours and 40 this gave
me 6 hours 15 minutes but yet the full
XL is definitely louder also with deeper
more punchy sound yeah so thanks a lot I
hope this was helpful and see you in the
next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
