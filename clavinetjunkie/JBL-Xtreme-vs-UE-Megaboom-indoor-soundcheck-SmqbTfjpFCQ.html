ultimate comparison that is going to be
extreme this is their mini boom and the
mega boom no sorry this is the Ultimate
Ears mega bomb and the JBL extreme I
already know that many will be
complaining well but the mega boom is
much smaller yeah but they cost exactly
the same and if you are willing to pay
that price you also want some nice sound
quality so let's check how both compare
as always I'm using binaural microphones
for the recording which will give you a
quite realistic impression if you listen
with headphones I will switch between
both start with you JBL and well we
should hear how both compare let's have
a listen
let's try another trick I will turn up
volume a little bit
maybe this
okay I place them away slightly and now
both are playing at maximum volume let's
try some R&amp;amp;B from soul persona
well it's obvious that the mega boom is
struggling a little bit
I don't know it's volume is fluctuating
let's try some Bhumi house and see if
the mega boom can really play some boom
that's the trivial extreme
the problem with the mega bomb is that
it sounds neither great at high levels
nor at low levels I mean we can have a
listen to the JBL flip 3 which is
smaller cheaper and it sounds somehow
more convincing
I don't know protein this speaker but
you
yet many will probably say that well but
there is an equalizer for the UE boom
mega boom but this should be bass boost
but the only thing I hear is some treble
loss it sounds just ugly flip again
okay thanks for watching guys this was
just for all those who were still asking
is there mega boom better than the JBL
extreme well I don't think so for $300 I
think this is the best you can get bye
bye and see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
