short video about a quite interesting in
the sonne caste rock + MK tone this is a
korean india not that easy to find but
i've seen that some marketplace d-does
on amazon offer it for around $50 this
is where I also bought it and what is
interesting is that according to some
measurements like here from clarity
fidelity it should be close to flat when
compensated for the Hammond target so
the sound should be really neutral as if
you are listening to some speaker in an
optimized Hammond listening room yeah to
tell the truth and all that impressed
for me it sounds a little bit off but it
can be tuned and brought with some
equalizer to a really high level and I
would like to demonstrate you this I
will put it inside here so you can have
a listen by yourself I will play analog
from so personam princess freedom first
the original track then without
equalizing and then I will adjust
equalize a little bit to make it sound
more normal so let's have a listen
I think you would hear without
equalizing it's simply way too hot in
the upper mid area so everything about
free keloids up to 7 8 kilohertz is
simply way to boost it therefore I'm not
quite sure how it can measure that flat
maybe the Hammond target is simply off
well maybe my unit and not sure but what
did I do
I took a peaking filter on with a gain
of minus 7 DB at center frequency 5
kilohertz and the Q factor of 0.7 so I
reduced everything around 5 kilohertz
maybe let's check out some frequency
response measurements this should
explain a little bit more in gray you
can see it uncompensated and in black
compensated for the diffused field
target there is some peak at around 3
kilohertz maybe to read it a little bit
better
I will also overlay the sony image 1
here and you can see it has small base
but it's also flattened in the 3 4 5 up
to let's say 8 9 kilo Hertz region and
we're looking at the raw response of the
Sun you can see that it doesn't have
this 3 kilohertz elevated as much so
with some equalizing the response of the
Dirac plus can be brought to a similar
level as the sony in this upper
mid-range here still not equal but it's
not as hot not as harsh anymore so maybe
let's compare the Dirac plus against the
sony image 1 with some Faro tracks this
one is of course way more bass boosted
so here the Dirac Plus is really quite
flat just some elevated bass in the
lower region around 40 30 Hertz so let's
compare these two and at the end I will
give you my resume
is it just a dream my name inside my
fantasies come to me you are in my
thoughts I never stray from the heart of
you come to me
we can't be underwater
am i searching you I wanna feel
so if not this elevated upper mid-range
the Dirac Plus would be a really great
neutral sounding in here also quite
comfortable one but with its stock
tuning without additional equalizing
it's simply way too hot it's too direct
I tried different tips there sony image
one tips improve the sound improve try a
little bit but still there is this five
six seven kilohertz boost it's not a
peak it's simply the whole area is
simply too elevated the sony on the
other hand is lipid slow with base basis
to Bhumi travel is also too picky but
it's still a nice smooth sounding one so
I'm a bit disappointed because I thought
when looking at the measurements here
from clarity fidelity also some other
ones measured it which close to flat but
maybe the Hammond target is simply off
it doesn't sound comparable to any other
in you know the etymologies finalist is
hot in this area so it sounds a little
bit off to me not like a speaker in a
room rather yeah
apart from that for $50 definitely worth
a try a simple equalizer reduce 5
kilohertz by 7 DB with a Q factor of 0.7
and it should be fine you could maybe
find you need a little bit better basis
nice needs a nice but the range between
meets and treble is simply to elevate it
so yeah it's a nice in here but not what
I expected I expected really a smoother
sound more compared to is only maybe
with less bass or so smooth smooth
whatever but it's it's - for me it's too
harsh too direct sounding somehow so I
hope this was helpful to give you an
idea about the sonic as Dirac Derek plus
mk2
cross there's also an older version
which is I think has more bass this one
sounds quite flat with bass
so for bass heads is probably not the
right one yeah thanks all for watching
until the next video bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
