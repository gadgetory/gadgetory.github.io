here the JBL control X Wireless yeah
they have a battery built-in connected
to each other completely wirelessly and
I thought I'll have a very short first
listen so yeah check them out yeah and
I'm not sure if you'll have the same
impression as me but they sound quite
boxy somehow take some time to switch
yeah they like somehow definition there
is some switch at the back which says
wall or other not sure which one of it
let me see otherwise they will turn off
or other if I take wall that base will
be even thinner
and a little bit underwhelmed to them
expected a bit more exciting for me next
right now track low levels no kind of
sound and justement also quite a bit
hissy so for all those who don't like
his not sure but let's write it down you
can hear their lower bass notes here
really well cause they are crazy loud I
think at high levels they outperform the
JBL boom box but it's not always high
levels that I want but I rather prefer
this thing at normal levels let's try a
mega track let's switch over to the JBL
because we are comparing them we're
small speaker let's try maybe the Piper
booster
Excel the new one not Excel sorry the
normal one yeah
problem is that I think the normal price
for them is 600 euros or something but
they weren't offer for 100 to 90 so I
thought they will be quite decent
unfortunately yes and of course at high
level stay
they are pretty pretty node so let's
check these two is the Toy Fair
so again JBL first
right awesome not that impressive to
turn through but the chicken attract so
I will increase volume pool here
the higher you turn them the better they
become awake
Sukhmani
recording starts we stopped but yeah
really loud no bass reduction but also
some some distortion still at normal
levels they are quite an impressive I
just wanted to give you this very first
quick impression of course I will try
doing a more detailed video but the
first impression is quite a
disappointment battery never yeah mmm I
think JBL claims for hours at low levels
so the high levels probably they will
turn off after half an hour maybe but I
will test this as well still I think for
really high levels they seem to be
louder than the JBL boombox also more
weighty somehow and yeah we all have the
advantage of being able to separate them
so I can put this one here the other one
of course to the other side of the room
and it should be quite a quite a nice
sound
still they're making this something
which you usually submit final maybe
but I mean 490 189 euros they were an
offer quite decent so if you can find
them here for this price it will be hard
to get a better stereo system but it's
not for critical listening rather you
know taking them outdoors they have some
mm tripod mount here so you can hit hang
from the hello from the ceiling or from
your wall yeah I think this was enough a
first impression thanks again and sorry
for this short Intermezzo here but I
wanted to share this with you as long as
I have some minutes left so bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
