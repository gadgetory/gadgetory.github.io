the topic regarding temperature related
issues of the JBL flip 3 unfortunately I
cannot give any final statement I wanted
to grab another black unit as I thought
it might only affect all the black units
because of the dark color but I couldn't
grab one because they are currently out
of stock and I have to return this unit
so I cannot really do any direct
comparison all I can say the yellow unit
doesn't have any problems I put it into
the Sun for one hour two hours and it
still sounded great before putting them
into the Sun they look like this I mean
equal but after the black one stands in
the Sun for 10-15 minutes the passive
radiators come out and when pulled out
like this standing upright they are even
rattling against the base so I'm not
sure if it's really just my unit but
meanwhile some others reported the same
problem with other colors one said he
had two red ones and both of them had
the same problem my yellow one doesn't
have this problem also the JBL extreme
so far didn't have any problems I didn't
notice anything I have it in the Sun
every day now for several hours and it
still sounds great
so this might be really some production
problem some sample variation I don't
know umm one came up with a theory that
it might be related to a daily or a
night production so during night the
temperature is different than during day
therefore the air pressure is also
different in some units and then if it
becomes hot the air pressure becomes
even even stronger even higher therefore
the passive radiators come out I don't
know
to sum up I would conclude that bite if
you like it and if you have this issue
return it and
well take another one I'm sure not all
of them have this problem but it seems
some have it and otherwise I wouldn't
have noticed it well if someone from JBL
or Harman Kardon watches this yeah you
can send me your better units and I will
test them I'm sure I will find any error
any issue like I did with the JBL charge
tool like I did know the flip three so
well send me your units and I will
willingly test them down to their guts
another interesting side note maybe is
the difference in sound quality between
both when I compare them both I found
that the black one sounded slightly
better then to really get true I
measured both I also repeated the
measurement after repositioning them and
I got the same results they simply
measure differently and although the
yellow one seems to measure a bit
flatter I think the lower bass boost of
the black unit simply gives the sound a
bit more punch this is somehow missing
from the yellow unit
I cannot say which one is more true to
the sound you should get from this unit
but I simply prefer the black one
therefore it's really a pity that it has
these problems at higher levels because
the yellow unit becomes a bit
uncontrolled with really bass heavy
tracks the black one has this lower bass
boost while the yellow one has some
slight emphasis on the upper base which
tends to distort slightly therefore I'm
really not quite sure what's the normal
sound how they should sound in reality
but all I can say they even sound
differently but I think the yellow one
is the more common you can also see a
slight Preble peak on the yellow one
which is missing from the black one it
sounds slightly smoother so yes this is
all I can say for now I hope all you
other users and owners have no problems
with sticking out passive radiators or
like I did
and you are satisfied with the unit
because they are really great but I'm
really not sure what JBL what kind of
problem is going on here again I think
right now this is all I can say about
this topic I will post another video
showing of the JBL connect feature in
detail before sending this unit back so
stay tuned for more oh so I hope I could
help I hope you liked it and we'll see
you next time bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
