going to look at annuities from Phillips
the ever play or the model number is BT
7100 this because quite nice and
interesting it's weatherproof has 100
hours of standby time again more of this
later and some other gimmicks like the
strap you can see here is actually the
USB wire for tracking so I can take this
out and you can charge the speaker with
this wire so no need to take any wires
with you just yet simply use this one at
the back you can see it very simply a
micro USB for charging auxilary but
nothing else
and now to this standby feature you can
wake it up remotely if I pick it up
through my list here phillips bt 7900 it
will turn on automatically this only
works use the speaker jumps into the
standby mode on its own so after five
minutes of idle of being idle it jams
into the standby mode otherwise if you
turn it off manually there is no way to
turn it on remotely and of course you
would like to release now it sounds this
is the most important part I mean it
looks quite nice also not too big but
although a solid performer I think it
lacks a bit especially compared against
some other comparable containers like
this JBL support for example as price is
also quite similar the philips shoots or
is announced with 120 euros and should
be out in july now while the JBL flip
for cost $99 so is quite a bit more
cheaper but sound wise i think it's a
little bit better not be fighting listen
let's check out maybe some frequency
response measurements and you can see
that the fields middle swallow nature
but there is also some lack of bass so
the bass is not kept at the high level
also at low levels there is no
additional bass boost while at high
level space is reduced even further so
now let's compare it maybe against the
JBL flip phone which is one of the top
performers in this class of course it's
better than many others but as you can
get the flip for for the same price i
think it's quite fair i will start with
an instrumental track from savasana and
with their fields playing first so let's
have a listen
you can really hear that the frequency
response is nice and smooth
part the sound legs a bit of warmth
click for exquisite more punch so also
the partial sound thanks to this treble
boost the Philips sounds nice the whole
chocolate with a lack of bass
something else I think you can hear
found its king of this has a super over
response jar to little baby let's check
them off exit and on this version is
quite nice is not exit here perfect
oh you talk depressed undermine respect
just a revived a takeover rap songs
election campaign the liquid all day
talking to that straight back their
credits more punching all the ranks a
lot of how we drink the image because
it's still today everything is ills all
trumpets our hand is made I mean it's
ready to strong but it's the phone
a dancer comedian and kakak video
hello increase volume idiot
so both were stabbed so the use case
elevated to Phoenix but yet it remains
nicely controlled so there's no
distortion no strength rolling or
circulated from many other speakers and
maybe listen how they performed and high
levels at maximum for the suspect
Philips increasing going to make turn
out not that loud so let's report to the
deputy louder before
experiment nicely controlled electric
electric for slightly louder maybe
managing tools within more base so I
will say the police place on a similar
level to the flip three maybe not quite
in the same week I stay asleep for but
still quite a decent speaker so no flaws
at all also like this gimmicky USB wire
here that you're really in case you
forget it for charging you always have
it with you this is quite nice
also the standpipe feature is nice
although not really work through I mean
if you turn if I turn it off now there
won't be any way to turn it on remotely
anymore it has to jump into this plane
time out on its own yeah I think it's a
nice bigger a little bit overpriced
currently maybe the price will drop then
below hundred euros not sure if it will
be released in the US as well but it's
already announced for Europe in
Netherlands I think an already order it
for 120 euros nice but I think you can
get better speakers as well so it's
nothing revolutionary let's say yeah I
hope this was helpful you can also check
it out from my speaker audio database I
already included it and completely it
may be against the HEI have flipped 3 or
some other speakers if you can compare
it against some other all the Philip
speakers like maybe T 6000 which maybe
is the unofficial successor this sounds
much better the BT 6000 was ca was quite
quite crappy but there is some solid
just it would need a bit more base maybe
you could hear you could see that the
the curve rolled off quite quite
smoothly but the bass could have been
kept at a higher level let's say so yeah
what I wanted to introduce you our new
roommate
Lily therefore meeting a little bit of
dirt here really nearly just that you
know why I don't manage to clean
everything really silly hard oh yeah so
quicker
so today's Lily she is very living very
lively lovely lovely lovely Amy so that
my attention at contraction she is just
she backed my wires off my microphone
has fallen out so yeah really
say goodbye to see her at all so this is
Lily and let me take him the microphone
again she pulled it out of my ear and
yeah I cannot make that many videos now
because she's very very living very
lately I think is the correct term and
yeah it's hard to get some minutes for
for yeah some sonic minutes so thanks a
lot for watching and see you in the next
video have a nice comment bye bye

team on the cameras in American HD have
