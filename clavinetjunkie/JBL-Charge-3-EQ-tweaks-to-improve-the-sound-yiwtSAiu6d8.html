judge 3 and today we are going to tweak
it or at least try to improve the sound
a little bit since its released some
months ago there were lots of
controversial opinions about the speaker
with many claiming it to sound muffled
others are more satisfied with it but I
also rather belong to those who think
treble response could be a bit better
there is even some discussion within my
channel with people asking how can the
sound be improved with an equaliser some
even emailed to JBL harman kardon well
it's the same company why does it sound
so much more muffled than the JBL judge
2 and why there is no update which
improves the sound and so on well if
looking a bit closer I think that the
charge 3 is a much better speaker than
the judge to us
yeah there is some treble problem but
the bass is much fuller you can play
much louder and much more control than
the old version also without the strong
processing but JBL harman kardon
obviously had to make some compromises i
mean a speaker that small with such
strong bass which can also play loud the
treble had to be may be taken away
slightly it already suffers from
intermodulation what is this year when
drivers full range drivers move due to
strong bass it compromises high
frequencies which you can hear is some
kind of side effect let's say so the
charts we already suffers from this and
if they raised treble maybe even more it
would suffer more and they had to well
to take it down but at normal listening
levels it just appears muffled and and
it could be definitely improved when
looking at a frequency response
measurement I did at the very beginning
when this becomes released you can see
yeah that it measures really flat and
natural just that there is some slight
dip at around 5 kilo Hertz and then
treble starts rolling off already around
twelve point five kilo Hertz so above
twelve point five is not much there is
still a slight raise above but with a
later update you can see that obviously
they included some low-pass filter so
maybe to minimize inter modulation but
it didn't really help much so they
didn't improve treble
but yeah took it even away
and sadly someone claimed with the
latest update which which was two days
ago that the treble has improved a lot
and I should perform it I did and I did
another measurement and there is no
change maybe even slightly worse than it
was before
so it would be of course interesting to
see how treble can be improved the
problem also is that the JBL charge 3
you can see this deep at 5 kilohertz if
we compare it with another speaker like
the Bose Soundlink mini you can see that
in this area the Bose has a boost so the
JBL chari definitely appears more
muffled just because the Bose is more
boosted but in reality that JBL has then
much letter frequency response also much
better treble as you can see it rolls
off at 12 kilohertz while the Bose
already rolls off above 10 kilohertz so
there is no upper treble at all with the
Bose Soundlink mini still I'm also not
that satisfied with the speaker for
normal listening levels it it has nice
bass but it's missing this nice Sparkle
that's why I thought yeah I will take my
my equaliser app and we will try
improving it slightly so I created a
curve as always and I did just what was
seen in the measurement
I took I'm here at around 13 kilo Hertz
with the upper band I hope you can see
this and I posted it 10 DB I could post
it in more but let's say this is OK and
I have another band which is at around
five point five kilowatts and I also
boosted it for 3-4 DB to to overcome
this deep and make it more more of a
flatter so let's listen to a song from
Salter freesia first without EQ and then
I will activate the queue so that you
can hear the difference it's always I'm
of course using high quality binaural
microphones so please listen with
headphones so you can really hear all
the nuances so now without the queue
I will increase volume slightly
now I will activate the queue and you
can probably hear that it became clearer
more sparkling what are the queue and I
think it me improves of X's if we
disable equalizer again it becomes
really muffled with the queue make the
final track this is playing with kill
now
which sounds of course okay but if I
disable equalizer yeah it sounds muted
and a big tool to gain with
pull it out try out trick this is
without EQ no and with a Q you can hear
this upper trebles pocket becomes much
better without introducing that much of
any additional I mean it just has two
drivers so the foreign drivers have to
produce both treble and bass of course
they struggle
I will deactivate Q again and you can
get it it becomes more muffled because
the higher we turn volume the stronger
you can try without but it's not so
obvious with this song
it's Varitek he'll their intimate
relation becomes much more obvious
because there is some bass and the
treble is quite we find this is with EQ
now without
you can hear that that level has this
strange character
again with the Q's volume because best
would be some dynamic adjustment
I will deactivate EQ again and you can
hear that it starts soundly it starts
really sounding muffled I will activate
EQ game so it's much better the problem
is also the human ear which of course
has no linear frequency response are the
lower the volume gets the low it becomes
sensitive for low and high frequencies
that's why both boosts bass and treble
at low of low levels if we have a look
at the frequency response measurement
again you can see that the charge 3
remains always the same regardless of
loudness level while both really boosts
treble and bass at the same time so the
human ear you had to compensate for this
loudness loss of the human ear you know
it's a pity that JBL doesn't apply any
dynamic adjustments they could take away
treble and bass just like they do now
for high levels but at low levels it
could get along with a bit more bass and
also with a bit more treble boost so
yeah but I think well some slide trailer
yeah EQ adjustment just like here with
with some slight hump at 5 6 kilohertz
and another hump at 13 kilo Hertz helps
already with this yeah it's a pity that
JBL didn't do anything or cannot or they
don't want to I don't know maybe they
want you to buy the next version the
best would be to include just Twitter's
so that the main drivers of food and
drivers would be cut off at let's say 2
3 kilohertz you wouldn't get any
Internet elation distortion bass could
be pushed even stronger because JBL has
really great bass processing JBL harman
kardon both the Harman Kardon go and
play you can see over there and JBL at
charge 3 they outperform all others
because in regarding in distortion-free
bass
put the strongest songs and this thing
doesn't fart doesn't do anything if you
play such songs on both or any others
because you know even the river starts
struggling little bit but Hammond cotton
outperforms the bill play a six you can
see over there which cost thousands this
costs 300 or 400 and it plays much
stronger at higher levels I mean it's
different again at low levels as the
bill play has quite a bit of a bass
boost even much stronger than the common
card on but the Harman Kardon remains
completely unimpressed even at maximum
volume with the strongest tracks just
like the JBL charge 3 it's only that the
treble starts sounding a bit strange
due to inter modulation so best would be
to include Twitter's someone claimed
that they responded there is no place
within this speaker for tweeters which
is a complete if you look at at
the fugu at the small one it's 2 or 3
times smaller than the JBL charge 3 it
has two Twitter's at both sides it would
be enough to add Twitter's even on top
as Twitter's have a much less
directional sound and full range drivers
and you could even yea get a closer on
the directional speaker because then you
hear the mid frequencies anyhow you're
just missing upper frequencies from
behind so Twitter's a bath would be
maybe the best solution not here would
like with the JBL extreme but really up
there somewhere no need for or even
maybe one driver at the front one at the
back just like many others dunno like
the the leakage also has driver spread
to the side so there is lots of
potential still still there the charge
free is already really great in this
size but there is room for improvement
lots of improvement adding Twitter's
making the sound more only directional
by by placing the speakers on opposite
sides adding some dynamic adjustment I
mean it's all there they are able to do
it but they probably they don't want or
they can't or I don't know maybe they
are just some morons doing
what some someone else tells them but
they don't think by themselves so I
really hope and I think in future we'll
really get lots of grades because the
GBA tracks for will be probably even
better I hope they don't make it bigger
but keep the size for this size it's
already pretty impressive and you can
improve it with some slight EQ as we've
seen but best would have been here to to
add Twitter's to may be optimized
drivers a little bit put them at the
opposite side for a more only
directional sound so yeah this was it to
tell the truth I really don't use the
charge three that often because for home
use if I'm going from the kitchen to the
bathroom and so on
I prefer even this small Xiaomi me as it
sounds much more balanced and and has
better treble therefore it's a pity s
such a great speaker stands around
unused it has great battery life really
impressive at mixing volume more than
six hours but yeah this intermediation
problem this muffled travel and
everything what impresses me is how well
JBL manages to control the bass with the
Harman Kardon gameplay and with the JBL
charge 3 they didn't or they were not
able with the extreme which tends to
distort if the peak becomes too strong
you hear something not so with the GBH
a3 and with the Harman Kardon going play
you will hear when I do my my video
about the Bo play a six you will hear
how how ridiculous it suddenly starts
sounding above half volume this is
horrible a speaker 4000 euros I mean I
got it for way way cheaper but anyhow
it's it's horrible and the Harman Kardon
coin play compared this to two words
really it's the same with the JBL
trashed winter bose soundlink mini the
Soundlink mini starts doing really
strange stuff at higher levels why this
charge three plays normally just like it
was recorded of course there is some
bass reduction at higher levels it's
it's normal the small drivers cannot be
moved like that but it's still way
better than many others because for
example if had the sony xperia which
sounded better with treble but
also started to compress quite a lot at
high levels so you lost all Peaks and
the Sun became more sausage while here
you could hear any attack so JBL has
definitely the best processing of all
JBL Harman Kardon of all companies I
have tried no yet they just need to
optimize it even further with dynamic
adjustment with whatever yeah this was
just a video about I don't know how to
tweak the JBL charge 3 yet best week
would be to add - Twitter's here at the
upper side most of the time you will
listen to the speaker from above I mean
you place it on the ground seat and the
the sound should emit a bit more upwards
therefore it's stupid to place Twitter's
here they should be either here or
directly at the top so you can also hear
it well from behind so far I think
nobody really did something like that
yeah let's see what the charge for will
look like and sound I hope it will sound
even better than this because this has
some really nice hi-fi high end touch to
it just missing this treble definition
but bass is already better than many
other larger speakers we've heard the
bass boom is quite a bit larger but
struggles with bass and this one plays
completely clean
so yeah nothing has to say about the
charge 3 for anyone who likes it yeah
continue liking it for those who don't
like it yeah maybe let's wait for the
successor model success in model the JBL
charge for let's hope gabion improves it
to exceed even more until then yeah
let's stay tuned and see you in the next
video bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
