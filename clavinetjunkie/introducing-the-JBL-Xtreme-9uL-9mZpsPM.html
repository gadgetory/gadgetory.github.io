brand new JBL Xtreme this is not going
to be a review or something
I had the speaker for just two days but
I think it's really worth mentioning
many people are always asking me which
is the best portable speaker well I
never had any answer because either the
speakers are not powerful enough they
have too much bass too little bass the
battery is too weak or something so I
really couldn't recommend one single
speaker but after having heard the JBL
Xtreme I think this is the best portable
speaker I've heard so far just keep in
mind this is rather an outdoor model
it's racked it's waterproof
water-resistant you see there is a zip
where all ports are covered so JBL
really takes the topic water-resistance
more serious now than with the JBL
charge 2 plus which has pods completely
unprotected and due to the fact that
it's an outer model it's also tuned as
an outer speaker it's really a very
powerful full-bodied sound I've never
heard something like that before
so it might sound a bit bass heavy let's
say indoors or if you don't like bass
look somewhere else this is all about
bass about powerful sound about loudness
if you for example thought the beats
pill XL is a great sounding speaker well
you will change your mind after having
tried the JBL extreme also this is not a
small speaker anymore let's have a look
this is the JBL charge 2 plus or you
know the old JBL charge tool so this is
a bigger speaker it's 2 kilograms and
but I think it's still handable I mean
if you if you're going on a beach or
something you can post it in a bag there
is a carrying strap included like this
so you can attach it and carry it on
your shoulder
so it's really nice I mean it's not a
speaker for the jacket pocket but it's
not much larger than a Soundlink 3 for
example or a mega boom
of course it's bigger but I mean the
sound you get is also much more serious
this is not a toy this is a powerful
sound cannon a bazooka or something
I cannot say much else about it apart
that it has some slight bugs for example
if you skip tracks it will always
swellow the first second also the
welcome tones are a bit annoying let's
have a listen when it connects is
another tone ok i'm in flight mode now
so it doesn't work and i think up to
$300 300 for $2.99
it's one of the most impressive speakers
i've heard so far keep please keep in
mind that i'm not affiliated with JBL or
some other company at all in fact I
contacted JBL if they would would be
willing to provide me a real sample they
didn't even answer I bought this with my
own money i pre-ordered it two weeks ago
because I was really interested and I
thought JBL could have something really
special
they came or they released it at a
really perfect timing because now that
the pill Excel has been has been called
back by Apple I mean this is a much
better alternative this is it's I mean
it's it's much more serious sounding we
will hear this later also many people
are asking me at compare this with that
compare this with please keep in mind
I'm just a private person I'm buying the
stuff with my own money I have a family
I make this all in my spare time I have
maybe two three hours a week where I can
do some videos so I will do of course
more sound comparisons but as for now we
will try to hear how ridiculous the JBL
charge too
sounds now compared against the JBL
extreme I mean the j/p HRO is one of the
best sounding portable speakers in its
class but the JBL extreme makes it sound
toys I will of course where my binaural
microphones and my head cam and we will
have a short listen
so please enjoy I set them up here so
please put up your headphones it's quite
a bit mini today so definitely not the
best conditions for such a test but I
hope we can anyhow get a first idea the
JBL charge 2 is playing at close to
maximum volume the extreme is about two
thirds and I will start playing with the
extreme heavy listen
charge tool okay let's turn it up to
maximum you can extreme
we are still about two-thirds I mean I
can turn it up a little bit this is
maximum volume now the charge to maximum
volume can extreme
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
