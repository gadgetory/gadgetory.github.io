we've just got a pipe burst recently and
I didn't want to make you wait
because I got something very interesting
a new speaker and I wanted to do a quick
sound check despite all the problems
here that's the river towable X River is
the new trademark of Californian audio
company audio design experts led by
audio legend Ricky far and the tuba X is
their first product a portable Bluetooth
speaker I will try to compare the turbo
X against my soul favorite speaker
infinity one and as you can see I didn't
have the guts to remove the protection
yet because both speakers are claimed to
have some kind of water protection but
the river is quite sensitive here as you
can see it's all glossy paint the
Infinity on the other hand has some
unusual chemic coating which is also
prone to scratches as you can see the
turbo X has some kind of touch control
it lights up if you come closer to the
surface here let's turn both on a peg
thanks to an app you have different
options for example you can you can
change the voice prompts for tones
within the app you have some controls
like on the surface here where is the
surround button this should work well
with movies and enhance the stereo with
even further there is also a turbo mode
which makes the volume go up to 11 for
the subject I will be wearing binaural
microphones as usual
so please put up your headphones to get
the most realistic sound impression of
how they sound in reality okay first
I'll start with the Infinity one then
switch over to the river 2 by X they can
for them
also here I think you can hear that
there's lots of interim modulation
distortion you can hear how that bass
affects all the treble and well this is
typical for the infinity one or just
live with it
well yeah quite a mess let's have a
listen to that
yeah the infinity is full of
intermodulation distortion again well
let's try another track maybe an easier
one
I think also here here it's clear that
the infinity one has some problems with
intermodulation distortion the song
sounds a bit messy let's try something
else
yeah the infinity one has a bit clearer
sound but just on overall sound response
I would say that the river to xsf letter
sound with better bass deeper bass let's
see how they compare at maximum volume
for this I will I will turn them to the
maximum and put them aside a little bit
both up on to the maximum now and I will
start again with the infinity one
you can see our little dragon I think he
liked the river also more thanks for
watching how are you you're in my body
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
