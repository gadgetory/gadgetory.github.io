a look and also listen to the quite
popular quite hyped Nura phone yeah
there was lots of buzz around this
headphone when it was released I think
it was also quite a successful
Kickstarter campaign so what is this a
wireless bluetooth headphone over here
with some in a penis let's say it has NC
and some unique sound personalization it
already costs $500 so thanks to Richard
one of my viewers for lending me them he
sent them over from Norway so they took
a long way to arrive your phone says
listen to music with its full color so
here let's have a look inside you can
see already the packaging is quite
modern quite unique this is the box it
comes in the headphone itself you can
see these penises here so it's not an
over Iran either I'm not quite sure the
kind of hybrid maybe you're inside other
wires also held by some magnet quite
nice so design wise it could definitely
win some prizes it comes with some wires
for charging also a 3.5 millimeter and a
lightning cable but you cannot use it if
it's not charged so if it's completely
discharged it won't work
also the wire holder here is very very
loose so it just needs there is nothing
that holds it in place and yeah you can
see this strange penises so it not only
looks weird but also feels a little bit
on your head apart from that it's quite
comfortable very nice build quality
really high it looks precious doesn't
have any buttons so it turns on if you
pull it up then after some time you get
some voice prompt telling you oh yeah
welcome all of of course first you have
to install the neuro phone app register
or login with some Facebook account
without any account you cannot do
anything with it and then you
personalize the sound this is an
automatic procedure it plays some with
tones takes maybe 2-3 minutes I recorded
the whole procedure when i pull it up
here on my ears i wanted to make some
personalization for the ears so at the
very end of the video i will play this
listen and also see what's going on here
but first maybe yeah let's listen with
my own personal profile without and with
and later on we'll talk about the sound
so it was not easy to record it let
alone measure it because it's not an
in-ear and it doesn't react as an over
here usually I would apply the over ear
or headphone compensation while in this
case it's rather an in-ear compensation
and then on top of this I like some
equalization simply because it didn't
sound like in reality but now I think
I'm pretty close sound bias and I will
play analog from supplement princess
region first it will hear the original
track from two bars or something and
then I will play it with neutral so
without any personalization then with my
own personalization with the
personalization of the ears or free chat
which is still you have three presets
you cannot save more which is also a
pity because yeah if you want to
personalize it for your wife or your son
or whatever you can get out of place but
let's say listen and later on we'll talk
about the sound
I think you would hear without any
personalization or neutral let's say
naked it sounds like crap way to boo me
way too muddy at the same time while
with personalization it doesn't improve
at all so you make some junk out of crap
you get some harshness in the presence
we can still lacking any treble
refinement and the basis still undefined
you can add this immersion effect but
this just add some droning some boo
meanness horrible just horrible and
every time I try to perform a new
profile it became different so you
probably also noticed the sound shift
towards the left side if you turn on
some profile first I thought maybe one
of my use his differently there for the
shift but it was with all her profiles
with with this from Richard with this
that I created for the ears the sound
always shifts to the left so I'm not
quite sure what all this webbing is
about it just some TSP tricks some
trickery which doesn't help to improve
the solid or they really try to make a
crappy sounding headphone sound like
junk
it still doesn't sound great regardless
which profile I tried the one from
Richard
sounds similar to mine but not really
better I mean it sounds on a level of a
maybe $30 headphone design is great yeah
but that was it I mean a course Casey 75
sounds better than this
doesn't have this booming us it's not an
active noise cancel cancelling headphone
but sounds simply way more natural maybe
some of you noticed I added some
headphones to my speaker audio database
just type headphone in the keywords
field and you will find all included
headphones together the new reform and
you will hear it sound just horrible
I didn't include it with my personal
profile because everyone will get
something different but I think it audio
should sound great from scratch without
any I don't know trickery but it sounds
just muddy it sounds really cheap and
yeah I think it's just some scam I'm not
quite sure how they can ask $500 for it
the app is nice I mean this
personalization it makes you think it
improves but even after this improvement
it's still junk I mean take a Sennheiser
HD 58 X you believe for $150 this
completely blows it away I mean they are
not even comparable this is not even
close
it just some Samsung I don't know I yeah
it's it's a joke it's really a joke and
I saw some videos from trusted reviews
they gave it a high rating so really not
sure what all this junk is I mean check
it out from a database compare it to
some really great Sonning compare it to
the original track and yeah it should be
clear it should be obvious that this is
just ran some some some vapor where
Samsung I have know some really horrible
joke yeah I can account provide you any
measurements as it's hard to measure it
maybe with some standardized system like
grass or whatever it would work but with
my system it doesn't work so the
measurement look weird but it also
sounds weird
these penises okay I mean you can get
used to it but it's still nothing here
I'm quite quite shocked again what kind
of crap I mean here on Amazon you get 46
customer reviews and most of them are
five stars so what gives
how can this be even three stars I'm not
sure we design ok packaging everything
nice high quality high end but that's it
hardest
better take some cost KC 75 for 15 or 10
dollars from mez drop and this will
satisfy you more sunrise it's still not
a great sounding headphone but way
better than this year so I'm quite
shocked thanks again to reach out I hope
you can sell this to someone because
yeah and Richard already told me look
it's so bad I want to hear your opinion
on this and I think I personally find it
even worse than him because he tried
creating several profiles for himself
and I also saw all his profiles look
different do you get this nice curve
demonstrating you the frequency response
of your ears or something I'm also quite
sure how they measure this because yeah
it should be consistent but every time I
put it on made the profile again it came
out differently still the sound was
never great regardless which profile a I
used so it's quite quite bad maybe for
this price for 400 or is it $500 it's
one of the worst I've ever had maybe
even worse than this Adira although the
idea was really crappy really really
horrible so maybe it's on the same level
as this this oh dear
what was it is something if $500 come on
yeah yeah now I will just at the end I
will let you listen again through the
whole of profile is a ssin process here
which takes away so we will hear some
funny
funky tones playing and I hope you liked
this video a little bit but it's really
it's shocking how bad this is especially
I mean why does the shift at the sound
shift towards the left side you should
broken maybe or doesn't or nobody hears
this oh what's what's what's the point
here but yeah sorry for all those here
for all those who bought this and who
think this is great because you really
wasted $500 for this you can get 5 6
decent headphones for the same price
which blows away justice all day long
and I mean it's not that comfortable
that
I would like to wear it all the time
with this penis inside major so I will
rather take some real in ear and then
have some decent sound because this this
immersion effect just ridiculous you add
some media it shakes your head what is
this you cannot listen to music like
that yeah but I will stop now listen to
that if you are interested at the end
you will hear some demo track which
comes with this app so I will switch
between the modes which it created for
the ear system here but apart from that
yeah horrible horrible really really I
am so shocked
also naughty I don't understand how
other youtubers can even yeah pick the
seriously this product because it's it's
just like this Adira which was just a
pity I didn't have this system yet but
the audio sounded even even worse than
this yeah thanks all for watching and
let's begin first you'll hear some tones
as I check to see if the ear tips are
firmly in your ears adjust the position
of your neuro phones until both ticks
appear and remain constant good job now
take your hands off your neuro phones
and sit still while I run a quick check
of your ears I'm now going to learn how
you hear music keep still and don't
speak this will take about a minute
all done your Nura hearing profile has
been created you'll now hear some music
played in neutral mode without your
hearing profile applied adjust the
volume is desired and when you're ready
press the personalize button to switch
to music in full color
