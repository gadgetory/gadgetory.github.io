give you a short quick impression about
the TD ka8 or Trek me just for the sake
of completeness as I have covered lots
of other TD case because already like
this correct micro here then correct
class track max I think there are some
others but these are pretty decent so it
would be interesting to know how this
one says so far I didn't quite catch my
attention but some commoner told me that
yeah it's pretty decent and cheap so I
should check it out I found it on the
German Amazon store for 8 euros in pink
so pretty cheap
usually it goes for a bit more like 22
dollars here you can see the old micro
track for $34 yet and yeah let's have a
look
so a mono speaker with some passive
radiator below yeah maybe you can see
this behind the flap I think it has some
i think i PX rating so it should be
water splash resistant something you can
see the main power switch usually it
should be off otherwise it will probably
drain the battery you can see an
auxiliary and micro USB and yeah let's
close it again which is not that easy
usually you would place it probably like
that for it more omnidirectional samples
you can see TDK also designed it to be
placed like this so more directional
like a horn or something
the design is nice I mean pink is a bit
questionable but yeah it was the
cheapest one for 8 euros for eight years
it's definitely decent so we should
check it out and yeah you can see
nothing really just a power switch no
volume buttons usually you do everything
fro through your phone or tablet or
whatever but yeah it's $20 you can
already get maybe this anchor sound coil
mini also mini track mini anchors from
kamini
which i think is a little bit yes more
decent but before having listens let's
check out a frequency response
measurement of the GDK and you can see
yeah there is some heavy
upper bass boost at around 200 300 suits
again some treble boost a bit higher
there is no dynamic adjustment for all
those but that maximum it doesn't really
reduce
based that much either we can have a
look compared to the anchor and you can
see the anchor doesn't have the strong
upper base book but that base which is a
little bit lower you can see there is
still some response at around 80 even
below 80 Hertz so the anchor will
probably sound less boomy but with a
little bit more time so we will have a
listen for the how these two compare as
always I'm of course using binaural
microphones so let's have a listen I
will play a track from soul persona or
so person up against princess freesia
which should reveal all differences in
bass response quite well so I will start
with a track me first please have a
listen
yes rebel seems also a little bit
directional the anchor you can hear a
slightly more punch from the base but
let's our bass player it doesn't have
this Moxie character this sounds a
little fuller but doesn't have the
sponge fill Eclipse
people from pepper is placed in a more
on the directional way probably this
reason why they really consider this
this way of placement
I think the answer is slightly more
upper base for still retaining the lower
base with really shine you can hear some
nice balanced sound but nothing really
special pediatric munition practice yoga
like that is no hair it's a little
cooler
we could compare it may be again some
other sticker like this Phillips
I think it's called pixel pop or
something it's there bt 110 110 which i
think yeah
it's not really that decent so how how
does it turn on doesn't know it should
yeah no I think the PDK consider it is
better than the Philips so let's have a
listen to another track a both are
connected both are no no future there's
a finish for all of them is bit you can
hear the Fed think that important for
measuring volume right and already
they're close to maximum this isn't
normal
we're not quite back you know from
stranger impression or limiting going on
home and much responsibility it has some
more Trebek battle cradle pockets and
presence parking storage let's try this
I mean it's nothing special but it's
okay for you if you really can get it
for eight-year-old the village council
is it 20 minutes determine to make you
into a pattern this is maximal affiliate
the TDK they're not that loud
but no distortion or kind of trance
funky things going on
yet maximum the village
maybe has in slices but slight edge but
you could definitely hear some strange
sound processing here so yeah it's
turned off again comparing it maybe
against my favorite hominid which knows
all the other ultra portable compact
because away yes so if you can spend $10
more something I would definitely I
would definitely get the xiaomi has it's
by far the best ultra portable speaker
will hear this with the next song hell
yeah I would maybe try mixing volume
little bit better so um yeah and I'll
track the CD case playing on so me
let's go choose one classic American
better I think you can be a much better
punch here much much more even count
responsible box in and crap little punk
like a mini high five systems which will
rectify am always appreciate lower
levels if you don't listen that loud TDK
is really boring with here sounds like
some mini speaker
and this has this mature sound no
comparable to larger speakers like I
don't know like a bottle and 20 maybe
this sound yeah not insecurity or rather
clock-radio like you let's try next
canary success only you can hear this
treatise even out slightly at maximum as
yes the only difference of the Xiaomi
contact all the others including this
tip slop popper I know is that it has
some real DSP processing included which
always tries to keep the bass on a
higher level so if you turn up volume it
will reduce the bass accordingly while
the others only have a general tuning
and it always sounds the same with a
little estate at low levels or at
islands so mostly they sound great or
let's say acceptable at maximum but at
lower level stays on adjusting so yeah
track me or however yeah my phone
records trick me is nothing that special
I really expected from all of it yes the
comments are told it's really decent I
mean it's not bad but it's really
nothing special if you don't get it
below $10 for $10 yeah definitely nice
speaker better than many others like all
these odd me which is they are horrible
you could see it has a nice balanced
sound but this upper bass boost made
makes it appear a bit boxy I think is
also an acoustical trick to boost upper
base more to
- try simulate lower base you could hear
it sounded a little bit fuller than the
anchor maybe the anchor had more punch
but but still the PDK had a little bit
fuller sound because of this upper base
book so yes
coming up next some others because I
have the show-me Wi-Fi speaker which is
not battery driven just AC power button
having problems with the app which is
only in Chinese so I could just show you
the sound but not all the features it
has lots of features even memory built
in so you can save songs directly on the
speaker take some yeah really extended
Wi-Fi functions but I cannot really use
them as VIPs in Chinese and I don't
understand the worth it even has voice
control and everything so really nice
speaker for around hundred twenty
dollars I think yeah more comparators
Sonos play:1 maybe so stay tuned I hope
I will manage this I also have a sony
SRS x-77 I caught my attention thanks to
one of my viewers been Alan Ross who
compared it to the Alt key and claimed
it to be way better well I don't think
so but we will see this in the next
video so thanks for watching and see you
then bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
