going to check out a wearable device
well not really this is the fool go a
portable rugged waterproof out of
speaker which thanks to this loop here
can be tethered to objects or made even
longer you can let it hang from your
neck back in my case which is quite
funny and I went out is this an auto
speaker which sounds better at high
levels and I also thought to compare it
against a ue one the boom that i have to
send to the winner of the giveaway
tomorrow so this is the last time and
last video I will use the Wonder boom
but you can of course compare them also
to my speaker audio database both
included the Wonder boom even with its
double up port which doesn't support
stereo the fugu goes two of them support
stereo or double up mode and I think in
stereo taste sounds really great but
before having a listen let's check out
maybe some frequency response
measurements and you can see it in its
normal mode and it also has an auto mode
shown in green and you can see the sound
is quite a bit meat focused there is
some bass below hundred Hertz but it
rolls off much too early
auto mode reduces bass and treble even
further so I would rather stick to
normal mode in most cases as the full
goal is designed to be more
omnidirectional speaker here in pink you
can see a measurement of X's which shows
the treble loss is not that strong even
when listen from lower angles
unfortunately at low levels there is no
dynamic bass adjustment but it manages
to keep most of its base Inlet maximum
although some stronger compression and
limiting can start to become noticeable
I think the most interesting feature of
the full go is it stereo pairing ability
just like the Wonder boom but this only
supports double up mode instead a sounds
really great and sometimes you get a
single one below $50 so two for the
price of a singer wonder boom which is I
think a bargain I like using them for
example on my scooter with one hanging
on the left side the other one on the
right and they managed to really come
from great telephone
Oh
and I also think
although the Peugeot is completely
waterproof it doesn't float so many
thoughts into water you have to fish it
out again it won't sound that great like
this anymore but you can simply drive by
removing the cover pulling it with this
fuga flap here but now yes let's compare
it against the Yui water boom as always
I will get my head cam and my binaural
microphones of course you should listen
with adults for the best results please
put them up and let's check them out
it's quite noisy today lots of planes
lots of wind but these are Auto speaker
so nevertheless meant for higher levels
but first I would like to demonstrate
you the directivity of the football
which is meant to be an operation
speaker which in reality it isn't it is
just to firing up drivers and if I start
a song from savasana you can hear that
the treble changes slightly but it's
also quite reasonable from iOS of course
not from below now you can place it like
this for a more directional sound or
simply basis left for a more directional
one where it's also this outer mode
which I would like to demonstrate you
now
so keep the mode button pressed for some
seconds and we are in outer mode but the
difference is sadly noticeable I will
switch back to his normal
you can maybe hear that bass became a
bit more pronounced but still it doesn't
have any taste compensation for low
levels so it rather sounds better at
high level so let's increase volume a
bit higher and in fact listen to the
launder bone for comparison and you can
hear it the football hit some nice punch
a little bit missing from the Wonder
boom maybe let's try a track analog from
focus on princess region you can hear it
well their face from this trend up quite
nicely causes lots of problems with some
speakers wander boom
they're both nose a little bit on
particular angles it really depends if
you are listening to one driver exactly
or in between I think you can hear that
the over goes on to the more dynamic
this machine is not a thumb and you can
give it a face count a little bit well
strange Google as I said more dynamic
and you know
welcome also here the bass drum this is
a wonderful play now
so the Fugo definitely feels slightly
cleaner we are around 3/4 volume now but
if I would use volume on the Rondo boom
here it starts to boost grace slightly
and the face will become even get more
distorted this is have volume I will go
now and although it's fuller you get a
strange kind of distortion the other
hand discussed some entertainment
another fact 3a listen
increasing volume with the tire wonder
boom and you can already hear some very
personal intimate relation area let's
increase them to make them and the one
of them
it looks like a louder
you can maybe hear from earth volume
filtration because of a little teeny
little bit get strong on particular
trade so in this case the one album on
TV better I will play another song
pretty depends on its own with some
frequencies the limited swadisthana for
all other wonderful becomes quite
massive definitely the fun really starts
if you connect to for stereo so I will
take the second one of course I have to
turn it on first and pairing is done by
keeping Bluetooth and plus press for two
seconds or something the same on victims
and first they always connecting double
up modisett para double and then we have
to switch to stereo so this is the left
one is the right one and we can have a
listen how they sound now so if you can
get two for the price of one thing
wonderful I think this is technically
worth it in magenta message
one of them coming little bitch
[Laughter]
most hands on another phone will reduce
volume some motors in education it to
make them little bit more comfortable I
think you can hear the differences come
on maybe see if we can place an epic
saga one of them
marathon and against increasing volatile
maximum
you can again hear the limiter maybe we
could try setting auto mode if this
improves a little bit
so again increasing fall into maximum
I think it sounds quite nice and they
wonderful they also let them know
now we can get some
you can still hear them struggling it
are the Wonder boom starts pounding
quite a bit soft mode</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
