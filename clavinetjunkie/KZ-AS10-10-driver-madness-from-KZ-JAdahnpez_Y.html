gonna take a look at the case that a is
ten which is a five Trevor in here yeah
five travels per one side so ten drivers
altogether I'm not quite sure what to
say about it with one Singh word it
sounds off to me yeah I know there are
many reviewers who are praising it also
had flux seem to like it
I usually got them quite highly they
have a nice measurement database but
already from the measurement you can see
that it cannot sound good
still I got many comments asking me to
review it because it's one of the best
from Kaiser but I really wouldn't say so
it sounds a lot crappy and to justify my
opinion I would like to offer you some
sound samples later on also some
measurements but first let's have a look
inside as the presentation is really
precious so you really have the
impression of having some high quality
product here you know with the sheets
written okay set a is ten ten drivers
balanced armature earphone not quite
sure why you need the sheet here so I
will take them out they have this I'm
not sure what the connector is called
cable is quite nice it because a small
remote here at the right side so there
is also some small lettering right so
this is the right one let's connect them
left this is right
so quite flimsy and they're quite big
also looking nice transparent here
written case that you can see some icy
circuits inside so looking quite nice
although they're big I think still quite
comfortable to carry better than many
others edges are run around it so they
are not uncomfortable but yeah it's all
about the sound and I think they just
don't sound right to me and I would like
to demonstrate to this with some sound
samples and I would like to compare it
against a simple single driver in here
from Sony quite an old one which was I
think also bundled with some phones
there's only image one it's not the best
sounding but I think for this price for
what it is a very simple chip in here
it's definitely one of the best
and then you should hear that their case
of a stance on simply off keep my son
samples always with a little bit over of
a reservation they are not meant to be
taken absolutely it also depends a lot
which headphones you are using for
recording I still try to optimize my
recording technique because it's really
not easy to record in years as yes yeah
react quite differently for resonance
and so on but it should demonstrate the
relative difference is quite well from
the Sony and in case that a is 10 so if
you hear one has more bass or one has
more treble it's correct just that the
overall response or the episode response
can sound a little bit of depending on
which headphones you listening to so
let's have a listen I will play just one
sing song from so person I'm princess
freedom and first we will hear the case
at a is 10 then this one image 1 then
again then a is 10 and again this only
MH 1 so there are two changes and at the
very end you will hear the original
track just to have a reference how how
they should sound so let's have a listen
you are in my thoughts I never stray
from the heart of you come to me
damn
am i searching you I wanna feel
I think everyone could hear that there
is some weirdness going on especially in
the upper mids it just doesn't sound
right there is some hunkiness
some hollowness some cheapness to the
sound and therefore I'm not quite sure
how someone with a good decent hearing
can regard this as decent sounding
because it just doesn't it sounds really
off and when looking at some
measurements I would like to show them
uncompensated to make them or compare it
to the others
keep in mind and these are made with
this year's measurement system so they
are not normed or like those
standardized coupler couplers but it
should still give you an idea and you
can see there is way too much response
above 2 kilohertz and there are several
peaks at 4 kilohertz at 5 kilohertz then
again some strange race at six kilohertz
again a peak at 10 kilohertz
it sounds like some comp filter it just
doesn't sound right I mean everyone who
who has a good hearing should hear that
this doesn't sound right then meets a
completely colored processed yeah when I
overlay the Sony image one here in black
you can see that it's way smoother bass
is even slightly less although from the
recording it appeared more Bhumika me
maybe and it doesn't have this weirdness
in the upper mids it's just a smooth
curve without any lumps bumps whatever
so I'm not sure why people could like
this yeah also the problem you get with
many drivers is they need some crossover
which has an influence on the phase
response
I will overlay a phase response for the
case at a s10 and you can see it
switches at 40 Hertz we are at 121 no we
are at hundred eighty degrees while at 7
kilo Hertz we are at minus 20 degrees
therefore this this driver madness I
think that if already six driver in ears
have one side I mean who needs this just
human one singer are correctly and you
don't need
very not sure what this madness does
this craziness 4:10 I would like to hear
one with ten drivers porn sites I'm sure
there will be some manufacturers who
will do this but the es10 is just
unreasonable I mean if you have no
reference if you think wrong xerocon
sounds great then of course this sounds
better but it's not an India that that
is meant to listen to music it just
doesn't sound good
it sounds off and that's the truth it's
not my years it's probably those ears
from those who who claim it's good you
could see for the measurement it just
some some bumpiness hits and even with a
standardized cupola you will you will
see that there is some zigzag in the
response curve which is not normal
the human ear already has resonances
inside at 9 5 kilohertz and so on if you
add some additional ones it sound just
horrible and this is what the case at a
s10 does you could use you get you could
get used mini to the sound after some
time if you listen for an hour you think
yeah it sounds ok but it still it's not
meant to sound like this I mean it
sounds off and their part and a little
bit surprised about all this crepeiness
that is out there and gets praised for
many from many- shure se215 which just
doesn't sound good
they all sound off just listen how to or
learn how to listen get a decent pair of
in years a really decent one and start
from there and then build up and try
finding a better one but don't think
this is a great sounding one it isn't
like most k said in ear stage sound just
off with some really strange response
curves strange hello
so yes my take on the case at s10 it
sounds just off unusable for me maybe
there are many who who can live with
this sound but I couldn't it doesn't
sound normal
it doesn't sound like a sound like the
sound was recorded like it's meant to be
it doesn't have anything to do with
v-shaped u-shaped
no the Sony is already vishay
it has a quite a strong treble and bass
boost this is v-shaped but it still
sounds natural normal this doesn't it's
not v-shaped it's bumpy shaped yeah
really I'm shocked I'm disappointed with
all this Miss misinformation claiming
this sounds good and and praising crappy
in years with just doesn't sound good
therefore I will probably stop with all
this because it doesn't make sense I can
talk and show you that it's crappy and
you will still try to convince me that
it's great and I have no idea I think
it's the other way around because yeah
these are unusable and I would never if
I was the manufacturer I would never
like to put this on the market and not
sure why they do this because most case
that Indians have a very strange
response the cheapest one this a te is
maybe their best one although I think
there are some simple variations as I
had to and both sounded completely
different the 80ies should sound flatter
with bass but it's more bass heavy than
my 80 still the one unit I have the a te
from cassette is probably their best
sounding one but this is unusable with
ten drivers and weirdness going on with
phase response and and frequency
response so I will stop now because it
doesn't make sense maybe this is my last
review before Christmas
my last eniac I had so many I wanted I
planned to do so many more but we will
have to wait probably until next year I
hope to find some really decent ones I
had this moon drop crap how do you
proceed in crescendo Crescent quiescent
quiescent which is really decent I was
comparing back and forth between their
Sun image one and the Crescent or
crescent cruising and I am torn which
one sounds better but for $30 this blows
this completely away this is just crap
compared I have many other others coming
which are stuck at the customs now for
one month there is not no progress so
the Austrian custom customs clerks are
really very busy
but yeah maybe next year we will find
some really great ones but this forget
all the hype about cases in years is one
stick a set as teeth whatever they sound
like they just don't sound good thing of
finger finger weak hands no how do you
say in English
stay off from his head get maybe the 88
is the cheapest one for six seven
dollars which sounds okay but every
other one is just unusable
yeah thanks all for watching I hope I
didn't blow you too much but someone
asked me I told him it's crap you cannot
reduce this to a single word tell me why
it script so I hope I could show you why
it's crappy because the frequency
response is just that isn't right if the
sound isn't right there is too much
going on in the upper mids which makes
the sound appear very very artificial
very honky the first thing I did when I
tried them on I was shocked what the
hell is this if you don't get this
impression when you when you listen with
them then something must must must be
wrong on your side yeah that was it
thanks for watching if this is my last
video for this I hope I doubt I will
have much time during Christmas during
during New Year so very nice time every
nice Christmas I hope I can still manage
some sampler video with some great
products until then stay tuned have a
nice time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
