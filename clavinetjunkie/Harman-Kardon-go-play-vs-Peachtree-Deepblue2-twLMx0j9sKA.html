going to make our first soundcheck of
the brand-new Harman Kardon go into play
and I thought we'll compare it against a
peach tree deep blue first why the peach
tree well I sold it so I have to send it
away and there will be no other occasion
and according to the wire cutter this is
the best home blow to speaker they
compared many devices including the
Zeppelin Wireless and the Marshall Act
on but for them the peach tree did Pluto
is best they claim against Bluetooth
speakers that cost almost twice as much
deep blue - sounds almost as good and in
some cases better so why not compare it
against the best one here you see them
both I already showed you how the Harman
Kardon looks without grill I would like
to show you again because I think it
looks really badass it would fit into
any youth room and I don't know this
looks really nice and of course with
cover it fits also in any living room I
really like this design with the steel
grip this is a bit yeah boxy nothing
special and I will treat both a
stationary unit so I will attach the
Harman Kardon also to means it will
become a bit powerful Harman Kardon
claims hundred watts when powered from
mains while this has 440 so this will be
definitely a bit louder we will check
this later on yeah let's turn it on
these are the welcome tones from among
cotton a bit better than Chaka boom but
still here you cannot turn them off and
as always i'm of course using high
quality binaural microphones please
listen headphones and first i thought we
will check the base response of both
because i have a track from NCS which
has some deep bass notes so please have
a listen
the bass goes like this here it starts
with G 1 a 1 B 1 and B 2 and G 1 is
around 50 Hertz so 49 which of course is
not that bad I will turn them slightly
louder and let's have a listen again you
technically hear all all notes here
let's try the Diplo too as well
I think you can hear that the Harman
Kardon sounds a bit more refined this
sounds a bit clunky I don't know but
they both play down below 50 Hertz at
least I don't know the Harman Kardon
plays around 40 Hertz the Peachtree even
a bit deeper I think but yet let's have
a listen to another song
I will try matching volume for both
the proton
yeah the Peachtree sounds a bit more
boxy I have the base set to two half
maybe will increase bass later on but
first let's have a listen to a track
from Sanchez oh yeah
this is it now I tried selecting quite
bass heavy recordings that contain also
some nice lower deep place the tip Pluto
I will try increasing pace want to not
compare
our motor sounds a bit trapped among
cotton has a much more open sound also
it the music seems to float around the
speaker let's have another listen to
another track from sanitizer also some
nice deep bass here we are this thing
already
owners already have slightly higher
levels I mean it's a big speaker sauce
it's not very satisfying
right right I think it sounds really
nice the deep blue - hi
now we could try creasing pace to
maximum but you'll hear what happens
it's horrible I will reduce base to well
one full notch below maximum yeah I
think this sounds much more convincing
and a crack so this is the base here we
want some real nicely face turn the
volume you want to feel through the
platoon let's to Bhumi the base has some
hosting the upper agenda Suns on Sealand
reducing pace we'll make it please call
it a yo ice and snow last year's 20
degrees and dust my Stevens Alberto
Ferragamo slacks Luciana get ones on a
day off waves that stays talking here we
go keep on handled pack no hell no it's
on here they don't match commentators
gotta be against got me hands for me
another crack from resolution 88 a
British jazz funk dope the deep platoon
go and play again it has this open sound
from something else
this llamas the bass drum is holding
here
the proto
it's off by moving it louder
you
the Pluto
I will reduce the gain of my recorder so
that we can really crank them to maximum
you know how it's become softer and I
will turn both because the maximum now
we're going to play as well
your software
other threats are you here no distortion
nothing even at maximum from both units
although that people to get out a bit
strange I will try with using volume and
makes it more to an amicable on the
slice the amicable feel sounds better
although playing at maximum maybe you
can hear some very slight hint of inter
modulation but still minimal the loop
who has a huge woofer inside another
track
some loud noises
here the difference is in loudness is
definitely obvious but I still think the
current play sounds better I will raise
volume again to my usual gain so yeah
sound wise the pitch 3d Bluetooth didn't
convince me that much it's louder but
you know you can be attach the Harman
Kardon and use it on the go which you
cannot quite with the pitch Reedy Pluto
and we can of course continue listening
to music and yeah something which you
cannot quite do with people to take it
to the garden I know put it into your
kitchen or simply here so yeah I hope
you like this very first sound check
will of course compare it against many
other units including the old Harman
Kardon gone play which I will hopefully
get in two weeks maybe two three weeks
we'll also compare it against the German
powerful boom stir I don't have the boom
store excel anymore which is also a bit
louder but yeah I think this sounds
definitely better then all units I have
heard so far if you like bass if you
like a powerful punchy sound I think
this is the unit to go with it costs
$2.99 so the same price which you pay
for for a JBL extreme yeah its larger
but sounds definitely much better I hope
this was helpful for a first impression
yeah stay tuned for more videos coming
of the Harman Kardon play I can already
tell you it's worth it and yeah if you
like the sound signature or if you like
the Peachtree I think you will be even
more satisfied with the cheaper Harman
Kardon won't play it's a wonderful unit
and if you don't mind the size you can
even I don't know you I mean you can use
it as some replacement for a home stereo
it's really the sound is very broad very
be very spacious so a great unit thanks
for watching and we will see us in the
next video bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
