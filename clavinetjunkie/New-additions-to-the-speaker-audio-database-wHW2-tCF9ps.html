additions to my speaker audio database
in the meantime added lots of recordings
so the speaker list is growing
constantly I think we are approaching
around 150 different speakers included
you can see what's new here starting
with the razor Leviathan that is not
represented because i already send it
back but you will hear how it sounds
against some others because coasting
around hundred fifty hundred sixty
dollars it's not completely bad but
really nothing outstanding for the price
then here we have the omega w for that
we've heard recently i also did a kind
of forest one video with it which of
course not was not meant that seriously
but i recorded the omega w4 in two
different ways one standing on a
resonating surface so that he can rattle
around you get this kind of fake base
similar to many vibrating speakers which
of course gives a bit more full-bodied
song but the base is not very clean then
I also recorded more dampened where you
will get the sound you usually get when
it's hanging somewhere I also thought to
include the tone bucks just for
comparison it's much smaller but doesn't
really sound that much worse so yeah
they are both really kinney sounding
next on being the denied magic box tool
that we've already heard in a video
within the database will hear that it's
nothing special really tinny sound no
base at all so I don't really understand
all those great ratings about it here
the bubble room 20 yeah I hope you
didn't get the impression as if I had
bested in my video it's really a decent
speaker really decent sound for my
personal taste it's lacking a little bit
with high loudness because distortion
creeps in pretty quickly also maybe I
got a lemon but my unit started to bust
slightly on the right driver and mine
discharges after seven days of no use so
if i charged it full don't use it after
seven days it won't turn on anymore
don't know if others have the same
problem but yeah apart from that it's
really a great speaker and for 79 or 80
dollars one of the best in my list i
think it outperforms the eclipse geek
easily flip 3 and so on it has really
nicely balanced sound with nice deep
bass treble is nice although higher
treble is missing but still pretty
pretty decent and yeah one of the best
although you will hear lots of
distortion on maximum volume something
you won't get from many other speakers
then we have the Devon boombox to or how
is it called boombox outdoor pool this
is the new model which has drivers at
the front and at the back so you get a
360-degree kind of sound it's really
nice because it can play pretty loud
louder than the flip three but still
remain pretty full bodied the sound has
some slight upper bass boost around 200
Hertz also treble is boosted slightly
but I think it sounds much better than a
UE boom with comparable loudness but no
dynamic compression and still pretty
pretty full base is compared to the ue
boom which loses all basic mixing it
just loud but nothing else so I think
the Devon boombox outdoor to is much
better for yet much less costing much
less we have the toy flip em star pro
here I did the German video about it
also an unboxing I think this is pretty
impressive thanks to this dynamo steroid
enhancing and you will hear within the
database how broad the sound really gets
the overall frequency response is maybe
not perfect it's lacking a little bit of
treble upper treble is completely
missing also base has a tendency to
drone but this starion hansung makes it
quite unique therefore I thought I will
also include the bose computer music
monitors they are neither Bluetooth nor
portable but I think they are really a
decent pair of computers because our
desktop speakers I was surprised how
well they sound through the database
there I mean nothing they don't distort
at maximum volume is maybe not the
highest but very clean sound not none of
this strange distortion get off most
other both something's because I mean
the sounding three of these thoughts
with every kick just like the Soundlink
mini does they play so clean and have
this nice treadle extension that the
soundings because are all missing my
hope originally because they are already
there
mod from to 2006 old 10 years old my
hope was always that both will release a
portable version of this they did with
the Soundlink but the sounding sounded
much worse than this so it would be
enough if they did some kind of wireless
stereo pairing maybe that they could
attach magnetically for charging a
rechargeable battery inside and this
would be a killer speak up there better
than most others in this size I mean
it's still even to it are not really
that big so it's a pity that both went
rather for it this soundlink book sized
models and later on the Soundlink mini
which sounds really bad compared to the
monitors I'm really impressed how nice
they sound and with the sound lik
monitors compared to the Dempster Pro
you can hear how much of a difference
you get regarding stereo imaging and so
on the both they both monitors are
standing 1 meter and a half apart with
me sitting around 1 meter 30 away so you
are really getting this perfect triangle
stereo triangle I think the best
approach has even slightly broader sound
of course it's a little bit more washed
out it's not as the stereo imaging is
not as precise as with a usual stereo
setup so far only the mini rex 2.1 are
included a stereo also my philips
osseous because i didn't have the chance
to record to flip free in stereo
unfortunately it would be also
interesting to hear how both sound like
that so yeah next one being the mini
Jambox i thought i will include it
because of my life audio unfortunately
the maximum volume is so low for
standard volume I already had to crank
volume close to maximum one notch below
maximum so you should get an idea about
standard volume how how loud it really
is because you really have to listen to
these recordings with the correct
listing loudness later on I thought I
will include a volume guide video with
me talking so that you hear how loud you
should set the volume but currently in
my research resources on it a little bit
limited for the database
but yeah the gem box is a pretty teenie
sounding speaker with life audio volume
drops even more so i had to boost volume
in post-processing because it was simply
too soft for my standard volume
recordings but you can hear if the
stereo imaging is as great as from the
powerful dempster pro the sound changes
a lot when switching from normal mode to
life audio while the outfit beamster pro
remains equal just that the sound
broadens up and I also included the full
XL without cover because i think that
the sports cover but also the style
cover or jacket swallows too much of the
sound you will hear it from the database
that it gets some slight hollowness and
treble becomes muffled when put inside
the jacket without jacketed sounds much
better from my taste it's a pity that
they went for this design another big
product of the food we excel is of
course distortion at high levels it
already starts around two thirds and
then it becomes worse and worse it's not
the typical distortion you get when base
distorts but it's rather crackling
scratching sound I think this is just
the amp that kind of amp overdrive
because yeah it's a pity otherwise this
would be a killer speak and if you
listen to the full naked compared to the
hammock ongoing play you will hear that
it's closer to the go and play them to
that JBL extreme it's really a seriously
theone speaker has some hollowness with
needs but still pretty pretty nice and
you get 360 degrees tell assault I also
added the serial and parallel p3 that is
already the p3 to the new version I
already packed it back because I would
like to sell it I mean it's nothing that
outstanding but it's a pretty nice
speaker wooden speaker with powerful
nice sounds although not perfect I
haven't measured it yet but I will
measure it and if my resources allow it
I will try to include measurements
unfortunately I thought the database
would steer up a bit more attention
interest so far after announcement I got
five donations I mean two of them were
really really big ones so thanks to
those but I cannot really continue
without any of your support I mean I
have three thousand thirty thousand
subscribers if everyone just donated 10
cents we could buy any speaker we would
like and include them into the database
currently I really don't have any budget
for enhancing the database any further
was including measurements and so on I
would have to talk with my program again
he would write some routines to make
some pop-ups maybe I don't know but I
invested with lots of money for the
database also lots of time to record all
these because you can see here I'm not
sure how many i have to record them in
standard volume with maximum volume with
two different modes like in the case of
the Omega so it took me several days to
really finish all of them including
editing so you can imagine to include
hundred fifty speakers how much time it
needs and also i need a calm day I mean
when cars are passing by or some some
planes I have to stop and record again
so recording which usually takes 10
minutes will take maybe half an hour for
just standard volume then I have to
repeat the same for mixing one so I
really hope you find this database
helpful and you I hope for some further
support from you otherwise I yeah it
will die before even having started I
currently don't have any budget to
really do anything new also no budget
for buying new speakers I got some news
because some free samples from from
China I will hopefully also get the
Archaea a320 some or a test about it
just a wooden bamboo speaker looking a
bit like the leg goes no male speakers
but i think the archer is even slightly
better and then upcoming next is the
puffer dempster the
the slim version it's a bit broader than
this so we will hear this one but
currently I cannot buy any news because
because yeah it's growing above my
budget so I hope you find this speaker
database switcher helpful have a listen
to the best approach against the
computer computer music monitors hold
those I think this is a really a decent
pair and it's a pity they didn't release
just a portable version all of it in
reality the very first released version
in Japan they were called micro music
monitors and they had a battery they had
a battery compartment so you could even
use them on the go but I think they lost
quite a bit of power when run from
debtor is then they took this feature
away and named them computer music
monitors yeah this is petey I would
really love to have them as spotted in
minutes I love them they have this nice
balance sounds some slight rattle boost
the bassist never over over done quite
nice balance myths yeah if I manage to
include measurements you will see how
they measure also that fool Excel you
will see that there are some slight
humps in the midst which makes probably
the sound as honky yeah this was it of
course as I get many other speakers i
will try to include them as well but i
need lots of time and patience so any
support is of course appreciate it so if
you have the will to donate please do so
and it will help me tool to continue
with all this it's still not very fluent
everything there are some slight bugs i
will i hope to to fix them with my
programmer for the really final version
but I think as it is now you can it can
already give you a very realistic
impression of how this because sound of
course it's just a snapshot of two
different loudness levels you only get
the idea how it sounds at this
particular level you won't know if it
sounds tinny at lower levels or it has
some bass boost as it's the case with
there with the joyful here for example
development sounds much tenure at low
levels that both have also loudness
included so
the booth base at low levels which is
natural because the human ear is much
less sensitive for low frequencies when
the volume gets down but you know I am
planning to include measurements for
maximum and for standard volume I could
maybe also include measurements for
lower levels but I didn't measure us
because therefore there is a another
notes field where I would like to write
my ideas about the speaker also some
some facts but it also needs lots of
time I have to to write notes 450
speakers which is yeah lots of work and
it was meant as a hobby some spare time
project it became a bit larger than I
thought but I need the support from you
in order to really make it grow and make
it something big and serious we have the
Syrian para is for sale as what he said
also the p4 which we've also also hurt
in a video the larger version is for
sale if you're interested please contact
me through google or from my email and
yeah i think four hundred fifty dollars
it should it's a pretty decent speaker
the other one I would like to 190 maybe
including shipping within Europe so if
you're interested please drop the line
and I can have some budget for new
speakers tensile for watching thanks for
your support and yeah we'll see us next
in another video bye bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
