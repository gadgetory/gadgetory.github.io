arrived the European version of the IVA
XS 9 so time for some real party it's
already available on the British Amazon
store for 299 pounds it will be also
available in the German Amazon store
later on and also in the French Amazon
store IVA is planning to release it also
on in some other stores until Christmas
and I've heard that they are planning to
release an optional remote for it
including also an optional carrying bag
this is the only problem you have just
this carrying grip but I would have
liked to have it around my shoulder
assets yeah close to 6 kilograms so
quite a beast but it's great to finally
have a version for Europe as well
everyone who always asked how can I get
it how can I import it yeah you don't
need to just wait a little bit until it
becomes available in your Amazon store
yeah it's one of the greatest because
you can get for around 300 bucks let's
see if I can connect and yeah half
volume now so definitely a beast of a
speaker yeah if you didn't know which
one to get if you should get the
Marshall Kilburn or some other junk ya
know get this one yeah I know my
personal favorite is the Harman Kardon
go in play I think it sounds a little
bit smoother but this one kills it in
overall loudness and also in punch this
is just incredible yeah it's a bit
larger the it doesn't fit into any
backpack like the current play but I
hope for a nice carrying back when they
release they promised to release it
until Christmas so yeah I hope this was
helpful stay be a bit patient and yeah
buy it
it's one of the best because you can get
for this price if you don't mind the
larger size thanks a lot for watching
and we will see us probably with some
other comparisons of the IVA XS 9 maybe
I can get the diamond box as well javi
already made some comparisons but well
I can do mine as well so stay tuned for
more have a nice time
have a nice end of summer and we will
see you soon
bye-bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
