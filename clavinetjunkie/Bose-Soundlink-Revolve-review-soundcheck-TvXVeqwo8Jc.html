to talk with you about the new Bose
Soundlink revolves I want to cover as
many aspects as possible with this video
so it might become a bit longer I hope
it's not boring for you but later on I
will also play some song samples compare
it against some other speakers so please
jump through this section which
interests you most
but first please let me tell you that
after my very first impression it was
maybe not that great in the meantime I
liked it quite a bit more it's far from
perfect but it's also completely
different type of speaker compared to
most others also compared to the Bose
Soundlink mini and I think it's a big
step forward and advance the Soundlink
mini remember when bose release the
Soundlink mini some 4 or 5 years ago it
redefined the complete Bluetooth speaker
category the driver layout the design
became something like a prototype for
many others because many companies
started to copy this design and you can
still find it in speakers like the sony
RX XP 3 with two main full range drivers
perpetrators one at the front one at the
bed the same goes for the downy
a5 or the anchor premium the rituals f4
some even resemble the sound of the
Soundlink mini so they measure nearly
exactly the same but these because
rather than for a directional sound so
if you place them in front of you they
will rather play towards your belly they
have a very focused directional sound
which was also one of the biggest flaws
of the Bose Soundlink mini it was always
shown on some images with people sitting
around and the speaker playing somewhere
so you will only get some muffled bass
heavy sound and this is where the sound
link level changes this this approach
and it offers you 360-degree sound which
really works well so it's it doesn't
matter how you place it away place if
you can place it beside you and you will
always get the same sound it's
interesting that it even sounds great
from below from above it will the first
speaker which I think gives the best
idea of a 360 degrees on we have the
view play one or the people but they
only cover a 180 degree area so from
below you don't get that sound but you
can even listen to the sound link
revolve from below which of course comes
with some problems as it acts rather
like some acoustic point source so you
get lots of reflections so when placed
on a table it will sound different then
when hanging free but it's great for
example if I if you put it into some
sleeve some acoustic transplant sleeve
tailor it to your rucksack it will sound
just great I tried this with the a tune
if you remember my video and it Daniels
around it turned around to the backside
this does not matter with the sounding
devolves and this is why I like it of
course the sound is quite a bit
different compared to directional
speakers and you get lots of direct
sound and not so much reflection of into
a ground with the something we both most
you get is indirect sound as there is no
real direct route it simply spread like
a sphere around which we have to like or
not but of course it's hard to to
compare and complete the omnidirectional
speaker to a directional one like the
Bose Soundlink mini which I currently
unfortunately don't have attend of
course it's not perfectly high five but
it it has a given the limitations of a
single driver which emits downwards and
then is reflected to the outside it
gives you a really nice sound and much
better than many other only directions
because I've tried for example de Libre
tones it was completely off the treble
sounded quite strange also the mini the
warm and - from Lee Burton also has very
strange sounding treble and overall the
treble here also has some colorations it
still nice and you have to be aware as
it it sounds nearly the same from from
every angle so while you might get much
better sound from a from a Sony when
this is directly in front it will sound
of
if you listen like that so I would like
to show you some frequency response
measurements it's not that easy to
measure it I measured it from front with
the microphone aiming directly at the
speaker
and then I turn it around 45 degrees and
I also measured it from below and from a
path we can have a look at some of these
measurements you can see it from front
from an angle of 45 degrees 90 degrees
135 degrees 180 degrees and so on and so
on and also from peg bass and from below
and you can see there is some change in
treble but if we average all these
measurements we get something like a
power response of the speaker which is
surprisingly linear the least of course
this typical both bass boost which is
not bad for all to use as it gives you a
fuller sound also in those the bass
boost gives you the impression of the
much bigger speaker playing and the
great thing is that the bass is really
nicely controlled compared to a sounding
community so there is no droning no
Distortion except maybe it's very high
levels we can also check out some other
volume levels you can see at low levels
even stronger bass boost which gets
reduced the higher we turn up the
speaker at levels above half this
reduction becomes pretty strong but
thanks to some strong upper bases
something revolves near manages to give
you a full sound even at maximum but
also battery life is quite decent
laughing class-leading as think balls
claims 12 hours I traded at maximum
although usually I would rather use it
one or two notches below as the
difference in overall loudness is not
this big plastic compression becomes
simply much too strong at maximum then I
got close to four hours without any
volume reduction or degrading sound
quality it turned off after three hours
and 50 I was to compare the Benham
deluxe in zero play a one at a
comparable level so it was playing quite
a bit below maximum and I got only two
hours 25 then it continued to play for
another 5 minutes at the lower levels
and turned off so you get more than one
and a half hours out of the both songs
integral for portable use definitely not
bad now I would like to demonstrate you
some of its features also the sound how
it sounds in reality is always an
abusing my binaural microphones ahead
can to give you a first first impression
for you to really get the most realistic
impression you should use a decent pair
of headphones so please put them up and
let's check it out first let's turn it
on and for this purpose I will start
deposit as you can power it on remotely
which is of course a nice
still not that many Bluetooth speakers
have this option for example the new
Sonia's oxx be three and four they have
it but they have to be attached to mains
all the time to make it work
also the new bill play p2 the small one
has this option but when I tried it it
managed to drain battery to 50% during
night so totora don't simply drag it
down and it will connect immediately it
married like to show you some of the
features of this app for example you can
disable voice points or from here I find
them quite annoying so I disable them
there is also the option to set a timer
for automatic power down for example
five minutes 20 minutes or Never then it
will stay on the after the battery is
completely under I said this - five
minutes and a really nice feature is
that you can manage Bluetooth
connections also from here also at new
ones and so on and both because are the
only ones which manage to connect to two
devices at once from on their own other
speakers don't even manage to connect to
one device for example if you have an
iPhone and an iPad it was connected to a
knighted before the next day you power
it on and the iPad is not present it
won't connect to your iPhone but those
speakers always try to connect to two at
once which is of course nice now let's
start with a song from so persona to
demonstrate you the sound which is of
course
a bit strange you have to get used to it
but what is interesting is of course a
dispersion how even it is even from
really below counters if it was emitting
the sound out of here there is hardly
any change in sound but this comes also
with some problem as the speaker
anything more like a sphere then count
change is quite a bit if I put it on a
table you can hear there is a big
difference in sound exchange found if
you flex it here and some plays in some
come filter effects are occurring I
think it will sound better displaced
upside down as the driver is far away or
far away from the surface is it not a
bit you can hear the travel becomes even
worse
so both should have decided to put the
driver upwards not down and I think
still we have to live with it and to
show you how it sounds against another
speaker here the Swami XP 30 I will do
some switching let increase what
impressed and let's switch to the
exponent and you can of course hear a
much more direct answers not that much
going around here the course again also
costs much molecules and keeps
regardless if you place it requires or
it will always on the phone
but it doesn't sound often anyway for
example if we find a classical track you
will hear that the mates are still quite
natural this is a piece from the
Tchaikovsky the xB 30 you hear
they both to assemble the orchestra
because they're both is just a mono
speaker so it doesn't have this sound
stage you can hear it still sounds right
many other speakers so they have some
humps in the mid the duplayee tool a
tool sounds completely off when you play
classical tracks it sounds very strange
that those in this case sounds really
nice
so it has a natural sounds just you have
to get used to this diffuse sound
anything let's try to be a jazz piece
with vocals so you will hear that the
voice sounds small as the same but it
deals more distance with the power
compared to the cony crazy Oh
get the hose countess if it was playing
inside oh I'm crazy
while the Sony aim is to come directly
towards you you can hear it still sounds
the same and the Sony lost its
advantages for a portable speaker
they're both stars definitely a better
job position simply place it somewhere
without turning it around all the time
but it's maybe not the best pickup for
sitting in front and listen but rather
yes going around and doing some work at
home and on track some smooth jazz maybe
and here it is this okay I mean it's not
off but it's just different okay
bass appears made it slightly for me
also depending on track I think is also
it would sound actually better hanging
somewhere maybe in place or on a tripod
you can sit as a tripod mount yeah then
I will put them over small so a th are
still there is lots of reflections at
the next item on track and let's
increase volume is more
donít ask me exterior 15 we should make
it enable extra bait here but again as
soon as we hand out and walk around the
both has a pizza plantation I don't walk
around to the room also turn around this
is the boss now
the story would have to be turned
forward to me here
so maybe let's check out the downy a5
now keep in mind that the downy a5 is a
second tee Daladier I saw nearly
one-third the price of the Bose
Soundlink revolve and although it might
resemble the old sounding 3 a little bit
it's still just a cheap Chinese copy but
let's compare these two starting again
with at all sounding Gribble's a
completely different earring but of
course also much more direct from here
again here when I stand up the sound
changes quite a bit while on the post it
really is always the same
that's the disadvantage of a speaker or
an advantage if you really sit in front
that's right Alex
what I like about there those hundred
kilos compared to of all those because
is that their base is nicely punchy
similar to what most before but much
more in control so it's that monkey
sports are going to produce the strange
artifacts we heard from the convent
guinea or founding Creed
of course there's no continuity
roll Motown system Enya the most
definitely plays cleaner
and I really have to absolve them
because the only meaning was unusable at
levels above 60% nailing started to do
strange stuff with based non effect
analog from savasana prefix-free John is
pick up he'll attract but you can hear
it handles it quite nicely the dolly
yeah carefully handle it
I will reduce volume maybe a little bit
the invoice cleaners or candor and the
holes so holes have some base
compensation for low levels but it seems
the revolve does not exaggerate as much
as the solvent unity to at very low
levels it became very homey while this
still sounds nice so let me keep volume
again yes now you can hear internal
table the second law let's write with
the boss as well cause it's far not as
loud as the downy but definitely not in
the process than anything else
not rekt also here very nice oh you're
here
it also you have to reduce volume
imagine to get clean sound they're both
really handled this nicely although it's
cannot play as loud as the down maybe
let's try the JBL charge three now I've
already seen lots of comments claiming
the charge three to be a much better
speaker than the Bose Soundlink we both
which I wouldn't quite say it really
depends on the way of usage and so on
also loudness the church we can play
much louder but at low level state Bose
SDH I think I will play again some tunes
and let you decide starting with the
ball something revolves
so I'm not sure if you are really
sitting in front of the stick all the
time but in this case they're both
deputies does a much better job placing
it in your garden walking around and so
on the charge we will become lost pretty
quickly and you would have to turn it
around all the time
while you don't need to do this with the
boss you can hear from an angle it
sounds pretty crappy no effect and
increasing volumes the tires this is a
chance we know suppose
he has a similar base punch it will be
better than their August meal
so I will use volume again and try to
simulate another situation where you're
sitting on some danger something
footpegs
each of these ideals and you will get
this sound while it balls still don't
okay even place like this so it really
doesn't matter how their oil changes
here or I don't know sitting around with
your friends all salty coming on the
lawn and everyone will get the same song
my this sounds really also faster it
really depends how you intend to use the
speaker I think for portable use they're
both is really one of the better ones
what did happen now
yeah I think I stopped music let's run
maybe another track it may be not as
defined as a real high speaker like if
the health and care something
industry and so neither is the church we
also missus refinement
another song is something more acoustic
because if you really intend to sit in
front of a speaker yeah that boss is
maybe not the best but still the charge
rate doesn't really count right here
I think I really prefer it upside down
there is some difference more
reflections here play at the surface not
effect
and again adding this volley slightly
the position
it's secure
Oh
yet a volume of the church with always
the same just a bounce to the text is
not as loud
usually I always stand in front of the
speakers but with the boss it doesn't
matter where I spent it always competent
of all you can maybe hear that the
charge free has it likely be prepared
this has maybe a bit more upper base
let's try an artifact something from no
copyright sound and what we could try is
needed increasing volume we will see
that they found us to become really
strange
during the last two steps but it still
Commodus loudest and sharply physically
moving and it's rather a lot so now
we'll not just below it sounds more
normal without losing as much
the last two step colada
by the trustee again a local think the
motivation here I required to mentor
them to be comfortable
so the don't explain of maximum or
rephrase attributable gold-plated
throttle with you thread
Oh
in all it's a spree fussing better for
me behind with this place
something and again increasing volume to
make some on the board you can hear
thousands become really much louder just
the compression become stronger so the
top shush we can retain much more
confident in mode for maximum loudness I
really wonder how they'd be starting to
evolve compared here with using volume
again two notches s yes like this you
think is much more usable another song
last one let's say and I will again try
to connect volume saluted better sold
both should play at a comparable level
the charged with at 3/4 I would say
then holes homo chest below maximum
didn't really change loudly just at the
founder google has been surrounded from
all type and then charge free and make
another thing for me I will use volume
again on both and you will maybe hear
that at low levels the Bose has of
course an x-shaped has bass dynamic bass
adjustment let's match them a bit better
so it really depends on the intended use
I hope my video could give you a better
idea of the sound from all these please
also check out my speaker audio data
basically already included there's
something to evolve you can also compare
it against the Soundlink needs which I
currently don't have a tent if you're
interested I will also try to grab a
sound link me again and compare these
two directly but for now you can compare
them in my database
I think the something revolves sounds
much better also much more controlled no
distortion they're sounding me already
distorts at normal levels I also think
that it sounds better than the JD in
charge 3 the charts we can play louder
but already starts to get some
intermodulation at levels around 2/3
already close to half then the sony
ericsson xperia cells may be better than
these two also way laden but it also
very focused very directional sound so
you cannot place it beside you and have
a great listening yeah nothing else to
say for now
I really would try to get the subject
mini and compare these two but I can
only tell you now that this sounds much
better than bassist much better under
control treble is better although a bit
strange something you get used to it
in Toulouse also thanks to this
omnidirectional sound I think both
really did a great job with this
acoustic deflector here others did not
that well it's not perfect but
definitely the best only directional
speakers try it doesn't quite make sense
to compare it against the Wando
which is already one of the best because
from Ultimate Ears but compared to the
Bo's it sounds a bit ridiculous if
you're interested please tell me I can
also compare these two but it's also
quite a bit cheaper this is the only
problem of the boss it's a bit on a
higher price especially in Europe for
230 you can get maybe better speakers
but probably not better omnidirectional
ones the a1 and the people they only
cover a hundred eighty degree sound this
is placed on a tripod and you really
have a spheric sound emitter I'm quite
impressed
maybe I expected a bit too much from it
but for what it is now it's quite decent
and I look forward to testing the bigger
one the revolve + which is more in the
size of the charge 3 so yeah we should
maybe compare the charge rate to the
bigger width of the small one is rather
the size of a flip phone so I hope you
enjoyed it a little bit I hope it was
helpful for you thanks a lot for
watching and see you then have a nice
time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
