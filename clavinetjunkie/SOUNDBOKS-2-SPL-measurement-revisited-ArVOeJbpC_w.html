owe you another sound pressure level
measurement or the new sound box tool
it's last time we didn't quite reach the
claim 222 decibels so this time I
brought my MPA a1 which is a
multi-purpose or resistant this is
completely fresh calibrated so it should
give us correct values maybe my previous
measuring microphone was not correct so
I will set it up here exactly one meter
away we also get some reflections thanks
to the surface which should be some DB
and we will do a new measurement so the
level meter is set weighting is
unweighted so flat response then we have
smoothing time is even faster than first
35 milliseconds and the range is from 70
to 130 decibels so yes let's try what
values we will get some books to is in
auto mode volume is a maximum yeah and
let's try the same track again I will
cover my uses I'm simply standing way
too close so let's get started
let's buy the walk
Oh
yeah but still a little bit far from 22
vegetables we are missing five vegetable
the only thing we could try smoothie
some white noise I will reset the
maximum level again and let's try some
white noise which is mastered close to
zero DB I think there is it here it is I
will again cover my yes
for eternity
wife's noise is not the solution here
yeah the only thing we could price me
doing some peak hold measurement let's
try this one this will also show us the
frequency graph and let's try again the
first song here we are mixing mixing
volume
and
yeah I cannot beat any louder this is
exactly one meter so yeah and instead of
fast response I you can see one meet
right here if you're fast response I
already did 35 milliseconds response
time and 117 point three is maximum so
yeah I tried it with two different sound
pressure level meter meters this one is
really calibrated I checked it
so yeah I'm sorry it held with any
louder it's still very very loud I
cannot stand here one meter away without
covering my ears even at home five
meters six meters away it's way too loud
so you cannot really a bear and stand it
so I hope you like this I tried to make
it as loud as possible
I went here still we have some people
going around here and I have to bring it
back to my car which is one kilometer
away so I hope you appreciate the effort
I tried but yeah I cannot bring it close
220 still I hope you like this I tried
but I faced 117 point three is maximum I
can achieve here maybe if I put it
closer then of course so anyhow thanks
all for watching and see you in the next
video and lifetime it bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
