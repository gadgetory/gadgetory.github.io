extreme against the new JB charge 3 so
here you are but I wouldn't say that
both are meant to compete but rather to
complement each other the JBL
charge-free is much smaller and lighter
so it's really a nice speaker to be
taking with you all the time while I
would rather take the JBL extreme when I
know that I meet together with some
friends and want to play some party
tunes or something but for Indo use
sometimes it's not the best speaker
because of this heavy bass boost it
already starts struggling slightly above
our volume with quite a bit of
distortion while the JBL charge 3 is a
much more balanced speaker also quite a
nice deep sound but simply not as
boosted therefore I would like to
demonstrate you how both sound as always
i'm of course using high quality
binaural microphones so you should
listen with headphones to hear the real
sound of them I will start with the
first song from soul persona starting
with the JBL charge 3 first volume is
set to slightly above half for both so
let's have a listen
is it just a cheap it's already here
that base from the spot slightly with
there why this sounds smoother without
this piece let's try not attract also
quite a bass heavy recording but this
charge with us really nicely here the
extreme always takes a bit of time to
switch
you can hear again face having to listen
to this please now clean the base
remains here the extreme yeah this is
simply because of so much boost if the
song is already boosted and you add some
other boost yeah this is the result
tracks again another song extreme
we can hear that the strong bass and
treble tends to draw out the need
slightly so it appeals more cover than
the charge three despite adding
Twitter's and to tell the truth I
personally prefer the more balanced
approach of their to charge free for
every day use of course the extreme
again you can all hear bass and hi-hat I
don't know not attract some acoustic
Jessie awesome Ola I mean for its size
the charge 3 is really an impressive
speaker
not simply different
maybe some rock
very nice needs quite a bit more booming
here
it's simply natural
extreme again
yet this sounds definitely nicer that's
why this extreme this is too much base
with this kind of recording I don't know
it sounds more defined somehow simply
clearer and everything
I will put them far away and let's
listen then now I can start increasing
volume slightly extreme
it's much more based it's still hard for
maximum extreme medium but you also get
this strange hot mix this still sounds
marvelous
let's find out a track their traps
explain two notches below maximum the
extreme is well all five notches below
maximum it appears more punchy but also
by the big harsh
I will increase the volume for maximum
on a charge for you not that much
difference anymore and I will try
matching the extreme to this there you
get much more punch here around three
four notches below maximum
but it still sounds great somehow I
don't know you her friend someone
the trucks replace at maximum
by the extreme is rather match to this I
wouldn't say that it sounds better
thank you different
another song also so for summer you
still get some nice punch of course much
less than with the extreme let's try
this yeah this punch is different
I will increase the day extreme also
connection now you can hear a difference
and quite a bit softer
extreme it's louder about the confidence
crane
touch me again
okay extreme
those are very loud noisy
extreme if louder that doesn't sound
good
Oh struggle a little bit maybe again
another crack oh we are at the beginning
again so my playlist is over yeah you've
heard it loudness wise no chance against
the extreme but I wouldn't say that the
extreme sounds great at maximum there is
some harshness and the strong bass boost
makes it well ap repeat I don't know
hollow or something I really like the
charge three despite not being as loud
and as Bumi yeah it's much closer to a
high five speaker is already mentioned
and for anyone who always thought yeah
this has too much bass you should try
the charge 3s this still has all the
bass but simply not as boosted
yeah I hope this was it I hope it was
helpful for you as a first video not
sure if we will do any more interesting
would be to charge three against one
extreme but currently I only have one
and I don't think that loudness wise to
could still compete with one extreme one
would be still louder but infrared this
harshness there is some shifts at higher
levels that I don't quite like so maybe
the two charged three could be even
better I mean I'm not even talking about
stereo separation and so on so thanks
for everyone who watches this and I
really hope this was helpful we will see
us in the next video until then have a
nice time at bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
