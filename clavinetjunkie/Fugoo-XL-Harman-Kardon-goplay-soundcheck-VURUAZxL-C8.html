Excel compares to the hammock I don't go
in play therefore I thought I will play
some tracks to give you an idea this is
not a full review just yeah a very short
video the full Excel definitely a nice
speaker cannot really compete with the
echo and play
neither bass nor really refinement of
sound yet but you will definitely hear
this I will start with the Foo XL first
it's already playing closer to maximum
why the go in play is well below half
and let's have a listen
I will lean back slightly so and maybe
you can hear that the pitch shifted and
it will
yeah everyone with a absolute pitch
should hear that it changes the speed
the playback speed this is probably an
arrow of the Bluetooth chip used I will
switch over to the point play here you
hear this is simply completely other
class of sound a bit honking meets
treble is a tiny bit missing let's try
something else
can't play
yeah I will Chris warm slightly and
let's take it out of this father
yeah but it's still I don't know let's
try not a trick it sounds funky I don't
know let's try the 360-degree sound but
you're here it also becomes covered
don't play from behind well of course it
becomes covered but the Pogo is not that
much better
Oh
it's run a track and I will increase
volume to maximum the current way I
can't play also slightly we are maybe
three four
another track
don't play
I will increase that go and play also to
maximum now
see this very stomachs wanna distortion
already you can play
yeah we could also try the outdoor mode
but well I don't know if it would help
lot outdoor
when play again maybe this
you can't play
now
fuga Excel definitely a great speaker
also because of its ruggedness and and
size but Sandra is really not in the
same class like that go and play also
the meats you heard maybe we're a bit
honky treble is slightly missing so yeah
if both cost the same and you don't mind
the larger size well you know which I
would definitely prefer I hope this
helped anyone who wanted to hear the
difference
thanks for watching and bye bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
