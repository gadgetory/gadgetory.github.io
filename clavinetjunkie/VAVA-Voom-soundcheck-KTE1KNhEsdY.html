about the available that are finally
here it is it was not quite easy for me
to get it although even at the very
beginning when it was announced VAWA
contacted me if I would like to review
it of course I want it but when they got
to know that I'm from Europe they told
me it's not released in Europe and they
cannot send me unit just by chance I
found that the Amazon UK store headed in
stock and I didn't quite know that UK
doesn't belong to Europe well they still
do but maybe in future they want so I
ordered it from the Amazon UK store for
I think 70 pounds which is 90 euros or
something in America it goes for eighty
two dollars currently so here it is yeah
pretty simple design with controls on
top nothing special two drivers one main
woofer two passive radiators at the back
charging is done through a proprietary
charge although there is another five
volts input microUSB I don't know what
it is but I haven't tried maybe you can
also recharge it for micro USB and when
looking a bit further also having a
detailed listen I thought it reminded me
quite a bit of the TDK a 34 and I took
some photos with a flash which enhances
the internals a bit and you can see well
it's more less the same the same woofer
in the center with drivers that drivers
are covered on the Bava but yeah at the
back you can see the same passive
radiators maybe slightly large on the
TDK so I took some measurements you can
see measurements of two different volume
levels with all three EQ settings black
is the neutral EQ setting red is party
and blue is surround and you can see
that something strange is going on there
are some humps and some dips it doesn't
quite measure really flat when compared
to the TDK this is more or less a flat
line so yes of course we would like to
hear how it sounds as always I'm using
binaural microphones so let's turn it on
here is a kind of battery indicator with
three dots a nice welcome tone not too
loud we will turn the TDK on later and
let's have a listen to a first track is
listen with headphones
volume is not in sync between Python and
speaker but you can hear maybe that it's
a little bit there the sound is a little
bit mushy me I mean it's not bad but
really nothing outstanding let's try
maybe another EQ mode this is party now
so it seems to boost bass and treble and
we also have surround so this broadens
up the soundstage you can hear it really
well but it becomes very very blue me
and and colored very mushy sounding I
will switch over to neutral again I
think this sounds really most neutral
but some treble sparkler is missing I
think and the bass doesn't really reach
me it just some upper bass boost as
we've seen from the measurement
let's try party again it sounds a little
bit better maybe but it remained we
reminds me a bit of the effect a brave
one heads with its own special sound
mode you can surround you can hear this
very summarised stereo separation out
but the sound becomes very very mushy
unfortunately because the effect would
be pretty great therefore let's try
maybe the TDK of this compares it should
connect automatically
this is still their father home
so another TDK and I think you can get
it it sounds similar but more refined
I thought rebel definition
ba-bye again a bit more Bhoomi maybe
let's try our track
30 DK hey sounds more more solid can I
buy you a biatch Oh Marge it's after my
baby let's try party mode you can hear
this become some formulas did he take my
age a moody bitch Mina like that Dada
oh yeah I saw girls bear they stopped on
Lulu little darker bestie down up again
oh my gosh yes
you can see the sunflower the guns
yeah there is something missing I don't
know the PDK sounds here like a normal
speaker the surround doesn't really good
the does doesn't good to the sound that
is you can hear it sounds really strange
let's turn it off again with a neutral
let's play another track and at low
levels you will hear that it does also
strange stuff here there is some pumping
so for low levels I will reduce volume
again
can you some kind of bread breathing
regardless if you reduce volume from the
speaker from the iphone low levels it
doesn't really sound that great maybe
not a track and I will put them far away
turning them to maximum so we can hear
how loud they can play as the TDK is a
pretty loud speaker so let's have a
listen starting again with the
okay
yes the father seems a little bit
controlled but also lower volume let's
try maybe this party mode who knows if
it becomes louder and again increasing
volume for maximum
okay a logger
now what we could also do is maybe
comparing that Vava voom against AJ
being track 3 I'll switch back to
neutral and let's start with the Vavoom
again the JBL yes sounds a bit strange
maybe let's try this party mode again
JBL it still sounds yeah normal
this has some kind of bony character and
also treble is somehow missing here's
this it opens the sound really nice but
it becomes completely muffled I can hear
instruments somewhere here floating
around charged three again if there is
some nice there in fact for sure this is
neutral again let's try another track
the GPL it's a bit louder now then
switching a few the volume always
changes on the bottom
yeah it's a strange booming sound maybe
we should put them away again and crank
both for maximum let's see if there
our home is still at maximum yeah and I
will try another track this is the
government laying its maximum
so mixing
they both seem to be similarly loud
although the TDK was definitely loudest
but the bhava still sounds pretty well
clean let's say there is not much
Distortion the JBL reduces bass at
higher levels
I couldn't hear this from the valve room
so I mean for half the price or a bit
more than half its maybe a decent
speaker but it's it's missing any
refinement you've heard the sound is
simply Bhoomi even the DK sounded much
better in my opinion the treble was
better than this boo - was missing
switching to another EQ mode didn't help
quite a lot the salon mode would be
great as it really opened the sound
completely but it made it also a kind of
boo me mess so I'm not that convinced
that the volume is really worth it it
seems to me like a knockoff of the TDK
maybe even slightly worse
I saw the DK for $80 as well I bought
mine for 55 euros so half the price of
the Baba the biggest problem of the TDK
is definitely battery the battery is
really weak if you turn it to maximum
after 15 minutes it will start to reduce
volume automatically not sure if the
valve uh does the same when I cut it it
was completely discharged so maybe it
has the same problem as the TDK
therefore the TDK has a main switch here
at the side so you should always keep it
off if not in use because otherwise next
time you want to turn it on it will be
empty so I think I definitely preferred
the JBL charge 3 over this I mean the
TDK is a very decent speaker but I'm
really not that convinced of the love
album I really expected a bit more but
it really seems to be equal with the TDK
with different tuning more boomin s but
the bass didn't really reach deeper or I
don't know so I hope this could help you
to give you an idea about the volume
yeah it was not as great as I hoped for
but anyhow yeah it's a nice speaker and
from what I know a smaller version will
be coming I already saw it on the
British Amazon store it's called Vava
voom 20
it looks pretty promising and there are
already some reviews out although the
speaker currently is not available so
maybe they will release it soon it would
be interesting also to compare it
against the charge 3 again is this yeah
it's a pretty solid performer not
perfect but really one of the best
currently yeah I hope you liked it
thanks a lot for watching and see you
soon bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
