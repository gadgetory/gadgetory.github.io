analysis of the new JBL charge 3
especially compared against the old
model a JBL charge 2 I think many might
be interested in this to hear how much
different the new sounds compared
against the old one I also read already
some comments of the posting my first
videos asking but what is the punch it
sounds different and so on yet it does
indeed
and I think JBL went for a more high
fight tuning this time it sounds much
more natural than the old one with less
compression also much louder but of
course it sounds different
therefore to demonstrate you this I have
a FIFA Copenhagen here which is what I
would call a kind of high-end portable
Bluetooth speaker and to show you how
these to compare and if the charge free
sounds really that much different I will
play a tune of course I'm using high
quality binaural microphones so you
should listen with headphones I'm
starting with the JBL charge 3 then
switch over to the Copenhagen and then
you can judge is it really much worse or
is it booming sound so let's start
the FIFA course you can hear more
refinement from the FIFA but I mean look
at the size difference and also prices I
think five six times higher so still for
each size I think they did a pretty good
job and if we have a look at the
frequency response measurement of both
speakers the JBL charge three in black
the JBL charge two in gray you see that
the JBL charge three is more balanced
now the bass doesn't have this strange
peak at 75 Hertz and that rebel boost is
missing although you can also see that
treble starts rolling off already at 12
kilohertz
so you will be probably missing the
higher treble from the JBL charge 3 this
may have different reasons one of them
being that it's completely water
resistant now the JBL this is the second
version the 2 plus was only splash
resistant so the material here could
swallow quite a bit of high frequencies
there is not only the material but there
is some some foil underneath that
probably gives it a water resistance so
I think even this foil could swell high
frequencies the other thing may be that
the drivers it still uses the same
drivers at the JP s the JBL charge -
from what I heard the only thing that
amp is more powerful as is the DSP so
the drivers are pushed much more now and
to avoid intermodulation Distortion um
they had to limit treble slightly
otherwise you would hear with bass heavy
tracks at elevated levels that yet
this because struggles a little bit it
still does there is a hint of
intermodulation distortion it really
levels close to maximum but only
variable with some particular bass-heavy
tracks and also not every bass heavy
track is prone to this but mostly such
electronica dance stuff and so on of
course I would like to demonstrate you
the changes the first change is of
course the welcome tone this is the new
welcome tone we have on the extreme flip
three pulse two and so on
unfortunately pretty loud the
confirmation tone while the tones on the
JBL charged to int plus here are a bit
more decent I would say not that loud I
would really like to be able to disable
them until now there was no option for
this I really hope JBL will do this in
future because in a silent environment
you simply cannot turn it on it's too
loud
you would wake or in a I don't know in
an office if you turn it on everyone
will turn around and the other thing
that changed is the volume stepping is
much more is much finer now I will start
playing with the charge three this is
the first volume step you can hear it
belly and you can hear this is really
it's possible to control volume
quickly nicely while the JBL charge tool
which will here needs five steps and it
already reaches hop volume you can also
here we are at half volume exactly and
how half volume is more towards the end
then thoughts so it's this is not half
volume in reality if we switch over to
the charge three you can hear the
difference in sound pretty relaxing
it sounds fuller overall
here you have this compressed bass
together with the sizzling treble
maybe let's try not right and I will
increase volume slightly
let's see what the charge to does with
it you can do it I have to turn it to
maximum but you hear lots of
confessional I have to turn it to
Mexican I would use both will have it
more comparable let's find out right
from princess freesia - also sings for
savasana scratch the GBA tracks - and
you can hear that the treble is
extremely boosted but it misses the
fullness of the charge three near the
treble is a bit more recessed but still
pretty natural sounding
and object maybe it's simply more mature
let's try a quick some smooth death
the chart or do you get this strange
punch which doesn't quite fit into this
kind of music it works well with powers
and so on but the compressor is simply
much too strong already you can also
hear they replace from part a little bit
version
it sounds much more balanced really like
like a real speaker
again something else kind of blues rock
or something and the charge tool you
hear that it sounds thinner also with
some fluctuations dynamics processing
they touch - this keeps up with your old
bar you can already hear it struggling
maybe some kind of dream wave
the judge tool
so the charge really definitely has more
face and it's much louder this
if you listen close you can maybe
discern some intimate relation with the
hi-hats
but yet the charge tool
I think the difference is really huge
here
that's right
there is real punch from a bass from an
airplane the charge tool this is really
maximum I mean I'm not joking
it doesn't become really louder
maybe this and you can hear that there
is some slight compression on the charge
free as well but it's minimal compared
to their charge - yeah this is maximum
everyone complaining that that charge -
is not loud enough will love the charge
screen listen
this is night and day what I would call
it I think and I'm sure you could hear
it as well the JBL charge 3 is a huge
step forward towards a major and great
sounding speaker everyone complaining
about lack of bass or punch has no clue
or maybe completely distorted
expectations but the charge 3 sounds
decent I personally I'm missing a little
bit the higher treble I think this is
the material and that it's completely
waterproof now it suffers a little bit
but it's still much better than they're
both we've heard already
then the beats bill it's simply that it
doesn't give you this high-end sound
from the FIFA Copenhagen here but I mean
you cannot expect 450 getting a sound of
a speaker which cost 7 800 at this size
it's really nicely compact it still fits
into a jacket pocket although it's a bit
larger it it's still really nice to
carry around and it's rugged rugged I
always say it wrong rocked so it's
rugged I wouldn't care a lot about the
Pasiphae eaters they are also quite
robust robust I don't know but I always
put it into some bag like that without
any protection and I did this with the
charge tool with the flip three and
never had any issues so just don't stick
anything inside here I think it's really
a great speaker and so far I have to
find something this class that can
compete yeah there is the sony xba-1
contender but the sony has other issues
we will hear this later on in another
comparison but you could hear it
competes pretty well against the boss
the bigger balls against the charge tool
also against the pill plus we've heard
we will compare it against some other
speakers as well next probably the sony
srs XB 3 so stay tuned I hope this was
helpful for you
I hope this could give you a better idea
of the differences between these two I
think that the charge tool becomes a big
torsional
especially because of this treble boost
it gives you the appearance of something
clear but it's a bit of a metallic sound
while the charge - really sorry the
charge 3 really sounds like a real high
5 speaker so thanks for watching and we
will see us in the next video have a
nice time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
