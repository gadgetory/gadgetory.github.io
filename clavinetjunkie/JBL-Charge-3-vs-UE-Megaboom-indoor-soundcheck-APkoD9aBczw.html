do another comparison with that JBL
charge three many people started asking
if I could compare it against a Huey
boom to I only heard that boom - in a
store and I thought it sounds ridiculous
therefore why not compare it against you
is Top Model the highly rated mega boom
which costs also twice as much many also
claim that my videos are bias that I
meant Ultimate Ears hater well that's
not quite true but when looking at some
other reviews like this from unbox
therapy here it says the best Bluetooth
speaker or you a makeup on Bluetooth
speaker review one of the best the best
Bluetooth speaker 2016 or you will make
upon review best Bluetooth speaker the
best Bluetooth speaker in the world 2016
UE mega boom I mean with claims like
this you really expect quite a lot from
a speaker but the reality is that the
mega boom doesn't sound truly that great
to give you an unbiased impression I
thought I will play some tracks I'm
always using high quality binaural
microphones so you should listen with
headphones and I will start with the JBL
charge 3 first with a level slightly
above half and a kind of funky track
please have a listen
I know people well it's also
questionable how to place the megaphone
like this we are only hearing one driver
but at least it gets some clarity
maybe some Jessi district yeah I won't
comment but everyone should hear that oh
yeah maybe some kind of porn music
yeah I know there is an ultimate gear
set and you have an equalizer but this
equalizer is really yeah unusable
ridiculous if you add bass everything
becomes soft
adding treble becomes in software so the
lowest frequency band is 150 Hertz so
you really cannot quite tune the speaker
to make it sound good you would need
much finer stepping and you hear I add a
300 Hertz boost and it just becomes
software you have a bass boost here but
no difference tool to standard I mean
so this equalizer app is really yeah
unusable let's switch over to the GBA
chart 3 again you can hear really bass
and some punch which is completely
missing from the middle boom
just some honk eNOS it should be placed
like this so we can hear both drivers
the left and the right one but then you
get this strange muffled sound let's try
another
listen to the bass you hear the bass
mode pretty well here
with the mega boom it's missing you only
hear the upper tones from there from the
base here is even a lower note it's
still here able with the charge
clickable again to me
you can definitely hear the notes here
let's try the Mabel it already starts to
drawn a bit it's like this like that
it's like this it's like that like that
it's like this it's much more punchy
basic song I like that it's like this
it's like that it's like like that it's
like this it has some honking asshole oh
man we don't know how to place it will
get acceptable son order it it's like
that it's like this that's fine at work
also here very nice deep bass punchy
bass drum I mean if the speaker has boom
or mega boom within its name it should
sound at least yeah punchy boom it bud
the bass drum is we do is just pok pok
pok pok much deeper sound here let's
listen to some other house tracks it
gives a slight kitchen radio effect also
as if it was standing inside some box I
don't know another house track here
maybe this is the boom they are talking
about this is food but it doesn't sound
right track
also nice punchy sound here back from
San chaser maybe let's walk around a
little bit
and I will start increasing volume to
maximum McComas well
yeah they shot free still has this lunch
oh just completely missing from the mega
bonus basically what the mega moment
feels slightly louder here another fact
we have a bass drones here's some 3 Rd
right
you can hear also compressing artifacts
here tries to be louder
and I'll trick where's the face from you
I mean the difference is really deep
next why this and the charge free is
another 300 agrees because of course
from behind it will start sounding
muffled but still much more punchy sound
on the charge here
it doesn't sound that over-processed
let's try this
you can really hear some nice deep bass
here
so yeah I wouldn't say that the JBL
charge-free sounds so great I would have
rather said that the mega boom sounds
pretty bad regardless which speak I put
against it it simply sounds off it has
the strange hollowness I don't know also
the 360 degree sound works but it never
sounds right you always have to turn it
with one driver towards you to get some
clarity otherwise it has I don't know it
it simply doesn't sound good so I really
cannot understand all the reviews
claiming it to be the best portable
Bluetooth speaker
it's decent but I mean three hundred
dollars or euros this is the original
price is way too much 400 I wouldn't say
anything but always hype around the mega
boom boom and mini boom and every other
roll boom I don't know it's simply not
deserved it's overpriced junk which
doesn't sound good at all therefore I'm
not a hater but I simply like and prefer
good sound which the mega boom boom mini
boom and every other yeah won't give you
this they all sound pretty bad but cost
quite a bit therefore I hope this was
quite helpful for you to give you an
unbiased view on the charge three and a
mega boom I really really expected much
more with all the hype and videos but
yeah maybe it's simply not for my taste
I don't know so thanks a lot for
watching and we will see us in the next
video bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
