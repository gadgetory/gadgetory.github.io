sound 993 wireless speaker I got this as
a real sample some time ago but didn't
quite manage to do anything with it this
was an IndieGoGo campaign but in the
meantime it's over and unfortunately it
didn't quite manage to reach its goal
just fifty three percent out of 50,000
and ADV son doesn't even hide too well
to show us which speaker is it's based
on like here they both sounding meaning
but they claim to have improved it with
a mid-range and high frequency bump with
tightened base and so on and they are
pretty proud of it well designed for
musicians so of course before having
listened how it sounds I thought we will
have a look at some frequency response
measurements compared to the bose
soundlink mini tool and you can see some
measurements at different loudness
levels here and it's also visible that
the bowls does some heavy bass boost at
low levels which the ADV sound doesn't
and the ADV sound has slightly better
treble response there is some slight
peak at one kilohertz but it's hardly
hear about the biggest difference is of
course that the base is not boosted as
much as like bose does so of course
unfortunately i don't have the bose
soundlink mini to anymore but i have a
boot in a Royale which is also based on
the same design from both but also
improved so we can have a listen to
these to how these to compare the first
thing I noticed with the ADV is that the
Bluetooth and everything is a bit hasty
first of all the volume is not in sync
between player and and speaker so you
have independent volume volume control
so when I increase volume to maximum in
order to have the entire volume range
from my from my iphone I get some
stronger hiss and Static which is not
quite present on the vetting but let's
have a listen anyhow there they are both
playing at a slightly low level and
maybe you can hear that everything
sounds more full-bodied because of this
base post it also boost space in the
same way as both does so we have to
increase volume slightly to make them
more comparable or more equal and let's
hear if there is some difference in
sound
yeah I think it's noticeable that
they're fitting has more treble boost
which in this case is not that bad it
sounds clearer and gives a bit of a of a
more refined impression
this sounds a little bit a buzz like a
little bit covered let's listen to
attract also more acoustic and I will
increase volume slightly on the meeting
as well let's try matching them
you
yeah the 993 has this typical travelers
like both so if you listen FX's it
becomes pretty pretty do that the tin is
somehow better here
let's listen to no trick yeah you can
answer given it follows a correction of
a second at the beginning of the song
attract from savasana yeah and here we
have the first problem this droning ATP
song doesn't give us so the basis is it
much better under control
this becomes seven bit more distorted
let's try not attract also from savasana
and I will increase volume even more and
the bitumen also a second here it really
distorts with the ugly
is it just a cheap no distortion at all
but again let's just put it rather hear
of Texas this still sounds okay why is
it nearly the same specs like the goal
and our track we also hear some second
of them the songs missing
baby
energy let's see
my ass
frequency wise they're ripping
definitely on more convincing this
reminds me a bit too much of both also
heavily stand when I start the song and
stop again yeah there is some some echo
or something so there needs to be some
improvement with Bluetooth this isn't
another song so here it simply jumps
over but the good thing is it's really
clean cleaner than the boss and also
clean under vision in which not solving
this messy
the base is much more droning on
visiting this isn't something else you
will never get the beginning of a song
with the ATV Sound I will increase
volume may be maximal yes not very loud
on the ADV as well so here the first
distortion starts appearing in this case
even the detainees dinner it's Patrick
let's walk around a bit yeah there is
not that much difference in loudness
between the East a the spinal tract and
now the limiter starts kicking in it
pushes the loudness down let's try the
15 there is this even software it's a
quickie love recording but you can hear
that there is some stronger limiting its
final effect
in this case the between son play is
louder there is really lots of
processing going on to keep distortion
load you can hear some compression
already the bass drum starts being
swallowed
much more dynamics here
I wouldn't call both great ah but I
think frequency response is a bit better
on the 18 it sounds clearer somehow more
convincing while this is a bit more
controlled with base you don't get this
drowning but it sounds too too similar
to let both something me I don't hear
much improvement the treble is still the
same this has much clearer a treble I
mean there is a treble boost we've seen
the frequency response of the Latino
royal and this noise and hiss and ya
know it's absent because there is
nothing playing also the fact that every
song during the start there are some
some jumps and and some seconds missing
is not that great I think ADV sound was
aiming at hundred seventy dollars for
the retail price but this is too much I
mean you can get this for sixty seventy
dollars and it sounds better maybe not
as controlled this droning is a bit
annoying maybe the second version or an
update they will finally managed to get
rid of it the gem heavy metal does
exactly the same so yeah I'm really not
that impressed design and I mean it's
really heavy I think it's as heavy as
the JBL charge three but not as rugged
and ya know you can see lots of
similarity to the post but no charging
through micro USB just a proprietary
charger so really really not that great
they seem to have based their design on
the very first bose soundlink mini
version yeah I mean they're already some
raving reviews about the heck even an
entry yeah I don't think it's that great
it's promising but I mean it's just the
rebranded boss something minute oh not
that much better in this case I would
even take the written as it's so much
much more cheaper yeah
thanks a lot for watching and yeah see
you then bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
