more detailed look at the new Harman
Kardon
Onix to do five it's already the fifth
generation of the quite popular speaker
series from them which had its origin
with the original Onix maybe remember it
I think it was released around four or
five years ago it was a litte bit more
precious had this nice steel grip all
around leather at the back Wi-Fi was
included and later on they released the
studio versions which was somehow
stripped down without Wi-Fi cheaper with
worse battery and they got these ugly
feet at the back here thanks to those
who could even fit them into any bag for
transport but maybe they were adamant
for being used at home black thing all
the time because battery life was really
crappy I hate the original onyx which
was quite expensive around 500 maybe
even 600 euros and I had the Onyx to do
which was way cheaper 190 later on price
went down even more and with the Onyx to
do I hardly got half and how it makes
him home then it turned off I could
still turn it on but only use it at
lower levels I think it was powered by
just a single 18 650 battery the second
version third version not much has
changed they just changed the looks
their materials added dual sound maybe
sound was tuned a little bit better but
they still sounded more less the same
and now with the fifth generation they
redesigned it completely no oddly fit
anymore you can see it's quite slim so
it fits inside it back for transport and
it looks like a bag and it's a mono
speaker now so it consists of one big
woofer in five inches and one Twitter
and probably to Percy graders one at the
front and at the back so you won't get
any stereo sound out of it which of
course is a pity also with two of them
connected for dual sound they will just
play here left and right channels
together dual sound from honk atom
doesn't support stereo apart from that
yeah let's look at the design on three
kilograms it's still charged by a power
brick so unlike the Buell 8:17 which is
larger and can be charged by USB see
it's a pity that Harman Kardon still
opts for an external power brick but the
chair the sound has definitely improved
also battery life is better now at
maximum I got two hours or let's say two
hours five it's still not class-leading
but definitely better than before
it's comparable to a hammock article in
play which manages maybe two hours 15
I'm not sure what sound is really
incredible
yet before talking about sound I will
show you some frequency response
measurements keep in mind these are
measured outdoors from a distance of 50
centimeters to minimize any kind of
reflections and you can see it measures
remarkably flat with some nice BBC deep
in the presence region and some heavy
bass boost with a peak at 50 Hertz at
low levels there is no additional base
adjustment but it doesn't really need it
as it already sounds so fed at high
levels there is some bass reduction or
let's rather call it compression but it
always remains clean and undistorted up
to maximum volume maximum volume is
compared to the JBL extreme - maybe but
when plugged in it will become around
3-4 DB louder
of course I cannot offer you any compare
it compare ascend to the Harman Kardon
go and play which I don't own anymore or
to the JBL boom box but it sounds better
than those although it's mono yeah keep
in mind it's just a mono speaker so you
won't get any stereo separation but you
can listen to it through my database and
if you compare it to the JBL boom box
you will hear that the Onyx to do five
sounds way better
also compared to the going play which is
from the same family the onyx to distill
manages a more balanced fuller sound
but it's definitely a bass-heavy speaker
so it has this really pronounced base
which you had a like or not it reminds
me a little bit of the billet 15 or 17
which also has the strange bass boost
but the Onyx to do is way smaller and
also cheaper I would also say it plays
more controlled without any artifacts
like the ability to do and it sounds
more natural you could see the frequency
response is close to flat you just get
this heavy bass boost with you either
like or not and now I would like to show
you how it sounds I have the FIFA Oslo
here as my reference because this is of
course twice as expensive another one
way smaller but comparable price here in
Europe you can get the Onyx to do five
for 220 some already offered below
hundred ninety so the price is compared
to the denim of course that they don't
help compete in fullness of sound but it
gives you some nice stereo sound stage
which the Onyx to do is lacking so I
would put up my action cam my head cam
also my manual microphones you should of
course Nesmith headphones and let's
check them out first it's compared onyx
to the 505 hours long
currently v I said - it's late night
mode which boosts bass and treble
slightly but they should make them more
comparable the Harman Kardon will be
playing first
this is Eric from a palapa with lots of
bass we added some bass Center and
varied based aviation here the Hammond
catamaran does this quite nicely with
lots of deep bass low so cool we'll make
it
if it was that simple I would like you
so they decide what songs we do never be
careful it's reduce here we should hear
that it's a real mono speaker which as
produces mono sound and although they
FIFA has dead drivers quite close to
each other it still manages some kind of
ambience their engines
you can hear a sound is way more open
normally because travel is more boosted
but also because it has two separate
trials
there is some real separation make the
chicken or Texas the FIFA doesn't hip
tweeters rather only killing Travis in
the Wofford but there doesn't seem to be
dead yeah I would seem to solve that
that or much worse than then comma
column do quite myself X's I think we
should at least including some second
Twitter to spread the sound slightly
this was something else also lots of
deep bass and very controlled up to
maximum no distortion nothing the FIFA
it cannot render this bass drum anymore
the LC freighters emit for some thin
slit so you hear some yeah that kind of
hot moist or airflow so the Onyx to do
does a much better job here way cleaner
way more punchy
the place when it's not clean anymore so
with particular tracks when it catches
this frequency of the PC freighter way
way nicer yes like this some smoke just
maybe here the emphasis is on base while
mix and treble a little bit out of
balance
if you dispatch some slight bass and
treble boost with late nights it's still
completely balances in here
it could definitely take a bit more
Spartan this right is also an acoustic
track with lots of bass I didn't hear it
renders this quite nicely but makes any
openness to the song
despite the virus being so close to each
other you can still hear some stereo
some reader on stage here
so the kiss is playing somewhere over
there and the problem is to won't blink
there either so
there is no way to get here all of the
speaker
and I think it's time to it's the
typical neutron this will increase
volume already much thinner I'm gonna
make another way so we can read it so
this is the Onyx to d5 and increasing
volume to maximum from maximum
we hop assault it is more than all
nestled activities community
is this really mixing in Seoul
maybe that's right that's right and it
pays to be recording beckon comfort also
here let's try the it's not that clean
anymore
the base is known as control so our next
video definitely does a better job here
so now maybe let's try comparing it
against a dental in via you can see I
set them up like this but it's the
drivers are rather at the top here this
shouldn't influence the sound at all but
now being centered we can concentrate
more on the sound stage and so on and
again starting with the Harman Kardon
so you can hear it depends a lot on the
music so with acoustic stuff with nice
the recordings the Harman Kardon radish
song yes up I would say lots of bass but
no openness to the sound somehow this
were this another across the district
get too much bass somehow here but of
course if you want to listen to some
basically music like this Onix to the
fight will again give a more convincing
results let's say there are with this
small size cannot configure
a very nice song station strike
doesn't have this pace
I can hear this face can people become a
little bit yeah quite heavy what I'm
going to be interested in is how it
fares against the FIFA Helsinki at
maximum if if I think he is yeah way
smaller and doesn't sound as full-bodied
or as fat I already said it to neutral
so we can increase volume to maximum and
I'm not sure I think it cannot compete
with base but it's probably even louder
so let me see it sometime now I'm
connected and let's start with the Onyx
to do again and another track so I'm
half volume now and can hear law also
face lots of droning the Helsinki son
shall obtain but the NS increase both
the maximum I will do it with the
Helsinki first
Fenwick's three or five days
we use also dynamics on home
still mother's parents bass-heavy by
more than any closer
this is just some baby swing let's say
loud but it's very undefined disrespect
this is compresses s so much that the
base becomes rather some yes and pull
out some sausage maybe if you find here
the base is still defiant you can hear
every attack not a space heavy part one
normal solid in how the base swallows
the eggs
if you cry stereocenter
identity must often compressed and mode
tries to keep the stories
so I think they FIFA Helsinki being half
the weight in size it's still quite
impressive
I think you'd hear the new onyx - the
five is quite a remarkable speak um
especially because of this impressive
bass response that they managed to
squeeze out of something that small but
this heavy bass can also become a little
bit annoying when listened in a small
room it becomes droning quite quickly
also and placed closer to a wall but
outputs on the other hand it sounds
great again so I'm sure it will tear
apart the community some will love it
because of this heavy bass while others
will say it's too much bass also for my
taste
that could be live with more treble
sparkle because of this big bass boost
the sound is not dead in balance apart
from that it sounds really quite
impressive I mean I already see all
those get old gangsters taking women
purses around on the street and blast
all their hip hop tunes instead of a JV
boombox I think this is what the JBL
boombox should have sounded
it's quite interesting because Harman
Kardon JBL it's the same company but
Hammond cotton somehow always manages to
make the speaker sound better like JBL
always faced the Jay big swing - is nice
but it cannot compete with the Onyx to
do five hear loudest wise there may be
comparable but plug it in and it becomes
340b louder so maybe with some external
power bank which supports 12 volts I
think the power brick is 12 volts stick
it with some velcro tape here at the
back and yeah you have full power even
at mixing I'm quite yes surprised that
it sounds so good compared to all the
others JBL boombox check it out of my
database yet JBL boombox just doesn't
compare louder but it makes me sound
great this also sounds quite usable at
maximum still the fee falsely could hear
was louder but it starts to sound a bit
stressed at at higher levels also the
Percy freighters have this farting so
with really bass heavy tracks with deep
kicks you will probably hear the FIFA
also distort while there Onix to your
place it completely clean and this is
what I personally find really impressive
great processing there is some limited
you can hear that is well some attacks
but it's nothing compared to many other
speakers which start to fart or do other
stuff so I'm really really impressed
let done is that it's mono you won't get
any stereo sound a second Twitter would
have probably helped to make the sound a
bit more open so it would spread
at least two ever to both sides but it
just a mono speaker and connecting two
together won't give your stereo either
battery life is not great but two hours
at maximum is okay and when plugged in
it's really not check it out again for
my database with the third and fourth
track I cut in some parts playing with
AC power so you will hear the difference
in loudness between battery and AC power
but from that nothing has to say design
if is of course a matter of taste
it looks like a woman's handbag but it
sounds like a better than a bazooka JBL
boombox which is of course really funny
and I don't understand while JBL and
Harman Kardon why they don't somehow
managed something really decent the
battery life and design of the GE
extreme 2 for how to use with the sound
of the Onyx to the v as it sounds really
it's so much bigger
thanks to this bass books but the bass
book is definitely not for everyone's
taste for me it's also a bit too much a
nice button with less space more bass
would be great so you have to rely on
some external if you maybe reduce it by
4 or 5 DB and it's still quite meaty but
will definitely sound more high file
let's say yeah I hope you liked this
video use my database for God's sake I
mean I don't know why I do all this I
still get questions yeah compare it
against this and that yeah you can
compare it by yourself like I've shown
in this video at the beginning just
compare it against the JBL boombox and
you should hear that this sounds way
better it's yeah it's I'm quite
impressed it sounds better than go and
play but he also then better than the
bewdley 215 which I have in my database
I haven't recorded this 17 but I thought
there is really that much difference
between the 15 and 17 sound wise so for
this size and weight and price
especially in Europe below 200 euros I
saw it on the Harman Kardon site on the
US side and $480 not really they went
crazy maybe you can write here 490 over
there for 400 480 but I already saw some
some offer it around $200 and I think
it's worth it and in the $200 class also
the denim via cost along the same it
blows away all the competition but it's
not perfect it's not there's no stereo
leather life could be better and design
of course is
a bit questionable imagine the Jabil
extreme with this sound and battery life
is it already has close to six hours at
maximum this would be a killer speaker
yeah I hope you like this a little bit I
will still probably not keep it because
yeah I have my fever I was like I like
more than open sound I don't in a small
room I compare both and if he falls low
still sounded normal right here you
could only was really strange by autos
yeah Giants but you can be sure that
your neighbors would complain even at
mid levels there is so much bass so much
of this of this energy this 50 Hertz
energy that you can hear your heart
meters away while not really playing
loud which is of course yeah depends
what you are intending to do with it
again thanks for watching and see you in
the next video
have a nice time and bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
