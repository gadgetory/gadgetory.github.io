America listeners to all of you I hope
you can spend a nice and peaceful time
together your family your friends or the
people you love this would be really my
last video before Christmas and also for
the next couple of days is I need to
take a short break from all this as well
but before doing so I wanted to thank
you again for all your support all the
nice comments and of course also all the
generous donations I got lately from
John in Finland 20 euros thomas chen 30
euros and many many others as well so
really thanks about this helps me of
course to continue my work in future
also to extend my database ending new
speakers and so on buying new speakers
but it's not necessary to donate as much
it would be enough if more of you donate
half a dollar or one dollar instead of
donating 30 or but really things about
this means of course a lot to me but i
also have some information for you
regarding the dental env√≠a and the US
release the information i got one week
ago was obviously wrong it's already
released in the US and you can buy it
directly from the den on us store some
of my friends in the u.s. already
ordered it for $199 they are waiting for
it to be delivered and yeah you can find
the link in my video description is not
affiliated i simply wanted to share this
with you for all those who did not have
a chance to buy it in the US yeah now
you can I think in some weeks it will be
also offered on Amazon but currently now
it's only offered on the US store from
then on yeah if you are interested or if
you got interested because of my videos
check it out tell me afterwards
if you are satisfied some obviously and
they still find some others because
better well I had some discussions with
some of my friends who are audio
engineers who builds because who tuned
speakers and they were impressed as well
one immediately said 'hey i have two
other one as well so i mean it is an
impressive speaker not just like all the
others but it is something particular
and you can buy it also in the u.s. yeah
just wanted to share this with you
because some comments are still why it's
not released in u.s. it is directly from
the u.s. to from then on so yeah we
could have maybe saved the giveaway but
yeah
it will be sent when I get my unit from
then on it's already shipped but I'm
still awaiting for it to be delivered
and then I will forward it to the winner
Stephen I think yeah so Stephen be
patient a bit you will get it in some
weeks yeah again thanks a lot for
everything for your nice comments for
the donations if you are having a spare
euro or dollar you send it to me please
and if I get enough I can of course buy
news because for a new year for 2018 I
have some surprises also some giveaways
of course and yeah you have to be
patient a little bit I will try to post
another video before a new year with
some announcements what's coming you
know what will be coming in 2018 so stay
tuned and Merry Christmas again have a
nice time and bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
