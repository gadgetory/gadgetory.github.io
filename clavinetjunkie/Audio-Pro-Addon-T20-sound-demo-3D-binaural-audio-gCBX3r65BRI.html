take a more detailed look at the AutoCAD
LT 20 which I finally selected as my
main listening system for home for
everyday use from all the others here
recently I had lots of difference
because I found like the huge I feel
Ultima for the active maybe you saw my
video about the vintage to augment the
vector middle where the audio proton t20
were already featured also the
professional or other studio monitor
like you got new protein 300 or the
powerful serum which even have some
coins driver and they all sound great
when used as intended so the new pro
standing exactly in front of you like
studio monitors one meter away they
sound great but I needed a solution
which sounded great in my room here I
don't have that much yes space to place
them correctly so I rather put them into
the corners and I wanted something which
sounds really nice and this is ready all
you pro really keep a nice without
compared to all the others they are hot
from neutrals or they are not studio
monitors I tried measuring them but my
new field measurement technique doesn't
work that well so you can see there is
some strong smile response also some
deep in the presence region which of
course is nice as others because I'll
tend to boost this region like JPL
speaker so you get this hard sound this
on release mode and also for all levels
the tone adjustments are nice so
boosting base your other only boost
lower base boosting for every other only
boost upper treble unlike the new birds
which boost it's a field so you boost
the entire mids and 12 section and
effects states don't sounded great
I thought we will try them out already
listening to an artificial panel head
you should listen and headphones for the
best result keep my voice is and others
reference to get get the correct listen
loudness so understanding one and a half
meters away from you and we are going to
try them out maybe against the rifles
placed correctly as you would do in a
normal room and then also placed far
apart maybe comparing against a new
problem so please put up your headphones
and let's check them out first let's
compare data 20 against a toy from a
team of 40
with a more traditional placement
product - there's not that much
difference between these two the p2000
slightly cheaper or so sizes were
smaller
let me see for every day I cannot let
them like this I don't have to
reposition everything then put them
slightly better but I can only manage
maybe when I empty the fishnet ones
unless it's too heavy to even move my
own setup is over there just like the
new birth new project we have at our
standing and later on we can maybe
compare these two as well but then
improper element for up close listening
they sound really great very precise but
I think for filling this room with music
on your property 22 a potato but now
let's compare a spoon and 30 20 we'll be
playing first
see
diamonds
visions of what defenders
here
only based on simply better horse at low
levels like this I simply would boost
bass would post travel to making
something more appealing now let's
listen to these two the other point L&amp;amp;T
20 against a new that you brought me 300
I know that the placement like this
quite far artists really Sapa but still
I think the autocross somehow managed
something musical I am start again with
you all your energy banking
usually 12 the you can start insists on
increase
the base here emphasize where I sleep on
a sofa is not as far but then we
wouldn't see
a great job here I think you could hear
why I selected audio / etem t 20 over
all the others yeah not only because of
looks but in my room with this strange
placement they offer the best result
somehow what I didn't show you yet they
back up all the connections one is
active the other one expensive here you
also have the button so you can select
between different sources they have two
digital optical inputs a USB out but
only for charging here is an auxiliary
with cinge and saudade although here I
wouldn't attach a subwoofer
there is enough base it resists down
into 30 minutes so I think they offer a
great result
not being that Sonic speaker but a
pleasant sounding one and this is what I
like about audio Pro I tried yeah I
track the t3 t3 was the first one I
tried some two years ago away the three
years it's on it great way better way
nicer than the G bit extreme although
not being that loud I heard the 3 or C 5
cm and they all sound great
better than the Marshall equivalents as
they are somehow not copies but they
have the same rival a also the p3 is
exactly the same as the Marshall Keeble
still the t3 being smaller sounds better
so I'm also quite impressed with the t20
I have the t8l which I probably won't
use that one that off anymore I have
them placed my TV set but I saw I prefer
the twenties I would like to try out
maybe the T 14 as well I'm sure they
will also have this typical audio
protein with some slight they call it I
think BBC deep so in the region of 3 4 5
kilohertz there is some slight lead to
make the Sun simply more pleasant also
effects is as other speakers who are
tend to spread this presence area more
effects is like the new possible so on
exists you get a completely flat song
but if you listen static effects is the
presence region becomes way to emphasize
so I really like the audio probe you can
try them out from my database
they are only already included with all
the others as well and I think they
sound really nice I would highly
recommend them for all those who look
for some nice looking look for some nice
ink
you can see they are slightly tilted
backwards it's minimal party it helps to
emit sound more upwards like the books
also here my room I need whites because
black ones don't need the highest
loudness these are crazy loud I couldn't
even call them at maximum I only put
them to 35% and I only had to limit
quite a lot because they have so much
bass so it makes me this was just
overwhelming so I like them a lot I
recommend recommend them if I find a
better solution I would of course like
to know but so far these give me better
results and all these professional ones
or expensive ones this constant you can
write them below 600 euros I thought I
can find a way better sounding solution
for this price I would be interested in
our suggestions of course but it must be
speaker which can really feel the sound
maybe with more on the directional sound
I'm not sure but the 8020 you could hear
do a much better job than the blue pros
here new Pro has a new night not now I
think they got their called X X Pro
something quite curious to universe well
maybe I can grab a sample go great for
my purpose like here feeling my big room
with music they are out of place so
these obviously do the trick also at low
levels simply boosting base slightly
travel size and you get a nice low lives
they don't have none of this has
automatic loudness compensation for
dollars so at least here you can help by
using the tone controls which I really
set up in a sensible way so audio Pro
has some they know what they are doing
nervously and I'm very curious to hear
some stuff from them yeah I think this
was all check them out to my database
compare them to some other speakers buy
them whatever I like them a lot thanks a
lot for watching
they'd be happy to take a more detailed
look if you're a donkey 20 which I find
it's a hi and welcome today let me to
take a more detailed look</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
