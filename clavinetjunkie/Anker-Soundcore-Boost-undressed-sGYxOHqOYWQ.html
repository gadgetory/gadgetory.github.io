anchor sound caboose to do a pretty
impressive speaker just maybe it didn't
be shy of traveled ever let's see if the
sound improves when we remove the grille
I will do this in a magic way Charlie
modern hocus pocus tada
here it is but first time story behind
this this was the unit I got at the very
beginning some time ago but I couldn't
present it to you as it had some reading
on the left side so I asked for
placement which was this one we heard in
the media already but still I wanted to
know why is this rattling if I could fix
it by myself so I tried to remove the
cover which was not that easy so I did
it with brute force and damaged the
cover but you can of course remove it by
taking down this bottom plate this is
glued by the way then you have to
unscrew the other bottom part below and
you get access to all the screws which
fix the grille to the body of course by
removing the grille all screws become
unsealed so there was a leak coming
through and the speaker solid crappy so
I fixed it by some hot glue now it
sounds to my surprise much better than
before you get some real trails partly
which is somehow missing from the
dressed one let's say and of course I
would like to demonstrate you this I
will grab my head cam my binaural
microphones and let's check them out
unfortunately I cannot switch between
both directly as both have exactly the
same name and Harris doesn't allow this
but I will start with the normal one and
analog from so personal princess feature
so let's have a listen
I try connecting to the other one number
one again and I think you can hear a
difference again make it one a quite
clear but to make this more comfortable
I will record one after the other with a
another song that has quite a bit of
treble high heads and so on and then you
can hear this definitely better so let's
start with the naked one first
and now let's compare the naked Sankar
boost against a can with bt 77 maybe
remember this I think this is one of the
best if not the best selling portable
speaker in the size I've heard although
not all that flows is the battery is
really crap both are playing without
their bass enhancing modes and the naked
sound car boost will became first
another song from savasana princess
region so let's have a listen
he's just a g-man sighs my fantasy on TV
clear are more sparkling let's turn on
the top you will use some slight
distortion maybe it's also the freedom
or you can hear the anchor sounds really
nice here I will stand up and let's
listen to them at higher levels so there
is the anchor decreasing volume to
maximum no distortion wrapping canvas
random
ultimate price not really that must be
fine
and both I able to retain quite an
amount of tape the anchor is maybe
slightly tougher but still quite
impractical you could hear it but the
improving sound is quite significant I
would say you get the straightest part
in sync you missing from the original
one also a more direct more open sound
of course the smaller permanent or the
best solution you see with this hot glue
the speaker looks quite a bit rough
still it has some funky look to it I
would say that it even completes well
against this reference because they can
would be t77 it's definitely the best
effort in this class and in size so the
anchor without cameras sounds pretty
close of course doesn't have this very
enhancing algorithm but yes very very
nice also loudness life's not that much
difference this is a 2.1 system with an
own woofer this is just 2 4 inch drivers
and two passive Raiders of course if
someone from Anka listens or watches
this yet please retune bass up a little
bit at mid levels there is too much
distortion too much uncontrolled Ness
and please add a little bit treble so
that it sounds with cover as it does now
without yeah I will continue using it
like that like this is I really like it
a lot
I don't care about the look I simply
laughs great sound and the anchor the
naked one definitely delivers it I hope
this was helpful anyhow it's not a mod
about for someone who has the money 70
$80 simply remove the cover maybe if you
manage it like I shown by unscrewing it
you will remove it without damaging it I
didn't manage so I don't have the cover
anymore but I like
how it sounds now and I hope Anka will
do some further tweaks to make that
sounds perfect
currently it's already great but without
cover it's even better so thank you all
for watching and see you in the next
video in a nice time and bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
