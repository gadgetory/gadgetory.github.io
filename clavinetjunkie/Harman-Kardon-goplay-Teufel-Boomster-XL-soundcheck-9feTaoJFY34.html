the new Harman Kardon game play against
the Toy Fair boom star XL as some have
already asked about it and maybe you
have noticed I'm back with my Sony
action cam as the Hawai I 4k I tried
before was not very satisfying
I think the Sony gives them much better
image quality without this wobbling
effect and although the Sony has some
fisheye effect I can remove it in
post-processing as you can see here so I
cannot eliminate it completely but I
think it's better than completely
without distortion correction so back to
the speaker's it's always the same
question which sounds better this is not
quite easy to answer as you can see both
are completely different the Harman
Kardon is much smaller
the total bumster weighs nearly three
times as much and it's also way louder I
showed it in a German video where I
compared it against the IVA XS 9 that
that toy free boom store Excel was even
louder so it's about twice as loud as
the hammer car don't go and play some
already complained that the Harman
Kardon is not portable but have a look
at this I mean great thing is that it
has this belt so you can really hang it
around your shoulder but the Harman
Kardon gunplay is really portable which
I would like to demonstrate you now so
this is a really small rucksack and you
can see it fits in pretty nicely even
together with the charge 3 and maybe
some camera and I can even close it
where is the zip
so yeah it is indeed portable I could
even fit in some bottle some beer some
vodka no idea but it's not as big as
some afraid of you have to really see it
life it's a pretty compact speaker I
mean not as compact as JBL chachki but
for what it pumps out it's really nicely
small of course both yeah I will turn
them on first of course both sound
completely different and before having a
listen I will show you two frequency
response measurements of both here you
can see the go and play and the total
boomstick cell you can see that the
Harman Kardon is more tuned for that
space so it has some lower bass boost at
around 50 Hertz while the total boom
stir Excel has more upper base there is
some boost at 200 Hertz also some post
at 70 Hertz so yeah it depends which
would you like more as always I'm using
binaural microphones so to get really
realistic results you should listen with
headphones I will start with some tunes
some electronical stuff later on some
rock also some acoustic stuff and let's
listen with the Harman Kardon go and
play first
quit play again
Hartford
want to play again
yeah maybe you can hear that both sound
indeed different the typhoon has treble
controls as well as bass but both are
neutral the Harman Kardon has nothing
but with a truth I think it's it's tuned
really well so there is no need for some
additional controls let's try another
track again starting with the echo and
play first and this lower bass boost
gives you this nice lower kick
I hope you can hear this why the boy
Fred boomstick self has a more booming
sound thanks to the upper bass boost the
kick is not as present
won't play again another pic - let's
check how well the song disperses to the
sides and also to above
- the treble doesn't have this sparkle
of the Harman Kardon don't play can't
play again
when play again
not a trick every way
- boom sex hell
my head's birthday
quickly again
- chance dance don't eat
this big
Oh
what we could of course try is maybe add
a little bit of treble and maybe two
notches and take away bass one not also
two notches
maybe this will equalize both slightly
more let's listen to another track very
nice deep bass coming out of the corn
play here
easy to see me
what's a very nice Terry effect there is
some obvious sterile processing on the
target you can hear it that reverb and
zone is slightly increase
it's really more spacious quickly again
now track maybe something more acoustic
and I will increase volume slide you can
see I am slightly about half on their
current play while the bumster is more
closer to half volume
you
can play again
there is much less upper base on the
corn play and the travel is somehow
smooth I did
boom stir again
you went play again
and another could suggest right
photographer
go and play yeah I think it's a matter
of taste which you like more you cannot
say one is better than the other let's
try something else
- boom strikes hell
it is louder now but you can hear that
there is some stereo wave here
although the hammock Adam sounds pretty
spacious it doesn't give you a basic
stream stereo every boomsticks elegant
yes less lower base with increased space
again and with you straddle on much
sounds a bit boom you click on play here
you have some bass kick but not that
much upper base
also treble doesn't disperse as nicely
to the sides
sounds quite a bit clearer that's why no
tracks and well as the going play is not
as loud or let's say the ultra booster
is so much louder I will keep the game
of my recorder the same but will simply
go far away this is the gunplay No
and I will start increasing volume to
maximum undergoing play yeah this is
maximum off
and I will increase volume to make some
of the booms to excel as well
go and play again also maximum it starts
sounding a bit lost let's see if I can
the closer without making the recording
distort - boom stir
can't play again
yay cannot compete loudness wise no
chance and outright some rocks
but this is really mixing
explore that - sir
let's try this again
another take more extreme according from
nocopyrightsounds
no discards a minute remains nicely
controlled but not very loud and after
the booster the boom stress this extreme
won't play again yeah maybe some dance
track also nocopyrightsounds this is the
gold play playing at maximum
- boom star yeah the difference is more
than obvious
I will try maybe matching them the
gunplay this is maximum more
the Bolsheviks alias more
a wrongful birth you
Conte play again
made the Pierce even softer then so yeah
sound wise you heard the difference is
pretty big and obvious I mean if you
need this maximum loudness I think there
is hardly any better speaker than the
oil boom to Excel also battery life I
haven't tested it in detail yet I will
try doing this soon to see how much or
how long it can play at maximum volume
the Hammond Colin going plane manages to
hours slightly above while I think this
should do twice as much twice as long
the battery is four times as big it has
88 watt hours while the Harman Kardon
going play has 22 so yeah definitely
much more powerful sound wise to tell
the truth I prefer for everyday
listening I prefer the Hammond Colin go
play has this impressive typical Harman
Kardon or JBL tunic with nicely boosted
lower base and not that much upper base
this sounds a little bit more boxy but
yes you heard loud as wise simply no
comparison this becomes a little bit of
a joke so for other party yet the
deltoid boom so it's definitely the way
to go and despite its 10 kilograms here
you can still you can see it know you
can still carry it quite nicely without
this carrying loop or grip it would be
impossible to carry it it has two grips
here but yeah it's not this comfortable
tool to carry around so for everyone who
was interested in this comparison I hope
this could help you further I still
think the hammock atom can place one of
the very best boom boxes not that big
way more portable than a clip James III
for example as you can really pack it
into smaller rack sectors it's not very
big one and it packs some punch not very
loud but if you need this loudness you
need also a bigger speaker so I hope
this was helpful I hope you liked it and
we will see you soon with another video
have a nice time at bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
