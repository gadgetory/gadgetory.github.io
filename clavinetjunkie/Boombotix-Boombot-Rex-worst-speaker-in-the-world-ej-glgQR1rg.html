look at the boom box boom bow tracks and
all that this is not the newest speak
anymore they even have a newer model out
no the boom ba tracks Pro but back then
this was advertised as being the loudest
portable speaker in the world they even
did lots of videos comparing it against
some other speakers asking people which
one was better and all seem to be blow
away by the sound and loudness of the
boom ba tracks it was offered at the
premium I think 80 $90 meanwhile you can
find it below 20 so I took the chance
and all that one so far it was not quite
available in Europe so I ordered it from
the Amazon Us store and here it is you
can see packaging is pretty interesting
with this foam inlay here but not really
that much inside just some wires and the
speaker the speaker doesn't really feel
quite premium but doesn't feel cheap
either it has a nice rubber finish so
it's splash water resistant charging is
done from microUSB it has an input and
output so you could maybe use it as a
kind of Bluetooth receiver with the
headphone or something controls on top
and there is a clip so you can attach it
to a belt pretty strong and the most
interesting part is of course how it
sounds if it's really that great so I
will turn it on and as always I'm of
course using binaural microphones so you
should loosen it headphones it should be
connected so let's start with the first
track I'm from add volume now
I can
ooh ah what's this this sounds horrible
the travel is completely distorted and I
will increase volumes what was this some
digital artifacts maybe let's try
another track ah this is unbearable even
soft you can hear it maybe we can fix
this somehow a cheaper ochco fixed it so
it sounds better but I don't think this
is a real solution maybe let's try
pillows
yeah also better but still writing yeah
I have this JBL go here also quite a
cheap speaker let's hear how this sounds
compared I mean the JBL is not a great
sounding speaker but still we can
compare this to again starting with the
boom ba tracks the JBL if family the JBL
appears models and it sounds much cooler
this really hurts I have to this is how
it should sound yeah I'm not sure if
they really think this or if this is
serious so I thought I will measure it
and here you can see a measurement of
the boom ba tracks and there is an
obvious treble boost at 14 kilo Hertz
with more than 20 DB if you if the
speaker gets too much input gain it
distorts completely I don't know if this
is really serious maybe I got a lemon or
something but maybe we can fix this with
some with some equalizer so I will start
my equalizer app and let's start again
this is without EQ now but I can
maybe reduce 8 kilohertz yeah we have to
reduce it by 15 degrees to get
acceptable results here now it sounds
better I think I will shall not equal
let's try the JBL again with without the
cure i have to switch over so but it
still sounds better and cooler
outside I will switch over to the Pumbaa
tracks again with EQ and we will hear if
this is any better I mean no it's
bearable but let's kernel EQ again let's
try another track ah this is I don't
know
yeah from behind it becomes a bit better
but still I will turn volume to maximum
board let's see if it's really that loud
a JBL as well yeah that one bar X is
definitely louder
it's only a mess let's try maybe another
speaker the GDK a 25 this costs well
around $30 so not that much much more
expensive add on both the maximum and
let's start with the boom box again yeah
I have to go away slightly because it
really hurts okay yeah maybe slightly
softer but the sound is because their
own boss dances around there
yeah ingleses really ridiculous
I'm not sure if if the speakers really
meant to be serious
but it sounds like a bad joke I don't
know if I got a lemon or something but
it's unbearable it's it's unusable you
would have to here take away all the
treble I don't know it's I would I would
avoid bomb but expand amines
I even tried contacting them if this is
really serious but didn't quite got any
response let's turn it off again but at
least you you get some sound out of it
this is a joke
I wouldn't yeah I will take it back
again and probably throw it away I
wouldn't even like to give it away as a
present as thesis this is it's like
probably the worst speak I've ever had
and and if they really asked 80 $90 for
it this is a ripoff a total yeah I'm I'm
nervous because it really hurt my ears I
hope this was helpful for you I didn't
know boom buttocks and yeah I probably
shouldn't have tried it out because now
I'm really know that this is pure junk
thanks out for watching and we will see
us in the next video bye bye I was fired
on the one hand for with the chest</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
