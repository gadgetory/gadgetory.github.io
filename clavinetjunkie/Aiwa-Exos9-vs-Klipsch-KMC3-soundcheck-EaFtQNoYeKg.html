today I thought we will try out
something really serious no fooling
around with little toys but really heavy
stuff look what I brought here this is
the IVA XS 9 and the clips KMC 3 that I
got from a friend this is maybe one of
the most powerful speakers so far well
until the Iowa but to make the clips
portable you need batteries or some
external power bank but a suitable power
bank costs around hundred euros so I
bought eight batteries for eight euros
you have to open this door here put
eight batteries inside you know it's
quite a hassle wet-vac with the IVA you
simply buy another battery if you run
out of juice it has a sweat ball
rechargeable battery here and you won't
cost fifty dollars there will be one
with double the capacity which should
cost about $70 so despite being bigger
this is the real portable speaker first
I wanted to make an auto comparison in
the open field but I had to hide myself
into the forest because of wind we will
have a listen hub of comparing maximum
volume later on we will go indoors and
have a listen at normal volume levels
which sounds better and so on I will of
course be wearing my binaural
microphones my head cam so that you get
a kind of first-person impression so
please put up your headphones and have a
listen I will turn both to maximum as we
are mostly interested in how loud they
can play they equalize a result on the
eyebrow it doesn't need any I will play
some tunes starting with the IVA
the first song is from my biggest Idol
opal opal and then we will have a listen
hope of compare
Oh face with the bitch
the father go away and more to solve
disappears the I rise still plays 12 the
tips is somewhat somehow 12
oh this was a bit of distortion that's
for this this is the IVA
eclipse well no base not at this
distance
I will try going as far away as I can
until the group of connection breaks up
the Eclipse is already having some
problems what the is this Mickey
Mouse hip-hop for us this is the Iver by
the way still going well the Klipsch is
disappearing not only sunwise but also
bluetooth wise
I was still going strong let's try a hot
strip I'm away maybe well 50 meters or
something and I'm still hearing it
pretty well the clip doesn't make fun
anymore also Bluetooth reaches far
notice is wide
there is some very slight distortion
with the IRA keep in mind this is still
a very early prototype I think my unit
is number 24 or something the clip
doesn't sound very convincing anymore
here you can hear the bass drum I mean
if it makes you dance that's for this or
our rock stands
keep in mind and maybe 15 meters away or
even more
the Klipsch is stunning is if it didn't
have any sub woofer
I have another track from opal opal this
is a remix quite bass-heavy let's have a
listen how this sounds
I'm starting again with the IVA notice
why stella comparable it's just that the
leaps down to the poor's without base
while the Ivor sound still hey body then
we simply more powerful now let's have a
listen how both compare indoors as you
can see I set them up one above the
other this is simply because the table
is too small for such big speakers but
the IVA is so large that it can easily
accommodate the clip above you also
won't get this disturbing left/right
separation but rather be hearing both in
the center so you can also judge better
which has better stereo imaging and so
on I will be starting with the IVA I'm
playing slightly above half volume for
both and well please have a listen
the clip becomes pretty muffled if not
listen exactly on axis are check out
this
drivers better in this regard
it's for something else
the clip sounds somehow stressed there
is lots of low best content content in
the song and I think this makes the clip
suffering
I think the sound is a matter of taste
but I hope you could hear the
differences I think the IVA has a bit
more refined sound more bass especially
outdoors you could hear that it sounds
really powerful why the clips was
already suffering a bit so I hope my
video was helpful this time again if you
liked it please thumbs up see you then
and bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
