present your or rather warn you from
another low-budget speaker I found this
on Amazon it was only shown as an ad and
it's available from different brands
some have it for $25 others for $30 and
I thought yet it reminds me a bit of a
small creative role but also the
taotronics past ex looks similar so I
thought this might be interesting as
well problem is it isn't or at least the
sound is really not that great as I
thought it has TF or SD card playback it
also has an USB charging art but we will
see that the sound is really crappy
let's turn it on and I mean these
welcome tones they are so loud you smell
it you smell they are already sold out
that that is thought I'm not sure what
all these people are smoking but before
I thing is maybe you want to see some
frequency response measurements and you
can see nothing special and awkward
still to throw at treble and bass
already rolls off at around 200 Hertz
there is no basic just with follow
levels a JBL cow sounds more balanced so
yeah not sure what the speaker is all
about there are some nice reviews of it
but well I would like to show you how it
sounds in reality as always i'm of
course using pen or microphones so you
should listen with headphones i will
start with the speaker which is simply
called b23 and a smooth jazz track then
i will switch over to the taotronics
pulse X so please have a listen
yeah quite a treble heavy sound as shown
in the measurement the effects of course
in comparison it gives a little bit of a
muffled impression but the sound is much
fuller and much more balanced
this is just rebel maybe something else
not work we're just really horrible you
get some nice bass and everything and
it's not as real as the other one or
maybe five dollars more maybe some days
back
yeah I think the difference is pretty
obvious let's check them out
at maximum so I will come up the house
eggs first this is maximum and you can
hear how it remains pretty punchy
now the b23 yes rather is sports
an object
you can hear some slight limit us in
that context but it's still louder and
more powerful sounds just horrible so
yeah I wanted to warn you from this as I
thought it might be a decent speaker I
like the design but yeah really nothing
special and not even worth twenty-five
dollars yeah I would maybe take it for
nine as you get some nice charging you
know power bank function but apart from
that yeah nothing that special and these
voice prompts like missing a little note
yeah okay so yeah hope you like this
also wanted to tell you that I added the
bump box to the audio database in the
meantime also the music is added I
placed it like that and you will notice
that yeah the bump box is really really
loud it's one of the loudest I had to
reduce volume a slight little not at
maximum because otherwise the recording
would distort is its yeah much too loud
but the recording still distorts a
little bit with particular tracks so
it's definitely the loudest behind this
database but at the same time you will
notice that it's mono yeah it is a mono
speaker I'm not sure if they if all I
like that or if mine is screwed up and
you will notice that the sound is pretty
crappy so nothing special also lots of
his the left twitter has really horrible
hiss and yeah I will turn it on and this
starts creeping in slowly
yeah and remains on this level now it
went away again but yeah it's really
really lets also the Bluetooth
contribution tones are very very loud
they are played always at maximum I mean
when I turn volume up here that tone
will be okay help
also this we had me at lowest level and
now the bass that
disappearing at lowest level but you can
hear that hiss I will turn the music off
again
this is unacceptable
so it is loud but it's the only thing it
can really do good other everything else
sound and and functions I'm not really
that impressed of course there will be a
more detailed review I'm in contact with
the BAM box guys as I'm not sure if they
if they really I mean if this is serious
a mono speaker and with all this noise I
mean you can still hear it from here
I am three meters away and and it's
noisy as hell
so here really a bit questionable
currently I mean it was a Kickstarter or
IndieGoGo project so maybe they are
still not they didn't fix all bugs but
you can see also this design here i mean
is this croaked or crushed crunch it how
do you say in english also the build
quality this is not a speaker I would
pay $500 I mean it's loud but yeah
nothing else so yeah forget this b23
it's really crap let atronics is of
course nice for 30 around $30 so yeah I
hope you like this and see you in the
next video until then have a nice time
and bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
