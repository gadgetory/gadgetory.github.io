something tomorrow is my wife's birthday
my son already had birthday some days
ago and her biggest wish was always did
I paint Jesse
unfortunately Jesse passed away in
December so I never managed but I
thought yeah it might be nice to paint
her a picture I'm already quite far took
me on two hours we can see the results
so far I think it's quite okay still I
have to work out the details also put a
bit more depth into the image also work
on the background but I think it's quite
okay so far I also painted Roxy's some
years ago and she always wanted Jesse so
I hope you will like it so I thought I
will set up my camera and do some
time-lapse and I hope something will be
come out of it a little bit better
because I'm not that satisfied yet you
can see I think it's okay but it's not
very it so yeah
yeah I think I'm more less done still I
want to work out some some smaller
details mmm hope she liked it yeah also
she always wanted some flowers but I
think this would distract too much from
the image maybe so I would probably
leave it like that I'm not a
professional painter so I apologize if
it's not that great
but I think it's quite okay mm yeah so
coming up next of course some speakers
again some headphones stay tuned and
sorry but I needed some time for my
family have a nice time bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
