to make an own dedicated video about
that or DC I sent an and plane a
magnetic in-ear headphone yeah what's
this maybe you've seen my video about
the Odyssey sedi for which was small is
the same but a higher class model or
let's say the top model in this line but
it was a huge disappointment especially
regarding the high price so for $2,500
or in Europe you have more expensive
with 3000 euros you would expect simply
way more but it sounded just crappy I'm
aware that it's designed to be used with
some additional equalizing but even with
this provided VST reveal plug-in by
Odyssey it still solid off so it would
need additional equalizing and I
couldn't bring it to some normal
sounding level why the I sent em can be
brought to a really high level and in
the meantime it became one of my
favorite in years among the a thematic
and some other ones therefore I wanted
to make this on video also cover all
aspects as this is my second unit the
first unit that I had had some issue on
the right side when putting it in I got
some cracking like some driver flags in
some forums I read that it's normal
others claim that you have to exchange
it so this is my second unit and this
one came with the second generation
cypher cable a crucial point of all
Odyssey in is that they just don't sound
good with a normal wire so with a normal
three point five millimeter wire the
sound is just yeah off it needs this
cypher cable which has additionally an
amp included a DSP also there is some
additional equalizer through a map so
you can adjust the sound to your liking
because the funny thing is that just
with the Y alone it still doesn't sound
good
so you need to equalize it further to
bring it to some really normal sounding
later and the problem I have here is
that my replacement unit once again
different so there is some sample
variation I'm not sure I would like to
show you this this is already equalized
with cypher cable so you will hear both
both units with exactly the same
settings this these ear hooks don't work
well on my ears also I had to cut the
ears a little bit because I couldn't fit
a full-size headphones so and
you will hear the old unit and then the
new one so you will hear the difference
is it just a fantasy
you are with my thoughts I never stray
from the heart of
so the old unit had some strange
hollowness in the mids
the sound is really different it's not
really simple variation if all units
differ like this then yeah you cannot be
through what you are getting
I'm quite satisfied with my replacement
unit but the problem is the cypher
carrier in the first generation one
sounds definitely better first maybe
let's look at the packaging it comes
like this so you open it here at the
back or DZ planar magnetic technology
flux and 50 magnets super efficient for
two times the driving power 99.9 percent
lower distortion award-winning something
yeah here is some cut cut through view
you can see that flux on magnet the
University of Reading fazer
whatever this is and they have improved
the new lightning cable a little bit
this one this remote the whole amp and
DSP since it's inside it's quite heavy
so it it hangs quite a bit why the new
one is redesigned it also has an
additional button and it's way lighter
so this is the remote like very it feels
rather cheap this one expensive but it's
too heavy so it puts it tends to pull
them out of your ear if it hangs just
like this therefore and I use them with
these ear hooks I also wrapped some some
pipe because they're quite thin so after
a while they tend to hurt my ears I need
to find some better ones some rubbery
ones these are also a bit too hard but I
cannot use them without these ear hooks
also the ear hooks tend to break easily
my friend broke them if you if you don't
if you are not careful they are very
flimsy but like this I'm quite satisfied
the problem is that the new lighting
here is once again completely different
and a new one needs a new app also has
the same 10 band equalizer
but the equalizer reacts in a completely
different way that bands are way more
narrow and with the old one you simply
had to adjust the sound a little why
would the new one there is a peak at 18
kilohertz maybe very high one and you
cannot reduce it known it's not let me
see it's not 13 it's at thirteen point
five kilo Hertz and it's just in between
the 8 kilohertz and the 16 kilohertz
band so if you reduce 16 kilohertz and 8
it's dim there because the bands are way
more narrow with the old one they were
broader so they adjusted the sound in a
more general way why the new one yeah so
how to proceed I would like to show you
how the sound changes between both
cypher cables first you will hear it
with the original 3.5 millimeter cable
and you will notice it just doesn't
sound good I will use the new unit so
the better sounding one because the
other one sounded a bit Hollow I also
used that unit for my LCD I for review
therefore I think the new one sounds
definitely much better and first you
will hear it with the with the normal
3.5 millimeter cable then I will switch
to the first generation cypher cable
then to the second generation cypher
cable and then I will use my equalizing
which I think brings into some really
high level for for the for the old one
and I also tried to adjust the equaliser
bring it to a similar sound but I didn't
manage you will hear there is still some
some treble peak so it was not possible
to make them sound equal yeah at the
beginning will hear the original track
for for reference for you that you know
how it should sound and then 3.5
millimeter cable then the first
generation cypher cable then the second
generation cypher cable and again
equalized and at the very end again the
original track so let's have a listen
I think would hear the old cypher Camus
has definitely nice and smooth on then
you one has the strength peak and even
with some additional equalizing you
cannot get rid of it and this is where
I'm getting a little bit frustrated
because instead of improving it I mean
they made it lighter
they made it nice out so the cable is
nicer now this was some flat cable quite
stiff this is a normal cable but the
result is worse I would like to show you
my equalizer settings first for the old
cypher cable this looks like this
so I rejected them a little bit since my
LCD I for video so you can see i reduced
base slightly i reduced for kilohertz
nearly completely i reduced 8 kilohertz
by minus 8 DB also 16 kilohertz a little
bit 500 hertz to get rid of the upper
base while with the new one which needs
another app which is called odyssey high
q-- my equalizer setting to bring it to
a similar level would look like this
reduce base by 8 TB at 332 Hertz by 6 DB
at 64 Hertz because it's way more base
heavy in its stock tuning and not full
and you could hear without equalizing it
sounds like some some some highly lots
of bass lots of treble and middle in
between and here I had to boost 4
kilohertz by 3 DB in contrast to
reducing it product for the old cable
and I reduced 16 kilohertz completely by
12 DB or so 8 kilohertz by 2 DB but this
13 kilo Hertz peak is still there so I
cannot really bring it to to the same
level both
and if I could recommend something this
is I would recommend the old cipher
cable Odyssey now announced a Bluetooth
cypher cable so this would work us all
with Android this is only lightning but
if it's again like this also with this
narrow EQ bands that you cannot adjust
the sound that well yeah it's a
disappointment so stick to the old
cypher cable and adjust the equalizer
but with the new one it's quite
impossible to bring the sound reading
right it's still too seasoning I would
like to show you some frequency response
measurements first the new unit let's
forget the old one I think maybe it's
sample variation maybe it's some effect
I'm not sure but this is with the
standard 3.5 millimeter cable and you
can see that until 1 kilohertz it's more
less flat but then you get this strange
peak at around 1.7 kilohertz too little
response between 2 and 6 kilohertz and
again some stronger treble boost let's
have a look what the cypher cable does
in this case the first generation you
can see it boost base and also the
entire region above 2 kilohertz way too
much boost makes it sound way too harsh
so with my equalizing it will look like
this and you can see a reduced base
slightly it's still more boosted than
with its neutral stock tuning but I
think with a little bit of a lower bass
boost it's more enjoyable and more
punching then you can see I reduced the
entire 2 3 up to 10 kilohertz region
also treble slightly as I think this
makes it definitely appear more neutral
I will take away the standard cipher
tuning and let's have a look at the new
generation cypher cable which looks like
this and you can see it's close up to my
tuning but they reduced 4 kilohertz way
too much and boost the travel too much
at the same time you can see that bass
is also heavily boosted way too much for
my taste so when trying to bring the new
cypher cable with additional equalizing
from my preferred response it will look
like this you can see they are quite
similar but there is some strange drop
below 30 Hertz I'm not sure if they did
this on purpose to minimize distortion
in the lower base region I'm not quite
sure but you can also see the 13 killer
peak is still there and you cannot get
rid of it so regardless what which
settings you choose it will be there and
it's to seasoning it's not normal
already with the
Generation cipher came I would reduce
treble slightly by maybe two or three DB
the 16 kilohertz Bend I left it like
this as I prefer a little bit of a
sparkle but this is too much with the
new one so I'm a little bit disappointed
I like it with the old one and
additional equalizing but the new cypher
cable is again a disappointment for me
so if you know what you're doing you can
bring it to some really high level some
enjoyable one not neutral or not spewed
your level let's say although I think
it's marketed as some studio headphone
read somewhere but it's not there are
too many Peaks here they are not that
horrible they react a bit different to a
normal in here so you get some peaks but
it's still somehow new natural sounding
if you apply the equalizer without it
doesn't sound that great let alone
without the cipher came without the
cypher cable it just just really strange
hardly any response in the upper mids
and it's funny that the new cypher cable
has the tendency to has already a
tendency to sound similar to my tuning
but they reduced upper mids too much and
boosted bass and treble too much they
could have made it really sound yeah
perfect
not true I didn't yeah I feel this was
it for the Odyssey I same time I'm a
little bit shocked how big the sample
variation is maybe I should try further
units but I will stop with this I'm
satisfied that I have one which I'm yeah
which I like a lot also I will keep my
old self a cable because the new one is
unusable for me maybe I will try the
Bluetooth version but hey I'm afraid it
will rather sound like this one the only
thing we could do is maybe play some
other samples my usual songs
and I'm not sure compare maybe both
cypher cavers to each other
equalized I'm not quite sure or maybe
let's compare it against some other in
here yeah I will decide later when I
when I start editing this video but have
a listen and in the comments tell me if
you liked it if you don't like it I
think for $300 including the cipher came
I think it's a bit more expensive 350
it's ok but be sure to get the old
version not the new one although the new
one is nicer smaller it just doesn't
sound as great it would be nice if one
could have swept the furnace somehow
maybe one would need to contact Odyssey
but yeah so I hope I covered everything
check my other video about the LCD f4 I
definitely like that I sent an way more
the LCD f1 even was equalizing it
couldn't bring it to a normal level the
tuning was just off therefore I don't
quite understand why there should be a
step up
I mean if the sound is worse then it's a
downgrade despite the 10 times higher
price yeah definitely really nice if you
adjust the sound to some and bring it to
some normal level I will post my EQ
settings some screenshot maybe that you
can download checks check yours I tried
back and forth but I got stuck with this
one as I think it sounds the very best
and closest to a normal sounding
headphone like the HD 600 or something
or even the automatic so like this it
sounds normal
yeah thanks for watching and see you in
the next video bye bye
