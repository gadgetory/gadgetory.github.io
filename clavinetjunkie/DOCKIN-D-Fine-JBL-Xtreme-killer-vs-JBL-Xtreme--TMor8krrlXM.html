obviously minute video voltage a bit
extreme kilo was taking a bit critically
some people claimed you're but you're
only compared it against the GB charge
three so it's not an extreme kilo
problem is I didn't have the extreme
attend anymore I sold my only with some
time ago but I owned it for two years so
I think I know how it sounds with the
needs of the speaker and I think I can
state that that docking defined sounds
better and outperforms it yes to prove
my claim here I have a brand image a bit
extreme again bought by a friend of mine
some days ago so she brings you and we
can have a listen but to avoid any bias
towards a blend or anything Boyan
I thought we will do another blend
listening test I will put them on top of
each other so we won't really know which
one is playing and we just call them
against PKA and speaker B and you can
decide for yourself which you like more
and which is better and so on it's
always here please listen platforms I
will use my vanilla microphone for best
recording quality also a head came to be
a kind of first-person joke
put your headphones up and let's check
them out as you can see also put some
dampening material below in order to
avoid any vibration the docking design
has the basic way does only at the back
and this short minimizes I will start
with a track from Princess freesia as
for personal Enix and I will start with
speaker
you can also check out how they perform
effect
Oh quick I will come closer again please
call it in your Isis no tachi 20 degrees
and just machines
salvatore ferragamo like veloute a sauna
d always the Facebook here we go people
here don't ask you wanna know where is
it don't matter holy and these haters
who can beat against on me
Houston Texas yes and you saw 50 so far
as me up inside until not like I'm Jeff
maybe some kind of lock
maybe let's walk again a little bit
around a home to see how pounded grab
here yes cannot attract also focused on
we're talking like this lady was caught
increasing volume headed bit higher
Kumada Creek which is countryman and
recently more into XML it can be as well
hopefully and mixing another house back
quick
of course music and sound quality is
only a metros personal taste so I really
don't know which one you prefer to which
one found it work for you if you really
want to know which one was which yet
please have a look at the variant of the
video where we these piqué and piqué
abhi but I think it was still quite
obvious I'm really impressed by the
stocking design and I hope I could give
you a better idea about the qualities of
it especially compared to the JBL
extreme we will do maybe another test
authors to see how they perform at high
levels but yeah as for now 440 years or
120 pounds as it's also a little on the
British Amazon store I doubt you can get
much better because in this size and
class yeah you can get an Onix to do but
it's much larger not as portable and the
batteries clip so I hope you like the so
far stay tuned for the auto video have a
nice time and bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
