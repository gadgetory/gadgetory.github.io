Archaea a 110 I haven't found the
speaker on the Amazon US tour but the UK
store has it for 14 pounds the german
amazon store has it for 20 euros and if
you don't expect any kind of sound
miracles it's still pretty decent as it
has lots of features included like FM
radio and TF card playback so I thought
we'll check it out as you can see at the
back you have some kind of stand it
reminds me a little bit of the Harman
Kardon esquire me maybe but of course it
cannot really compete as it's much
cheaper so let's turn it on so it
automatically jumps into Bluetooth mode
yeah very cool voice of this guy here
and we can also switch to you can see at
the back Terra a mode button a light
button which we'll check later on so
let's turn to FM radio but the reception
is pretty badly we're live so in a city
it should be much better the reception
should be improved if you put in some
USB wire so you can hear it works more
or less you can switch between different
stations but yeah it's pretty bad here
we're live
some work better than others and there
is this light button I already told you
so let's turn it on and as you can see
there is a magical light here I will
darken the room slightly so we can see
this better and you can already see some
light here let's try the TF card or
micro SD there are different modes
available for the light this is a
standard color changing mode and this is
of course the more interesting one a
kind of disco light and this should also
give you an idea that the some of the
speaker which is well not that great but
it gets the job done later holding the
plus/minus button for for a second
changes volume otherwise you skip
between fresh I think it looks pretty
cool and there is another mode which
simply flashes or something becomes
darker and lighter I think
of course I prefer that one let's switch
over to blue it also has some record I
didn't know so you can record something
definitely for the tracks playback okay
now we are in Bluetooth and there is
another speaker pretty highly rated that
I love I love odd mini which costs the
same 20 euros here in the US store it's
a bit cheap I think it costs twelve or
fourteen dollars but yeah I don't think
it's as great let's try this as well and
I will play some tracks let's see if I'm
connected obviously not
yeah now and I will start with the
Archie first
a volume of course is not insane let's
switch over to that I love odd mini and
you can hear that it's much worse I mean
although the Archaea is not that great
that I love is simply horrible this
sounds like a bad memory or something
I will try turning them higher this
maximum no okay this is mixing as well
and let's try another trick
yeah a little bit of distortion already
what is sticking out this way
this is maximum volume is there I know
so you definitely have to reduce volume
slightly three notches below maximum
should do the trick
yeah I will lighten up the room again so
maybe not a must-have but for 20 euros
you get really nice features and this
will definitely work better as a present
than this here which cause the same I
don't know why this gets so many great
ratings this is junk it sounds bad and
it cannot do anything here you get FM
radio microSD card playback it can even
record I didn't know this and you get a
nice disco light so if you need some
present for your friend well why not
choose their archi a 110 i hope this
could give you an idea about this
speaker thanks a lot for watching and
we'll see us in the next video bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
