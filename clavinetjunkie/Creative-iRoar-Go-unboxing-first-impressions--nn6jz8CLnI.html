unboxing or you I wanted to make a video
about the ohms angle 3 the bestseller
number one on Amazon but I think this is
a bit more important this is the new
Aurora goal and yeah let's have a look
inside I think from what I heard some of
my friends have already heard it claimed
that it's pretty decent also quite a bit
smaller than the previous role models
and pretty loud as well so for 199 maybe
a nice contender for all those looking
for a decent speaker below $200 but I
haven't heard it yet so we will do the
unboxing together of course is always
I'm wearing binaural microphones in the
head cam to give you a kind of
first-person impression if you listen
with headphones you should get a pretty
realistic impression of the sound as
well as we'll play some tracks later on
in case it's charged and so what we have
here and feature wise pretty impressive
five drivers transform it into a
personal PA system digital music player
with micro SD playback intelligent app
for audio of personalization I think
this is a nice feature that you can
really adjust the app to your liking and
unlike the app from Ultimate Ears with
some three or four band equalizer which
yeah which lets you adjust the sound of
the mega boom and boom but yeah you
cannot really adjust anything because
it's here it doesn't do really great
things yeah I think it's really small
not smaller than the very first roar
that I owned and also way smaller than
the new I roar pretties pretty
sweet-looking I have the arrow as well I
wanted to cover it first but yeah it
didn't quite manage yet so you can see
both side by side so size wise it's
quite a difference
it's really much more portable
interesting what's this looks like
someplace Afridi - but these are here
maybe it has an additional sub driver
who knows but yeah you can maybe see it
no it's not quite visible yeah a big
main driver to smaller drivers well not
Twitter's but let's call it over and and
here is nothing this one has a different
layout it has two drivers here and the
main driver that main woofer here so
yeah what else is inside the box it was
beef and a charger with some adapters I
think it cannot be charged for micro USB
let's see what this oh here this in
which direction
hmm my nails are maybe too short I
really don't know I think it goes off
like this so we have a USB not sure what
it's for probably for some updates or
something and we have the main 15 volts
so yet probably no charging from micro
sd which is of course a pity yes I mean
it's a small speaker so it could be nice
we'll be able to charge it from micro
USB as well so let's put this away the
Aurora has a new super white mode which
would be pretty impressive maybe similar
to the to the toy toy for Dempster
prefered with dynamo or the ice on power
I reviewed recently which also has a
nice steering hansung so let's have a
listen how the IRA compares here so
maybe let's try turning it on
you know these tones still from the hold
in the very first roar and let's check
if we can connect here are bluetooth is
the USB auxiliary I think it also works
as a DAC when connected to two Bluetooth
so let's see if it appears here not yet
maybe we should force pairing from now I
think you can turn these voice prompts
off completely we will do this
immediately later on here it is
connection yeah pretty loud and yeah
maybe let's have a listen a track from
Princess freesia from her latest album
Stella sonic so let's check how it
sounds volume control here now it works
it seems to be same
there are two ways how to place it
either like this or a more direct sound
like that as I'm moving maybe let's
check the sound master connected we have
this
so it doesn't find the speaker obviously
it's quite don't know how to my speakers
here it doesn't find the speak up so
that app seems to be a bit yeah doesn't
want to do anything your speaker have
here it is finally
so now we are connected
I think the song changed immediately so
next we have usual here warm haha takes
a bit not much difference energy energy
load it takes quite a bit to change okay
I think it's something bit tinny so this
is super white mode which should be so
impressive it comes in all things
there should be some further settings ah
here we have no come on
every change takes a minute or what yeah
that's a bit frustrating if you want to
adjust the equalizer so let's just paste
like me well I cannot do any change
it doesn't really change
I don't know I can't feel anything
hmm yeah I mean it's not really that
impressive from what I can hear let's
try the super super white mode again
hey Samson hi Scott tricky Amy maybe
another fret on cap yet we also have a
roll named this seems to be war this is
war
okay now it's very interesting
and this is again the equalizer so this
is super wide without any defects yeah
Keith whisper roar it sounds the most
interesting also some stair enhancements
obviously in our track in resolution 88
which is jazz funk rock just released a
new album although this is an older
single from them
pretty loud I mean this is half half
volume yeah I think I would like to hear
it against the the big IRA which I was
not that impressed with let's see if it
will connect I mean nice features even
eps and everything but some ways it's a
bit
yeah we'll connect it maybe there's an
outfit from Cape yet this is their big
impressive
maybe a bit more than useless
I hope a scarer imaging is definitely
better from the smaller one I'm not sure
if they're IRA is playing with some set
in C of course I will disable all audio
effects here so this is with neutral
let's activate roar again alpha playing
with the war now there is sounds a bit
more interesting dance track the volume
always jumps on this one is pretty hard
to set a fixed volume level I think the
smaller one songs even slightly better
he came louder again
and now the volume control now it will
eat there seems to be something that the
world and control on this one
take this once again nothing happens
there seems to be something they may be
because of switching or because both are
connected within the app so well with
Rohr enabled it sounds pretty nice but
as soon as you disable or and it's a bit
unspectacular let's say but for let's
see if this works let's stop the music
yeah but we will of course have a much
more detailed look on it I will check
out our settings and see which one
sounds best I will do some measurements
yeah I think it's nice also pretty small
not much larger than a JBL charge 3 we
will of course check also how it
compares against the charge 3 but I can
already tell you that travel is
definitely better on this one and
loudness wise of course we will have to
see I mean I don't think it can compete
bass wise but still a pretty nice sound
so thanks a lot for watching yeah this
was a short unboxing maybe not as short
we had some problems connecting with the
app but yeah it finally worked out so
coming up next the ones no.3
the best seller number one on Amazon
among portable Bluetooth speakers so we
definitely have to check this out
and stay tuned yeah and see you see you
then bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
