world premiere unboxing only here on
this channel this is the Porsche among
portable Bluetooth because the new calf
gravity 1
I thought we will open this together it
just arrived as always I'm of course
using vanilla microphones so we can also
have a listen later on some first
impressions how it sounds how it looks
and so on you should listen headphones
of this results as binaural recordings
only work well though headphones but
yeah let's have a look what keV yes
thank you a brand new speaker
designed by Porsche in Austria so yeah
it's an Austrian speaker more or less no
it's of course British calf design I
mean the design is Porsche and
everything else acoustics is of course
keV we already heard the Kevlar which
was a decent speaker maybe a bit
expensive this one is even more
expensive I think it calls for $380 or
380 euros so it's definitely one of the
most expensive portable compact because
I've tried it looks very premium it is a
bit cold so yeah therefore you can see
my finger prints here definitely much
more premium than Bose Soundlink me also
gives a bit of a heavier impression and
yeah I think I mean depends you either
like or hate this design I think it's
really different
also that speaker fires upwards so you
get a more only directional sound unlike
yeah about Sonic mini which you always
have to aim directly at you otherwise it
sounds like crap so let's look inside
that packaging is really very exclusive
just like yeah what you would expect
from keV so what do you have here in
hard candy an irregular variants oh yeah
it may vary by region but well a charger
probably
one piece anodized aluminum housing to
maximize sound quality There is
obviously some carrying back included
which is of course nice
so you're just for transport you just
put this inside here and it won't
scratch or damage although the carrying
back is a bit thin so yeah it would have
been better maybe hold a bit more
thicker pouch so yeah let's put this
back again and what else do we have here
manual a nice charger USB charger and a
nice exclusive USB wire let's see where
are the port yeah they are here below so
we have charting through micro USB
auxiliary in and also re charging out so
it can act as power bank yeah of course
the most interesting part is how it
sounds
and yeah packaging is really really nice
I think the Box alone cost some twenty
thirty bucks let's put this away let's
turn it on and see if we managed to
connect here is the power button yeah
the same tones that we already know from
the Cape Muir it seems to have a similar
driver layout so two drivers but two
passive radiators this time it's already
here gravity one
and yeah he has a check so let's check
out somethin maybe no dance music as I
think it's much more exclusive premium
product so probably more for some yeah I
don't know if most can afford the
speaker so let's check out some some
jazzy tune from Dave strike Emily with
the rest there is some directivity so
it's not completely on the directional
volume seems to be the same thing of
course
maybe we could put the $10 Scipio play
beside it as I think they both should be
quite comparable although there the your
play is a bit cheaper
I will try matching volumes for both
it's not easy to get the exact volume
the heart rate I mean the a1 is a mono
speaker so not really much of a sound
stage but I cannot feel any kind of well
stereo from the cave either that's nice
but but the Yoplait a1 doesn't sound bad
either
maybe the check still imaging with the
classic from Pink Floyd yeah nothing
it's just no no sound just like on the
a1 so no left right obviously it's the
same it's the same problem in head with
the calf neuron which had two drivers
but only one really played the whole
frequency spectrum the other one was a
rather kind of filler so yeah it's not
stereo what you are getting here just
like with the vo play one I'm not sure
if the calf gravity one supports they
are pairing with another one
otherwise yeah you'll just get mono
sound here you can buy a second one and
have more yes stereo but obviously it's
not possible with the calf let's try
another friend
some smooches maybe I will increase
volume slightly to get some nice room
filling sound
it's a bit of pity that it's not stereo
and
they won
the kept sounds make it a bit more
neutral this has a little bit of a maze
of characteristics but the treble has a
bit more sparkle on that panel dollars
in funk pretty punchy the bangle balls I
can hear quite a bit deeper bass the I
would say that a 1 definitely has the
edge shape somehow more exciting with
some kind of rock
they doesn't have that great space
response I was expecting the a wonderful
Hassan Scola here despite being here
quite a bit smaller
with him here some slight artifact
similar to the a six-week earth but this
is typical for Venable see they have
this problem where the songs of it
is something from cap yet and more
modern recording this has a bit more
body you can hear much more days coming
from the back goes real estrella a dance
track a1 Stratos maybe slightly and I
will increase volume to maximum for both
a one
as well it's really maximum it doesn't
go any louder
so yeah enough for a first impression um
I mean ya know with the Bengal dogs in
the play one the chef may be the one
sounds may be a bit not sure how to call
it but definitely not as exciting is the
a one which would probably appeal much
more than messes
while this mmm it's very natural the
sound but simply misses all the the
oomph and and the sparkle I'm not sure
of course I will do some elements I
think it sounds better despite being
designed to be omnidirectional it sounds
still clearer and better when aimed
directly at the listener you know
basically this is somewhere inside here
not sure about the pricing I mean $380
I saw the some-some dealer in Germany
had already solved the a1 for 170 euros
so you can get two for the price of one
cave gravity one design is really cool
also the color this this this brownish
tone so it's not just playing silver but
really looks it extremely exclusive but
I'm not quite sure about the sound yet I
will have to test it more in detail also
it's cold so maybe it will it will meet
some breaking design is matter of taste
I like it as it's quite unusual it looks
as if it was a floating maybe therefore
the name gravity one so thanks everyone
to everyone for watching
I hope you found this interesting and
will of course do a much more detailed
review of the gravity one
yeah it's 8 800 grams this is I think
600 so it's quite a bit lighter so more
portable I think yeah we will see where
the keV
gravity one fits in compared to some
other contenders again thanks a lot for
watching I hope you liked it and see you
in the next video
have a nice time and bye bye ok so just
a shot extra for all those who really
watch to the very end I thought I'll
grab the creative IRA as well that I cut
some days ago to give you a better idea
about the sound of the CAF gravity 1 I
am not sure why keV really had to go for
a mono solution I think they are a bit
afraid of high frequency interference
issues that you get when two drivers are
as close together as here but you get
this with us because so you only have
one Twitter here but you get mono sound
so I'm not sure what's better
interference or stereo the error is set
to its super white mode and it should
give you an idea about the sound that
you get with interference but also with
stereo I will start with the keV gravity
one again
the IROC the Romney is some competition
effect when I move my head but still you
get this sound state that is somehow
missing him here I also thought the
creative was a bit muffled when I heard
it the first time but the cave doesn't
seem to be that much better
both are pretty directional so you
really get a nice sized edge here
maybe let's try Pink Floyd again yeah I
mean this is really an impressive effect
cap again yeah
we could all force turn it to neutral
and see how they compare them yeah the F
is quite a bit clearer but but if you
well if you can see that this is nearly
half the price of their calf sounds also
a bit more powerful I mean with the raw
mode you get even more bass boost which
of course is important for all of the
listings so let's turn them a bit lower
try to match them a bit better yeah this
is a problem they still didn't implement
any kind of loudness compensation which
is of course pity
princess freesia you're still a bit
louder yet the travel is definitely nice
I hear but it still doesn't have this
extreme sparkle the Iowa goal
appears to be to muffled for my taste it
should really be placed like that but
then you get interference issues due to
reflections with the yeah of course
we will do some burning and check it out
later again but I thought it will really
change a lot the sound I mean you won't
get much more sparkling maybe slightly
better bass but yeah we will see this
more in detail in a more profound trivia
so stay tuned and have a nice time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
