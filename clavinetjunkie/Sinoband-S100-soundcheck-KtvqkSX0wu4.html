speaker that some might
arrested in this is the sign of bent
s100 as you can see it's really high
quality it comes with an own pouch
finish is brushed in a minim and it
really feels great I mean you you have
the impression of having some high
quality product here I put it against a
MacBook Air it looks just as good what I
like most is the design I mean this is
it's it looks very modern very trendy
you have the passive radiators at the
front at the back technically it has
hands-free included recharging is done
through USB and it also has micro SD
playback I thought we should turn it on
and have a listen and let's try the SD
card this is the
keeping the button pressed reduces
volume or increases volume you can pause
or resume playback and switching to
bluetooth is done for a short dress of
that power button now it jumps into
bluetooth mode so sound wise you may be
already heard that don't expect any
miracles it's not the best sounding
speaker but it's pretty decent I mean I
have another micro speaker here the TDK
micro track which well maybe from
slightly smaller so we can compare this
tool this is the GDK playing not a sign
of band
they are on escena levels although
you're here that there TDK is more
refined
it simply sounds better
there is some harshness in the lower
treble aleni
but the TDK is close to maximum while
they started to play much louder the
different
of course we could put up another
speaker against it this is the MIR Tech
wireless speaker it's cheaper it costs
about twenty thirty dollars can get
which version you get so let's have a
listen to the music compared to the sign
up band as hundred you already hear some
slight distortion also fuller sounding
nice a treble
of course the music is not really a
great sounding speaker either but we
have the JBL degree here let's have a
listen how this sounds it's connected I
mean the flip three is sure it's more
expensive but you get really high
quality
so yeah I mean it's not bad but it's
really not a speaker I would buy for
sound quality but rather for looks
I think it's a pretty nice speaker I'm
not sure about the price because it
varies but I saw it for I think $69 and
you get a really high quality trendy
looking speaker I hope this was helpful
for anyone who wanted to know how the
sign of band sounds I have also I think
it's called
thumb well or something if you are
interested in the speaker well please
let me know and I will try doing some
kind of comparison thanks for watching
and bye-bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
