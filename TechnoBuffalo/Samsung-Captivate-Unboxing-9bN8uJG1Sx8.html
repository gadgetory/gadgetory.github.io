TechnoBuffalo here that unboxing that I
am really excited about this is the
Samsung Captivate AT&amp;amp;T first high-end
Android smartphone so without further
ado let's go ahead and get to the
unboxing so you'll be able to pick up
your samsung captivate on July 18 for
$1.99 on a two-year contract from AT&amp;amp;T
this is the carriers variants of the
galaxy s2 make sure I've heard that name
thrown about over the past few weeks so
further ado let's go ahead and get into
this and of course we'll use the big I
hope I don't cut my finger off knife and
as usual within about these I'll sort of
go through the specs as we get to it
there's a lot to talk about know lots of
like about these Samsung Captivate so go
ahead and the karfedix pack and giga
Dennis is full retail packaging here is
the samsung captivates a galaxy s phone
like we just talked about we've got a
picture of the device on the front we've
got a what's included in the box which
will certainly go through it's got the
phone the battery wall charger all that
good stuff few more specs here and this
is sort of where things get very
interesting the Kapiti is packed to the
gills with all kinds of smart phone and
super phone goodness so let's go ahead
and talk about some of the things that
really stand out over the rest on the
first is that Super AMOLED screen that
you're going to be looking at when
you're using your phone you may have
heard that term thrown around quite a
bit
what Super AMOLED means is that the
technology that's used for the
touchscreen generally sits on top of the
phone itself here is Super AMOLED that's
actually integrated into the screen so
that's going to mean for you is 20%
brighter screen 80% less Sun right
reflection and 20% reduced power
consumption which is awesome so we're
looking at a 4-inch screen with the
resolution of 480 by 800 as you can see
right there phone doesn't weigh very
much clocking in about 4.5 ounces 16
gigs storage card is going to be include
a talk time we're going to get about 5
hours and 50 minutes standby time about
300 hours sort of rounding out the rest
of the specs sure we'll go through this
the Android 2.1 platform is sort of an
Samsung's own TouchWiz on top of it the
Super AMOLED screen of course and a one
gigahertz processor this is not sort of
your standard one gigahertz processor
that we've seen in Snapdragon devices
this is actually Samsung's core eight
Humminbird processor which is very very
similar if not identical to the a4
processor that we've seen in the iPhone
4 and the iPad so very similar very
similar architecture you're going to get
really nice feed from this one gigahertz
chick so sort of keep moving down here
you've got the swipe text input sort of
a new way to type of course you're going
to have an on-screen keyboard as well
we're gonna get Wi-Fi is this the GPS 5
megapixel camera this can record 720p
video full DLNA support you can sort of
control other devices with this control
your media
3.5 milimeter headset jack the rest is
up you'd expect but enough about me
talking about the device let's actually
take a look at it we'll go ahead and
open it up we'll cut the plastic here
and once again you go to pick this up on
July 18th for 199 bucks go ahead and
slide the box up push that off the
static she gets very uh hard cardboard
the Box looks the same as you older 18t
boxes but actually it's sort of a newer
take on it gonna protect the phone a bit
better so that harder cardboard all
right so welcome to ett thank you for
purchasing your Samsung Captivate
everything is sort of put in very nicely
into this envelope a QuickStart guide
and that is about it
texting and driving it can wait most
definitely can so we've been pull out
the phone and push this off to the side
actually nice to see AT&amp;amp;T getting
serious about Android this phone is
really packed to the packed to the brim
with all kinds of features that I'm
really looking forward to taking a look
at but pull that up nothing inside I
don't think nope just filler the rest of
this stuff is going to be inside this
sleeve which is going to get you a
manual which is nicely seen many manuals
anymore
and it's like the official name for the
Samsung Captivate is going to be the SGH
I 87 this is actually not Emmanuel's
your health safety and warranty guide so
there's that we're going to get a pair
of actually pretty nice looking
headphones with microphone look very
similar to Apple headphone with the
inline mic and got for the adjustable
ear size a very nice for Samsung to
include that we've got your wall charger
with the course USB battery which looks
to be pretty beefy is of size 1500
milliamp hours and of course we have the
cord to connect to your computer of the
wall which is going to use micro USB
samsung has a dhaba abandoned their
proprietary standard what was their
proprietary standard is no longer
standard of course so here's the phone
itself and all of its Super AMOLED 4
inch touch screen glory let's go ahead
and take a look at it we'll go ahead and
peel back they texting and driving and
definitely that's a good message do not
text and drive
go ahead and whip that off here and
we've got sort of a very nice thin
looking slate device so on the left hand
side volume rocker up and down nothing
else on the right it's like you're going
to have your lock and power button
nothing else on the top there's the
micro USB charging port 3.5 millimeter
headset jack on the bottom you've got a
microphone the back is just going to
feature a speaker grille and your 5
megapixel camera does not have an LED
flash sort of has this pattern design on
the back it's just plastic it's nothing
metal and it's like no this is indeed a
Galaxy S phone you're going to probably
hear that galaxy s name thrown about
over the next few months so we've got
sort of a interesting array of Android
buttons here this is using TouchWiz so
it's their own Samsung's own sort of
take on Android the buttons that we have
right here it's go ahead and take a look
and I'll go ahead and power this on to
in just a minute we're looking and it
appears to be a menu button a home
button the back button in the search
button those are the same buttons that
we see they look a little bit different
and they are not actually physical
buttons they are capacitive buttons in
grid into the device itself we also have
a proximity sensor as well on the
so I'm gonna go ahead and pop in the
batter and see if we can power this on
and take a quick look at what this looks
like and of course stay tuned to
TechnoBuffalo in the youtube channel
we'll be doing a ton of coverage coming
up on the Samsung Captivate so the back
of the phone kind of comes off an
interesting way you actually push down
that plastic piece in and then you can
pull off the whole back and then we're
going to get access to the microSD card
and of course the SIM card slot I'm
going to go ahead and pop in a battery
take a quick look what this looks like
and again I'll be doing a full
walkthrough of TouchWiz and the rest of
the features of the Samsung Captivate
push that back in slide that back all
right let's go ahead and power this
thing on and see what it looks like
alright so we've now got the phone
powered up and ready to go so you can
see I heard a quick look at what the new
TouchWiz interface is going to look like
especially on an Android device and on
first blush I got to tell you the Super
AMOLED screen looks and gorgeous of
colors of bright vibrant I've got a
light on it right now I'm really not
seeing any reflection which is very
impressive and good first impressions
let's take a look at how this thing is
going to stack up size-wise like the
some of its competition so here you got
its AT&amp;amp;T stablemate the iPhone 4 steven
messiah standpoint they look very close
three point seven inch screen here and
certainly a four inch screen on the
captivate tutor stacked on top of each
other could see that they are both of
very thin devices to go ahead and bring
in some other Android let's say distant
cousins here is the captivate next to
the Nexus with one can see sort of the
screen size is there stack of these on
top of each other as well and if we
bring in some of the big guys and the
larger screen size phones here we've got
the Evo 4G stack next to each other you
can see that there is definitely a
difference and I do like the way the
captivate looks you almost can't see
where the screen stuff
the buttons and it sort of looks to be
when the screen is turned off at least
of very fluid which I definitely like
look at here you can sort of see where
the lines are and the same thing here
with the Nexus One and the same with the
iPhone in addition and if we bring in
sort of the last size comparison we've
got here is the Droid X you can see that
there's definitely a difference here and
certainly if we stack them the Droid X
is much much larger especially in the
hump area then the captivate so push
those off to the sides again another
quick look at what the TouchWiz
interface is going to look like with the
operating system it's found on the cap
your bags going to look like again it's
Android 2.1 with the skin on top of it
I'm sure to stay tuned to TechnoBuffalo

the captivated show you how the camera
works the operating system functions and
how the whole package comes together so
