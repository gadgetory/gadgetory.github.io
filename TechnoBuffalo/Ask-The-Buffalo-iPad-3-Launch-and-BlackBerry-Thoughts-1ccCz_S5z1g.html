brought to you by Squarespace on this
episode of technobuffalo brought to you
by our friends at Squarespace we are
going to cover everything mobile we're
going to find out what these two phones
have in common and don't have in common
we're going to find out why this guy is
the best phone and 18 tease lineup and
what's up with the ipad 3 or ipad 2 HD
ipad 2 plus or whatever Apple might call
it when you can expect it and if you can
expect it this is asked to Buffalo let's
get started welcome back to another
edition of ask the buffalo i'm jon
rettinger and you can ask me any
question from the wide world of
technology that you might have whether
it's cell phones laptops computers
desktops or something else that might
use batteries it is fair game go ahead
and ask me anything you can ask the
questions in two ways first you can send
a message to me on twitter either at my
personal account at john for lakers or
at TechnoBuffalo ask your question use
the hashtag ask the be otherwise once a
week on technobuffalo calm we put up an
article asking people to submit their
questions and you can ask your questions
there so without further ado let's go
ahead and get started with this episode
I've asked the Buffalo this is a very
mobile centric episode we're focused on
tablets and laptops our first question
comes to us from the website 00 dude man
guy 00 asks John what is the best
android smartphone for AT&amp;amp;T that's a
great question actually about a week and
a half ago I put up an article talking
about the five best phones at AT&amp;amp;T is
line up and number one actually happens
to be an android phone the best phone at
least in my opinion whether it's Android
or iPhone or any other operating system
out there is definitely the samsung
infuse this 4.5 inch beauty is a
glorious phone to behold I'm holding it
above my head and glory the screen is
absolutely awesome it's using AT&amp;amp;T hspa+
for
gee network so it's very fast it only
has one core unfortunately so if knows
you like to spec your phones and make
sure they're maxed out you know you're
not going to be getting that dual core
speed to say the motorola atrix but what
you're losing in that one core you are
gaining up in a really really slim
package a gorgeous screen and a phone
that just works very well so the best
phone in my opinion 18 T's lineup is an
android phone samsung infuse you can't
go wrong hopefully that helps answer
your question so the next question comes
from vivid tweets who asks John are you
still using the blackberry I took your
advice I feel so happy with a
non-smartphone i'm using a nokia e63 i'm
sure blackberry and nokia aren't so
happy with this to give you guys a bit
of back story about a month ago I had
had it up to here with my smartphone
addiction everywhere I went I was on the
phone I was checking youtube comments i
checking comments on revision3 i was
watching videos managing stats replying
to comments anything else you can do
with the phone really 24 hours a day and
I felt like I needed to unplug so I
picked up a unlocked blackberry bold
9780 so I'm getting on here is just
email and the black braids limitations
which I know a lot of people have talked
about there's actually one of its
biggest selling points to me the browser
awful on OS six at least not so
incredibly solid so I'm not spending my
time browsing the web twitter client
barely useful it's got an awesome
keyboard and i can pick out a ton of
emails on here so everything that I used
to do on my phone that used to spend all
my time addicted to checking and playing
games I can't do any more at the
blackberry and it's freed up my life so
rims probably not so happy to hear that
it's like I'm sure nokia is not so happy
to hear that here using their e63 but it
doesn't work so if you ever feel like
you're too plugged in and you just need
a few days or weeks to unplug and i
really recommend trying to pick up even
a flip phone or something that's just
gonna make phone calls for you hope that
answered your question so keeping up
with the smartphone questions this one
comes from dan de Orio who asked John
what smartphone did you use before you
switch to blackberry I was an iphone
user and I was using a unlocked iphone 4
l i was using on AT&amp;amp;T s network I've got
a blue one here which I converted to
look
Lou it's kind of fun but this is what I
was addicted to I had it with me all the
time and that was the phone that was
always in my pocket when I wasn't
testing something new and something hot
our next question is from bosox tweets
John who's more awesome you or Noah if
you've seen our videos on revision3 you
know the answers very clear the answer
is choice C junk watches most awesome
our next question comes from perhaps the
best name I've ever read technobuffalo
fan asks John what do you think about
blackberry OS 7 that's a great question
i'm so i've been using a blackberry as i
mentioned i'm very interested in what
room is going to do with OS 7 in
particular the hardware that it's going
to come on so it's going to come on the
blackberry bold touch the 9900 or the
CDMA variants of the 9900 we're going to
say it on a torch to which we broke we
had exclusive hands on with the phone
and it's going to come on another torch
device which doesn't have a physical
keyboard sort of think storm but
actually that works I like the liquid
graphics I like how it's very smooth
scrolling I like that we're going sort
of more touch screen so you can get that
modern gestures and pinch to zoom I'm
excited for it whether or not it's going
to be an OS parody with iOS android and
webos that's has yet to be seen but I am
very much looking forward to it so

whether you are an advanced coder or

Squarespace really is going to have
something for you our last question
comes from Brian Darden who asked the
question everybody's mind John do you
think they'll be an ipad 3 by next year
so if you're saying next year full 12
months yeah of course will be an ipad 3
the big rumor is whether or not we're
going to see an ipad 3 or an ipad HD
come out by the holiday season
supposedly it's going to be a
complementary line to the existing ipad
with double the resolution aimed at
professionals that will launch with the
suite of video editing and photo editing
applications I think we're going to see
it probably not it doesn't make sense to
have that nap was portfolios people are
saying well apples got a macbook and a
macbook pro same people have an iPad and
an ipad pro it just doesn't make sense
and Apple would piss off a ton of people
if they were to create an iPad pro or
whatever ipad HD to go alongside the
ipad 2 that i know a lot of you went out
and bought so a few months from now if
i'm wrong i will replay this video and i
will do something extremely embarrassing
but i don't think we are going to see it
