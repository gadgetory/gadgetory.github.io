people have viewed the site in just a
couple months that's amazing really
exceeded any expectations I ever had I
actually started this just to help
people out enter some questions I know
when I was looking to buy a computer I
couldn't find much well information so
thank you guys I'm really happy that
it's become an open forum people to
discuss questions they have or problems
are having and people are starting to
answer whether it's me or echo fish or
you know LZ landing I meets whether it's
anybody is a really big male dancer
question so thank you to all you guys
who have helped to to make this as a
success this is much credit to you as
anything and i'm looking forward to two
more videos and answering some more
questions and hopefully helping other
people make web decision is right for
them so to commemorate this week I am
pledging at least three new videos for

coming days anyway guys just wanted to
