big volume is kind of subjective but
whatever like that it plays music chill
pill mobile speakers everything you need
for your ipod or mp3 player we got some
info on the back iPod iPod Touch PSP
work with anything I believe with a 3.5
millimeter headset jack and here's a
little bit more information bill dig
magnetic lock to secure each speaker
together and travel easily retractable
us ki b cable and twist to expand each
speaker for bigger bass and overall
sound oh cool all right let's go ahead
do they look like I've actually never
seen these but I've heard a lot of
people talk about them I know they've
gotten some very good reviews so I'm
curious to see if they lives up to the
hype just simple tray slides on out what
are we get in here it's like we get a
chill pill carrying pouch you can call
it your pill bag slim tell the folks
dear poor you're carrying one there is
that click to some instructions never
read instructions for better or worse
here are the chill pill or is the chill
pill looks like there is a USB to
mini-usb that's a cool number 51 that's
just the adapter so here are the chill
pill or is the chill pill again and two
speakers like they are magnetic like
they said and look at that it's pulls
right out and you can plug it right in
and it goes right back in
and get sealed measure line in that's
pretty cool wonder what we got same
thing on this side looks like they
probably how you connect them there's
your mini USB port and there must be a
mini USB port right there plug them
right in and you are good to go and rock
your chill pill this is use this
rechargeable mini USB so that's handy
take that end plug it in and you are
good to go I'm actually nice i got a
nice feel to them they're kind of small
they look a little funny stand next to
each other like that um but i'm going to
use them for a little while and i'll let
you know what i think it also looks like
they pop open for some little extra
sound if you want that it's extra base
if they'd say that's kind of neat things
have all kinds little secrets in them so
