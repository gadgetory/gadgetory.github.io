show you before i do that is one of the
new cooler things that the software
update one point one point one did let's
do with the bluetooth headset if you
look right at the top of the phone right
there you can see a icon now for the
headset so if i go into menu for example
we can see it a lot clearer a little
blurry but right up there it tells me
how much you matter your life is left in
the headset which is nice didn't do that
before okay so now let me walk you
through a purchase on the itunes Wi-Fi
store so i will just go to purchase or
go to itunes Wi-Fi i'm connected to my
Wi-Fi network at home it's on downloaded
but i can click on featured and it pulls
up a whole menu here of new releases top
what's hot and genres I don't know what
song I want to download here at the
bottom I have across here featured top
10 search &amp;amp; downloads and right now you
can only download music and killing do
it over Wi-Fi so that means no TV shows
no movies and you can't do it on
singulars edge network not that you'd
want to so let's see if there's a song
that I want here
