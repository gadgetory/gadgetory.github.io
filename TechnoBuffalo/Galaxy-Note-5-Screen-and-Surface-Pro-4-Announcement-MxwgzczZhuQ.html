to you by domain.com it what's going on
guys the mark and sang in from
TechnoBuffalo and in today's episode of
rumor roundup we'll be talking about the
future of android where the galaxy note5
Sony's Xperia z4 and microsoft surface
pro 4 this is rumor roundup so let's go
ahead and get started Xperia z4 is
expected to look pretty similar to last
year's e3 at least according to the
latest renders we saw but a newly leaked
case for the Xperia z4 shows a different
looking design the case which was
obtained by a Polish site reveals a few
possible differences between the z4 and
as e3 xperia z4 is also expected to pack
a 1080p display a snapdragon 810
processor 3 gigabytes of ram 32
gigabytes of storage a 20 megapixel
camera in the back and a four point
eight megapixel front facing camera now
we're still big fans that xperia z3 but
we're hoping for more than upgraded
hardware and a slight redesign for the
z4 samsung's galaxy s6 is packing an
almost successive 1440 x 2560 pixel
display but the next note device from
Samsung could take things even further a
new report from phonearena claims that
the galaxy note5 will feature an ultra
HD display with a resolution of 21 60 x
3840 yeah that's 4k in layman's term or
in a film world that's almost 4k but
stretched to a 16 by 9 aspect ratio now
specifically the galaxy note5 may pack a
five point eight nine inch qhd display
giving it an insanely high 748 pixels
per inch or as John would say 748 PP
meanwhile the rumour galaxy note5 edge
will allegedly feature a slightly
smaller 5.7 8 inch display which could
pack in 762 pixels per inch we're still
not totally convinced any of this will
actually happen though and what
practical advantage does UHD have over
today's qhd displays more pixels may
sound nice but that'll also drain your
battery quicker and it'll be one
expensive smartphone if and when it does
come out so let me know what you guys
think is 4k display on a phone truly
overkill what matters to you more
display or battery life let us know in
the comments down below Microsoft will
reportedly unveil the surface pro for
this month at its annual bill Developers
Conference though the device may not
launch until a few months later the
report comes from digit times and it's
ply chain sources who have a pretty
mixed track record when it comes to this
kind of thing still we wouldn't be
surprised to see a surface pro 4
unveiled in the near future I've been
looking at the surface pro 3 for quite
some time now and I guess I'll have to
wait for the surface pro 4 to be
unveiled until I make a decision it's
been just under 11 months since the
surface pro 3 was announced and build
could be a good opportunity to show off
windows 10 running on some cutting-edge
hardware sure there's a surface 3 that
was just announced last month but it's
running an intel atom chip so it can't
really quite compete to its bigger and
faster pro brother we're not really sure
what to expect from the surface pro but
an upgraded display and a new processor
seems likely and we may even see a
better surface pense to go along with it
if you find out more information about
the surface pro 4 will be sure to keep
you guys posted let me stop the video

word in caps at domain.com check out
google is apparently close to launching
iOS Android wear support and I think
it'd be a pretty solid move the verge
claims that Google plans to launch a
companion app that will be available for
iPhone users and will allow you to sync
up in Android wear device with your
iPhone we've already seen hackers create
their own work around but this would be
more official since it's coming directly
from google voice support will
apparently be fully baked in and you
should still be able to reply to
messages that right through google's iOS
applications like hangouts now one major
roadblock that Google might face however
is Apple certification process Apple can
most certainly block google from
launching the app inside the apps or
putting pressure on people to buy the
Apple watch instead Apple hasn't really
reacted that way towards pebbles so
maybe we will finally see Android wear
for iOS I'm a big fan of the Moto 360
circular design and I'll probably buy
one immediately if it ever gets
supported for iOS anyways that's it for
this episode of rumor roundup anything
that I talked about in this video will
be in a link down below give this video
a thumbs up if you liked it and we will
see you guys in the next one
