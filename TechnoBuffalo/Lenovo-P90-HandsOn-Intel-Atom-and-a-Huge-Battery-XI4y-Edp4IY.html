technobuffalo checking out the brand new
lenovo p and 90 it's their second
smartphone running on an intel atom
processor in this case it's a Z 3560 so
64-bit quad-core up to 1.8 three
gigahertz here pretty sweet-looking
phone I like this red color on the back
you're looking at 13 megapixel camera
and with the LED there it's dual led to
a close and then up front you have a 5
megapixel camera for self you can see
that up top a 3.5 millimeter headphone
jack the left-hand side you have these
nice brushed aluminum of buttons for the
volume and the power and on the bottom
you have a micro USB port off to the
left there the pretty sweet looking
device it's a 5.5 inch display with a
1920 x 1080 p display you'll notice it's
pretty thin it's also got a huge 4000
milliamp hour battery which lenovo says
last a really long time thanks to that
intel atom processor sports LTE networks
a single sim card on this one right
there on the right-hand side and then
you're looking at android 4.4 kitkat on
here which runs really smooth although
they say now with ollie pops you it
really takes care of that a 64-bit
processor when you're the opponent's
upgraded eventually so anyway just a
quick look here at the Lenovo p90 this
