crazy high score PETA against people at
$10,000 or more of equipment and also
crazy low because to credit YouTube
account is free but somewhere in there
there's a happy medium to be able to
make good videos but not having to break
your bank I'm taking my family next
month to Sun Valley Idaho for some some
rafting and outdoor adventure and I
thought it'd be kind of cool to share
the setup that I use when I'm traveling
to create just family videos I know the
old version of the dad with the thick
camera on the shoulder is done and gone
you can do everything you want to create
a pretty beautiful looking video for
your family or for YouTube with just a
few simple products and a few easy apps
which we're gonna show you so for any
camera setup whether it's mobile or in
the studio a gimbal is a must-have but
they can get big and gain li and also
they can get crazy expensive enter the
zion smooth for it is neither of those
things it is light and not very
expensive about a hundred and forty
dollars obviously almost every
smartphone now has some sort of
stabilization but if you're running
after kids or you're going down the
rapids or doing something involves a lot
of motion
you're gonna want something that's gonna
create that smooth effect and that's
what a gimbal does I love this one for a
few reasons first obviously you can film
like almost every gimbal can and you can
also turn it if you want to film for
Instagram stories that's a big part of
family trips like I'm doing you know
sharing stories with the friends and
family it makes it really simple and
easy to do there's a built-in control
panel lets you manipulate almost all of
your phone setting the apps gonna work
with either iOS or Android so you don't
have to worry whichever phone you're
using a refute switch often but probably
my favorite feature is the ability to do
the vertigo effect you might have seen
this vertigo effect in a lot of movies
it makes things really cinematic
essentially what it is is zooming out
while walking forward or doing the
opposite zooming in while walking
backwards and it's been really hard
almost impossible to do on most
smartphones but the app gives you full
control the ability to create awesome
looking vertigo shots which you're
almost next to impossible to do but
that's one of the things that I really
love about this
on smooth for a couple of things they're
nice with it first if I'm traveling down
to Bala generally I don't have a lot of
battery packs with me so I can just turn
it and that's gonna put it in to standby
mode couple other cool things as well
there's a trigger on the back of it so
if you hold down the top of it you get
something called phone go mode
essentially you're not gonna get those
real smooth pans it's gonna move with
you ever you go it's going to go and if
you hold down the bottom one it gets
sort of a more smooth look if you're
moving it around a lot of things should
we enjoy about it but I like the
flexibility that you get with the smooth
floor there's a ton of options and
buttons and control dials to get even
more granular all the other stuff that
you'd want here like focus pull and zoom
capabilities aren't all built-in if it
was down to if you want a gimbal that's
gonna be perfect for you for out in the
field with a family trip or in the
studio design on smooth for it's a way
to go we've got to kind of the awesome
point in technology where almost every
modern smartphones camera is good or
some version of good enough
in fact the shot you're seeing right now
we're filming it with the iPhone 10 the
lensing is awesome what it's not though
is versatile you don't get the same
options of switching lens like you get
with a DSLR or both video cameras so
after some third-party options to put
new lenses on cameras this is 99 bucks
it's by ala clip it's definitely not the
only third-party lensing option how that
I just wanted to give you guys an
example of what they can do so this one
is going to give you three different
lenses it's a fisheye at the super wide
and it's a macro it's a 15 times
magnification super easy to put on you
just push a button and it slides right
on and then it's installed and it'll
work with your camera app that you've
got or any third-party camera app you
want gives you a bit more flexibility at
the shots that you want to get it's also
really portable which another reason
that I liked it unlike cameras on
smartphones microphone still pretty much
suck fortune there are a lot of
third-party options
this one here is a hundred and thirty
bucks condenser mic buy sure we're
testing this with an iPhone so this is
the Lightning version and it's pretty
simple it's mostly plug-and-play you
plug it in and it's got left and right
channels you can adjust it it's great
for filming family videos if you're a
mobile journalist if you're recording
music on the go or you just want a
better audio recording and typically
what you get with smart phones it's a
really good choice in fact the intro
that we filmed
was only using this your mic today we've
got all this awesome video and you want
to make it look better maybe some shots
over suppose render expose and you want
to work with it I recommend an app
called disco you guys might have heard
of it it's really popular for photo
editing it gives you a lot of filters
but now those same filters are actually
available on the video side there's a
free version if you want the video
option that's gonna cost you about 20
bucks for the whole year and I think
it's pretty worth it you can do a lot of
really cool effects you can make the
video look better you can adjust
background levels things that are nearly
to have to do and something like a final
cut or Premiere Pro you can really do
from your phone to make those shots pop
and sort of stand out in typical phone
videos this goes just one option though
for sort of cinematic editing there a
lot of other choices there either in the
App Store or Google Play so we can play
with a few to find one that you like but
if you want to just pick one give this
go shot I'd say you've got all these
clips that you've edited that look
awesome that have smooth motion effects
you got that killer vertigo shot
with the smooth for you want to put all
together into a final video this one's
gonna seem kind of obvious specially if
you're using the iPhone but I a movie
for the iPhone is a really simple and
easy tool to stitch all of the do
together you can add effects you can add
title cards and cards serve it's
everything you can do an iMovie just a
lighter version on mobile and it just
works really well a lot of video options
as well for Android we've covered those
in previous videos but really any mole
butter lets you stitch clips together
and add transitions it's gonna be a
really good choice
sort of bring that final video together
see the share on YouTube or just to show
your family and friends so those are
some options to step up your video game
that aren't 30 40 50 thousand bucks and
a separate your video from the
competition or just make it stand out to
your friends and family I do want to
thank Sian for sponsoring this video if
there's a product or an app that you
guys use that we didn't mention even the
comments down below and let us know
we'll check it out with the audience
know if we like it we'll film an updated
version of this video with your
suggestion and be sure to give you guys
credit give the video a thumbs up we
appreciate it
until next time I'm John render from
TechnoBuffalo I'm gonna take my family
to sunny Valley and hope my
four-year-old doesn't fall off the raft
we tried whitewater rafting this guy's
the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
