to you by netflix welcome back to
another episode of renter's ransom your
host Jon regice the show where I rant
and rave on anything from the white with
the technology and sometimes a little
bit outside so up this week we're going
to talk about Android updates for your
phones the processes that carriers have
to go through to get updates on them and
why your shiny new Samsung HTC LG phone
doesn't have the latest version of
Android and you are super sad face this
is right in jerz rants let's go and get
started so one of them were popular
questions I get is when is my ex phone
gonna get the latest version of Android
so let me walk you through the process a
little bit first stop complaining if you
bought your phone unlocked meaning you
bought it from a third party you bought
it not from the carrier themselves you
went to an unlocked retailer site you
bought it from the back of truck however
you got your phone if it's not through a
carrier then you might be in luck you
might just get newer version of Android
the only barrier between Google and your
phone in that case is the manufacturer
that phone let's just say HTC for
example because that was the first thing
that popped into my head Google puts out
a new version of Android they see the
code out to everybody usually developers
get the code the same day that it's
released from Google's its developers
that's manufacturers everybody usually
gets that code on the same day so I get
a week or two they get the code that
tested out the latest skin and they can
push it out to you in theory that's how
it would work and then you get android
4.2 and you'd be super happy and i'll be
okay with the world but that is not the
way the world works there are skins on
these phones first of all which have to
be checked for compatibilities they
gotta run through that phase they got to
check for features to make sure they're
not counteracting each other they got to
go through and do QA which stands for
quality assurance make sure every spec
and every feature works the new version
of Android which takes quite a long time
once they do that then they'll push it
out to your phone but also it's a
question of whether or not it's worth
the money for them they got to go
through and test all these things that
takes a lot of man-hours a lot of
computer hours and has a huge cost so
your two-year-old phone they probably
not gotta see if it works forgot
maybe a four or five month old phone
them yeah they might test it then your
only barrier to gain latest version of
Android is just that or they're not the
manufacturer wants to spend the money
and if they do then boom Andrey on your
phone everybody's happy you're not sad
you're not emailing your friendly local
tech journalist sank John why is your
fault that my HTC whatever didn't get
Jay balls well now you know why but then
you throw in the carriers or most people
get the phone so go to a store assign it
to your contract and they get a phone
and then things get even fishier and
longer you can appreciate why you're not
getting latest version on your phone so
after the manufacturer goes to in tests
all those things spend a bajillion
dollars to test it then has to go to the
carrier just use AT&amp;amp;T cuz that popped
into my head AT&amp;amp;T has got to say okay we
got to test that on our airwaves maybe
there's a line of code that's not going
to play nicely with the LTE to hspa+
transition or they just be a plus
transition to edge they got to test all
those things to make sure you get a
seamless experience as possible on their
network and that takes time and that
takes money and that actually takes a
lot of time the process for
certification can generally take
anywhere from four weeks to six weeks
and sometimes even up to two months when
you throw that into the mix and all
those times is very well to people
saying not worth the money so you're not
get the update to your phone when it
just takes longer and longer and longer
so should you complain to the
manufacturers nope probably not she
complained your carriers no probably not
you want to go to Google though should
be the focus to complain to if Google
want to make this easier for everybody
they could possibly release the code
earlier than their announcements or this
is just something crazy maybe stop
releasing new versions every three
months it might make life easier for
everybody stop it too many versions of
Android let people enjoy their latest
stuff for like a day before a new
dessert comes out that might make people
happy might make me happy all I might be
sagged then you don't get cool features
but people are gonna stop complaining
and if they stop complaining about that
i'm sure they find something else to
start complaining about cuz there's so
much to complain about complaining about
the fiscal cliff complain about wars all
around the world famine people starving
inflation stagflation other
things that end inflation inflation
balloons are blowing up everywhere
there's a lot of stuff to worry about
whether or not your phone's going to get
the latest version of Android so stop it
stop complaining if you want to make
sure your phone good latest version of
Android for the next couple months buy a
nexus phone I'm saying it again by a
Nexus device and stop complaining
honestly the bulk of emails that I get
saying when is my phone getting X
upgrade it's probably in the 10 to 20
per day seven days a week and I want to
share with you it's a friendly ranti way
stop it just do your research if you
want to get one of the great carrier
phones out there when the great
third-party manufacturer phones that put
on their own skins they're awesome but
don't rely on a software update don't
rely on saying okay no I'm good next
version of android because yeah you
might not so be happy it's what you have
when you buy a phone is really the moral
this video you're not happy to what you
get they buy it not to be happy two
years from now get a phone you're gonna
be happy with for two years if you want
to be guaranteed of upgrades go for a
nexus hopefully that helps answer a lot
of questions I'm sure I ain't get a few
folks out there but heck threatened just
