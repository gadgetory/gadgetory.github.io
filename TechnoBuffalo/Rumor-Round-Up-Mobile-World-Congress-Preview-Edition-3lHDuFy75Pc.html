to you by jackthreads Todd may get to go
to Europe to cover Mobile World Congress
but I get to drink coffee at a little
cups right here in California it's Tecna
Buffalo's rumor roundup the Mobile World
Congress preview edition hey what's
going on everybody and welcome to rumor
roundup TechnoBuffalo on revision3 for
the week ending today friday februari 24
2012 I'm no Kravitz editor-at-large for
TechnoBuffalo and this is a special
Mobile World Congress preview edition
it's really just an excuse for me a
drink coffee are these little tiny cups
John likes to make fun of me though for
the little cup so here I'll stick my
pinky out alright never that let's get
on to the rumors first up Microsoft may
be the star of the show not with a
mobile phone not even when the mobile
operating system but actually with
windows 8 we're expecting to see a
preview to be unveiled in Barcelona
along with that we may see the next
version of the windows phone operating
system codenamed tango was in string
about tango is that it's actually a move
down mark in some ways it's really moved
to broaden the market the hardware specs
required to run Windows Phone will drop
a little bit with the tango build and so
that will allow Microsoft and their
partners to go into more markets with
lower-cost hardware and to that end we
may see a new lower end Windows Phone
device from Nokia the Lumia 610 is what
the rumor mills calling it in addition
to that we should see a nokia lumia 900
the high-end device for the European
market it will be similar to the 900
that we're expecting to come out in just
a few weeks here in the States on AT&amp;amp;T
except that the european version will
not have LTE support additionally Nokia
just put out this week a teaser video
that's all about imaging cameras may be
a big theme in mobile Congress this year
as the cell phone looks to replace the
pocket camera once and for all I can
hear Mike Froman shaking his fist in the
background and so odds are this probably
jives with the rumors about what might
be the final flagship device might be
called the 803 if all up to the na
big news expected from Microsoft and
their partners including nokia also
perhaps including LG we've yet to see an
LG Windows Phone device for rumors
kicking around about a device called the
fantasy also sony ericsson may be
entering the windows phone phrase some
rumors call them sites and they're just
sony sony Mobile got to get that into my
head it's not sony ericsson anymore so
any mobile with their new design
language on a couple of Android Xperia
devices we're expecting to see a mobile
Congress we may also see a Windows Phone
device the one that we saw pictured
online actually has a slide-out QWERTY
keyboard HTC Samsung a sous we'll get to

your brain jackthreads go HTC is rumored
to have a couple of phones at least in
store for their presser on the
twenty-sixth including a brand new
flagship a quad-core device powered by
Nvidia's Tegra 3 codename the endeavor
but said perhaps to be called the HTC
One X apparently the rumors say will
pack a 4.7 inch 720p display that will
probably be some variant of super LCD
and also feature that nvidia tegra 3
quad-core processor the Tegra 3
processor currently does not support LTE
so I don't know if they're going to talk
about global availability since it's not
a u.s. show or if there's going to be an
nvidia version and a qualcomm version
because HTC's got a long history with
qualcomm
I don't know also a phone that's going
by the names HTC Ville and also the HTC
One S expect these phones also to ship
with the latest version of HTC Sense
running a top android 4.3 manwich LG
announced a slew of devices already
leading up to Mobile World Congress the
l-series they also have a new 5.3 inches
at a phone is it a tablet but there may
be one more device in store for LG's
press conference this Sunday a quad-core
monster also powered by Tegra 3 this one
has been called the x3 but also may be
called hold your horses for this name
the LG optimus 4x HD if I have that
right speaking of Samsung were we well
we are now Samsung it may be more about
what they don't show they're not going
to be unveiling the next galaxy s phone
at Mobile World Congress the galaxy s3
or whatever it's called what we are
expecting to see from Samsung is at the
galaxy note 10.1 I don't know if that's
what it'll be really be called but we
may be seeing a variant of the galaxy
tab series a 10 inch tablet featuring
the S Pen advanced stylist Huawei a
super high-end device pointing from
Huawei the diamond series a sous will be
showing we're expecting them to show a
production version of the e phone or
iPad phone or whatever it's called the
crazy phone tablet hybrid docking you
know craziness that they should I
believe it computex then of course is
always a chance that apple spoils the
party or at least steals a little bit of
the thunder by sending out press
releases I'm kind of have expecting to
see Apple send out press invites to
their rumored March 7th event for ipad
maybe also for Apple TV but we'll get to
that next week if it happens again
Mobile World Congress this weekend Todd
will be their coverage starts on the
26th sunday with all the press
conferences and the show kicks off on
the twenty-seventh so keep it locked to
