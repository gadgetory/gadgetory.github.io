everyone John rende Jeff and
TechnoBuffalo here live from CES 2013
we're at the Panasonic booth taking a
look at the a100 action cam got Matthew
from Panasonic here is gonna walk us
through what this thing is and what its
purpose is the a100 is an active
lifestyle camera
it's a wearable camera that can shoot
from a first-person perspective with a
strap that goes right around the back of
your head holds the camera right here
how comfortable is that feel it's
actually pretty comfortable I found it a
good resting spot they take awhile to
get it sitting just right no you just
got to adjust it and it's expandable I'm
back here so you can move it for people
who don't necessarily want to wear it on
their head we also offer a slew of
accessories that will allow like a multi
camera very able to put right on the
shoulder pack handlebars things like
that the idea is that by separating the
lens from the brains of the camera we're
able to reduce the weight that you have
to carry with you and it also allows us
to make the body much smaller so that
you're able to carry it on your head
frankly and what kind of resolution are
we looking at
it's a 1080 video so it's
high-definition and recorded to sd or
micro SD or any built-in storage in it
micro sd is what it's going to record to
in addition it has Wi-Fi capabilities so
it allows you to be able to control it
from your tablet or smartphone with
either you know the iOS or Android
operating systems and you can live
transfer and you can also do live
streaming through Ustream as well so if
you want to take out your cell phone and
you could go ahead and hotspot your cell
phone and you could live stream your
content in real time tell your family to
go to a specific website and they can
watch the live content Sadie said you
could live transfer the video footage
oh no not live transfer but live stream
up to a site or once you've shot your
video you can transfer it directly into
the tablet from the micro SD card into
the tablet and then from the tablet if
you want to do edit it truncate the
footage get rid of my babbling and plus
stuff like that you can then shrink it
and then just flick it to YouTube or
flick it to Vimeo or wherever you like
that's very cool we expect this to come
to market sometime in the spring is
warmer plantings you're bringing it out
and no pricing information yet we
announced 30 days prior I'd love to tell
you but I'd have to shoot you so well
thank you very much for the time I
appreciate it thanks to
for powering our CES coverage
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
