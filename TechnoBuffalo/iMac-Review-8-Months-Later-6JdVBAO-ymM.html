about eight months since i unboxed my
imac i thought i'd give an updated
review and i'm playing with the green
screen so it's been eight months i
unblocked the imac and truthfully i
couldn't be happier let's go back and
check out just a clip from the unboxing
24-inch imac i'll show you guys the
ports and that's good enough so the
eight months I've had it everything I'm
quite happy with it overall performance
has been absolutely fantastic I mostly
needed it for a beefier video processing
for HD rendering and video editing
mostly for these videos and that aspect
the imac is really exceeded my
expectations certainly they've upgraded
the processor and upgraded to videos new
graphics chipset since then but the
older model which 1i have has certainly
been more than satisfactory HD rendering
has been so quick much better than ever
was on my macbook pro and certainly
faster than it is on my current imac i
can render a five-minute HD clip in 720
resolution in about eight to nine
minutes which is actually very quick
part of that credit goes to imovie 09 to
do a lot of my editing on I'm VOA it was
about double that but now that I've got
to cut down it really is quite nice
performance like i said is an absolutely
fantastic graphics rendering is great i
have played a few games on it sporn
those things but i'm not a heavy gamer
but when i have game it's been
absolutely fantastic I dual boot this
machine with windows 7 that I've been
testing and playing around with and the
dual boot experience via bootcamp has an
absolutely stellar as well I really have
to give Apple credit for giving their
users the option to have the best of
both worlds this is kind of a tangent
but people always talk about the Apple
tax won by an apple product certainly
there's a premium that you pay when
buying an Apple computer usually
anywhere from three to five hundred
dollars and i think that the software
that comes bundled with it certainly
covers at five hundred dollar range if
that's what you can use it for so I the
whole ilife suite I movie I web I photo
I DVD all that
certainly you get your money's worth but
you also get the ability to run Windows
natively on your computer similarly get
the best of both worlds and be able to
have the best of both worlds my opinion
is worth paying the premium some you may
disagree some of you may agree in my
opinion it's been totally worth it and
for what I needed the imac for it really
has been the best of both world and
going like this because I'm pointing to
the imac you can't see it but you're
right there so really has far exceeded
my expectations now just like the
macbook the boot up times have slowed
down significantly it's not as slow as
it is on the macbook but the boot up
time now it's probably about 30 seconds
it's not terribly slow certainly 30
seconds is much faster than any pc i
ever had but it's not as fast as the
20-odd seconds it was when i first got
it so guys just wanted to give you a
real quick overview again it's a glossy
screen and I've got she been very happy
with a glossy screen I know that really
is the only option that they offer with
the imac but if you're on the fence and
worried about it I say don't worry I
haven't really had any issues with
glitter reflection I like seeing a
brighter coast even though they might
not be natural if you are a professional
editor it may affect you a little bit
but I don't think it's something that
needs to be that big an issue personally
so I got just a real quick overview
won't give you some impressions on the
imac and mostly i want to play around
the green screen behind me which was the
main point of this and I guys hope you
enjoyed let me know what you think about
the green screen you have any ideas for
what I can do or putting the background
or put up here over here you know let me
know anyway I'm gonna get to editing and
put some fun stuff in here and I will
see you guys in the next video for
exclusive updates be sure to follow me
