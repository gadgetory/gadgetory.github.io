TechnoBuffalo I'm checking out Cadillacs
new queue it's basically taking a tablet
putting it in a car and seamless - with
the Linux based operating system now
that is pretty awesome has a pretty fast
processor and it can do a lot of the
things that your tablet or your
smartphone are capable of doing I'm
going to take a little demo so stick
around and check it out we got a we have
a three core arm11 processor in here
that's 100 mils per core having this
thing is extremely capable its Linux
based software okay so kind of a nice
and open best of the open the best of
the best software developers in the open
architecture world taking what they've
done and incorporating it into our our
system here the list is beautiful
because what you have is the ability to
kind of drag yourself down the side of a
list here okay and you can kind of
similarly iPhone context exactly exactly
so what we've done a couple things here
right we've created the ability to flip
in the system just like in an iPad and
it's not tuned yet that's why it's
flaking very far I can grab it I can
drag it up and down I have a great
interface in the middle that shows me
kind of where I am okay I'm on 101.5 and
I wanted to I want to be up around 89 I
can just touch 89 over here and it puts
me right at 9 well let's jump over to
NAB so okay let's get a video just get
one of our favorite artists play and see
what see what I got here for you that we
can play the Queen Freddie Mercury I do
all right that's the foster the people
maybe I'd rather go for Britney Spears
you want to lift you let's do Britton
all right so we'll get we'll get Britney
playing on here okay it's pretty quick
I'm impressed it is name again we're at
a beta level software there's little
bugs our album art didn't come up it
should come up but it will come up in
the system and your six months six
months out of yeah okay so there's so
much so many software releases left I'm
not funny
so as we're talking about the reveal on
the throat so I went to a very clean
screen as I approach the system you
start to see the system come up what I
can interact with yep we talk about an
apps right I want switch over to nav nav
is sitting right up in my app tray sorry
we didn't okay so that's your main
application straight right on exactly
okay very cool so now I'm in my nav and
it's uh again we're beta we're coming up
here we're just taking our good time
doing it so one thing that's cool about
the app tray we'll go back to the home
page just like on your consumer device
today I can press and hold I can go into
an edit mode there my apps right SMS
text is important to me I can take SMS
text I can drag it up into my app tray
and replace something that's up there
kinda looks like a little Android going
on there and a little iOS too absolutely
very very idea of hue was - we heard a
lot from our customers we don't want to
relearn how to use something we want to
we know how to use these consumer
devices get those consumer devices in
the car and let us be familiar with what
you're putting in our vehicles we have a
great lighted storage bin inside here
with the USB port so I can plug in my
ipod I can stick my iPhone in there I
can stick my android in there okay
connect the system via bluetooth
I can connected the 10 Bluetooth devices
on this - can be active at once the
system will support all your major
Bluetooth profiles for phone connections
audio streaming text messaging even the
newest audio streaming where I can
browse my music and get all that
information up there as well so the idea
is get in the car get your phone in the
storage bin or your device in the store
has been put it away don't touch it and
use the great interface that we have on
the screen here to access what's on your
phone in a safe manner
our steering wheel controls are really
focused on the right hand side the
steering wheel for infotainment we have
a five-way control or kind of up
left right and center select and what
that is supposed to be a very intuitive
interface that I can go through here I'm
going up I want to go in settings I want
to change my layout I went down to press
it pick the layout looks cool to me I'm
a performance guy I'll choose my
performance layout the system will come
back build me a performance layout and
give me a different different experience
but still all the same information so
what do I have available to me I have
vehicle information my vehicle
information in a very cool you know
almost video game-like atmosphere with
3d 3d graphics rendering on screen there
now speaking of video games can you play
video games you aren't gonna be able to
play video games in the COPE you're a
passenger
so the idea again the idea with Q is not
to not to bring technology for the sake
of Technology in the car is to have a
very safe driving experience but we're
all connected we don't want to get in
our car and not be connected so the idea
is get in the car keep your connected
life but in a safe and usable fashion
while you're driving I admire that I do
I think because I don't want people
running around playing Super Mario
Brothers like ROM so yes carry your car
that'd be really powerful no travel no
longer be safe if you do no know so and
just to finish out we can do on the
screen here we have all of our phone
connections on the screen if I get an
upcoming phone call can you get a
picture of the person I get text message
I mean it notified that I have one so
it's all migrated into the front exactly
so every I can do here I can do here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
