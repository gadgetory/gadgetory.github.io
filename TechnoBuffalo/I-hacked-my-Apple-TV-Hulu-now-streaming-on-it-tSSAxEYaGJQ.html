lakers calm it's a little bit of a back
story yesterday i was studying and I was
kind of get a little burnt out in a bit
of a break so I remember reading about
being able to hack your Apple TV so I
figured you know what let's give it a
whirl so I did I hacked my apple TV 2
now stream content from hulu that's hul
you calm but leave only works in the US
what it is it's a legitimate site that
lets you stream television content and
movies from the major networks you have
to watch maybe 30 seconds of commercials
that are put in there but really you can
get everything that's out on television
just about a day after it gets aired it
really is very nice but it's currently
was only available on your computer and
not on your television obviously so what
the tech does is let you stream Apple TV
sorry extreme hulu content to your Apple
TV in addition to just myriad of other
options which I'll get into later but i
just want to show you guys an example of
hulu and how it works so enjoy the video
i'll put a link up in the sidebar to
send directions about how you can do
this I'm not condoning it I'm not saying
you should do it I'm just going to say
here's how you do it not responsible for
anything happens to it if you screw it
up but if something does happen you can
always just restore your Apple TV ok I
just wanted to give you a little quick
bit of backstory hope you enjoy the
video it's a little bit shaky cuz i went
handheld with the flip here um but it
should still be good enough to give you
guys just a nice sense of hulu and how
it works on the newly hacked Apple TV
all right guys jon rettinger with john
for lakers komm doch dl soon bye alright
guys so here is the apple TV menu and as
you can now see I've got a new bar top
that says xbox media center / boxy and
then it goes down to movies TV shows and
all the rest of stuff for you to see me
an Apple TV first thing I want to show
you is that the functionality the
initial functionality of apple TV is
still fully intact so we'll go to movies
we can go to top movies
and you can browse through movies just
as you could before with no noticeable
difference whatsoever so the initial
functionality of Apple TV is still there
after you allow it to stream hulu
content so we'll go up to xbox media
center / boxing I'll show you guys what
this looks like so we'll go down to
Boxxy hopefully you can see this pulls
up a little apple logo takes just a
second to get loading there now it's
going to ask for you to sign in with
your username which you actually need an
invitation for right now since boxy
which is thus letting you stream hulu is
currently in alpha testing so I will
sign myself in and here we are I've got
recommendations from people who are
following these similar to twitter some
friends activity what they've been
watching my activity and some of the
things I've most recently watched let me
hit to the left you can see different
options video music profile downloads
and settings so I'm just going to just
want to show you hulu right now get into
more depth in future videos look a right
to video go down to internet it'll be
greeted by a ton of different options
here you got CBS Internet content CNN
Comedy Central there's hulu and again
hulu lets you legitimately stream TV
shows and movies from the major networks
in the US so you're here I've got hulu
movies and TV shows so we'll go over to
TV shows popular clips recently added TV
show clips I'll just pick a clip here is
I don't get any copyright issues but
just to show you that it works so here
is a clip from one of my favorite shows
24 and you have a choice of different
clips these are interviews for people
from 24 so we'll just pick one is to
share that it's working you can hit play
or read more go ahead play and then just
like regular apple TV it'll buffer for a
second and then we'll start playing so
I'll let you guys see what this looks
like in a real
I'm and at the top of the TV you can see
it's an Internet video / hulu / TV so /
TV clips and you guys can just see that
it actually is treating it as a computer
loading video and there goes now it's
quite charismatic will do something out
of character this I'm going to pause it
you can see your options down here you
can read more about it recommend it to
friends you can see where you are in the
section of the clip just a very handy
interface just wanted to give you guys a
very quick overview of Hulu on the Apple
TV and show you what it looks like I
just installed this yesterday so I can't
really do a review on it but I can't say
the day I've had it has been very handy
so I hope you guys enjoyed and look for
a review coming up in the next week or
so this is jon rettinger with john for
lakers calm if you guys want some more
exclusive John for lakers information
