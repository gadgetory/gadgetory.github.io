thunderbolt what's going on everybody
I'm Noah from TechnoBuffalo comm and
I'll tell you what the intro I filmed
the first time I did this video was
better than that but I've since had a
cup of coffee I'm a little wired and I
don't know that just came out but this
is a fake unboxing because I already
filmed the unboxing and then when I went
to edit it my memory card totally failed
so I'm shooting it over again it'll be a
little fakie style I've already set the
phone up but that's okay you don't care
you just want to see the phone
it's the HTC Verizon Thunderbolt the
first 4g LTE smartphone for Verizon
they've got a couple of data modems out
already but this is the first smartphone
this one's been anticipated since it
launched at CES it's been delayed a few
times but it's out now or it will be out
tomorrow actually I'm digging the
blacked out box here very cool it's kind
of embossed they're black on black
Verizon down here at the bottom HTC on
the side you have embossed their HTC
Thunderbolt very cool this one will be
available tomorrow I'm filming this I'm
filming this today I'm filming this on
March 16 that'll be available March 17
to $49.99 on contract to your contract
two hundred fifty bucks makes it quite
expensive as far as cell phones go but
you get a lot here so let's open the box
and see what we've got going on thanks
to the folks at Verizon Wireless for
lending us this one for review we will
send it back when we're done with it not
keeping this it's a loaner and you can
see you know I've already done I took
the phone off I tried to put it back on
it's just a hot mess right now but
that's alright well now we'll try to
recreate the unboxing experience so
we're going to remove this before use
and we're going to hit power and the
phone's going to come on the power
button is a little bit not a lot of
action on the power button so it's kind
of hard for me actually to tell when
I've actually turned you know hit the
button and turned it on or not there we
go so while this is firing up in the Box
in the I liked I like the deal with the
box or the black
on the outside the bright red on the
inside very cool you get your master
your device master the thunderbolt
manual you get your 4G SIM card LTE uses
a SIM card CDMA does not you know more
acronyms and standards and stuff the end
consumer probably isn't really going to
know the difference or care or whatever
you your phone setup you're good to go
but basically it's a CDMA and an e video
but then also with the LTE you've got
your sim card here goes under well also
in the Box you get your AC charger it's
USB based and it works with the USB to
micro USB cable you also get now we'll
get back to the phone and I guess in a
way you get the benefit of me having
played with it for a little while
already it's a solid device 4.3 inch
display WVGA so it's a big screen it
feels really good in the hand but it is
kind of heavy a little bit thick you
know kind of reminiscent of the the Evo
I wish I had an evil here on hand it to
compare it
so I decided at the big screen you've
got the kickstand it's made by HTC you
know very very similar in some ways but
but it's solid its plastic on the back
with the the metal the brush metal
accent kickstand there it's a little bit
of a soft grip plastic feels pretty good
nice curve to it
but again you know it is big device and
it isn't particularly lightweight but
you know I think you notice it's there
but but I don't think it's a
deal-breaker if you're looking for this
phone but basically you've got on the
front 4.3 inch WVGA display of course
it's touch sensitive multi-touch
capacitive touch you got your for
Android buttons on the bottom capacitive
touch buttons you've got up top and LED
indicator light your earpiece and then a
1.3 megapixel front-facing camera for
video chat self-portraits you know
whatever you want to do with it on the
right here you've got a rocker switch
for your volume on the bottom you've got
a microphone on the left side your
microUSB port up top you've got a 3.5
millimeter headphone jack
you've got the battery cover a little
release thing you've got sound of
release it's just you know where you
watch something in there to take it off
you've got a microphone another
microphone up top and then you've got
that
power switch which you know is fairly
recessed and then also I'm just not a
lot of action on it not a lot of give
there so a little bit I don't think it's
big deal once you get used to it just
first couple times I pressed it I wasn't
sure if I'd pressed it on the back
you've got a kickstand with Google
I'm always got a peg leg with Google on
it kind of like the Evo there and then
the 4G branding of course up top eight
megapixel camera with dual LED flash
autofocus and 720p HD video capture oh I
hit a button and got visual voicemail
setup which it did not mean to do anyway
we'll go back to the to the phone here
and so you've got the 4G you've got
Wi-Fi as well the phone will require
obviously a voice and data plan so
Verizon's data plan or voice plans start
at 40 bucks I believe I'm going to get
the terror sheet out here to make sure
nationwide talk plans begin at $39.99
monthly access and an unlimited 4G LTE
data plan is $29.99 monthly access so
250 up front after we're on contract and
then you're starting at 70 bucks a month
for limited voice and unlimited data and
then if you want to go with the mobile
hotspot app here it is mobile hotspot
you can connect up to 8 devices via
Wi-Fi over the network here the 4G
network or 3G depending where you are
and that will be free until May 15th
you know first ones free and then after
that 20 bucks a month for 2 gigs of data
so you get unlimited data on the phone
for that $30 mandatory smart phone plan
and then for an additional $20 a month
you can get up to 2 gigs a mobile
hotspot data so there you go more
services more complicated billing
statements I guess anyway inside the
phone it's a 1 gigahertz Qualcomm
Snapdragon processor it's single core
not dual core bits the newest version
you get 8 gigs of internal storage 32
gig microSD card pre-installed so for
250 you're getting roughly 40 gigs of
available storage little less than after
formatted which is a little bit more
than you get on a 209
$9 iphone 4 if you want to make that
comparison also like we said fourth 4.3
inch display the two cameras
you've got the Wi-Fi built-in and then
it comes with some 4G you've got the
newest version of HTC Sense so you know
the thumbnail view with all your
different screens
the HTC apps friend stream and peep and
that stuff and then in your settings
you've got the stuff we've seen on some
of the newer HTC devices and you saw
some of this stuff at CES and again at
Mobile World Congress the scene and
sound set personalization menus where
you can just kind of set everything all
at once you know a scene will have your
wallpaper and your apps and you know
everything kind of all set up there your
app shortcuts that kind of stuff sound
set will set all of your sounds all at
once or you can go in and customize
things you know one by one if you so
choose there are also some 4G specific
apps on here there's bit bop
there's let's golf too there's rock band
there is where was the other one here
tune wiki so do a little demo of two and
wiki to play some videos with Sinclair X
and we will search for let's search for
the Foos have a new song that just came
out I don't know if the songs up with
the video debuted I don't know if it's
going to be available to hear but we'll
see we get back this is on 4G right now
I am not set up on Wi-Fi 4G I have a
Verizon pantech data modem that I've
been checking out and a 4G has been
really really impressive out here in
Northern California also used it down in
San Diego a few weeks ago very
impressive all right I don't see that
new video but let's go we'll go Everlong
let's see what tune wiki is all about
here you've got your sink lyrics there
on the bottom crank it or we could we
could do the kickstand Jam here if we're
going to
I'll see it's like fake kickstand anyway
it's a while before these lyrics come on
I know this song takes over I'll scan
ahead ask of you you've got a promise
not to stop and I say when she's saying
all right so there you go that's that -
Mikey works more interestingly though
talking about the LTE network not rolled
out everywhere but like I said it's been
very impressive when I've used it with
the data modem around these parts on the
west coast so I already installed the
speed test app so let's go to speed test
and I also happen to see this is the
benefit of me having already done the
video and the memory card failed it was
like a run-through you're getting a much
smoother video experience here which is
unusual for me if you know my videos you
know smooth is not my middle name so
here's my MacBook and I've got the
Verizon 4G modem the pantech modem and
I'm sure that could turn the computer on
and will tilt the camera up a little bit
we'll do a little impromptu speed test
here now I've got the LTE hooked up
Airport is off so there's no Wi-Fi it's
just running the LTE and we're going to
go let's find a server let's find San
Francisco go so this is on the Verizon
4G LTE network with the data modem we're
getting a ping of 50 we're getting
download speeds approaching 9 Meg's this
is a little slower than it was the last
time I used it last time I was getting
12 to 15 pretty consistently it also
kind of depends on which server you're
using to test and there are a lot of
things about speedtest.net that I need
to I need to talk somebody really knows
the deal to find the best way to to
really assess the speed here but anyway
for the purposes just comparing the
modem to the Thunderbolt so on the san
francisco server 50 millisecond paying
eight point eight six down 9.3 nine up
which is um you know which is nice
upload speed so let's go to find the san
francisc
server San Francisco done speed test
begin so ping was 101 down it looks like
we're getting a lot less interesting
down was about five up with eighty you
know I don't know man uh interesting
stuff so the download speeds were about
half the upload speeds were twice as
fast on the Thunderbolt let's and
eighteen up is crazy let's change the
server let's do one more let's go and
you know it's interesting because I
don't know where the towers are I
already know how this stuff is routed
you know etc etc so let's go why not
let's go up
let's go Modesto and do the test here
the Modesto server one more just for fun
eighty two ping now we're getting about
six thousand kilobits or about 6
megabits down little ass notes down to
five
s'okay 48 it peaked at around six and
twenty five up which is insane that's
really in late terms for uploading
that's really really fast fast to the
point where it makes me wonder if
there's an error in the testing Mustang
there is I'm just saying that is really
fast of course that was probably a
mobile you know that probably wasn't
accurate because that was a mobile a
mobile test with a smaller upload packet
but whatever it doesn't matter this is
not meant to be any sort of scientific
test just for fun so here's Modesto and
go again we're looking at what were my
results here 48 4.8 down 25.8 up 82 ping
so ping is 51 and 10.4 down so again
about choices fast on the download speed
and then the upload speed the
Thunderbolt five times
so what does that all mean I have no
idea but I'm going to investigate it
means 4g is faster than 3G and it means
that the thunderbolt is capable of some
stuff for sure but I don't know 25 up
seems kind of fishy anyway there you go
a first look the HTC thunderbolt for
Verizon it's the first LTE 4G phone on
the Verizon Wireless Network again it's
available March 17th which is tomorrow
at the time I'm recording this anyway
March 17 2011 for two $49.99 on a
two-year contract requires a voice plan
and the 4G LTE unlimited data plan and
then it's got the optional mobile
hotspot feature for 20 bucks a month for
up to 2 gigs of mobile hotspot use
although they're giving it away for free
until May 15th if you have this phone
much much more on the Thunderbolt on
Verizon's 4G network on all the other
new phones coming out did I say this is
Android 2.2 I don't think I said that
the beginning I said it in the first
time I filmed this video but yeah it's
Android 2.2 with the latest version of
HTC Sense so you know know that for what
it's worth 1 gigahertz Qualcomm
Snapdragon processor 8 megapixel camera
with HD video 1.3 megapixel camera on
the front and a kickstand till next time
my name is Noah thanks for watching much
much more on all this stuff over at
