technobuffalo here and today Apple took
the wraps off they're completely
refreshed not redesigned macbook pro
line so let me run through everything
with you and tell you what you can
expect stick around so this is going to
get a little bit on the technical side
but I'm going to explain all the new
specs new features and a new price you
may see me a glance downwards I got some
notes in front of me so all three
macbook pros at 13 to 15 17 the various
models within those sizes are now
getting core i5 and core i7 Sandy Bridge
chips which is awesome no more core 2
duo for that lowend 13-inch model no
more core i3 everything is going core i5
and i7 to go anything they're going to
be very very fast gone is the nvidia
chipset unfortunately the higher-end
models are going to have so 15 to 17 s
are going to take advantage of AMD's
radeon HD 6000 m graphics or some
variants of that the 13 inch models are
going to be using Intel's HD 3000
integrated options you hear integrated I
have to think ah no but supposedly they
are much better I'm so we'll have to
sort of see what the hands-on results of
those are they're all going to get
facetime HD cameras which is long
overdue it's going to give you about
triple the resolution of the longest now
last generation FaceTime cameras they've
got this new technology called
Thunderbolt you may have heard
referenced as light Pete could sort of
apples name for it it's going to give
you 10 gigabits per second transfer
speeds and to give you a frame of
reference on the USB to point out ports
down on the same macbook pros are going
to give you four hundred and eighty
megabits per second so much much much
faster the only problem with Thunderbolt
technology now is you're going to need
peripherals that support it so that
should be sort of set a new standard
hopefully on the next coming years for
data transfer speeds that is crazy fast
alright so let's jump into the models
and let's start with the smallest guy
the 13-inch MacBook
Pro is going to come in two
configurations both models as I
mentioned are going to come with now
core i5 or core i7 chips which are
awesome and super fast the lower end is
going to run you 1199 dollars it's going
to get you 2.4 gigahertz core i5 chip
four gigs of ram is now the new standard
and a 320 gigabyte hard drive and as can
be using Intel's HD 3000 chip I was a
big fan of the nvidia chip sets the last
generation had so here's hoping intel i
can keep pace with those stepping up a
little bit 1499 is going to get you a
2.7 gigahertz core i7 model with a 500
gigabyte hard drive the same four gigs
ram and that same intel integrated HD
3000 graphics moving on to the two
inches larger the 15 inch you are going
to get just i7 no I 5s for you you're
going to get two more eyes you've been
also going to get AMD's radeon HD
chipset which is pretty awesome for all
your graphics means it's going to cost
you 1799 it's going to give you a 2
gigahertz quad-core i7 chip HD Radeon
6490 em with one gigabyte of vram
checking out a lot of vram for all your
video editing or game plan whatever you
want to do and 500 gigabytes of hard
drive space these computers now may
actually be pretty decent fora for the
casual gamers I want to hear at the
gamers have to say if you would consider
using one of these the next 15 inch
model is going to cost you just shy of
2,200 2199 you're going to get a 2.2
biggert core i7 computer with the Radeon
6750 graphics 750 gigabyte hard drive
with some solid state super expensive
options for 128 256 or 512 the 17 inch
model the big granddaddy of them all
it's pretty much similar respects to the
high end 15 model you're going to get
the same 2.2 inch core i7 the same HD
Radeon 6750 and seven hundred fifty
gigabytes of hard drive
you can put in them solid States if you
want and it's going to cost you two
thousand four hundred ninety nine
dollars so none of these are very cheap
computers we are getting now a more
powerful line of macbook pros you're
getting the same USB ports you had in
there but this new Thunderbolt port is
pretty neat what do you guys think about
the new FaceTime HD camera long overdue
I think that Apple put it in certainly
gonna make making casual web videos um
my cheese here so I'm excited to see
these get my hands on them and you give
them a thorough review I 10 you guys
have to say or you've been waiting and
you're gonna go jump the ship and go get
a new macbook pro you know what's uh
what's your plans do you care do not
care you still thing back to overprice
using Mac's or good value love to know
