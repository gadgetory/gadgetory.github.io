brought to you by the LG OLED TV not a
new TV new category television as you go
guys mar / center here TechnoBuffalo and
this is Ron parida hello he is the
number one head honcho when it comes to
making our videos look pretty bad direct
and edit a lot of these you're talking
about for that's what I do that's true i
edit my own stuff for the most part but
all the really good like all the
creative all the direction all that
stuff that's on Ron's I worked with John
so I edit all of John's videos behind
the scenes yeah all that good stuff it's
it's awesome and and we since we're both
editors found ourselves in a weird
position lately where our macs are just
not keeping up with what we need the
reason we're here is because we want to
build a pc for the office for for each
of us the bigger bossest baddest status
you can see that we can yeah and we
thought it would be super fun to involve
you guys in the process so this is
basically just a hello hi here's our
project that we're working on uh and
what we want to talk to you guys is
about is there's a site called pc part
picker and we would love for you guys to
go there build the pc of your dreams the
one you think we should build and send
us the permalink leave that in the
comments down below so we can take a
look kind of like dig through in like
make an amalgamation of the
TechnoBuffalo Camille word best words
yes you like words huh I have a great
vocabulary guys might have expensive
expansive vocabulary so we we have a
couple of things already and they are
right here we've got first of all just
to just give you guys a quick heads up
i'm not i'm a kind of a beginner when it
comes to the source of I've got about
mount pc background wise burst has built
his own pc right we built one a long
time long time ago well not but yeah
might the last one that i built is a
long time right I've never built one so
I'm pretty new into this yeah I know my
basic nerd stuff this is all next level
nerd stuff and I'm looking for the Nomad
stuff and that's it yeah that's what
we're gonna yeah trying to do together
and then you guys can teach her onto
exactly so all the noobs hop on my
hottie on set up yes so team run let's
teach team wrong about things that we
shouldn't be throwing in the air so you
guys might have seen a video that we did
an unboxing for Intel's new stuff to
skylake processors this is a skylake
processor it is an i7 it's um
and it's clocked at four point oh giga
hertz but unlocked means we can
overclock it it's as long as we have
cooling system yes see runs already
basically a natural we're also starting
acapella group yes barbershop quartet
acapella group it's going to be okay
anything yes we're gonna have an entire
way to go on tour career so popular
change but we can we can overclock this
that's a big deal as long as we get some
good cooling stuff so let us know what
you think is awesome in terms of liquid
cooling because I would like to do
liquid cooling we've also got this Intel
this is a 750 series internal pci e
solid-state drive it's for 400 gigabytes
which I do know a little something about
that my latest macbook pro that I got
has pcie and that was pretty
life-changing yes because of the way
premier references proxy file it speeds
up your reference times x yeah like your
previews come up willow it quicker
because there's less media pending rain
lets me depending fewer drop frames
right to yeah if you're dropping region
this is works fast or works a little bit
smooth it's a PCIe yes who comes up and
of course a computer wouldn't be
complete without RAM and we've got this
amazing corsair vengeance LP x ram this
is 16 gigs for four chips of ddr4 ram it
comes with fans that to me is ridic I've
never seen ram come with my fans you
don't come with fans I get pretty hot I
don't come a fan yes we ought to and I
still don't have fans this room must be
a new level of hot like a new level of
how kids I don't I have never seen Ranma
fans before in the game yeah and of
course we've got this awesome Z 170
deluxe motherboard which obviously we
can fit that processor into got plenty
of slots for pcie stuff lots of outputs
six USB 3.1 ports it's it's a fantastic
motherboard we're very lucky to be able
to start our build with all this stuff
but of course we still need power supply
cooling monitors a case all kinds of
senior monitor oh yes speaking my
favorite monitors I've ever used was
actually the LG 34 inch ultra wide which
was insane because the way just in
premiere stood
I live in premier by the way yeah I see
it every day of the week little too much
maybe but whatever yeah it stretches of
time line it looks awesome so I mean I'd
so LG it doesn't it so they make awesome
owners I would love to go for this but
actually I do want to take a second
really quick talk about sponsored video
okay because we've got LG as a sponsor
so that works out perfectly it's almost
as if you knew that she was the sponsor
a super serendipitous anyway Wow LG's
TVs also use all the technology like our
phones do and they look phenomenal right
we've had a mini office for a while I
know you've lost a number of games of
fifa on it I don't talk about it cool
fair enough who booked it look a little
picture out there the TV was great city
was i can play not so much i use went
home for a while too and yeah my
goodness it's a great TV and it really
is a new category of televisions not
just like a new kind of TV it's a lot
like when we went from plasmas 22 lcds
most definitely it's a full-on it's it's
not just a new TV it's a new category of
television this is the stuff that we've
got there's plenty more stuff that we
need we definitely want your input in
terms of what we're going to build here
and we want to make this video series
moving forward so that you guys are kind
of with us along the way and we get we
wanted we thought those would be a great
way to engage with us start with us we
love and get together with you guys yeah
which is a big family here so we want to
make this a fun little party of a pc
gaming process yeah so a figure maybe
maybe next time we get together let's
talk about like cases in the aesthetics
of the build you know we can talk about
like the nitty-gritty stuff now leave us
through links to your pc part picker
