John retinue from tech Nova flu here
we're sharing a lot about the RAW
processing horsepower found in the
iPhone 4 but it's actually the same
processor that's found in the iPad so
that it could be fun to put these two
devices head-to-head and see which one
is faster through both unscientific
texts so we'll test app speed and web
browser speed on both Wi-Fi and 3G so
let's jump right in and start with
browser tests on Wi-Fi the iPad is not
running iOS 4 so it doesn't have
multitasking yet it's an older version
of oh yeah so it's now iOS 3 the iPhone
4 does that multitask let me show you
that everything is closed with the one
exception of the web browser which we're
just about to open so we're got YouTube
channel youtube.com slash John 4 Lakers
CUDA Bonnie so we're gonna do a simple
refresh this is a page that have been
visited two before on both devices so
consider it a simulation of a site that
you visit on a regular basis let's go
ahead and check this minion so go ahead
and do a refresh on each you get go
ready to hit there and go ready to hit
here and they're off at exactly the same
time and it looks like the iPads got a
bit of an early edge
well the iPhone looks like a caught up
and the iPhone finished just a little
bit before the iPad not much mean about
half a second in favor of the iPhone
which does by the way have twice the RAM
of the iPad so it does seem to maybe of
having a little bit of effects so next
let's go ahead and check out
TechnoBuffalo and see if we get a speed
increase here as well let's get it
queued up on each and we've got
everything ready to go so we've got
ready to go here and ready to go here
and we are off loading TechnoBuffalo
calm on each so loading you to the
iPhone was a bit faster let's see if
those results are duplicated here iPad
finished a little bit earlier over the
iPhone here actually those would be
sooner so maybe about two seconds
earlier for the iPad so let's see if
that holds true over 3G so I'm gonna go
ahead and turn Wi-Fi off but I'm gonna
do this on camera so you can see that
there's no funny business going on as
anything here open up settings and we're
going to kick Wi-Fi off
so we'll go back to just 3G speeds we're
gonna do the same here on the iPad
go ahead and turn cellular data on and
we're going to turn Wi-Fi off and we're
gonna see if there's any sort of
difference here so I've got five bars of
3G service on the iPhone and the iPad is
gonna tell me wait for the service I
have in just a moment as it connects to
18 C's network and we'll see if there is
a difference over network to network so
right now the results are sort of
inconclusive the iPhone loaded one page
faster the iPad loaded the other faster
all right so we've got both devices not
affect its HD T's 3G network and let's
go ahead and see if there's any
difference we'll load the same web pages
once again so we've got four to five
bars of 3G here on the iPad and five on
the iPhone so pretty close and then go
ahead and close down the settings here
so it's pretty even so we're just
dealing with web browser so we've got
TechnoBuffalo comm queued up again on
each let's go ahead and do a refresh and
we'll see if there's any speed
difference here all right they're both
hit at the same time definitely slower
loading than on Wi-Fi they appear to be
almost exactly the same spot maybe the
iPhones got a slight edge let's take the
guy film is holding that slight edge
feel like I'm announcing a horse race it
looks like the iPhone is going to finish
a bit earlier perhaps iPads they did
come back iPhone has done and the iPad
is still loading so no we're about five
seconds past so about seven seconds
between the two the iPhone being faster
let's try one more web page to see if
there's a difference we will go back to
the YouTube channel and see if that
affects anything at all
there you go YouTube and we'll just load
it up regular YouTube comm here and see
if there's any is there a difference
alright hit at the same time on each and
this website has been loaded on both
devices well here it looks like the
iPhone finished again earlier than the
iPad so in a web test out of the four
tests we ran the iPhone finished faster
and that is pretty representative of
what I've seen the iPhone is just very
fast web browsing in this case a little
bit faster than the iPad so let's see if
that holds true for program application
so let me go ahead and shut down this
and we'll try to open up the same
programs on each and see if there's any
sort of difference let's start the same
Twitter application will start with
Twitter if I can see if that is any sort
of speed indicator good dad that was not
scientific i hitted the wrong time try
that one more time there we go looks
like a little bit of first on the iPhone
again and a little bit later on the iPad
let's go ahead and try opening up the
App Store it seems any difference there
as well so it's connecting and again
faster on the iPhone than it is on the
iPad
actually noticeably so alright next
let's go ahead and try and open up
settings and see there's any difference
here as well it's just sort of simple
application else you control what you
got going on on your phone about the
same there for settings and we will try
one more will try opening up let's say
iTunes which does look different on both
devices
and again this is still now over just 3G
so it may be a little bit faster here so
it looks like it connected first two on
the iPad so overall in majority of the
tests look like the iPhone was a bit
faster than the iPad which is very
interesting I don't know if this is
going to impact any of your purchase
choices I thought it was sort of a fun
informal test to run anyway i'm jon
revenue from TechnoBuffalo i'll see in
the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
