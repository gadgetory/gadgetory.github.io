Developers Conference is coming soon in
fact it's coming on june thirteenth
double w DC is where Apple especially
unveiled the next version of their
operating systems whether it's been
expert of OS 10 or iOS and this year
should be no different but I'm expecting
a lot more to come from Apple than just
on the software side so these are five
things you can expect from apple's WWDC
let's start with the most obvious new
iOS iOS 10 every year I feel like this
is a year Apple is gonna just redesign
things it's gonna be it's gonna be super
awesome every year I'm just left going
like that's nice and I'm trying to learn
from my mistakes I don't think we're
gonna see drastic overhaul of iOS I
guess if it ain't broke don't fix it but
judging by the earnings it's like a
little bit broken things you can expect
more 3d touch integration throughout the
entire bit of software approve
notifications hoped with more
interactivity built-in better home
screen notifications and you could be
really nice for a lot of people and I'm
still hopeful that maybe we'll have
interactive icons not really widgets but
some sort of interactivity built into
the icons on the screen other than that
not really holding my breath for too
much more tomato westin let's stick with
software for number 20 s 10 is getting
an update and perhaps a new name we're
currently on OS 10 11 the next version
you can do math vos 10-12 and that's
just a Justin unsexy name we've seen
references on Apple's own website too
Mac OS I think that's what OS 10 is
going to be cold Mac OS not sure exactly
what it's going to be you can expect
more Syrian aggression it's been a big
glaring hole in Apple's desktop
operating system for a while I've seen
record Microsoft is done with Cortana
Alex likes three to make a big showing
in Mac OS and a wild card here
touchscreen support big time wildcard
bomb Oh hopeful and the next one
something happening with the macbook air
I'll I'm putting my bet on it being just
the death of the macbook air Apple's
lineup is a little weird down on one end
you've got a really thin underpowered
overpriced macbook with a high
resolution screen and then you've got
the macbook air more powerful now with
upgraded ram inside of it with a low res
screen and then you've got the macbook
pros
215 inside with two generations outdated
processors it's a very weird outdated
kind of lineup the macbook air no longer
make sense and apples lineup but I said
this in the past even though it just got
a few extra gigabytes of RAM I expect a
macbook air to go the way of the cube
the Newton the Pippin Scotty and the
Jordan and to be retired there'd be no
more macbook air before anybody gets too
sad about the macbook air i think the
update we've all been waiting for is
coming redesign macbook pros finally so
you can expect to the new macbook pro
first a redesign thinner lighter faster
that kind of goes par for the course for
apple new io USB type c / thunderbolt
support i don't think it's gonna be the
only port they're gonna have on the
macbook pro and we're gonna see legacy
iOS will have USB 3.0 I think
Thunderbolt add additional Thunderbolt
port it's going to go away I think we're
still going to have the SD card at least
I'm hoping but that's probably likely to
be swapped out I also probably have
colors I would also would make sense if
you keep the casing the same size
increase the screen size so a 15-inch
MacBook Pro be a 60 inch macbook pro and
the 13-inch you go to 14 inch keep it
inside of the same case with thinner
bezels and also of course
high-resolution displays and support for
until 6th generation Core I chips and
last not least probably sexy of all the
updates new software next generation of
watcher was a key VOS I wouldn't hold
your breath for anything like Apple
watch to voice hope will Apple of a wild
card I still would love to have a gaming
Mac you know maybe some crazy updates in
the mac pro maybe we'll see assistant
like we have with Amazon's echo all that
stuff I know is wishful thinking I'm
hoping that there's one more thing that
what can be hbu I'll surprised all of us
so you guys think what are you excited

jazzy for you you can't wait to have
happen are you more fresh prints and
just too cool for school and don't care
