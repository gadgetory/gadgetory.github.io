from TechnoBuffalo every year we like to
have the staff pick their favorite phone
of the year I have the privilege and
honor and just the giddiness I get a
test every smartphone that's come out
pretty much over the past year so I
thought instead of just naming my
favorite phone I would name my top five
but then I started making my top five
list and I realized there are too many
phones that I like so instead of my top
five smart phones of 2014 I present to
you my top 10 smart phones of 2014
ending of course with my number one
choice and these are obviously in order
of how I like the devices this isn't a
definitive list it's actually just a
personal thing for me usually I do
reviews I'm sort of broadcasting for a
general audience and sort of take my own
preferences out of it these are my list
of phones that have been my favorite
personally to use and test through 2014
this was a super hard list to make and
I'm sure I'm gonna get plenty of hate
for it a lot of phones that I test that
I liked could make the list cuz only ten
of them so things like disease so we're
getting Galaxy alpha did not make the
cuts without further ado it's going to
get started
coming in at number 10 perhaps a
surprise to some of you the blackberry
Passport
the sucker was released in September and
I really liked it before you jump down
my throat
let me just quantify this BlackBerry OS
10.3 is really really good my big knock
on blackberry 10 was ridiculously poor
app support now however that is not a
valid argument now you've got
BlackBerry's app world you've got full
Amazon App Store a built-in you can
direct download almost every APK from
Google Play so you get almost the
best-of-three app stores I love the
keyboard the size was a little bit weird
that square design 4.5 inch square at
the 1445 1440 resolution took a little
bit of getting used to I miss a physical
keyboard and I really liked a blackberry
stuff coming in at number 9 the galaxy
s5 this is ancient by smartphone time is
released back in April remember it's got
a 5.1 inch screen it's 1080p
I liked the phone I didn't absolutely
love it I think Samsung disappointed a
lot of people what the s5 ultimately
ended up being I think that's why we saw
a huge design change with the Galaxy ala
phone we saw with the note 4 but it
still sold a lot it might not have sold
as many as Samsung it hoped cell phone
would introduce fingerprint scanners and
heart rate sensors and of course a lot
of people love it
coming in at number 8 the Droid turbo
this would have gotten much higher on my
list that would have released a lollipop
already forward supposedly is coming
sometime soon this came out way back in
October if remember this 5.2 inch qHD
thing was a pretty badass phone at that
Kevlar back 39 hundred million power
battery I pretty much had every feature
you could want for a Verizon I loved it
for that lollipop it would have been way
higher on my list coming in at number 7
the LG g3 the sucker came out in June
5.5 inch qHD screen was a first q HD
screen a mass released in the US market
bezels are really thin buttons on the
back had laser autofocus not instills
one of my favorite phones but obviously
there were a few that I liked a little
bit more so let's talk about those
number six the HTC One m8 released all
the way back in March this 5-inch screen
phone I
like the design I think each TC doesn't
incredible job with their devices the
metal body feel really good
the older pixel camera might have been a
little disappointing to some but overall
I think it was a really great package
plus I kind of like wake she's he does
with sense coming in at number five
another Samsung the note 4 released in
September this 5.7 inch qHD screen phone
has pretty much everything you'd want in
a modern phablet device Samsung I think
nailed this product everything they miss
at the s5 they hit home with the note 4
the design way better it feels premium
the screen q HD and is probably the best
screen I've seen on any phone going
right now lover 8 TouchWiz its there
lollipop update suppose it coming very
soon of course all the S Pen features
I think Samsung absolutely nailed the
note form come unit number for the Moto
X 2014 version released in September I
love this guy from myriad of reasons
among them you can customize the phone
to look any way you want from leathers
looking like the back of a football
different colors moto maker is really
pretty awesome getting a phone that's
customized just for you I love that it's
already getting a lollipop you're
getting native naked Android as Google
intended which I really like I have got
carrier support from us every carrier
outdoor out there I love the build to
the phone I like the circular flash
though it doesn't improve much think it
looks really cool and I've thoroughly
enjoyed using the phone coming in at
number three the Nexus 6 released back
in November this 5.9 six inch qHD phone
has every speck you could think of for a
super phone its God in there the
sideways was a little bit big for my
taste and I really like big phones I
loved the way the phone performed I love
the way the lollipop look I think
Motorola built up did a really nice job
though I didn't like all the greasy
fingerprints that showed up on the back
of the blue one the white and kind of
radiation color one was way better
everything about this phone was
absolutely awesome I really really liked
we are getting to number one wearing the
big guns now coming in at number two the
iPhone six-plus released in September
this will make the list because it was a
big departure for Apple not so much on
the software side but finally a big
iPhone which was a lot of what I was
asking for I've liked the using it I
still think the software is deficient
from a hardware standpoint I really like
using I like having iMessage I like
having a shared photo galleries and I
like sort of being inside of that Apple
ecosystem oh well I think there's a lot
of room for improvement
Apple enabled as far as they could with
iOS 8 the iPhone 6 plus which brings us
to number one if I may get a drumroll
please out of all the phone I tested
this year my favorite phone the one I
enjoyed carrying in my pocket the most
is the oneplus one this guy came out
around June of 2014 this 5.5 inch phone
was rocking CyanogenMod and brought a
crazy new model to the market first
it was really an expensive 64 gigs for
about 350 bucks I know a lot of people
took umbrage with their invite system
which was done because they just didn't
have the money to mass market the phone
their mass produced of phones rather
when you got an invite that's when the
phone was made hopefully that's gonna
get Ali gated soon they've opened up the
phone source sale on mass markets now
there's been some confusion by their
cyanogen is gonna keep being on the next
version of it but the phone as it stood
when I tested was my favorite phone it
was quick was fast the camera got better
they improved the screen the way it
looked they improved the touch
sensitivity I loved everything cyanogen
offer else it'll make my phone look like
a lollipop day after Google announced
what they called Android hell at the
time you could skin it you could see me
can do anything you wanted with it right
out of the box and I absolutely loved
away the fete sandstone back felt just
everything about this device was
enjoyable to use right out of the box
and I think the oneplus folks absolutely
nailed it if you want to get what I
still consider to be one of the best
phones of the year look to pick up a
oneplus one now that's a little easier
to buy at an absolutely killer price you
smack a Samsung logo on there or an LG
logo on the back the price of that phone
out wager almost doubled I don't know
how they did it
but there is no
sacrificing quality for price did they
hit this one square out of the park so
what do I think of my list yell at me
all you want I can take it what did I
miss what did I not miss on here what
should have been number one what would
your top 10 or top 5 or top 3 be I would
like to hear from you sir or madam leave
