technobuffalo hearing that calming quiet
noise that you're here right now is the
sound of the ipad rumor mill finally
grinding to a halt today Apple sent out
press invitations for a March seconds i
pad 2 launch events or at least an ipad
2 announcement event so let's go ahead
and rundown on what we can expect
so often times these apple press invites
are been ambiguous with what's going to
get an ounce maybe there's a stripes in
the background for some sort of tiger or
leopard for an operating system or hints
that maybe it might be I phone-based
they really took the direct right at you
approach with this one there is a
picture of the ipad in the corner and
the event is on Wednesday March second
and that means there's a big number two
right in the middle of the invite so
you've got an iPad and got number two
right there so ipad 2 most definitely is
going to be the focus of the event now
there have been a ton of rumors
circulating I've been really trying to
not inundate you with videos on ipad
rumors you know as sort of a play just
to get get dish to get views so I really
wanted to wait until we observe
everything together we had a launch
event and now we finally do so let me
recap what I think we can expect with
the ipad 2 so the first thing I think we
can expect nothing new is the same 9.7
screen our chances are the same
resolution we're going to see a little
bit thinner display which is going to be
a little bit of a thinner body and the
rumors had been suggesting that it's
going to be a little bit of me a tapered
sign so it'll look a little bit
different it won't be like the iphone 3g
the iphone 3gs where you couldn't really
tell the difference was this is going to
be a more stylized upgrade so similar to
the iphone 3gs to the iphone 4 this is
the first ipad upgrade that we've seen
being the Senate a connection device so
it hasn't really been a precedent set
yet the big announcement presumably is
going to be on the cameras I front and
rear facing camera being featured on the
ipad 2 seems to be all but a certainty
with recent supply chain suggesting at
five megapixel camera on the back and a
VGA camera on the front most obviously
for face time huh so you can get your
video chat on and take yourself poured
your facebook photos with your ipad
whatever you like probably going to be
the largest announcement what we might
see is the next generation a four
breaths called the
85 chip all that will make its way to
the next generation iphone as well the
trend has recently been towards dual
course we see them with Tiger to resync
Qualcomm announced dual core chips it is
widely being presumed that Apple is also
going to follow suit with a new
dual-core chip which should be pretty
fantastic and hopefully very fast and
upon par with what we've seen from the
likes of nvidia there Tibor to chip is
blazing hopefully the ipad 2 will
feature a faster processor doubling of
the RAM making for a more elegant
experience using the tablet what's more
important to me and this is from my
personal standpoint this is a bit of an
editorial ization here i am less
concerned about a speck update I'm less
concerned about a dual-core processor
and more RAM as I am about the user
experience and for me iOS has gotten a
bit on the stale side it hasn't changed
all that much since 2007 the changes
that iOS experience has really been the
hands of developers in the forms of apps
and new features and functionality of
that has subsequently unlocked but the
core look and feel of the operative
itself hasn't really changed when you
look at for example the lockscreen of an
iPad or an iPhone there's obscure lack
of information there I'm competitors
Android for example most notably you
look at the Palm webOS you are doing
things with their real estate iOS
notification systems that sort of pop up
our intrusive and have to be hit ok or
cancel are really at least in my mind
starting to look very last generation
their intrusive you can't continue what
you're doing it stops what you're doing
so I'm hoping that the focus of his ipad
2 that will also be showing perhaps next
generation operations that will address
this Apple has always been on the
cutting edge of design from a user
experience standpoint so I don't expect
the company to rest on their laurels and
continue sort of the same icon row after
row after row format that they've been
doing I like iOS iOS is still my
preferred operating system I think it's
elegant it works well and it works well
for me
competitors are really coming up quick
and a lot of people's minds have
surpassed iOS in terms of functionality
so it's sort of hopeful that apple will
advance the operating system beyond what
we've seen so sort of the general specs
what we can hopefully expect with the
ipad 2 there have been rumors of perhaps
even a micro USB port in SD card slot
even talk of light peak which is sort of
a new data trade for us technology
making away at the ipad i would
necessarily hold my breath for that
there have been sort of new standards
and laws the european union that are
mandating standardized charging port so
perhaps maybe we'll see a micro USB used
as a standard alternative but I'm not
hoping for that no but I think we're
even going to see it I think that 30-pin
connector is going to be here to stay so
what do you guys think about the ipad 2
is it the tablet you've been waiting for
certainly whether you want the ipad 2 or
don't want the ipad 2 the sequel to the
world's most popular tablet is that
during me much more competitive world
then when the first generation entered
you're now living in a time when the
zoom is going to be available you're
down to blackberry playbook you're gonna
have a galaxy tab 2 in tab 10.1 the 3 DG
slate oh just kind of need so you're
gonna have a lot of options when it
comes to tablet click out really has to
bring their a-game if they want to
retain the dominant market share love to
hear what you guys have to think jon
rettinger from technobuffalo see the
next video bye bye
