TechnoBuffalo show online beer to host
for today Sean ani editor and chief to
the site i'm joined by deputy managing
editor Todd Hazleton everybody are you
doing today Todd dude except for after
last week's show on really nervous that
we're on some people's huge HD he's so
well if we are we hope you're enjoying
all the the grandeur that is tated
myself yeah that's uh so it's actually
been a fairly quiet week hmm which is
nice before the whole google i/o WWDC
III every gas co thinkin's where we are
working very very long hours i will say
e3's press day is the worst one by far
yeah we start at like 8am and i think i
usually get out of here around 10pm or
so it's I've covered in e3 before it was
tough Oh different than other shows are
my puppy here if you see me looking at
that a little different than other shows
because the public's there too so it's
kind yeah well this year they're adding
even more on stage precedence so it's
it's going to be a long day very long
day but we had some a couple things we
want to talk about I wanted to know Todd
did you ever play any musical
instruments yes saxophone uh did you
ever try playing your sex phone while
driving I didn't I started on the
trombone and then moved to the tuba so I
can also say that I never attempted to
play while driving however we bring this
up because this week it came out that
there the autonomous cars are being
tested have been in a couple accidents
most of them though none of them have
been the caused by the autonomous
driving right they have been caused
either by other cars or by the
autonomous cars being under the control
of the drivers that are monitoring them
but the the fact that Google and their
report came out and said you know we've
seen so many crazy things when dry
down the road and you know we've seen
people reading books and all that but
the one that killed me was the guy goes
we even saw someone playing a trumpet
yeah who plays a trumpet while driving
how does that even work I mean maybe in
the future when these you know
autonomous cars are there then you're
kind of sitting there you play the
trumpet all you want but yeah well you
know and that's the thing that came
across my mind you you once autonomous
cars do become a reality which it's
clear that they're going to become one
you know how many people are gonna be
freaked out driving down the road
they're going to look over and some guy
goes napping right exactly you know
there's going to have to be I think some
sort of label on the car right that says
autonomous right yeah that's a good
point we haven't even thought about that
like are they gonna color code or like
how are you gonna know so you don't just
sit scared really was like idea exactly
hey but I think one of the things
because currently like when we were at
CES and the audi a7 concept i think it
was a drove from san francisco to vegas
by itself they had to have you had to
have somebody behind their wheel the
whole time so but yeah i would be scary
still you see someone napping yeah we
are yeah I modeled over for that the
second I heard about onimous cars as you
know I have to drive three hours to get
to an airport whenever I fly out to
irvine right you know I hate that drive
hate it but it's a very laid-back
highway it's a dual lanes both ways
hardly anyone on it it's a great highway
it's just a boring drive right I'm gonna
nap if I have an autonomous car i am
going to be napping during that three
hour drive you know somebody's got to
look over the head cv and go oh you know
what's happening call the police or
whatever it when these cars first hit
the road you're gonna have to be
expected to be pulled over by the police
who knows how many times right because
they're not going to understand them
they're not going unless there is some
sort of label on them say self-driving
autonomous whatever rules that say like
you still have to keep your
on the road and stuff like then what's
the pool I mean then they're safer but
they're not really more fun exactly I
don't know it's going to be interesting
to see how those work out but getting
back to to the whole accident situation
I the first time one is in a major
accident we're not going to be able to
escape those news right people are going
to go nuts and they're gonna you know
damn autonomous driving for a long time
I think oh yeah unless the thing is
where i was in sweden earlier this year
with volvo checking out there
self-driving cars and what they're doing
on the front and all those whole planets
like have no accent or no serious
injuries in their cars by 2020 so if we
get to the point where cars are super
super safe anyway and not just volvo but
everybody and then their self driving
and then they get Maxine's but nobody's
hurt then maybe you know it's a little
more acceptable I think it's just so
long as nobody's hurt these things yeah
I think so too now I did read this week
also that the first self-driving semi
has been approved Dre I saw that I have
mixed feelings that is that seems so
much scarier because you want to semi
when something goes wrong at the semi
something goes very wrong has no one
ever seen maximum overdrive yeah right
but also I mean they they if it tips
over then you've got stuff all over the
road and traffic and maybe they're safer
I mean maybe you can keep this semi
going 35 miles an hour I feel good about
that except everybody knows one of the
hard things about shipping is that those
guys got to make their hours right and
that's where I mean I can see an
advantage to because I mean I've known
truckers that have pushed and pushed and
pushed to make those delivery times and
you know that they faked their logs they
do all sorts of things you know they
take drugs to stay awake all that stuff
I so semis already are fairly dangerous
and by no means am I condemning the
entire semi industry i I'm talking about
very specific cases but semis in general
already scary you know because they
our gigantic they you know anything goes
wrong it's a catastrophe right and so
now the idea of a robot driving one I'm
just like you know right but well Google
was sang up so I guess back to the
original stories earlier this week there
was a report from the AP that said
there'd been four accidents since sep
tember of these autonomous driving cars
three word Google one was a dell fikar
dlp ajay and then google like their head
of the autonomous driving came out and
said well actually there's going to
Levin or something like that since they
started the program and none of them
have been at the fault of Google's cars
and he was saying like look these things
are safe and perhaps it applies the
trucks too because a driver we have our
field of vision were distracted they
said any moment during daylight hours
the United States 660,000 people are
distracted driving something like that
and so they're saying well look here is
this car that has a 360 degree camera
view the whole time like it's its eyes
are always on the road and of course you
know there's failures but yeah I don't
know I mean I'm excited for the concept
but I can also see where there's going
to be some issues ya know but I I think
that the fact that they have been in
some accidents they did need to get out
and you know and i'll say i almost feel
like they need to say something as soon
as they happen on you know hey one of
our cars was in an accident today here's
what the flowmetry told us so on so
forth kind of like remember when that
one reporter said that the Tesla your
matter elife didn't live up and all that
and Elon Musk came out with no no no
here's all your de la yeah here's all
the logs you're lyin yeah I I own I just
I think maybe they need to make sure
they're always out ahead of things right
um from praising Franco
I play the piano all driving with a ton
of scar focus mostly on decreasing car
road accident is it possible that
insurances will also become optional and
autonomous completely takes over excuse
me that's an interesting question um I
don't think it'll become optional but I
think it if rates didn't drop you would
have a really strong argument for hey
you guys are ripping us off right yeah
huh I haven't even seen any thats a
really good point and how hard are those
insurance companies lobbying against
autonomous drive yeah well I don't know
I it's a fascinating concept I hadn't
even thought about that yeah yeah
especially imagine um yo teen drivers
are considered the most risky you know
there was a driving he changed then he's
gonna work I don't know I can't go lower
if they're not even driving but they
would have the ability to take over and
rush basically a thumbs until need yeah
I bet as long as yeah I think in the in
the most the near near future as so long
as you're able to take over then you're
still in any insurance and all that kind
of stuff but maybe in the Jetsons kind
of future everything changes brazen
Franco brings up another good point well
a driving license even be a requirement
in the future yeah like getting in the
super future really i don't know i
always i'm writing these articles today
and i say like like today you know
domino's saying you can order pizza from
twitter and it's like we do we live in
the future so now i'm thinking like the
future future I know but until I know
it's all coming so quickly I was
promised flying cars yeah I still did
not have a flying car always buy a plane
still not the same thing yeah I I want
like a Back to the Future to yo the
wheels yeah go under in the whole bit
you know or Lola for
agents of shield one of them from such
an Baja when do you think we will see
autonomous cars in mass production so
than anyone can buy one i don't know i'm
thinking maybe by like 20 20 yeah I
seems like five years out they'd start
to I'm 5 10 years i don't know i think
one of the problems is going to be
regulation right like i was just talking
about with that car that drove san
francisco to vegas saline someone behind
the wheel there's still like a lot of
things that need to change in the
government as we've seen with drones
moves kind of slow at that kind of stuff
but amazon how to deal with drugs for
example yeah yeah exactly oak maple has
a comment on the story hey I'm able for
those of you will see Todd held on a
mini dachshund my puppy yes she was
crying the day it because dad wasn't
paying attention that's exactly right
but I I don't know there's so many
questions with this you know it's a
technology I'm very very excited for but
so so many questions to still be
answered right and hopefully we'll hear
all them at some point but speaking of
questions why did verizon by AOL yeah
that was weird i mean i don't know i
mean i got in i always come in super
early in the mornings to to exercise
before work and all that and i came in
and i always fire twitter up before i do
anything i'm just say there's Terry I'm
like my sleep deprived or is that I can
happen especially because they denied it
not too long ago yeah well said like
there's nothing going on and all that
and then yeah I just sort of hit like
verizon's making you're gonna pay four
point four billion dollars for a well
Andrew like what which I find
interesting is about the same price
doesn't he paid for Lucasfilm or marble
right and it's over people saying like
just under a quarter of what whatsapp is
worth and like hey
I like for instagrams just crazy I I
think they were still there after all
those remaining dial-up customers well
that's what I was thinking to the rural
people I mean it sounds weird but maybe
I don't know but yeah I in their in
their explanation and that's about as
deep as i went into the news was you
know they needed AOL for the internet of
things and all these like buzz word
sounds like what all right whatever but
they do then you know they get some of
the lot always our competitors
TechCrunch and gadget Huffington Post
and stuff like that but then there's
rumors those are going to get spun off
at least opinion posts so I mean aol's
not just the dial-up company that we all
think of but i'm not sure why Verizon
needs or wants them aside from like you
said I mean rural customers may be the
folks that are still on Rodman but how
valuable are they really we're still on
dial-up my brother well I'm from such a
Mahal what does verizon's acquisition of
AOL and tail and what does it mean for
employees and readers of The Huffington
Post engadget TechCrunch in makers well
I entails 4.4 billion in cash now for
those that aren't familiar with these
types of situations a lot of times
though they'll involve stock transfers
or whatever no verizon is just outright
paying the owners of AOL here's 4.4
billion audios and there's like 150
million breakup fee or so I'm like I
think yeah if it doesn't happen but in
general the the 4.4 billion is just here
you go by right which I can't see why
this deal will go through and I can't
foresee any sort of government
regulations competing this one right but
as for what it means I'm sure there will
be some housecleaning I don't think
however they're going to get rid of some
of the most valuable AOL properties
which are things like Huffington Post an
engagement rumors civilly Huffington
Post could go for like a billion dollars
so I'd be like a quarter of the deal
yeah but as for TechCrunch and makers I
imagine they'll stick around but I i
would say a lot
of the house cleaning will be in the
background it won't be as we call it
consumer-facing you know it's kind of
like when we talk about technobuffalo
with which you the reader see that's
consumer-facing the version of the site
we see that's you know the the work
background stuff but and engadget said
yesterday they've had more readers than
ever you know so there's a lot of
success there and doesn't sound like
anything's gonna change on their own
yeah I don't think in gadget or
Huffington Post or going anywhere as for
everything else I don't know only time
will tell but it was it's such a an odd
thing you know and the thing I keep
wondering about you know they say
they're still you know what was a 2.1
million dial-up users something like
that where are they even finding modems
hahaha they probably still have them
write like I don't know yeah we're do
you buy movies beginners don't come with
them anymore yeah the external ones I
used to have an external one yeah I had
an external one for a while as well and
but i I just I can't remember the last
time I even saw modem yeah well what do
you see using a lot of pcmcia ports I
think yeah one other laptops yeah the
yeah the poppin arts yeah yeah which
then you push it on the little black
thing in the phone thing would pop out
on top yeah I remember when I bought my
first one of those at a i think i was in
georgia I'm business I went into a best
buy and the guy was like this is so cool
look you push it it pops adds like some
sort of James Bond thing this was the
sales clerk or bestbuy I was like that's
great yeah yes the early days of of the
internet uh-huh I was so happy when
ethernet came her Oh seriously from
brazen Franco interesting question uh
why not use the for billions to improve
upgrade their own
structure good question I think they
have been doing a lot of that anyway but
yeah it's there's varied when you're
dealing with the corporation as large as
verizon they have a situation where
their stockholders expect them to
acquire expect them to expand expect
them to move into other fields and a lot
of companies the size of verizon will
have whole departments called mergers
and acquisitions that are dedicated to
doing nothing but this they go over and
they look over all these companies and
try to see what would fit what would
answer problem so on and so forth yeah
so expand yeah it's not an uncommon
situation but at the same time yeah i'd
rather see any carrier invest four
billion that's just laying around into
their infrastructure but i don't know
it's interesting and it it was funny how
many people grabbed stories of all the
old AOL trial disks i saw some people
you'll say their parents you still
haven't round and use them as drink
coasters but you get those all the time
they were everywhere big nail and stores
they came in magazine they came in the
mail you couldn't escape them no I
remember once I got one in the mail that
came in like a metal 10 that was just
the size of the CD I was like how much
money is the drive everything yeah
different like dude some would offer
like 500 minutes or like 10,000 minutes
oh no it was always hours hours and
hours so hours and hours of free oh yeah
which was all a low was good for but
I I was a copy serve loyalist you yeah I
think I had earthlink yeah i loved
compuserve I I had compuserve AOL for a
while I never got into prodigy but yeah
compuserve inhale well I haven't both
for a while and I stuck with CompuServe
0 the 0 days of computing so we've got
some questions coming in here well we're
going to dive into him here from David
two mil in the rural areas there's the
only options are dial-up satellite
internet and verizon's data may be
moving people off dial up and on to
verizon's network right that's a
possibility i live in a rural farming
community you know luckily I do have
cable internet here although it's not
the most stable as Todd can attest to
you know if I live further out yo and
one of the surrounding towns you know
we're surrounded by towns that start
with green green castle green top so on
and so forth yo maybe I would have more
of a need for dialogue but I don't know
it's interesting it might be a move to
try to get some of those rural people
that are there enough real people to
make it worth their while that's the big
question yeah I don't know Bernie if
that's their strategy and they're going
after your dial up and is 2.1 million
then it's sort of like they just
acquired customers which is what you see
in wireless when you know bigger carry
requires a smaller one yeah t mobile
metropcs that kind of thing from such
and bahal this is a story that came out
this week as well off topic is it true
that Windows 10 is going to be the last
version of Windows well yes and the way
it was phrased sort of they were
Microsoft was basically saying like I
think they're going to sort of go the
way that Apple has with OSX like Windows
10 and then we're going to do more
frequent updates and just sort of keep
going and I
think it was referred to as like windows
as a service you know so you have
windows and you just keep going with
windows as opposed to going like you
know like we have in the past windows XP
windows 7 windows 8 was 8.1 windows 10
so I that's that's how I understood it
well I think it's going to be excuse me
folks my iPad keeps going off so I want
to mute it um yeah I think it's going to
be somewhat though like Apple and the
fact that it's OS 10 I I think that
windows finally got to the number 10 and
okay now we're on par with Apple I don't
know it's I think that's what it's going
to be the like you said in your in your
article Todd that it's going to be
incremental updates now at this point
you know it almost sounds to me like
Windows 10 is going to be more of a
platform right exactly like a service
sort of a platform for everything to
like they were saying you know obviously
we already know but for phones tablets
even xbox one yeah I don't know it's
going to be interesting to see how
Microsoft plays this out honestly I
don't think your average consumer really
cares what a operating system is called
although there will need to be some way
to delineate you know this is the newest
version yeah like please install this
one yeah exactly once just sit on the
old one but you know when they sell new
laptops with it stuff like that but it's
sort of easier for Apple to do that
because you know they're like oh here's
Yosemite and here are new laptops for it
whereas Microsoft I mean sure they can
have their partners on stage but it's a
little different they're not yeah amia
that's one thing I answer this I don't
even remember what the numerical number
is for windows at this for mac OS tent
this point I just know it's to symmetry
okay bye I think this was Lee Apple did
wisely that it gave them names right so
yeah
it does how nice a lot more sense yeah I
i just i wonder what a microsoft might
name stuff well they went from project
Spartan to edge so it's not too exciting
now i wonder if they'll go with breeds
of dogs or monkeys or something yeah
it's gonna be very uh very interesting
Windows 10 mini dachshund uh from such a
Mahal are any of you guys excited for
Assassin's Creed syndicate nope i saw i
was watching part of that announcement
yesterday just the london part seems
pretty cool but uh and the last one i
played was Black Flag I guess the pirate
run I didn't play unity I'll probably
try it I don't know next week I'm
excited for Witcher 3 coming out but I'm
gonna be out in California actually at
our around office so I won't be able to
play it here but yeah I honestly I've
never tried two Assassin's Creed huh
I've never played one of them you know I
just never been anything that looked at
appealing to me so it's not that I feel
there's anything wrong with what they
announced with syndicate I just at this
one I just don't feel like jumping into
the series so but I don't know the way
they were talking about it though how
they want this to be a game that people
talk about the future and like
exploration they've done a really good
job at that I mean we'd have to let joey
davidson talk more to it but I thought I
think I'm kind of excited for those
aspects though on the site today we said
I guess no multiplayer which is kind of
a bummer because I always like a game
with some sort of multiplayer aspect now
speaking of uh mr. Davidson since you're
out of town next week he will be
stepping into the co-host chair too all
right to host the TechnoBuffalo show
with me i'm trying to get us on our
longest run ever of an undirected
episodes 0 0 life from David DeMille the
problem I see with microsoft updates is
that they don't present it people tend
not to not update it yeah
that's exactly it they're going to have
to do something that makes you realize
this is the new version of Windows 10
this is what you want yeah exactly and
that's what I was saying it's sort of
easier for apple with the new hardware
especially heavy when you look at
iphones right it's like WWDC in june and
then September you know the new iphone
ship with it everybody's talking about
it they want that Microsoft is sort of
setting themselves up to do with surface
but you know we haven't really seen them
do that yet but hopefully that's sort of
what they continued moving forward yeah
I don't know it's going to be
interesting from brazen Franco on the
winton topic is windows becoming a
service Allah 365 if not how are they
going to monetize on it well I wonder if
they're just not going to in the sense
that you know sell their the other apps
and services through it sort of the way
Apple does with Yosemite right like you
don't really pay anything and not
anymore free upgrade so I think they're
probably going that route after I mean
we know that Windows 10 is gonna be free
for what the first year they said yeah I
think that um they'll still sell it to
OEMs but will they sell it to consumers
i think is the big question right and
then i don't think they will I mean as
long as you'll create in that first year
yeah oh it's gonna be interesting to see
what happens uh from David DeMille Todd
any updates of your Apple watch usage
over time um I'm still I'm still wearing
it so that should be that's actually a
good sign of the view yeah I really
don't like this green band cuz not that
I really care about matching wearing a
yellow shirt there just be easier to
have a black band or something on it
battery life against been good I'm still
charging it every night but what time is
it now it's 1230 my time and I'm i was
up at like 645 today and it's at
ninety-four percent so it's really good
battery life for me i mean in that sense
and again you know in my review I said
that the battery life is good you were
saying well you've said it
you know Android wear was bad at two
days and so I think it's just a matter
I'm impressed because it does a lot and
so for doing a lot throughout the day in
ninety-four percent at twelve-thirty is
pretty good but I and I want to charge
it every night like I like that it's
always here with the apps with the
weather with my movement the only thing
I gotta say is it continuously tells me
to stand up right after I sit down like
it's the dumbest thing I mean I was just
walking around and then I sit down it's
like don't forget to stand up well that
doesn't work properly yeah I'm liking it
I gotta say i also like i like i have we
the most basic model which is cool but I
sort of wish i had the steel one just
looks a little more I don't know yeah
but also do you I spend that much money
no I don't so let's say think exactly
speaking of things like the AOL deal
from such a baja are you guys happy at
the current state of techna buffalo
meaning slowly becoming more recognized
and still independent we love our
independence we yeah we really really
love our independence you know the fact
you know as has been revealed on the the
TechnoBuffalo channel we do have an
investor that John took on a long time
ago who is a silent partner he does not
have any say and how we do things but in
general óleo we are independent we you
know I talked to John and the buck stops
with John we don't have to go to any
sort of corporate overlord we don't have
to go to anyone and ask permission to do
anything and yes it's a hard road to a
hard road to go down but you know it
life would be a lot easier with a lot
more money backing us but we're making
her own way and we like it that way we
we like being just us yeah yeah did Todd
do you have any thoughts on it
no yeah I agree and I think that um you
know after the news yesterday to you
with with verizon picking up a well what
does that mean for a gadget and gadget
says you know like we're independent
editorially and the verge sort of tried
to say like how is that possible but the
verge has you know funding from
Comcast's arm to and pointed to its own
article that trashed comcast has the
worst company in america so a lot of
feeling a lot of these companies still
do have independence to some degree i
mean if they're saying so i believe it
but it is nice not having to deal with
any of that right like we're just not a
corporate culture not a corporate you
know like you don't go into a huge
office where there's a huge sales
department and all that and for better
or worse it's what i prefer i like it so
yeah yeah we're quite happy being
independent and we plan to stay
independent for a good long time he's
right uh from also from such a ball off
topic i just got a original pebble in
october 2014 i'm loving it so far but
since the pebble time was announced it
is so tempting i don't know if i should
get one get it once it's available to
everyone besides backers are wait a bit
longer to get one well Todd and I are
both backers so will we getting this
month we should be getting here
hopefully hopefully I so I say we can't
answer that till we get have time to
play with it which hopefully will be by
the end of this month I I'm looking
forward to it I actually I'm going to
hand my original one down to my mother
who's never had any sort of wearable but
she likes the idea of not pulling her
phone app or purse all the time I I
expect her to work for about a week
before she gives up uh but uh yeah I I'm
done I'm out no it should be i'm looking
forward to playing with that i want to
see what improvements they've done i
love the idea of having a color screen
now yeah i wish i'd gone to steal want
to be honest though
because once that came out I should have
switched but uh and now having the Apple
watch and having the motive 360 like not
crazy about going back to a plastic body
watch but I don't know ma'am also from
such a Mahal hey Sean which one are you
more excited for Disney infinity 3.0 or
Lego dimensions and why Disney infinity
3.0 two words Star Wars I'm not a I'm i
liked lego by i'm i'm not on the current
lego fanaticism and i'm a huge disney
fan so infinity was always going to have
me but adding in Star Wars just seals
the deal as far as I'm concerned they're
coming free Todd yeah breaking news here
though I just wanted to share Windows 10
editions was just announced by Microsoft
so there's going to be Windows 10 home
which is the Consumer Focus desktop
Edition windows 10 mobile sorry meant i
was going windows had mobile that's the
one for smartphones and small tablets
windows 10 pro that's desktop Edition
for PCs tablets and two and one it
builds on the features of Windows 10
home but for the needs of small
businesses for those who need to manage
devices nap so I can RT Department
windows an enterprise for I guess larger
IT departments Windows 10 education for
schools this is the problem with
microsoft windows 10 mobile enterprise
the same idea of volume licensing to
customers and then moving forward but
I'm surprised they went back to windows
10 mobile they're going like I mean it's
not it was once called windows mobile
Wow but that's right on topic to what we
were just talking about with Apple where
you have you know Yosemite and what a
microsoft thing to do i'm actually
really surprised by this well I wonder
Xbox born is well just hang on to okay I
cannot believe how frustrated that just
made me okay just as Microsoft
right ah nothing they that's the whole
thing everyone thinks that I hate
microsoft I don't I used Microsoft
products for almost a quarter of a
century you know I want them to succeed
they are their own worst enemy you know
it is never ceases to amaze me how they
get in the way of themselves yeah it
just seems like confusing for consumers
they're going to go to bestbuy and be
like wait so do I want Windows 10 home
or do I want Windows 10 Pro and that's
let me not had those questions asked me
before especially when i worked at
laptop magazine cover computers a lot
more and it does confirm though the 10
home 10 mobile 10 pro free upgrades for
Windows 7 Windows 8.1 and Windows 8
Windows Phone 8.1 devices for the first
year after launch but still I mean all
the names I thought the whole point of
this and they said this earlier was it's
just going to be called Windows 10 for
everything and now here you go and it's
out there's 10 windows 10 pro when do I
mean that's just confusing I mean yes
there is you know I believe it's called
OS 10 server but I mean it's it's not
something that you know that many people
have to worry about but when a consumer
walks into a store I I thought after the
whole RT thing that Microsoft is my idea
really you know Artie was a joke you
know Microsoft I swear
I I I just right I don't know what
they're thinking I don't know I mean I'm
actually really surprised by this
because I thought it was a good idea to
go Windows 10 and call it like that on
everything like what's on that phone
Windows 10 what's on that pc windows 10
what's all that top yeah and we're right
back to where we've always been
consumers if they walk into a store and
they asked a Salesman what is this Mac
running they can go Yosemite done now
you walk into a store and you look at a
lineup of PCs ego which version of
Windows 10 is this ready oh well it's
running home okay well is home the one
where I can no that's so silly it's so
stupid you know and I know a lot of our
listeners I know all of you guys I know
that you're going to understand this but
think about your parents think about you
know that guy you know in class that
doesn't understand his own phone think
about the average consumer that you see
walking into a store they're going to be
confused yep you know it's just like
every time I hear somebody say oh we'll
just route your phone yes I could root
my phone can your parents route their
phone more than likely not and that's
the sort of thing that's where Microsoft
is messing this up your your average
consumer is not going to know what each
version of windows does they're just
going to say you know oh it runs Windows
10 okay that's fine but is it running if
you ever watched the the british sitcom
Todd it crowd no I mean I think I
watched like maybe you sent me an
episode or a clip or something like that
but that way about soccer I know of it
yeah i just watched the whole series
finally on the recommendation of joey
and the the way they answered the phone
every single time somebody called down
with a problem the first thing they
would say was have you tried turning it
off and on
or is it plugged in yeah so yeah that's
exactly although the funniest line in
that whole show they were they found a
but a suspicious package that might be a
bomb and there was a robot trying to
take care of it and the robot stuck in
the guy yells down the street you know
I'm working on it there's something
wrong with the computer in the yell back
what OS is it running he goes uh windows
vista and one of them turns and goes
we're going to die which made me laugh
so hard I almost had to stop my
treadmill Oh a Microsoft I don't know
what to do for you anymore you're your
own worst enemy yeah good good grief
well we're almost out of time here I
can't believe how fast these shows go
anymore and we love doing from such an
Mahal off topic or any of you excited
for rock band 4 Guitar Hero live again
I've never played any of them I have no
plastic and so I am I'm excited i saw
this setlist yesterday I guess I think
this for rocking for right yeah yeah
yeahs with yeah i like to those games I
don't have any of the instruments my
roommate had it when I was uh just out
of college so that's when I played it
last and I don't think my wife would um
i was gonna say i don't see her going
for the zombies before but i don't think
I'll own it yeah I don't see her going
for a bunch of plastic instruments in
your apartment yeah oh you never know
though she would surprise you yeah just
real quickly going over here mahna I see
a lot of your questions but we answered
those very early in the episode so
listen to the audio replay later from
praising Franco I bet verizon is only
interest in this 2.1 million users still
