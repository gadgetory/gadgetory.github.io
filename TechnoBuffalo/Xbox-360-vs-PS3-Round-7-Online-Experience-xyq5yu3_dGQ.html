looked a design and functionality of the
user interfaces and in this round we'll
continue with the online features of the
you is the PlayStation Network versus
Xbox Live is up next so get ready for
some heavyweight game console action its
LP from TechnoBuffalo
and welcome to the next installment of
the console world to start off this
comparison I thought I show you a clip
of Xbox Live's Get Connected advert and
pay specific attention to the music
entertainment of Xbox Live
you can try games before you buy them
and extend yeah if the music sounds
familiar that's because it's the theme
song from ps3s exclusive hit
LittleBigPlanet interesting choice of
music for the xbox live women both
parties are responsible for copying and
sealing the others Thunder so hey that's
business
you can't invent the wheel for a second
time
so in the last round the ps3 took a
slight edge because from the standpoint
of functionality it's less clustered
with content and it's a mo logically
laid out interface that appeals to the
offline single-player gamer in me but
and this is a big button and I don't
mean figuratively the online component
of the interface which we did not cover
is equal is important if not even more
important than just the basic
functionality of interface so in this
round we'll be taking a look at the
online services how they're integrated
into the interface how well they're
implemented into the gaming experience
and how well it all works let's start
off this comparison with finance I come
from a PC gaming background I played a
lot of games online starting from the
old quake days and the notion of paying
for the opportunity to play with my
friends at first is preposterous why
would I want to pay for something I've
done for years on my PC for free while
the PlayStation Network service is
currently free the Xbox Live Gold
account will cost you up to 60 bucks a
year so what am I getting for my 60
bucks a year well I do get to play
online with my friends I can create a
party and chatted with my buddies online
I get some exclusive content like
getting some game demo earlier and I get
a lot of interesting online services but
most of these features you get for free
on the ps3 so again why would I want to
pay for this well there's a single
reason why Xbox Live might be worth 60
years a year and the reason is that it
works I've been a PSN user since the
very beginning and truthfully I've had a
lot of issues with PSN for example the
first two days of the launch of modern
warfare 2 a lot of issues the servers
were randomly down and friend advice
didn't work at all
I've never had this happen using xbox
live live is not flawless but it
definitely works better than PSN
everything eventually gets patched up to
work on the ps3 but it can be a bit
annoying but a couple of weeks ago I
heard that Sony has recently hinted at a
paid service coming this year to the ps3
giving somewhat similar exclusive access
to content that you can expect on Xbox
Live an unconfirmed perk to the PSN
premium service will be free access to
old PlayStation titles which is actually
a great idea but if I have to start
paying for the PSN premium service I
expect it to work better don't get me
wrong the PSN works great most of the
time but
there can be some random issues that I
never experienced on Xbox Live however
an annoying thing about the Xbox Live
service is that you pay for the
subscription but you have to pay for it
pretty much everything inside the
service as well there are some random
themes and stuff that are free but saw
not much real content that you'd
actually want in the first place and
they get it for the UI is the fact that
most icons on the interface leads to
more paid content and it almost seems
like the consumer aspect super sees the
gamer aspect of the interface which
really affected the result of the
previous round overall while I'm not
doing the happy dance for having to pay
for the online service I am willing to
pay it if I get a guarantee of
everything working and up until now the
stability and lack of issues with Xbox
Live service is starting to justify the
price tag but I'll leave the final
determination to whether Xbox Live is
worth your hard-earned bottlecaps
after we've covered all the features I
mentioned in the previous round that
Xbox Live is quite seamlessly integrated
into the new Xbox experience in fact
without the features of live it wouldn't
be much of an experience at all most of
the nxe channels are directly integrated
into Xbox Live in the spotlight channel
you find featured content in the
different tabs of the spotlight channel
you find gaming related news interesting
new features and the most interesting
new content found in the Xbox Live
Marketplace the spotlight channel is the
section that will be opened on default
once you start up the Xbox 360 on the
PlayStation 3 you have a keenly similar
section which is also the first thing
you see when you fire up your ps3 in
terms of featured content it's pretty
much the same as the spotlight channel
on the 360 with the exception with ps3
having links to websites that launched
the ps3 web browser which I'll get to
later in this comparison
while I enjoyed the speed and
functionality of the PS Reis cross media
bar I would have liked to see some more
integration to the online features most
of the online features are basically
icons that launch different applications
rather than being integrated into the
experience itself the store icon
launches the store application and the
home icon launches the PlayStation home
application and so forth while in the
new Xbox experience most of the online
features work all as a part of the same
interface okay next we're going to be
comparing the Xbox Live Marketplace to
the PSN store
I'm usually interested in game demos and
that's really the content I want to get
to an Xbox Live provides a nicely
integrated route to the content browsing
content in the Xbox Live Marketplace is
fast and large box art icons really work
well here it couldn't be much simpler
than this
while the PSN store is a separate
application with a more classical
approach it also works very well it's
fast and logical and it can change the
way to view content to suit your liking
content why the stores are quite similar
on both systems you find extra Maps
classical games arcade games extras for
games such as costume for your
characters and on both systems you find
a selection of original and creative
content from independent developers the
content inside the stores differed bent
depending on the region but both stores
have great content and are easy to
navigate Sony has the edge though on
movie content with the agreement Sony
has in place with the major movie
distributors the video store has a broad
selection of very good titles available
to buy or to rent unfortunately the
movie content is not available in every
corner of the world including this one
there's more ps3's in Europe than any
other region but still most countries
have limited PSN services and i got'em
it I'm pissed off about this I just
can't imagine what the holdup is Xbox
Live now has the Zune Marketplace with
some good movie titles that are
available from most corners of the world
including remote places such as from
Finland there are some pretty good
titles in the Zune Marketplace but I
would like to see some more aggressive
pricing and speaking of pricing one of
the weak points of Xbox Live are
Microsoft Points which act as a currency
of Xbox Live to buy or rent content you
first have to buy
soft points which usually don't even
correlate to the currency here using for
example I just bought 2100 Microsoft
Points for 19 euros which correlates to
what 90 94 cents per every 100 points
and the craziest thing is that the
prices differ depending on the place you
purchase them
luckily Sony took the direct route and
you can buy content from the PSN store
with actual money but I have to
compliment how the Xbox Live Marketplace
is also very nicely integrated into the
gaming experience you can access
specific game related content from
inside the game you're playing and while
I do not agree with all the content
inside the store it all feels connected
which gives the whole experience a much
more unified field while the PSN store
is very versatile and navigation wise a
bit simpler it can compete with the deep
integration of the marketplace both
consoles have services that are region
specific for example both the Xbox 360
and ps3 have Netflix services that are
only available in the United States and
for example the vids own service is
available in Europe and the Pacific
region I can't cover the Netflix
services because over here in Finland
there's no such thing bid zone has gone
a bit under the radar it's a very cool
music video application with a nice
collection of content spanning from
Metallica to the sticks in mid zone you
can create your own playlists or for
example play and shuffle up the videos
from a specific genre and best of all
vids own is a free service there
actually is some bids own content on the
Xbox Live Marketplace as well but
there's no dedicated interface like on
the ps3 playstation home was initially
titled to be a new way of experiencing
gaming online in home you could have
space where you can launch games and
hang out with your friends and interact
with fellow PSN users and have all kinds
of content that is seamlessly streamed
into the experience it kind of does what
it promises except the seamless part
there's just a lot of tedious loading
times that really put off enjoying the
experience why in the world would I want
to launch a game from a place where it
takes me five minutes to get to the
answer is I wouldn't beyond the
novelties of the virtual world I think
home doesn't add too much value to the
experience Microsoft kind of created the
avatars to compete with home and they
actually managed to successfully
integrate the avatars into the actual
interface and that's pretty much what I
expected home to do when I first heard
about it
Microsoft recently announced that they
will be introducing a new game room to
the nxe where you can use your avatar to
interact with your friends and play
classic arcade games like centipede and
asteroids sounds kind of cool but some
will see with the last major nxe update
the Xbox received Twitter and Facebook
applications as separate applications
they are in fact very good but I would
have liked to see the applications
integrated into the dashboard in a way
that does not require you to launch the
specific application every time you want
to post a single tweet the ps3 also has
Facebook integration you can set your
ps3 to share trophy purchase and game
event info to your Facebook feed there
is no dedicated application for the
Facebook feed but you can use the web
browser to access your Facebook account
and it works okay as Facebook is
designed to be used in a web browser and
speaking of the web browsers this is one
of ps3s advantages it does in fact have
a web browser while the Xbox 360 does
not it's not at all a perfect browser
but if you want to keep ad web browsing
ain't actually half bad but some with
the Twitter and Facebook applications
the Xbox 360 has better social network
integration however I would like to see
the applications integrated in the
similar way as the messenger app tapping
on the 360 controllers menu button gives
you fast access to the messaging
application messaging on the Xbox 360
relies on Microsoft Live service which
integrates the Xbox 360 messenger
through Windows Live account so all your
contacts and your Windows Live Messenger
account will be the contacts on your
Xbox so on your Xbox 360 you can chat
with people who don't even own an Xbox
and this I think is a welcomed
integration the basic messaging
functions on both systems are about the
same you can send and receive single
messages to your friends who are online
or offline and you can also create an
audio or video chat on both systems but
a major and significant benefit to the
Xbox 360 messaging system is the cross
game voice chat which makes it possible
to talk with your buddies while playing
different games so basically you can be
playing the single-player campaign of
Gears of War 2 and talk to your buddy
who's playing the newest Hannah Montana
game in-game voice chat is possible on
the ps3 but not between different games
and audio communication
in game is dependent on the games own
infrastructure a very nicely devised
element to the xbox live is the party
system the party system allows you to
create or join a party and talk to your
friends anywhere on xbox live from
inside the party you can easily launch
you the same games and even watch a
rented movie together the Xbox 360 party
system is excellent and it's a system
that I'm dearly missing on the ps3
because on the ps3 there isn't much that
motivates you to stay connected with
your buddies while it seems Xbox Live is
all about staying connected and
interacting with your friends and
overall I'd say the messaging and
communication are superior on Xbox Live
both consoles have an accomplishment
tracking system that are linked to the
online service you can basically keep
track of what games you played and
compare your accomplishments against
your buddies you have trophies for the
ps3 and achievements on xbox 360
trophies were introduced to the ps3 in
July of 2008 some games were updated
with trophy support long after the
release so people who bought the ps3 and
games early on got screwed sure would
have been nice to get trophies from
games like Warhawk uncharted and GTA 4
but since I play the game pretty close
to their launch dates I got nothing
there are four different types of
trophies bronze silver gold and platinum
bronze being the easiest to achieve
while the platinum trophy requires you
to hunt down every trophy in the game
every trophy increases your experience
level and the more valuable the trophy
the more experience you gain on the
level system I have to admit it took me
some time to figure out how much each
trophy was worth I actually had to
google it and search a forum which makes
the trophy system unnecessarily
complicated the Xbox 360 achievement
points are a bit more straightforward
and simple the smallest achievement is 5
points and the highest is 500 points
which all accumulate into your gamer
score there is no level system but it's
really not needed and you don't need any
mathematical equations to calculate
anything and the gamer score is a nice
measure of how accomplished a gamer you
are in short the Xbox 360 achievement
points and gamer score are superior
so to wrap up round seven is xbox live
worth 60 bucks a year the answer is yes
if that's what it takes to have
everything work as well as they do on
Xbox Live I'm willing to pay and this
goes for the upcoming PSN premium
service as well I am willing to pay for
the service but Sony's going to have to
up the ante because as is now almost
every aspect of the online service is
better on the Xbox 360 while I do prefer
the cross media bar is an offline gaming
experience taking into account the
online components in all the complexity
I have to say that the new Xbox
experience is overall a better more
thought-out interface with excellent
online integration but most importantly
Xbox Live works and earns the Xbox 360
appointing this round tying up this
matchup
stay tuned for the next run where we'll
be taking a look at the media playback
features and I have a feeling that
solely might have something of its lead
for the next round
