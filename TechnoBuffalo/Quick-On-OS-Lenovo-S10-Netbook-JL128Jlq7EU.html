the really cool things about the Lenovo
s10 netbook is it actually ships with
two operating systems on it one Windows
XP which is probably going to be your de
facto operating system for most of your
tasks but it also has this really cool
quick on OS which is fantastic for
wanting to check your email view into
pictures or even getting on skype so let
me go ahead and show you what that looks
like and we'll do a short walk through
button turned on and you'll get the
Lenovo splash screen in just a second
there it is
and pretty quickly after you get this
splash top OS and that's really it if
you don't move the mouse at all you'll
go right into Windows XP there won't be
much of delay but if you want to check
out the Quick Start OS let me show you
what we have here share your ideas which
is sort of a Lenovo version of a social
network I'll show you everything here
you've got Skype chat photos online
games music and web now what most people
are gonna use this for probably the web
so let me show you what that looks like
first
so again Lenovo QuickStart powered by
Splashtop and I believe this is Ajay a
very very very simple Linux kernel that
they installed on us let's take a second
to load
server not found it takes it just take a
little bit to connect to the wireless
network but it's actually a relatively
full-featured operating system which is
pretty neat the browser is actually
relatively good so there it goes and one
of the cool things about this browser is
you can do anything you normally would
do so you can very easily view YouTube
videos I'll show you right here
youtube.com go in and check your email
watch some of your favorite videos you
know really whatever you want and you're
good to go so here's the video on the
Kentucky Derby and there you go you can
you can start watching which is actually
pretty cool let me go ahead and turn
this off in the Kentucky Derby so this
is the browser it's a great browser you
can do whatever you want you can
bookmark pages and check your email or
you know really anything you do with a
normal browser except for download files
then close that off and we are back at
the QuickStart offerings with them now
when you close an application after this
first time you get this sort of Mac OS
10 ish dock where you can power off the
computer exit or go into all those
applications we just saw before so let's
take a look at music when I kind of walk
you guys through each one of these very
briefly and the dock will just go away
if you move your mouse and you've got
just a very rudimentary music player you
can have some music stored on this
partition and that's it you can access
all the files in my computer or an
external storage drive so you can plug
in a USB hard drive or thumb drive and
get rockin on your music so we will
close out of here let's keep moving
along see what else we got next one
online game so let's see what kind of
games we have
I'm gonna tell you guys for when I'm
sitting on the couch and I want to check
my email I'm really using this quick on
OS really morning I'm using Windows XP
which is kind of neat it just takes you
to really different array of games that
you can play Sudoku blooms tower defense
I'm using Santa dress up you know kind
of a bunch of cool little games you can
play when you're just sitting around so
we'll give this a close and let's keep
moving along on this with on OS come on
there we go okay so the next thing that
we have and there I just popped up my
configuration panel where you configure
your network the date and time
environment screen settings volume
control and launch bar settings next one
is pictures photos rather opened up the
game the end there we go load photos you
can see that this can be a little bit on
the squirrelly side but for the most
part actually works very well so
visualize that you've got a nice simple
Photo Viewer you know what the same
interface you had for the music player
but you can do your photos and show them
to people if you just want to turn your
computer on and say hey take a look at a
picture of my dog you can show it to
whoever real quickly we will close out
of this I will keep moving along now
there is a chat client if you want to
hop on a I am and talk to a buddy
tell him to meet you at the movies or
something so welcome to chat each add
your accounts and it's really just a
free full-featured chat application
nothing terribly exciting but you can't
get to it really quickly which is nice
next thing we have a Skype and Skype
feels you that may not know is a voice
over IP phone client meaning you can
make calls to a landline to other Skype
lines really or whatever right through
here is actually very neat and you can't
take advantage of the built-in webcam
for Skype chat while you're using us so
we don't need to sign up for a Skype
account I want to show you that it was
there and then you get share your ideas
I'll show you what that looks like
move the mouse to get rid of the duck
really it's just discover social media
all about Lenovo Lenovo forums Lenovo
blogs and really things about the
company
so guys overall I really gotta say I'm
pretty impressed with this quick on OS
it's relatively full-featured it's
pretty robust it seems to be pretty
stable as well so definitely recommend
it it's a nice added feature a lot of
netbooks are shipping with some sort of
quick on OS and this is Lenovo's take on
it I know you guys hope you enjoyed for
