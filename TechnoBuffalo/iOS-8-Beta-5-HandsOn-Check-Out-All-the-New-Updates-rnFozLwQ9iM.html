from TechnoBuffalo and iOS 8 beta 5 was
just released yesterday and we're here
to show you some of the new features
that beta 5 offers there's not a whole
lot so this is going to be a quick one
so let's get on with the video let's
start off at iCloud within the settings
app the iCloud icon changed up a bit
nothing too drastic but it now has a
white background with a blue gradient on
the iCloud icons so nothing too major
there another thing that's new in this
beta is iCloud photo library when you
turn this feature on you now have the
option to either optimize your iPhone
storage meaning it'll keep the optimized
versions of your photos onto your iphone
and store the originals in iCloud if you
have the download and keep originals
option check it means it will store full
resolution photos and videos on your
iphone so that's definitely a welcoming
feature in my eyes now if we head to the
messages app and check out the keyboard
predictive text is always enabled but
you can always hide it by swiping down
on it now if you press and hold the
little emoji button you now have a
toggle to disable it completely before
used to just say predictive on or off
but now you have a toggle which I kind
of like much better last thing we found
interesting was the spotlight animation
is super quick it doesn't have that
bouncy effect like the Notification
Center or control center but overall
it's just really really quick with other
small tidbits and minor changes if
you're on t-mobile when you're using the
latest beta and you have Wi-Fi calling
enabled you're now going to see t mobile
Wi-Fi up at the top instead of just
t-mobile another thing that's new some
iOS 8 users that are using Yosemite beta
on their mac also getting a pop-up to
ask them to use their phone numbers for
SMS relay on there max this isn't that
big of an update for iOS a but thought
we just share some of our thoughts of
the latest village if you haven't
watched our beta for video will leave a
link down below and we'll also leave a
link on how to downgrade and as always a
märklin sanctum from TechnoBuffalo i'll
see you guys in the next video thank you
