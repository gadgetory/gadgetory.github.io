to you by State Farm helping you get to
a better State hey guys Ashley skava
with TechnoBuffalo bringing you the too
long didn't watch recap of the Sony
keynote for e3 2013 oschino can get
pretty long Sony's was about two hours
but we've got our five favorite games
that we saw at the presentation first up
was watchdogs which we've been excited
about since it was unveiled at last
year's e3 it combines open world
exploration like Grand Theft Auto with
some really cool technology and multiple
ways to complete objectives it also had
what looks to be an additional
participatory experience via tablet or
smartphone which we will definitely be
checking out Tatsuya Nomura introduced
final fantasy versus 13 which now has
been rebranded as Final Fantasy 15 it
looks gorgeous with the same strange and
beautiful character design we know and
love from Square Enix and it's
definitely a game many Final Fantasy
fans are looking forward to fans of the
Keyblade rejoiced today when the teaser
for Kingdom Hearts 3 dropped bringing
the full console title back to the
PlayStation after a long hiatus it's
still in early development so let's hope
that means Star Wars and Marvel levels
now that Disney owns both IPS sci-fi
shooter destiny was one of the ps4's
more innovative games with an
always-connected world that developer
Bungie plans to augment with mobile apps
and social media we absolutely love
bungees goal of blurring the line
between a single and cooperative play
experience it's not exclusive to the ps4
but destiny is already on our wish list
lastly Elder Scrolls online was
announced for ps4 bringing the MMO to
console and making Elder Scrolls fans
very happy in the process Bethesda also
confirmed ESO would make an appearance
on the Xbox one but the ps4 will have an
exclusive beta period so you may not
want to miss that sony also made it a
point to let indie developers know that
they were welcome on the ps4 with self
publishing available and that's
something the Xbox one does
have so big points to Sony for allowing
indie devs to get in on next gen action
also Jack Tretton came out and said
here's the deal guys and as if he was
reading off of a list of Xbox one
features said that the ps4 would a
gladly support used games be be able to
play single player games without having
to go through any kind of verification
or drm verification process every 24
hours and thirdly he said that there
would be absolutely no problems loaning
selling borrowing games giving them to
your friends once you bought a disc it
was yours to keep and do with whatever
you wanted got a huge standing ovation
it's a really big deal and honestly kind
of like shooting fish in a barrel for
Sony because they kind of eight
Microsoft's lunch but the jaw dropper
was when he announced the price the ps4
will be available later this year
probably around the same time as the
xbox one for a full one hundred dollars
less then the xbox one it will be
available for 399 US dollars at launch
you'll be able to get a ps4 for less
than the cost of a 4th gen ipad and that
is serious business that was like a mic
drop I couldn't believe it people were
screaming inside the keynote it was
amazing definitely III history if the
gloves weren't off before they are
certainly off now the duel has begun
shots have been fired it is getting
serious out there we will be bringing
you all kinds of show coverage hands-on
so there's any games you want us to
check out at the sony booth let us know
in the comments see you on the show
floor I want to thank our friends at
state farm for powering our e3 coverage

having State Farm they help you on your
schedule offering 24-7 access to an
agent on your schedule not theirs let
them help you get to a better State</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
