TechnoBuffalo here with a full review
for you of the newest tablet on the
block
this is rims BlackBerry PlayBook let's
go ahead and see if it deserves a place
in your bag the BlackBerry PlayBook was
the darling of CES 2011 it was actually
one of my favorite devices that I got a
chance to see but from pre-production to
production a lot has changed and there's
some new things here that we didn't see
before so let's go ahead and dig in this
review is going to be done a little bit
differently than past video reviews I'm
gonna break it into two separate
categories things I love about the
device and things that I don't love
about the device I'm not gonna say hey
cuz that's a strong word let's just say
not love so the first thing about that I
really like about the device is the
screen its 7-inch 1024 by 600 resolution
display is absolutely beautiful
you get great visibility from all angles
whether you're at the top or the bottom
or the side images look absolutely
beautiful on here open up picture it's
probably not gonna translate on camera
but take my word for it text and
pictures and video really do pop
everything looks absolutely gorgeous you
can see in images picture here the text
for example on a website looks
absolutely great if you're reading a
book through the built-in Kobo book
store you will have no problem reading
it there isn't any pixelation you don't
get any sort of jagged little dots that
look like they're floating about in text
it really is very very very clear the
screen on here is absolutely the
excellent one of the best of the tablets
that I tested the next thing that I
really love about the PlayBook is the OS
itself
I like the gestures I like that I
control and swipe and swipe the
multitasking here is probably the best
implementation of multitasking I've ever
seen let me give you a quick example I'm
gonna go ahead and open up a video this
is a 1080p video we'll go ahead and hit
play say I'm watching it and I want to
see the first few seconds and I forget I
got checked TechnoBuffalo to see what's
new I can use the gesture area which is
another thing that I really enjoy about
it go ahead and swipe up that video is
still going to be playing I can move on
over this is very similar to Palms webOS
offering I can open up TechnoBuffalo I
can read what I want to do I can swipe
back up I can head back on over to the
video which is still playing and I can
resume it right where I was one of the
things I find really fun I really like
about webOS is actually the ability to
close applications just by swiping them
up now you can hit that little X later
if you want but that's not nearly as fun
the menu system is very intuitive you
can pull up to get a new menu system
it's powered by qnx you can see all your
applications all the favorites go ahead
and push that right back down if you
want to get some more information from a
menu you can actually swipe down and you
can get all that information right there
as well
let's go ahead and put that back up the
tabs and the interface really do make
this a fantastic operating system we're
probably looking at the future of
BlackBerry's right here so the OS is a
huge positive and as you see me go ahead
and move through this you're probably
noticing that it's moving very quickly
speed is one of the other things that I
love about the PlayBook this thing is
very very very fast its dual-core TI
Bilt processor clocking in at 1
gigahertz on each core augmented by one
gigabyte of RAM really make this a fast
tablet for opening up any application or
anything you want to do it does open
very quickly if I wanted to open up the
music application for example things
open and boot with a relative ease and
you can have a lot of applications open
and still have that speed which is quite
impressive considering this is a true
implementation of multitasking
I love swiping things off like that so
the next thing that I really enjoy one
jump back here to the browser is the
browser itself it works really well it's
quick the physics engine is very nice I
don't get any of that sort of a
checkerboard pattern when you scroll it
keeps up with what I want to do pitch to
zoom is very fast there is full flash
support I don't personally use flash
very much on browsers but I do like to
have the option it's all about consumer
choice
so you can choose turn flash off but
even with flash on pages look very well
and flash content really does work if
got some Flash content here on
TechnoBuffalo I really do like a browser
so if you were worried about from
previous BlackBerry browsers whether you
honor us five or over six browsers have
not been outstanding on previous
BlackBerry devices this definitely sets
a new standard for browsers I really do
enjoy us going click the tab will go
ahead and close out the browser the next
thing that I really like and this is
quite surprising again from the
BlackBerry device is the cameras the
three megapixel shooter on the front and
the five megapixel shooter on the back
which also shoots Full HD 1080p video is
really nice and aside from shooting very
nice quality images and video the
location is also really good right in
the middle your fingers aren't going to
cover it when you're holding the device
which is very nice so if you're looking
for something that you can use to shoot
pretty decent pictures and pretty
impressive video the playbooks gonna
work out well for you I do wish there
was a LED flash at least have that
option but that is not a giant omission
one other feature isn't really being
mentioned all that much about the
BlackBerry PlayBook
is how it gets charged and it gets
charged via microUSB down there which is
something else that I really like I
don't have a mini or micro HDMI out
cable so I'm not able to test that
functionality but supposedly that also
works very well so those are the things
that I love about the BlackBerry
PlayBook but there are an equal amount
of things that I don't love about the
BlackBerry PlayBook I'm sure you can
guess what some of them are let's go
ahead and jump into the app world here
app support is one of those things that
just isn't quite your yet you can access
some older BlackBerry applications not
necessarily optimized for the travel
interface that you work but there aren't
that many now this is a gripe that's
true with most tablets that are running
a new operating system developers
haven't had access to developer kits and
different api's for quite a bit of time
so there's not going to be an
overpopulation I think there's something
I'll have to get rectified as the
platform and the
whysa matures and also we're going to
have support for Android applications
coming soon which is going to
dramatically increase the number of
applications that are available so while
it's a gripe right now it's launched I
think that will get rectified in the
coming months and probably years as the
operating system and the playbook is
whatever comes out next play but to
probably continues to mature the next
thing this is probably the biggest right
is the lack of missing core
functionality and of course I am talking
about a mail application and a calendar
application there are some bundled
really just web shortcuts here for Gmail
Hotmail Yahoo and AOL I'll just take you
to the web portals for each this is
something that really doesn't help the
rumor that perhaps the PlayBook was
rushed to market now there is bridge
functionality if you have a blackberry
you can pair them up you can't do it
quite yet with 18t but the other
carriers you can access the mail
functionality and calendar functionality
and the data connection but if you don't
use a blackberry you are going to be
losing out on those really necessary
features exec with the Gmail application
just take me to the website and that is
a tremendous omission and that's almost
an unforgivable omission now certainly
that is something that's going to be
rectified very soon but most people who
use a tablet especially me
I need to be able to check my mail and
you fail to hook up to my calendar if
this is a 7 inch size so it's very
portable you don't want to put it in
your pocket and because it's a portable
chances are you're going to want to
input all of your data on it not having
that option not sort of having that
choice to whether or not you want to use
the mail or calendar functionality I
find quite annoying and a huge omission
now again something that will be
rectified very soon and one no longer
need to be a gripe instance this is a
BlackBerry device I'm assuming that's a
mail application that they put on here
will be outstanding so let's go ahead
and move on the next thing that I'm not
the biggest fan of on the PlayBook is
its on-screen keyboard so I'm going to
use the built-in word application this
does ship with Microsoft Office
functionality there's sort of a word to
go PowerPoint to go and this spreadsheet
to go under different names
this probably comes to a gripe from the
size of the screen the seven inches just
doesn't lend itself to much room for
typing it's too small to do typing as
you would on a normal full-size keyboard
like you can on the bias with a nine or
a ten inch screen and it's almost too
big to do very quick thumb typing
comfortably if you do flip it over out
of landscape mode into portrait you
can't thumb type here feels very smart
phone s so the keyboard if you're
looking to put in a lot of information
the on-screen keyboard is not gonna be
the quickest way to do it one thing
however jumping back about things I do
like the cut copy and paste
functionality is quite good on here I'm
gonna go ahead and put some text get out
of selection all right can't slow that
there we go so I go ahead and type
something the quick copy and paste it's
not as elegant and some other operating
systems but it doesn't work very well go
ahead and select you can move that and
you get cut copy and paste and it works
really well
so really did a very nice job with that
the next great thing that I don't
necessarily love about the playbook its
highs into that keyboard and that is the
screen size now this is definitely a
personal preference thing for some the
seven-inch screen might be absolutely
perfect and the absolute ideal size for
me I prefer a little bit of a larger
screen a nine point seven or a 10.1 inch
screen so I recognized that this might
be unique to me the playbook if it was
larger so like I could probably use it
on an everyday basis once there was that
mail and calendar support because it's a
little bit smaller I'm gonna have a hard
time reading a lot of books I don't have
the best eyesight in the world so I
would have really liked a larger screen
real estate well I assume that'll
probably come with updates to other
hardware down the road the next gripe
and this is a huge gripe with the device
is the power and lock button it is that
tiny little guy right there that you
have to if you've got big college you're
gonna hard time pushing you gotta make
sure you hit it and you're going to need
that to lock and unlock the device now
the device is locked right now and
ordinarily to have to find that power
button to unlock it I think goes right
there
there's another way to unlock that uh
but it's not really being talked about
that much if use the gesture area you
swipe to the right that will unlock it
so that mitigates some concerns I prefer
to hit a hardware button just what I'm
used to for locking devices and this one
is very very very small you can
definitely get used to doing the swipe
to unlock type mechanism here which does
make it a bit easier but something to
keep in mind especially if you've got
giant fingers so this has been a full
review of the rim blackberry playbook
there's a lot to love about the PlayBook
I'm very encouraged by the future of the
operating system and the future of the
hardware looks like RIM has really put
together a potential competitor for the
tablet crown but it's not there yet
the lack of core functionality mail and
calendar the lack of app support just
doesn't make it the most ideal tablet
right now however once we have Android
support and you've got that mail and
calendar this really might be one of the
better tablets out there the operating
system's buttery smooth it works well it
handles multitasking better than any
other mobile operating system I've used
it's got a beautiful screen a fantastic
browser and really does bring a lot to
the table so if you are looking to get a
rim blackberry playbook and you can live
with them as limitation for right now
knowing that in the next few months they
will get fixed go ahead and pick one up
and don't have any reservations or
trepidations if you need some of those
features that are missing and you want
to see how the whole tablet market plays
out especially with all these new
Android tablets about the hit you may be
better served waiting so I am John
