from TechnoBuffalo and today we're going
to be taking a quick look at the
steelseries 6gv2 mechanical gaming
keyboard the 6gv2 is a no-nonsense
gaming beast with an inner metal chassis
encased in a thick layer of blackened
plastic the retail price is about a
hundred to one hundred and twenty-five
dollars depending on where you buy it
there's a spring under every single key
as well as a cherry MX black mechanical
switch which actuates under 70 grams of
pressure now that doesn't sound like a
lot but it's actually pretty stiff
although the keys are very responsive
they are non tactile and they don't
click like some other mechanical
keyboards these six gp2 features six
media keys at the top which are
activated by a non-binding SteelSeries
key this replaces the Windows key to
prevent accidental presses while in game
if you're not used to it the keyboard
definitely has some noticeable height
especially if you're compared to some
other flatter models like the Apple
keyboard there are no height adjustment
switches at the back only rubber strips
in each corner to prevent sliding the
6gv2 is a USB keyboard but they also
provide you with a converter you know
just in case
SteelSeries is a really popular brand
for first-person shooter gamers and this
keyboard performance flawlessly for FPS
style gameplay however if you're not
used to the cherry black switches it can
be trickier for real-time strategy games
like Starcraft 2 yeah build that
hatchery after a few gaming sessions I
noticed some fatigue to my fingers from
playing definitely not used to this
different cherry Black Keys the other
functions of keyboard of course is
typing typing on a mechanical keyboard
can only really be compared to typing on
a typewriter the feedback is absolutely
amazing which allows you to type a lot
faster
SteelSeries decided to move the
backslash key next to the question mark
which I found problematic while typing I
suppose this is so that the Enter key
can be enlargen which i guess help
certain styles of gameplay I'm not too
sure about that
remember that SteelSeries key I talked
about this guy is very cumbersome if you
plan on
using this keyboard on Mac OS it cannot
be reconfigured to anything so you're
pretty much stuck without a left alt
option key over all this keyboard is
rock-solid and built to last
if Cherry MX black keys are your thing
you'll definitely dig the 6 GB 2 however
if you're a Mac user you might want to
consider other mechanical options
hopefully you guys enjoyed this video
this was john q from TechnoBuffalo and
i'll see you guys next time
happy gaming</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
