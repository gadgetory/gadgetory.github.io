TechnoBuffalo here I get asked a ton of
what my favorite apple apps are for the
ipod touch for the iphone and for the
ipad thought it would be fun to show me
what applications i actually have loaded
up on my ipad let's get started alright
so the apps that I use on my eye patch
or having an order for when I use the
most a YouTube certainly the built-in
app I do actually a lot of YouTube video
watching before i go to bed usual catch
up and what my subscriptions I've been
doing what people I like to watch I'll
catch up on their videos calculator
certainly the ipad needed one so I do a
lot of calculations so iPad photos it's
pretty stock notes app store Bloomberg
for keeping track of my stock portfolio
Netflix of course for Washington movies
and TV shows on the go it's actually a
great app to haven't checked it out
really worth it you can get even the
smallest Netflix subscription cheb
leaves about 12 or 13 bucks you can act
as a ton of movies ready to go on demand
kind of neat pages for doing word
processing I heard you guys that know
I'm graduate school wasn't time to take
my ipad with me to take notes and having
pages makes it a lot easier when I get
word documents back I can open them up
with page to do some editing a lot more
text editing capabilities and I can't in
just built application I'm sort of with
that theme of school on Numbers and
Keynote sort of apples iWork answer to
excel and powerpoint you can open excel
and powerpoint documents edit then i did
an overview video showing how these
things worked but they are very helpful
my favorite application that i used all
the time while i was on my vacation is
ibooks great for our reading books
certainly it comes free with the eye
patch got give it a download keeping
true with the book seemed and now have a
kindle app on there as well you can
access all of your kindle content it
syncs up with amazon's whispersync
network you pull in all of your page
marks and your books kind of cool
analytics HD this is sort of like google
analytics let's pick your track of
techno Buffalo of stats I can see with
this I doing on it
or weekly basis some people are looking
forward to helping better traffic to
site helps me better help dictate the
content a weather channel app is awesome
what's me tell me what the weather is
only got to know that before you go
outside they just redid a whole
application it's free I'm pretty sweet
eh go ahead and hit local and it'll pull
in your local weather so you last time i
checked it i was in Venice and go ahead
and sort of pull in where you are right
now so in irvine kind of cool all right
moving right along SportsCenter he has
no I'm sports nut this is application it
costs a few bucks where you can set it
to pull in your favorite sports your
team's whatever you'd like you can view
all the ESPN video right from here
however you can also just go to ESPN com
now their videos being preferred for
html5 you can watch the video there so
it sort of gives more of a customized
portal but it's no longer necessary
after ESPN we did their websites ESPN
com visit from the iPad you can choose
either mobile or full and the full
version actually will convert all the
videos for you which is kind of neat so
I use this less and less now go ahead
and exit out of their new york times
editor's choice um big reader of
newspapers so usually in the morning I
read the New York Times and coming up
next to it the wall street journal comes
down to about four bucks a month first
script into the wall street journal I
really handy you should read one or two
articles a day sort of broadens your
horizons and if you think a bit more
globally I've always enjoyed reading The
Wall Street Journal all right moving
down to the bottom sort of the standard
Safari mail my Twitter client of choice
is at twitterrific and if you guys have
seen that this is not the pro version
this is a free version there's a pro
version to animal to account its
advertisements but this one works very
well for me sort of pretty standard I
like these large text on the iPad so
that's what rific settings and calendar
I do all my calendar and stuff too on
the iPad I haven't synced up with google
sync in a google exchange server
essentially google change ever so if i
added a calendar on the ipad of updating
online affected it on my iphone or right
now i'm using the blackberry torch still
sort of always sink so I always have my
updated calendar moving right along
contacts boring iTunes boring I probably
note that is filled runners is
pretty pretty pretty kick-ass tower
defense game a lot of fun i was great on
the iphone and it's pretty much exactly
the same on the ipad but bigger a lot of
fun if you haven't checked it out Words
With Friends words HD it's called right
here essentially Scrabble you can play
online a bunch of buddies I suck at
Scrabble but it's fun to try videos you
guys all know speed test X HD lets me
test network speed so I had to test 18t
and 15 penny more I am helps me get a
better sense of how the network speeds
are run it gives me a better sense of
perspective i'm talking about speeds in
phone videos justin.tv that j TV app
that's actually iphone app that will let
you watch through some live TV shows
maps of course you know jumbo is
actually another calculator big daylight
is actually a countdown timers usually
have to count down days from my wedding
if you go ahead and open this up it'll
show you how many days it's been since
my wedding so there's Rebecca there's
maze been 12 been married for 22 days
which is pretty cool next to go over to
cut up that is a cut head application
lets you trim all your URLs right from
your iPhone iPad or iPod touch you just
put in what you want hit Jordan copy it
and you're done really sort of handy for
cutting your URLs angry birds if you
guys loved angry birds on the iphone or
ipod touch it is just bigger and better
on the ipad Angry Birds menu addiction
and these boots are very very very angry
and the levels are very hard which makes
me angry but the game is just a lot of
fun certainly worth checking out
definitely worth the price i believe
about five bucks ish the next need for
speed shift some driving game ticket van
just miss 3d acceleration and you turn
it like you at normal driving game like
this alright let's go ahead and keep on
moving a Star Wars battles for humph it
is a see there's a theme here it's
another tower defense game takes place
in Star Wars universe and I'm really
showing my geekiness here of my all my
games ABC player once you watch them the
epc concept for those do outside of the
US a TVC is a TV network
it shows they had lost for example and a
few other great shows cloud browse I
haven't really used since I first
demonstrated it but essentially what it
does is it virtualizes or pulls in
another computer's web browser and that
computers getting bowl watching flash
content so technically you can get flash
content on the iPad you can check out
the video i did on cloud browse doesn't
work very well it's kind of slow but
technically it's possible look another
way to get mrs. Barnes &amp;amp; Nobles content
right on to the iPad another way to read
books a good reader i think is a must
must must have on the ipad or leave it's
on my phone as well helps you open up a
ton of different content you might have
trouble with incomes pdfs get a little
weird or documents and Excel things like
that sometimes don't always open very
well a good reader just makes that a lot
easier but 99 cents totally worth it I
am plus this is the lite version so it's
free lets me just use its messaging
clients a i am we'll talk in keauhou and
a few other ones in there as well keep
it moving hulu plus i did get a trial of
hulu plus so i've got that to check out
you guys hopefully found my video
Flipboard which was awesome sort of
aggregates all of your content from your
social networking fees and your RSS and
puts them into a really cool-looking
magazine type thing it's something that
I did a full video on it just really
kind of neat you go ahead and sort of
see what people are doing so in your
Facebook Twitter I've got inside
flipboard's there get some technology I
can sort of see what they're looking at
Twitter people have posted a link to
something Twitter it shows up that whole
link will show up as a magazine page go
ahead and open up here you can see that
someone shared a 18t article you can go
through and sort of see all the cool
stuff that Maya friends and followers
have shared on Twitter go ahead and back
out of that Facebook that is actually
the iphone facebook application so you
got to zoom in i don't use it very often
other than just for uploading pictures
usually if I want to use facebook on the
ipad i'll just use the facebook website

totally what time it is not all
