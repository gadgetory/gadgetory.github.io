TechnoBuffalo I just want to show you an
example of NOC code from LG and how it
works so really it's a it's a software
feature meant for unlocking the phone
instead of a pattern or a pin and
actually it does use a pattern but a
little differently so right now the
phone is locked right so then if I want
to unlock it I have one two three four
okay so that's the setup that they've
used here for dock code and that's that
can be applied inside the settings let's
see if we can get that up
select lock screen and so here is where
you would put the pattern now we're
sticking with the one-two-three-four
that's the current one and then you
would decide which one you want so we're
gonna go to knock good again and you
would set the new code I'm gonna keep it
like this it's a demo and I don't want
to walk everybody out but then you would
be all set so then every time the phone
is unlocked or locked rather say you say
you set the codes a 1 2 3 4 back that
way then that would unlock obviously
that's the wrong code at 1 2 3 4 it's
the correct one and it unlocks the phone
so a pretty sweet feature and hopefully
we see it on more of LG's devices I
think it's pretty unique and it's also
really easy to do with one hand you saw
me do it just now as opposed to say some
of the larger screens where you might
have to stretch around for a pattern so
1 2 3 4 it can be done really anywhere
on the screen as long as it's in a
general area so it's not like it has to
be exact anywhere as long as it's in the
specific quadrant in any case this is
Todd Hazleton with TechnoBuffalo and I
just showed you
