video maybe it's like a Tuesday or like
it's Saturday afternoon whatever day it
is it's a good day to win the latest
phone from Apple you teamed up the folks
from Kingston to let you win a 64 gig
iPhone 10 or if you want an iPhone 8 or
and I have Phone 8 plus but the 10 looks
to be where it's at any new Apple iPhone
under a thousand bucks you can win here
the dates right right here the giveaways
going to be happy we made it super
simple if you want to enter open to
anyone on this planet so as long as you
live presumably on earth you are going
to be good to go
hit the link down below good article on
TechnoBuffalo comm you you're entering
over there
I never thinking to yourself sounds like
a pretty good deal John thank you but 64
gigs is not enough for my gigantic photo
library folk to Kingston have you
covered with the bolts available in 32
64 128 you also have got the 128 one
here and I'm gonna throw one of these in
for the winner so you can also win a 128
gigabyte bolt but this is gonna do let
you back up your photo and pictures like
stupid simply so plug it in you'll
download an app and the app they made it
just do one thing only it backs up your
photos and videos you could take
pictures directly onto the bolt or video
directly onto the bulbs you can choose
different photos or folders that you
want to backup directly onto the bolts
to keep and use the bolts with other iOS
devices like wife's iPhone or your iPad
plug it in you are good to go it's
really thin too so the iPhone is going
to sit flat send me the camera humph
doesn't make a wobble but the bolt is
not going to make it wobble my iPhoto
library right now since it around 17
gigs it's a huge chunk of my iPhone
storage so the bolt makes it really easy
I think cloud storage has a place but if
you are on an airplane don't have
internet connection or you somewhere
where and that's not working you're not
working fast enough you lose access to
that stuff you gotta throw something
like this really small in your bag your
pocket this makes it really easy it's
also a great way to stave off maybe you
have an upgrade this year you got your
eye on the iPhone for next year now
thing you don't have to upgrade your
phones running out of storage space pick
up a bolt throw all your photos on it
you are good to go again when any iPhone
you want under a thousand bucks but
probably you should pick the 64 gig
iPhone 10 that's that's when I would
pick we'll send you the unlocked version
so doesn't matter where you live I'll
have all the radios in it linked down
below to go your article on checking out
Buffalo comm to enter then get a
Kingston and legitimately badass bolts
so next time
John render TechnoBuffalo good luck
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
