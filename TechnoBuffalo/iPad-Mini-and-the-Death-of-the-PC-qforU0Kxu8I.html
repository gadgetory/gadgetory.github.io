to you by goto meeting welcome back to
another episode of ask the buffalo this
to show where you could ask me John
Rhett injure any question you've got
from the wide wide were the technology
don't know what phone to get not your
tablet you can pick up don't know what
mobile operating system is right for you
this is the place we could ask all damn
questions up this week we're gonna talk
about the rumored iPad Mini we're gonna
talk about the Microsoft Surface or talk
a little bit about what's in the future
for TechnoBuffalo and a lot of stuff in
between this is asked to Buffalo let's
go ahead an get start first question
comes from user Josh who asks hey John
you think the iPad Mini will get the
widescreen form factor the iPhone 5 or
the same form as a nine point seven inch
iPad Josh it's a great question I would
expect that the new iPad Mini is gonna
share similar dimensions to the larger
nine point seven inch iPad meaning four
by three aspect ratio so get used to
seeing black bars on the top black bars
on the bottom I think the iPad Mini is
going to follow the same cycle as the
regular sized iPad I think wants a
regular sized iPad or new iPad goes
widescreen I think the next generation
iPad Mini will follow that same path we
are gonna see though the lighting
connector in there in a few other
differences not sure if we're gonna have
a Retina display that one is still sort
of up in the air but from a dimension
standpoint I still expect it to be four
by three user four hard Mohammed asked
hey John do you think the iPad Mini is a
good idea if so what do you think will
set it apart from the current iOS
devices so that's a great question
whether that's a good idea
only the folks of Cupertino can answer
that I will say it's a bit of
interesting products when Apple unveiled
the original iPad they really weren't
that made up of competitors out there
Microsoft had tablets certainly but as
far as the internet and the palm of your
hand and the ease of use there wasn't
anything like the iPad when was first
announced it was a revolutionary product
same thing with the iPhone there were
plenty of other phones did a lot of
different things but there wasn't
anything that optimized touch in the
same way that the iPhone did really
ushered in the age of capacitive
touchscreens and they were leading the
way sort of through that path the same
isn't so true though with the iPad Mini
there are a lot of 7-inch tablets out
there 7.5 inch tablets in there so Apple
is entering a crowded market they're not
creating their own market like they had
before us whether or not it's gonna be
success
really determined I think based on what
the competition does I really need to
pay an extra one hundred two hundred
dollars for an Apple device of the same
size or you can pick up a nexus 7 it
does the same thing it's gonna be a bit
of a tough sell based on that pricing
scheme especially when you consider iPod
Touch at $300 you're not really sure
where this iPad Mini is gonna fit in
price-wise I'm inclined to believe
though we're gonna see an 8 gigabyte
model come in at 250 bucks to make it a
sort of a close competition with the
Nexus 7 from business model standpoint
it could be quite interesting as Steve
Jobs in Wall Street as extends biography
I asked him about cannibalizing your own
products and he said it's better to
cannibalize yourself than have your
competitors do it for you so while
Apple's having a giant pack take away
from sales of the larger iPad yes
absolutely
but lease that money staying inside of
Apple and the iPad Mini is really just a
gateway into the App Store where Apple
makes it absolutely killing so if you
think even take a loss on an iPad Mini
which I doubt they will isn't gonna make
it back in spades and applications that
are bought to the App Store so ever
price it aside to charge for it that
really is yet to be seen but I do think
it's probably gonna end up making Apple
boatloads of cash user Seba asks hey Jon
do you think the new surface RT tablets
will cause the death of the PC that's a
great question actually I think quite
the opposite I think it might be the
rebirth of the PC we are really at a
paradigm shift and what paradigm means
it's sort of a new way a new aspect of
doing something and I think we're seeing
really a shift on how people interact
with computers certainly tablets like
the iPad sort of ushered in the wave of
tablets they're limited as far as what
they can do they were great for media
consumption not so great for media
creation things like the Microsoft
Surface and Windows 8 al was taking that
one step further so you get the same
benefits you get of a device like the
iPad or an Android tablet meaning you
could browse the web you can check your
email you could run a full Microsoft
Office suite
you could run full applications you can
run full desktop applications right on
your tablet you could throw on life the
surface for example the touch keyboard
and you can have a full
laptop with you anywhere you want to go
see if the full power of a PC when you
need it and the tablet capabilities when
you want it so the think it's gonna kill
the PC no absolutely not I do think
though there's gonna be a lot of
struggle with getting used to Windows 8
folks that aren't so tech savvy and are
used to windows looking the same way for
every generation are really gonna be
thrown back when they get Windows 8
especially if they're upgrading on older
computer doesn't have a touchscreen
we're using the modern UI can be a bit
unintuitive without your finger so I
think there's definitely going to be a
bit of reticence from perhaps an older
raishin of Windows users who are really
not sure Windows 8 is going to be but I
think once they get new hardware and
hardware that's equipped with a
touchscreen there should be a higher
adoption as a long convoluted way of
answering your question I hope that
helps that's great stuff John but I'm
gonna take some time to thank our
wonderful friends at go-to meeting
meetings are essential to the way we
work it's an opportunity for different
voices to be heard
share ideas problem-solve and develop
creative solutions but if your team is
spread out to different locations coming
together can be an impossible task
unless of course you use goto meeting
with HD faces the powerfully simple way
to meet and collaborate with clients and
co-workers online a great example of
online collaboration for us that
TechnoBuffalo would be to cover big
events like the iPad Mini event where we
can all come online together and say
okay you can make this article I'll
cover this story you can make this image
I'll make this video tools like
GoToMeeting are invaluable for stuff
like that no matter where everyone is
located goto meeting allows you to share
the same screen making it easy to be on
the same page and with built-in HD video
conferencing you can see each other face
to face so it's easy to launch or join a

g-dog asks hey John when is the new
TechnoBuffalo redesign coming what is it
going to be like so we are in the late
stages of testing what I'm calling
TechnoBuffalo 3.0 I would hope that
we'll see it sometime before the end of
the year so before 2013 TechnoBuffalo
3.0 will be here it's gonna bring a lot
of really neat features but the best
thing that it's doing and things you're
not gonna see cause it's a complete
redesign from code based zero we a lot
of bloated code in a website does you
have using tactile Buffalo from day one
feel that we initially launched we have
two sub blogs where users could create
their own blogs we had a social network
built in a lot of outdated code Pecha
Buffalo 3.0 is doing we are starting
from scratch we're starting from no code
at all no plugins nothing and built that
sucker right up but it's also coming
with a huge redesign for how information
is gonna be presented and sometime in
2013 later on and might even seem
dedicate
apps for TechnoBuffalo but a lot of cool
things are in store for how you can
interact ways you can view content if
stay on an Apple event day you don't
want to see any Apple content you can go
ahead and view content just focus on
Android or filter out content you can do
all kinds of really cool stuff that you
couldn't do before and really excited to
be able to share it with you guys so
that's it for this episode of ask the
Buffalo I'm your host John Rhett enger'
