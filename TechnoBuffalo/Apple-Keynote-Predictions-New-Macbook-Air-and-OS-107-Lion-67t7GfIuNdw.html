TechnoBuffalo here we are rocking an
old-school john for lakers camera angle
i'm still traveling but i just got word
that apple is hosting a media event I
back to mac media event on October 20th
at 10am and their Cupertino headquarters
and I want to talk to you about what I
expected what I think we're going to see
from this media event so ignore the
blinking lights over there right behind
my head there and let's go ahead and get
started alright so let's start with some
of the obvious Apple makes many products
other than mobile it seems like the
mobile gets view lion's share of the
attention on the logo put a picture of
it right now there is a little picture
of a lion peeking through the side which
is presumably supposed to be a sneak
peek at the next version of Apple's
desktop software OS 10.7 now before you
think it's going to be shipping next
week we saw a sneak preview of 10.6 snow
leopard almost a year before finally hit
our computer so presumably this is going
to be the same thing as far as feature
those four 10.7 no one really knows
right now it really just be general
speculation but look for us to finally
get a chance to see with the next
generation a desktop software and
operating system is going to look like
probably the big highlight of this event
is going to be in the portable computer
lines presumably the macbook air they've
been rumors of 11.6 11.7 inch panels
floating around for a while that are
going to be part of this completely
redesigned macbook air a few weeks ago
Apple started to pull the super drives
from the shelves for the current macbook
air leading to speculation either this
will have optical media built in which
sound very apple style for for a macbook
air line or they're going to completely
do away with the CD ROM which and DVD
ROM which probably wouldn't be the best
move we're going to see a complete
redesign of how the device looks
presumably with two to three USB ports
and perhaps finally first time we're
going to see actual HD webcam built into
the macbook air line hopefully this
macbook air i'll take the design cues
from rest of the line give us
the black bezel around the screen and
the full multi-touch trackpad without
the physical button are you guys excited
about a new macbook air is 11.6 inch 11
inch screen in general too small for you
guys maybe the sweet spot and sort of be
apples almost netbook almost certainly
at a premium price the rest of the
laptop line is also due for a little bit
of an update especially the macbook air
are in sorry the macbook pro line
probably just a speck refresh of the
core line you know perhaps the new core
right through your core i5s and the
macbook air will presumably be powered
by a new core i3 ultra low voltage
processor which certainly should up the
speed from the long in the tooth current
core2duo chips hey guys want to give you
sort of a quick recap of what I expect
us to see and what I think we're going
to see are you guys excited about
updates to the macbook pro new MacBook
Airs to see OS 10.7 I think OS 10.7 is
probably what I'm most excited about
want to hear what you guys have to see
you agree/disagree I am jon rettinger
from technobuffalo be sure to stay tuned
for live updates from the apple media
event which again will be the October
20th at 10am of course we'll be doing
you know minute by minute sort of as it
goes updates and we guys I will see you
in the next video bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
