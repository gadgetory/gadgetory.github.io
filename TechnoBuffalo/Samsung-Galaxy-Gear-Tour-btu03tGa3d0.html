technobuffalo checking out samsung
galaxy gear smartwatch is going through
a bunch of features
got that one point six inch super amoled
display to get control your music and
everything like that and then let's go
around the watch a little bit going down
you've got the 1.9 megapixel camera
right there very good focus for you the
strap should fit a bunch of wrists we
had somebody in Berlin testing it and
that's actually one of the speaker's
complete andhra microphones rather
really it took a nice metal face here to
comment six colors day in peace get shot
again and then nothing up top there
let's get the screen active again
there's only one button right here for
the left hand side there tap that that
activates the same make sure something
does because he were going through
serving it's hard to grab the super
animal and I can with a clock I'll show
that word can go through the different
phases there and show how it appears
change your sound whether you want to
Barbara okay great for running up
there's the weather no too funny it's
like when they like voicemails best boys
between there's a gala get stuff in us
so you can show the pictures that you've
taken on your note 3 this is designed
yes far too like everything I believe
turnips or something else that's why I
think the double tub percent of this
forest on right the two fingers quickly
brings you that status man using about
GT battery life town and options like
that at real quick just to make it let's
compare it to double copy
the nearest so there's a comparison of
how it looks next to the pebble as well
you can see that Samsung has got a much
nicer design it's got the color screen
obviously while this is just a Yank
display and this is sort of plastic and
she feeling samsung's is a lot nicer
anyway quick look at the galaxy gear
from Samsung next to the pebble this is
