technobuffalo here's a full review for
you of the HTC aria from AT&amp;amp;T wireless
so as I like to begin all my phone
reviews no matter what a phone can do or
can't do it's not going to serve its
primary purpose if it can't make phone
calls so let's talk about color quality
call Claude it on the Aria as it
generally the case with all HTC bills
phones is outstanding I actually
experienced no dropped calls as soon as
my daily driver for for many many days
call quality was very solid I had no
white noise on my end o crackling her
pops or snap and I also didn't have
anything on the other end of the call
when I had people call me from the
device so call quality was very very
very good again as we've come to expect
from HTC so no worries there so let's
talk about this size this device first I
will talk about sort of the specs it is
a very small screen clock mean a 3.2
inches the thing is downright diminutive
and if you look at it next to some other
phones you can really appreciate it sort
of the size so here it is next to the
iphone 4 for example you can see that
there is definitely a difference if you
bring in some of the larger phones you
can clearly see a difference here we
have the droid x for example i mean
which takes up the whole top part of the
camera this phone is very small and i
think has a really really nice place and
a good niche in 18 keys lineup it's got
a 600 megahertz processor which is by no
means are gonna set any speed records
but it is very very very capable 600
megahertz processor and phone this size
is really aimed i think squarely at the
traveler or the light business user when
i was traveling this is a great phone to
bring with me doesn't take up much space
maybe we'll do everything that I needed
to do and the phone didn't show a single
sign of slow down a battery life fauna
is extremely strong it's packed me
twelve hundred million power battery
you're going to get six hours of
talktime and about three hundred and
seventy-two hours on standby time so
let's talk about some specs a little bit
more this is an android 2.1 device quite
obviously with HTC skin on top of it
called sense which adds a lot of
functionality and you are getting full
android too
what one we really one glaring exception
you don't have live wallpapers here so
if that was a concern for you that you
had to have you gotta have the mario
wallpaper the area is not going to be
the best advice but if you can live
without the live wallpapers are you
really going to get a very very nice a
well-rounded a full-featured phone so
let's back up a little bit and talk
about the screen a bit more it is an LCD
it's got a resolution of 320 x 480 so
it's a TFT screen case you were
wondering it's got a hundred three
megabytes of onboard memory but it's
going to come with a 2 gigabyte microSD
card and of course you can put in
whatever size card you want up to 32
gigs really up the storage now don't be
fooled by the small size of the phone as
I was I expected sort of subpar
performance I what I got was a phone
that really step for step kept up with
the more powerful android devices
certainly if I didn't have many
applications writing the background if I
just had two or three things running if
I had email and web browser this thing
was just as fast as the Snapdragon
processors it was when I start to have
many many many applications open I
notice a difference so if you're looking
for a sort of a budget fast phone this
really is a great choice the browser is
full-featured and actually does play
flash content it's got multi-touch so
you can certainly pinch and zoom and do
what you like I don't plan on watching
any hulu on here though you're not going
to get that but sort of for general
content the web browser does work really
really nicely so backing up one of the
concerns that i had look at the phone
sort of this size how is a keyboard to
make sure you guys are the keyboard
looks like on the HTC re n so you can
see if it's a concern or not so it is
HTC skinny keyboard that's not the stock
android keyboard you can see the
accelerometer sort of kicking in right
there typing on this is sort of a mixed
bag the first day that i used it i was
completely inaccurate words didn't even
make sense and that is even with
androids outstanding autocorrect feature
actually found myself relying on the
text-to-speech to do most by typing
however after using it for a few days i
got much better with it the keyboard is
gonna be something you're going to have
to get used to because the phone is so
small i noticed when you type your
fingers you're going to take up a lot of
space it's a bit better in landscape it
certainly it's a bit easier to serve
I've been navigate here but now using it
in porter it's going to take some
getting used to I've also enough said in
many videos I'm not the biggest fan of
capacitive buttons on the bottom
generally the not start responsive not
so with the re ethic HTC may have fixed
some of their issues the capacitive
buttons here were very very very well I
had really no issues one button that I
really never used at all but it does
have in case you're wondering is this
track pad which you can use serve scroll
from screen to screen or scroll through
applications I can push it in if you
want to select it's nice to have I
suppose but I really haven't had much
need for it this is capable of playing
really almost any of the games that you
like from the android marketplace so if
you've got your concern to that aspect
no need to worry like I said it overall
it's just a nice package in a nice phone
it's got a five megapixel sensor on the
back does not have an LED flash but you
are going to get served HTC's
outstanding photo options let me show
you really quickly what those are
because camera quality was actually
pretty good and again I expected much
less from a phone this size and really
was pleasantly surprised you guys to
probably see me demonstrate this camera
stuff quite a bit but you get a lot of
options here so certainly take the video
as well you can choose your brightness
or white balance you can choose all
kinds of different options if you like
four different effects grayscale sepia a
negative I really a ton of other things
to pick out whatever makes a picture
look best for you this does our record
video and a VGA resolution which is you
know not too bad it's going to get the
job done before you need but again for a
phone that's sort of gonna cost you
about 130 bucks all you are getting a
lot of bang for your buck and if you're
an Android fan on a teen scene you're
not looking for a huge screen but if
almost really going to do everything and
fit nicely in your pocket that aria is
going to be a tough phone to beat
