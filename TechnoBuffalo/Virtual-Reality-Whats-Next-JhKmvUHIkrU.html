lips of most tech enthusiasts it's how
much you hate iOS and/or Android and
virtual reality you can't go any or
about virtual reality being thrown at
you it is the buzzword du jour and it's
still very much in its infant stages but
each year the best and brightest in the
VR world meet in downtown Los Angeles
elebrate the greatest in VR at VRLA so
since it's in our backyard we decided to
check it out although I still think VRLA
should be able to just strap on a
virtual reality headset and go while
sitting in your chair we're not quite
there yet as virtual reality matures
there was a huge push early on to make
the visual stunning if it didn't look
good you weren't gonna believe that
you're actually there an audio is mostly
just strapped on a pair of headphones
but now VR audio was coming and that was
a huge emphasis at the show so what is
VR audio so as you're watching this
video turn your head to the left and
you're gonna hear the audio kind of
strong around your right ear turn the
other way over here coming stronger out
of your left ear that's what companies
are trying to simulate so when you pair
this new VR audio with VR videos it
creates the really immersive experience
that we've always imagined a virtual
reality could be so the biggest name in
sound was there to showcase VR audio and
that was of course Dolby they're trying
to bring their add most technology to
the virtual reality world if you ever
been to a theater that has Dolby Atmos
you'll know how drastically different
that sounds doable once you have that
same experience that you put on your
headphones and strap on the goggles but
Dobby wasn't the only folks there
Skullcandy was also there with a huge
presence they filled the new crusher VR
a headphone of course be our eighth
inning for virtual reality audio these
have been designed entirely with virtual
reality in mind they've got custom
drivers designed by Skullcandy to
deliver haptic bass the intensity can be
controlled through the passive touchpad
on the side of the ear cup and when they
eventually come to market at some point
they're also gonna feature pretty badass
battery life for 29 hours rechargeable
battery and be totally Wireless they had
a really cool demonstration to show it
off
they had VR audio that we visualized
showing the power of the headphones
still development when they come out
they should retail for around 300 bucks
of course if you want us to test them
let us know and we'll put him through
the paces
so aside from D our audio there's a ton
of other really cool stuff to see
Skullcandy was also hosting the world's
first vr rave
J was performing using a virtual reality
interface developed by the way VR so
instead of just picking on some records
or hitting playing a playlist it was all
done using virtual reality if you wanted
to get even more into the rave you can
put on a backpack that was synced if the
music's you could actually feel the bass
and experience the visuals through VR
headsets that you wore as well and they
also have a gigantic LED display behind
a DJ but hands down the coolest thing
that we saw was mine rides air flow
flight simulator if you ever watched
like Superman and you've been like damn
I wish I could fly like that they
suspended you midair Mission Impossible
style made fans blowing all over you put
an oculus headset and you pretty much
took flight you could zoom around
mountains it's just an incredible
experience that for me showcase the best
of what virtual reality could be if you
like your domes either big iron or
thunder you'll be pretty happy with what
HP and Radeon did the NS here did 60
degree projector dome and it's exactly
what it sounds like they invited
everyone to lay down on a beanbag kick
up your feet relax and look up at the
short film that's a pretty famous artist
Android Jones created it looked like you
were going through a nebula then a
dragon appeared looks like you took a
lot of things that are probably illicit
and illegal and then you walked out to
the real world
so virtual reality is super cool but
vert reality right now requires you to
be tethered into a computer or wires to
be somewhere a company called dr arcade
which they are showing off a completely
wireless VR system a demo kind of an old
western style game where you could just
shoot bad guys they popped up it design
different places like arcades those are
still a thing that exists you've been
family entertainment centers which I
don't know those exist anymore that's
probably just sitting on the couch it's
a ton of other really cool stuff at the
r-la and they had a 3d LED TV they had
ten developer showing off at the future
of VR is going to be and when I left
he's gotten to my real life car and
drove home a real-life world which I
could strap on a headset fly watch a
dragon nebula
guy and just relaxing for triology so we
are super new and still very strange to
experience what do you guys think about
the yard you think it really is the
future is it gonna go the way of 3d TVs
like oh that's something cool that I'm
never going to buy it looks like VR
seems to be here to stay but I want to
know your thoughts on it if you are a VR
fan and mash that thumbs up button and
let us know I am John Randy from
TechnoBuffalo and I will virtually see
in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
