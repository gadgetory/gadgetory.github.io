search engines for just about everything
nowadays for our information for spell
check at least in my case for maps but
they'd also tell you a lot about people
in general and you can play sort of a
fun game with some of the most popular
search engines out there when you start
typing something into google for example
automatically populates what most people
are looking for and start with that so I
thought it could be fun to sort of do a
little bit of a well a game of sort to
see what people are looking at let's
start with some pretty simple search
topics let's start with I like the first
thing that comes up is I like to take my
thumbs to my hands and see what it would
like to be a dinosaur I like turtles
I like to think of Jesus Jesus as a
mischievous badger I like it rough
lyrics there's a lot of very funny
things here that that happen I like to
make myself believe - planet Earth turns
slowly I mean these are what people are
really searching for let's take a look
at a few other ones that are quite
interesting is he is either one easy
cheating easy into me is hell exothermic
or endothermic is hepatitis C contagious
is herpes curable so out of these few
you know is he to have to deal with STDs
and one of them is just funny so let's
get rid of the heat part let's just see
what people are searching for word just
is let's see we've got is lady gaga a
man um that's a good question
let's take a look at a few other ones
here that are quite funny when when is
they like same things 2009 alright that
makes sense
when will I die when is Labor Day when
is Easter when does daylight savings end
when does the hangover come out on DVD
already has one is Thanksgiving Day 2009
when does New Moon come out really shows
you people's priorities here it's mostly
just DVDs let's take a look at a few
other let's try when will so we've got
when will I die again when will Verizon
get the iPhone another one when will I
die Windows 7 h1n1 vaccine one will I
get married another one for the
on the iPhone and when will I feel my
baby move my case probably never so
Google is a fun want to play around I
think you should do this on your own and
see some words and let me know what you
find leave a video comments or text
comments let me know what you guys see
that's sort of fun let's take a look at
Bing since being is also a pretty
popular search engine let's take a look
at some of these similar ones
let's try I want I want to hit the
Potamus for Christmas I want to die I
want this forever lyrics so that many
people are searching for
I want a hippopotamus for Christmas
alright let's take a look at I lost I
lost my social security card I lost my
passport I lost on Jeopardy
so I'm nothing terribly funny there this
just a fun game I like to play whenever
I have a few minutes and I'm bored sure
to thought I'd share with you guys
and see what you guys find I'm really
curious like I said before leave a video
response or a text comment sort of
curious what you guys come up with
that's funny and we guys hope you
enjoyed this sort of silly video and
I'll see you in the next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
