to you by godaddy what's up everyone and
welcome back to their pisode of renter's
riffs the show or I take anything from
the world technology that's going on and
we chat about it this week I finally had
a chance after all these years to go to
comic-con I'm doing this for emphasis
I've always wanted to go of always read
about I've always watch trailers always
watch to leave trailers avoid read all
the comics and I finally got to go and
it was super exciting so you ever wanted
to go to comic-con one of your someone's
first experiences keep watching so first
of all registering for comic-con is
crazy difficult we register for a ton of
trade shows that any star difficulty
whatsoever but getting in for comic-con
is like a whole other beast we had a pre
registers press like six months in
advance we had to send in letters on
letterhead and prove that we were press
it was a whole deal but we finally got
approved and all was good at the world
so we go down to San Diego for comic-con
we took the train down there were just
about a two-hour train ride down from
Orange County I don't know to expect I
was expecting like CES but just with
comics so first we get down there poop
the train this is get to a train station
there are people in costumes and you see
all the pictures of everybody in cosplay
and it is like that everywhere you go
people ranging of all body styles and
shapes to got men and women of just in
various stages of dress and undress
walking around just walking around San
Diego which is also very weird so he
finally got into Comic Con and I
expected just giant hog after Hall of
stuff turns out it's really just kind of
one major hall where all this stuff is
and it's called comic-con but all the
comic book stuff all accomplished
benders in the storage are kind of like
shunned in the corner which was very
weird but they had just thousands and
thousands and thousands thousands of
comics of everyone you could think of
even named he's never heard of there was
a conic I saw of a guy who super here it
was he could pick up his limbs and throw
it that is not a joke it was a thing and
I saw it absolutely bizarre they've got
things that are in slabs and comic books
out everywhere people are just talking
about nerd things in fact we can to talk
about nerd thing if you listen while
you're there you look here absolutely
crazy crazy stuff the weirdest thing I
heard one of the most nerdy things I
heard
there are people talking about the new
daredevil series on Netflix and no joke
this is the voice I'm not making this up
with you a nerd say okay this is the
voice that I heard you're not really
hoping to daredevil cure used on netflix
too true the first material and that
daredevil does get his powers from a
radioactive post that follows on his
back and get rid of a dye site I really
hope to do that right and that was just
an example of the stuff you hear it is
awesome there's not been a better time
in the world to be a geek than right now
I'm 34 years old I'm not that far
removed from the middle school high
school ages but now if your geek in that
aid you are like the coolest and it is
awesome to see so Comic Con has worked
from being just about the comic so I
went with her editor-in-chief shot on it
who back used to run a comic book
shop I used to go all the time in the
nine years when it was just about the
comics and now it's sort of more about
the movies and the paraphernalia I go
along you know with comics a lot of
anime stuff there and a lot of other
things I didn't know what was that goes
along with anime but sort of all about
the movie that's sort of prevailing
everywhere if you want to get into all
these panels you see they showed a
trailer for season 5 of The Walking Dead
you want to talk to the folks that are
in Avengers age of Ultron oh you pretty
much have to camp out like four days in

the funny thing also about comic-con
would day we were there which is on
Wednesday there was a ton of movie news
coming out because you've got that many
people in a small area cell phones don't
really work so despite being at
comic-con I got almost zero movie news &amp;amp;
0 comic news that was going on marvel
announced a sequel to guardians of the
galaxy and I had no idea so it's kind of
ironically when you're at comic-con you
don't know what's going on in the world
of comic con the people walk around in
costumes again are absolutely awesome we
did a whole gallery of comic-con i'll
put a link to it down below if you want
to check out all the ppl with pictures
people in costumes
people just walking around all the Lego
stuff that was there it was absolutely
awesome to see comic-con was not what I
expected which was not say that was a
bad thing I expected just huge sprawling
displays comics everywhere I expected to
see celebrities walking around expected
the panels easy to get into and maybe it
was just my naivete but that's not what
it was it was packed in that one hall I
mean his shoulder to shoulder I with
people and on one side it might have a
guy dressed up like dr. doom the other
side you've got like sexy spider girl
next to you I was just kind of cool to
see and it just was a lot of fun you
ever have a chance the opportunity go to
comic-con I totally recommend it make
the trip if you're not in California at
San Diego wedding is one of the biggest
beautiful spots the entire country so
it's a cool place to go for a vacation
but go there an experienced if you can
it is absolutely awesome to behold the
pictures in the gallery don't do the
whole thing justice but if you want to
live a little bit of vicariously checked
it out it was cool to see the melding of
tech and comics there were so many
companies that using oculus to sort of
given immersive experience to what they
were trying to show and this was really
cool when I kind of my inner nerd my
inner like 14 year old Otis reviews to
sit and read comics and you know in
shame upstairs it's kind of proud and
came back and just turn late meal I'm
just fun to be alive right now it's just
really cool guy though p enjoy episode
