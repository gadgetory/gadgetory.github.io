with TechnoBuffalo today we have a very
exciting day despite the hurricane
that's raging outside it's Windows Phone
8x this is from HTC it's big Windows
Phone day there's nothing to see on the
box but let's unbox it anyway so big day
for Microsoft they're discussing today
Windows Phone 8 this is the 8 x1 of the
flagship devices that will launch here's
what's in the box
you've got the charger a set of
headphones standard HTC fair and then
the wall mount there let's power up the
device because that's where it gets
exciting right ok so here we are you can
see the front face here that's a 4.3
inch display it's Gorilla Glass 2 on the
back you've got an 8 megapixel camera
with LED flash here's the Micro SIM port
it just sort of you could pop it out
with a nail but you can also just up tap
something in like a pin pop it out
volume keys here they lay really flush
with the surface of the phone you can
actually see that there it's really hard
to see even from the angles there you go
on the other version of this phone it'll
launch in the neon yellow or red and a
blue 2 those are the same color as the
body so it's always kind of buried like
that here's the camera quick launch key
just hold that down microUSB charger on
the bottom Beats Audio of course you've
got a little speaker grille here
3.5 millimeter headphone jack up top
front-facing camera that is a wide-angle
lens it's a 2.1 megapixel camera can
also record 1080p video and then of
course you've got the the grill there in
the windows buttons here let's get it
powered on you can see it's already
attracting fingerprints that has been so
this is already powered up I already set
it up because otherwise you guys would
be sitting here watching you just sort
of log in everything so okay so that
just showed it Sunday I'm filming this
video in advance of the storm tomorrow
in case my electricity goes out in any
case here you go this is the new home
screen that was a funny picture of me so
in any case you can now resize any
widget on the home screen so let's say
we want the New York Times one to be
bigger we can just pop it out like that
and leave it whereas we can also make it
small now same goes for these larger
widgets up top so or live tiles I should
say you can push that in
or you can you can make it smaller so in
the space where you had four logos or
four apps before say or one app before
you can now have four or more than that
so here we go one two three four five
six seven eight in the screen that this
takes up so there you go and now if we
wanted we could take more real estate of
everything so that's what's awesome
about Windows Phone eight from the
get-go is that it's much faster this has
a 1.5 gigahertz Snapdragon s4 processor
and it's highly customizable we'll go
through here you can see it's the same
as before the menu but there are a
couple new things here music and videos
now instead of Zune Microsoft has
already done that office of course and
OneNote great applications for syncing
and staying in sync up to the cloud
storing with the cloud and store now so
before it was called the Windows Phone
Marketplace now it's the store and go
through here same apps that you've seen
before right so I haven't seen much new
here in terms of like we don't have
Instagram right now yet or some of the
games are kind of math in my opinion I'm
hoping now that we have much more
powerful processors on board then we
have dual core support and Windows Phone
8 then we actually get those apps that
we've been looking for for a long time
in any case so what you'd expect here
let's dig back into settings now okay so
here whoops
went to emails in accounts of course
that's the same as before for the most
part now you can change the color of the
homescreen so if we wanted to say go
with this bright red color well actually
that's an older color so it's uh let's
show you I don't know this lime green
one or even this olive here the home
screen you see it's all brand new here
let's get this one back out cuz I like
it big it's all olive quick color change
you can also of course change light and
black backgrounds but those are still
the only two colors let's see our hues I
should say while it's new I actually
don't want to show too much because I
have my own card set up on here but here
in any case if you have say a debit card
or anything you want it'll add that if
it's ever been stored or used to
purchase anything from Microsoft but you
can also add
your own cards so let's see a deal name
okay so this is if you had like a deal
nearby and you wanted to make sure you
take advantage of it you just manually
enter so blockbuster Delta this isn't
actually working properly right now and
I'm not sure why it says open app Delta
miles there's not one yet and actually
when I was trying to do this earlier it
kept adding information from my bank
account instead of Delta so I'm assuming
Microsoft will address this today or
Monday rather and go over everything
more detail and release the apps that
work with this but right now it's not
fully functional so let's get to the
camera now you don't want just a shot of
my table here's the remote
so we'll take a picture eight megapixel
camera now by default I believe it goes
to five and that's just to get the right
I put it on eight earlier okay goes to
six by default so it sort of takes up
all the real estate of your screen
unlike the One X you don't get the
rapid-fire I mean it's pretty quick but
it's still kind of trying to save unlike
the One X ray like Bam Bam Bam Bam rapid
fire mode other features here you can
change of course the effects that allows
you to go sepia or grayscale you've also
got the resolution that I already showed
you contrast saturation sharpness the
ISO and face detection a pretty good
camera I just find that the iPhone 5s
camera took much better shots in a lot
of scenarios especially late at night
out on the streets the lamps all had
this weird glow to them from the One X
or from the Windows Phone 8 X rather as
opposed the iPhone fiber was just more
natural and the colors looked a lot
better so in people now there are rooms
so before you've always had what's new
recent you know everything like that you
can see I talked to my mom she's
concerned about this one so now we have
what's called the family room or buddies
you can add your own so you have your
chat now I don't have any more Windows
Phone 8 devices so I actually can't talk
about too much of how this works because
I just can't test it until we get more
but then you have a calendar so
everybody can share the same calendar
you've got photos you can just upload a
photo so that everybody or a video so
everybody can see them in your
shopping this one's pretty cool notes so
so you got to go go get milk eggs and
bread for Mom
let's make sure that shows there you go
the screen is pretty bright or you can
create a new note you know hi whatever
and that of course stays in sync because
it's one notices in sync with your
SkyDrive so just the members chat
calendar notes really cool new feature I
hope this takes off of course you have
to have a Windows Phone for it to to
work properly in any case that is a very
quick look at an unboxing stay tuned for
much more I also have my full review of
this phone up on the site today it's the
Windows Phone 8x this is the
international version from HTC I will be
reviewing or we will a TechnoBuffalo
that you TNT t-mobile and Verizon
versions of this phone and you'll expect
LTE there right now I just have HSPA
here in the city from AT&amp;amp;T what else can
I tell you about it real quick one gig
of ram 16 gigs of storage we talked
about this briefly this 2.1 megapixel
camera is really cool it's front-facing
and it has an 88 degree viewing angle so
that means you can fit more of the
landscape or whatever you're taking a
picture of into the photo and it's
really neat it's only 2.1 megapixels but
useful if you're in you know just
hanging out and you want to take a shot
of everybody even at an arm's length you
could fit much more than two or three
people really cool so i'll show you that
in the review manual you can read the
text online on the site this is todd
