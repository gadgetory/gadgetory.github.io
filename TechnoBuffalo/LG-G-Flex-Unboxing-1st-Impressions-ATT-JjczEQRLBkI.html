TechnoBuffalo here it's an unboxing for
you of the LG G flex if perhaps you like
your phones like you like your woman a
little bit of curve AT&amp;amp;T has you covered
for remember take a look at this guy
probably about a month ago in its
unlocked form but now it's available for
US carriers it's got a curved display a
six-inch screen all kinds of other
self-healing and flexible awesomeness
built in to go ahead and open it up so
here is the box for the LG G flex
looking pretty familiar an 18 T's orange
and white box it's gonna be available
shipping February 4th it's gonna be 299
bucks with a two-year contract or 649
without but of course check prices
because it was always very here is the G
flex or as fingerprints on it that makes
me kind of sad
ATM T's PR folks when I step to send
this to us for our review so there it is
all curvy and ready to be used let's see
what else we're going to have inside of
the box I'm gonna resist trying to make
flex jokes did I'm just buff like that
Quick Start Guide for getting started
quickly
we got webs and G flex books nothing
overly exciting there we've got a wall
warts typical LG will all work we've got
a charge and sync cable got a sim
removal tool which is super cool cuz
it's got a G on it and that is it so
here is the phone let me go ahead and
power it on and just like it's a little
brother the g2 the buttons are on the
back I'll go ahead and hit that peel
photo plastic will run through all the
specs if I get that satisfying whooshing
noise new peel us off what was kinda
satisfying so you're looking at a six
inch screen it is a 720 display so that
means it's 1280 by 720 if you can do a
quick math that is a PPI of 245 the
screen is Peola or pull it as as I like
to call it powering this guy is a pretty
beastly a quad-core chip and Snapdragon
800 so it's a 2.6 gigahertz chip it's
got 2 gigs of ram and 32 gigs of storage
no external options oh no matter where
look it's not gonna have a spot for it
the main camera on the back is a 13
megapixel camera of course I didn't
shoot 1080p but also has a camera on the
front that is a 2 megapixel affair it's
got the latest Wi-Fi standard here 802
11 ABG and an AC and a pretty beastly
and curved 35 hundred million power
battery and it's NFC enabled to be good
and peel off some this stuff on the back
and let's talk about some of the
interesting things about this phone so
aside from being just a gorgeous 6 inch
screen it also has a bit of a curve to
it so why would you want a curve
well the idea behind is you get a more
immersive experience when you're
watching video if you want to hold it in
landscape mode it sort of thing I get
behind the curve TVs all supposed to
feel a little better when you're doing
your scrolling feel more saying genuine
more natural I suppose but that's not
all the secrets and kind of cool things
this thing has it's called the G flex
for a reason the phone and screen
actually bend and flex if you go ahead
and put this thing flat and you push
down the phone will actually Bend with
you know why you'd want that not sure
but it is kind of cool that it does it
the other trick this thing has is on the
back plate here this is not a moveable
but it is self-healing now if you take a
giant gash on it's not gonna heal itself
but little scratches you get in your
pocket from keys or coins you apply a
little bit of heat you know either from
your your leg or if you just kind of rub
it the molecules kind of start to fuse
together and the little scratches will
start to go away so really cool things
here so we've got LG's UI which I tend
to like it's they've let Android kind of
be Android with some nice things on top
of it the qslide apps are always kind of
cool we can sort of put things right on
top of whatever you doing so calendar
for example a little calendar will show
up you can move it around you can keep
it on top of your screen if you want to
go ahead and see delts we're gonna have
here in the app Department so pretty
standard apps I've got all the ATT
bundled things there including AT&amp;amp;T
Navigator ett ready to go and 18 keys
Wi-Fi I've got some LG things here as
well notice the icons like a little bit
different you scroll from left to right
to see all of your icons Twitter comes
pre-installed that's kind of nice to see
it's always the first thing I kind of
download
you editor are here as well yellow pages
voice command and the rest let's do a
quick tour of the device again you got
this nice six inch screen it is 720p
you've got on-screen buttons here so you
got your back your home and your menu if
we're gonna look on the sides for a
power and lock button you're gonna be
looking for quite a while because that's
not there all you got on the side is
just a single SIM card sitting right
there on the back love it or hate it
that's where your volume up and down and
your power and lock but they're going to
be but LG phones are kind of cool see if
that's got it enabled it's called the
NOC feature you can double tap the
screen to turn it off and double tap it
to wake it up which to me is absolutely
brilliant it just seems like that
feature should be baked into every
Android phone it just make sense it's
intuitive so I love the dets there so if
you don't like that button on the back
to lock it you only have to do it all
that often just simple DoubleTap and you
are good to go you've got the camera
module a 30 mega person got your LED
flash and such and some small AT&amp;amp;T
branding and you've got the G flex logo
down below and some speaker grilles a
few things we put the phone down there's
gonna be a bit of a rock to it if you
hit the top or the bottom but side to
side it's a very stable let's do a quick
size comparison here here is the very
diminutive looking iPhone 5s with its
4-inch screen and here is a bit of a
larger phone we've got the Galaxy Note 3
at 5.7 inches so you can see that the
giant size of this phone just point
three inches smaller than Samsung Galaxy
mega this is not a phone for the faint
of heart so one of the questions I had
was how is this thing gonna fit in your
pocket with its curved like that it goes
sort of the opposite curve of your leg
but as you can see it fits in your
pocket okay it doesn't stick out too
much wearing normal dude jeans don't
have to worry too much about that and if
you're a lady and you put this one in
your purse again not to have to worry
too much because it's gonna seal itself
which is neat but as you can see as well
bit of a thing you're pretty magnet but
just true with most phones out there so
use this phone I'll put through its
paces to you think see if it's worth
your phone by and buck again it's gonna
be available February 4th to buy tell me
more watch this video the phone's
probably already gonna be out I'm really
looking forward to trying and you get a
chance to really use
