to you by jack threats welcome back to
another episode of asked a buffalo this
to show you could ask me john render any
question you've got from the wide world
of technology and sometimes a little bit
outside of technology last couple of
weeks we talked about a lawsuit I give
you guys a tour of the office this week
we are back to talking about tech news
and answering your questions up this
week we're going to talk about Windows
Phone vs. iOS and Android iPad and iPad
Mini business what my daily phone is and
we'll talk a little bit about the droid
DNA this is asked a buffalo let's go and
get started
harder Toulouse wants to ask hey John do
you think Windows Phone will ever gain
as much traction as Android iOS the
honest answer Connor is nope not gonna
happen it is never gonna gain as much
traction as Android and iOS no matter
how much money Microsoft what's behind
it but the big thing is here I don't
think Microsoft expects it to surpass
iOS mr. past Android I think Microsoft
would like an ideal world is a really
solid third place OS there's plenty of
room in the marketplace for a third
place the operating system I think
that's what we're Microsoft is going for
it trying to use sir blackberry kind of
jump over Symbian and any other third
party platforms I think Microsoft was
really good in sconce themselves as that
third option if you're looking at io s
might not be appealing to you if you
like to customize your device if you
look at Android might not be appealing
to you because it could seem overly
complicated Windows Phone fits perfectly
right in the middle you get some
customization options you get the power
of Android you really get sometimes the
best of both world Connor wants to ask
this a question that I got quite a bit
John I can't decide between the iPad
with Retina display and the iPad Mini
what are your personal views on the two
of them also which would you buy so if
it was up to me and I was buying a
tablet I didn't have any of them a good
the Apple Store I try them out and I'd
see which ones I like the best and I
would walk out with and iPad Mini which
is very surprising I'd loved the big
size iPad I always thought that that was
what I would carry with me all the time
when it comes to tablets I really am a
dedicated Apple guy
that a 7 inch green sighs just wasn't
for me so I got my hands on the iPad
Mini absolutely loved it now yes the
screen resolution is super bad and if
you ever use anything at the retina
display or HD screen you'll clearly
notice it but the portability and the
size really make it the iPad for me so a
lot of people want to know what I carry
with me on a daily basis and that's what
user tmk b-24 wants to know John what is
your daily phone well for the past
couple of weeks it was the Lumia 920 but
I have switched to the Galaxy Note 2
this is the AT&amp;amp;T Galaxy Note 2
I switched away from the Lumia who's
having some difficulties connecting to
bluetooth in my car
I'd have to reboot the phone every time
I got in the car sometimes that forget
phone would ring and after trying to
fiddle with the phone while I was
driving that is super dangerous and I
don't want to do that so I switched to
the Galaxy Note 2 and I loved it I love
that gorgeous 5.5 inch screen I love the
power behind it I did however install
Nova Launcher it's it's sort of on top
of TouchWiz so I got rid of a lot of
TouchWiz esque features definitely check
out third-party launchers in the Google
Play Store Noah's when I use but there
are a lot of other awesome options out
there hopefully that helps at your
question so the Droid DNA is arguably
one of the hottest phones out there
right now and user selim Zubair wants to
ask about it hey John what is your
opinion of the htc droid DNA think of
compete with the Samsung Galaxy Note 2
either way is the DNA not a phablet
phablet is the term to mean a phone or
tablet case you didn't know phablet you
call it a tone call it a fad phone tiny
tablet I do think that the Droid DNA can
absolutely compete with the other
flagships on Verizon the iPhone 5 which
you didn't mention Galaxy Note 2 and
Galaxy s3 the screen on this is
absolutely gorgeous now I can turn it on
I could show you on camera but it's not
gonna do with just it so you see it
right in front of your own eyes it
almost look like there's a sticker on
the screen hard to believe that it's
actually the screen itself is a little
bit of an odd design at the five inch
screen it's sort of tall and narrow kind
of like a bigger version of the iPhone 5
but it's extremely powerful it does
absolutely everything you need I love
the industrial design speakers all the
way down the sides phone feels great in
your hand it's got that great HTC built
yes absolutely can compete no I don't
consider to fab what five inches is
probably the biggest I'll consider to
still be just
educated phone can get to five point
three and five point five then you get
into that tablet range and to show you
what I mean
here's the note two phablet phone tone
phone big fattie boom body normal size
and sweet the differences
hopefully that helped answer your
question all right so let's step away
