to you by Dollar Shave Club what's up
everyone welcome back to episode of ask
the Buffalo I am in the ass the buffalo
chair my name is jon rettinger stash or
you could ask me any question that you
might have from all the technology
sometimes the bad side of the world of
technology this week we're talking about
my favorite smartphone the LG g3 we talk
a lot about III a ton of stuff in
between disaster Buffalo let's start
asking the Buffalo so once you jump
right in there's been a ton of
smartphones release and that is what the
first question has to do it comes from
user at balasore gun who asks at
technobuffalo what is your favorite
smartphone of 2014 and what device are
you most excited for this year so it's
kind of two questions my favorite phone
so far that we've done a formal review
on it's definitely HTC One m8 i love the
way the phone felt I love the way the
phone worked I like the cameras I really
liked everything about that device I
wish to add some other things I wish we
had removable battery and other options
but really I think it's the best package
phones I've reviewed quite yet there's a
big caveat so a couple phones that are
out they have not done the formal review
on I'm looking at you LG g3 the phone
I'm most looking forward to this year if
there is an xyx Nexus 6 certainly that
one would be high on the list and a 5.5
inch iphone 6 we probably top my list I
like iOS but like bigger screen so I've
been sort of more Android leaning I love
to serve try Apple's OS on larger screen
size and see if they could potentially
woo me back or at least be able to
compare for lack of a better term apples
to apples when it comes to screen size
hope that helped answer questions so if
the Nexus line of phones does go away
which I hope it doesn't it will probably
replace with google play edition phones
and that if the next question has to do
user at no yellow ass at john for lakers
any rumors of an LG g3 GPE which just
stands for google play edition no no
rumors unfortunately and i would not
cross your fingers that is going to
happen you didn't see one for the g2
although and this is our big
maybe might make you happy the rumor if
we do see it Nexus 6 if it is the final
one the Nexus line who knows but suppose
it will be based on the LG g3 but
probably without those buttons on the
back so might loose from its course sort
of sleek looks but it should have the
awesome specs including that stupid
awesome quad HD screen so there might be
some sort of Savior in there if you want
a GP dishes phone you might want to look
at putting a third party Rahman there
something about cyanogen or being able
to get some stock Android on that device
open it up and your questions so there
are ton a mobile OS is out there you've
got I OS you've got Android Windows
Phone bb10 serve some smaller ones in
between but which one is the best which
one's my favorites the next question has
to do with user at my name is Luis task
at john for lakers at this point what's
the best OS out there hashtag as the be
the best is such a relative term but
here's the honest answer you guys
probably don't want to hear they're all
good and they all do pretty much exactly
the same things they might look
different my wrapping different packages
but they all do pretty much exactly the
same thing I know the iOS fans and the
android fans are gonna get all mad on me
OS doesn't have widgets and Android is
buggy realities they do pretty much
exactly the same thing just a little bit
differently once more open ones are
closed you have maybe more customization
options and the day to check your email
browse the web they play apps and they
give you information those are sort of
the key things that a smartphone has to
do and both os's do that sort of really
well if I had a pic one you know
definitely probably be one of those two
I think windows phone is really up and
coming I think with eight point one that
gets official I should definitely be
mentioned in that conversation of course
the new update to bb10 offers a lot of
new features you can get android apps
running on that's a pretty elegant OS
and hopefully get some new hardware to
run it on but certainly all of us is at
this point do we do Zack for the same
thing I can give you the honest truth
that's the truth and sometimes truth
hurts before I get the next question let
me just tell a little story it's about
my face and it's hairiness my wife my
mom my sister's pretty much every lady
in my life is always yelling at me that
my face looks gross because i hate to
shave the folks at Dollar Shave Club
trying to make that much much easier the
reality is buying a Razors kind of sucks
you got to go to the store get the key
of the plastic thing show up just a
stupid amount of money the razors end up
being like laser pointers and
calculators all rolled into one and just
totally unnecessary but fortunately
there's a company that is doing away
with all that you probably guess their
name it is Dollar Shave Club I'm trying
to make life easy for you they make it
super super simple so for just a few
bucks a month the folks at Dollar Shave
Club are going to ship amazing super
high quality razors right to your door
so it can even have to freedom leave and
their blades are just as good as the
other big shape companies at just a
fraction of the price they've got other
shaving stuff to to make sure your face
looks nice and soft they got dr.
Carver's easy shave butter to make your
shape even more buttery smooth check
them out if you hate going to the store
to shop and you hate shaving they make
it so easy go to Dollar Shave Club calm
/ TechnoBuffalo again that's Dollar
Shave Club calm / TechnoBuffalo now back
to the question g3 just wrapped up last
week and there was a ton of new stuff
that came out at user 1 e 2011 asked at
John for lakers thoughts of this year's
e3 we covered III exhaustingly last
year's all about the new consoles this
year though we got to see games that
were made just for those consoles the
launch games were probably made the
laceration hardware that sort of poured
it over to work with xbox one or ps4 I
love seeing what these new consoles are
going to be able to do if you look at
what games look like when they came out
for the xbox 360 and ps3 vs what games
look like you know maybe last year for
the xbox 416 to ps3 they looked so
different so I'm excited to see games
get better and better it's dense can
take advantage of the hardware in the
new consoles but looks like with Arctic
starting to sort of dip their toe in
that power Assassin's Creed looks
awesome thing ever play multiplayer
looks ridiculously cool i can't wait to
serve parkour my way around the
revolutionary time france you got
through the stalwarts there yet
battlefields and call of duty all of
which look awesome incredible graphics
to sort of bring some new things to the
table but mostly that same sort of call
of duty and modern warefare people know
and love new a low game certainly sounds
pretty awesome excited about the master
chief collection but i spent most of my
time
III actually have Nintendo's booth we
had some pretty heated competitions
going on with super smash brothers I
never really played super smash brothers
before but it looks really awesome on
the wii u were already playing mario
kart like crazy here in the office and
if i myself just excited for sort of
hyrule warriors sort of excited about a
new zelda game coming out so sort of
oddly enough intend out kind of mood me
back if I didn't have maybe the splashy
announcements I'm splashy keynotes that
may be swinging Microsoft did but I
think Nintendo's got some got some punch
left and certainly the mario kart is be
mario kart certainly Mario Kart of
selling a ton of we use and I know
people can make fun of me and I also
excited for the new lego batman game
every year at e3 i go to either Sony or
Microsoft when they have their a lego
game set up either those boosting I
always go and play Lego games people are
service everywhere but nobody's ever at
those kiosks and I sit there and I'll
explain the leg of games don't judge me
I love them they're fun you should try
them all right guys those are my
thoughts generally on e3 a sort of a
casual gamer there's a lot big site
