you guys know how my install of leopard
went i installed it friday night when it
came out when i installed it i still had
my western digital drive plugged in and
when i put the CD in me double click on
the install icon it reboots your
computer and then you get to pick the
drive it installs to my western digital
drive was the only drive that showed up
my internal hard drive on the mac the
one obviously i want to install leopard
on didn't show up a little unnerving so
i unplug the driver side of the computer
and then my hard drive showed up so the
moral is if you're installing leopard
unplugged or external drives first all
in all insulation was pretty quick i
think it was an hour and 42 minutes
total and I think 40 minutes of that was
just checking a disc for air so I'm sure
it was a good disc so keep that in mind
I think you should be done though I'm
probably about two hours is realistic
expectations so the anyway the install
was pretty easy i did i had the upgrade
i didn't have actually didn't get any
options to do a fresh install or not on
the live didn't show up but had no
problems all my music is there all my
pictures are there all my firefox
bookmarks are there all my you know
browsing history everything is still
there so there was no trouble with there
at all i recommend the upgrade
personally the only thing i had trouble
with it all was neooffice that open off
his program that i talked to you guys
about that's the you know Word and
PowerPoint stuff that's just cuz I
didn't upgrade to the new version so i
downloaded the new version 2.2 point2 i
think and had no troubles at all so
really and everything worked my fan
control programs everything so far
leopard has been i've been pretty quick
i'd say as quick as tiger was really no
quickness difference time machine though
is really cool as soon as you plug in an
external hard drive that's bigger than
the hard drive on you and Mac it'll
recognize the next
and we'll start a backup the first back
of it it does that's a copy everything
over that took some time once I've done
it's actually pretty quick so time
machine is a very cool feature I don't
much of a chance to play with spaces yet
but it seems to be nice haven't really
played with manga leper from jerz yet up
and out but it seems cool I like the new
doc it's kind of neat one thing to know
instead of little arrows on the dock
when you have program open there's no a
little light below instead of that arrow
I like to air a little better but I'm
sure get used to the life not a big deal
um so I'm looking at my desktop right
now seems anything else I wanted to talk
to you guys about parallel still works
no problem everything just worked the
install was really Terry easy anyway
guys that's it just a real quick
overview of how the leopard install went
again I'll use it for a while and i'll
post a review for you guys on some of
the cool features stuff i find it
alright guys that's it i hope you hope
you enjoyed and if you upgrade to
leopard hope it one as well as I did as
well as mine did and thinking about
upgrading I'm sure it will go well don't
worry go go do it you got soft you soon
