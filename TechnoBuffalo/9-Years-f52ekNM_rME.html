I'm going to come out and say it this
week has been my 9 year anniversary
since i created the youtube channel and
in nine years my life has changed more
than i ever could have imagined nine
years ago when i opened the channel
youtube was mostly cat videos and guys
get hit in the balls that's what youtube
was it wasn't her the vast space that is
now with incredible creative content
youtube professionals short films full
length features what YouTube has evolved
into over the past almost decades been
incredible but back down years ago it
was kind of a wasteland of awesome
opportunity you could do whatever you
wanted to do I made the channel
initially I picked my old a.m. screening
from high school Jon for lakers to show
that I clearly had no foresight what was
going to happen because I wanted a
comment on other videos if you don't
know the story i'll give you the real
quick abbreviated version i've been
using a giant 17 inch HP laptop and diet
and I want to get a new one that thought
maybe I might switch to mac but I never
used a mac before I didn't know how to
use a mac thought I'd look for videos on
how to do it and there weren't any is a
go walk around best buy just relax I
used to just love to research
technologies I figured okay I'll get new
computer and I'll research video cameras
and I'll make videos maybe they'll help
somebody since I couldn't find any otha
that I was looking to do and it just
kind of grew from there my early videos
you could hear the digital tape in the
background a lot of them were filmed in
my apartment with the webcam on it was
that old santa rosa macbook pro it's
just been an incredible opportunity i
never knew what i want to do with my
life before i started youtube I always
figured I was going to go to law school
don't think I've ever been good at my
entire life was talking I figured law
school seemed to be a good fit so after
college I worked in a law firm my
parents convince me to do that before
with the law school I'd already applied
to law schools and I hated it I was
miserable i I just I didn't like what
that life was what that life would be
for me I knew I wanted to have a family
and very tough to do as a new associate
in a law firm sells really floundering I
wasn't sure what I was going to do with
my life I started running a marketing
department for software development firm
it was fine I you know I paid the bills
I didn't like the job than YouTube gave
me an opportunity and you guys gave me
the opportunity through YouTube and it's
been just incredible the past nine years
we've grown from a company of one to a
company of 12 to you know 1.2 million
subscribers and the website doing 15
million page views a month it's it's
been incredible and I've learned a lot
over the past 10 years and I have made
plenty of mistakes and I have certainly
not done everything right over the past
nine years but I've learned and I've
learned with you guys and I'm still
learning and I'm still growing trying to
be a better leader trying to make better
content trying to steer the site in
different directions and trying to do
new things and none of this would be
possible without you guys and I not I
know people say that all tie and let go
thank you but I mean generally from the
bottom of my heart you actually put food
on my table you put diapers on my
children and none of this none of
anything here would be without you one
of the things in life that I'm most
proud of is ability to let other people
have a chance to live their dreams to
the chance to talk about technology to
make videos about technology to write
about technology something I'm so
passionate about and I a wake up every
day happy even a really bad day here you
know when the comments are mean and
miserable it is still a good day and a
grand scheme of things I get to do what
I love and that's something that I will
never ever take for granted for as long
as you guys let me do this from the
bottom of my heart I just want to say
thank you and know that I generally mean
it and know that you have changed not
just my life but everybody's life here
and because of YouTube because of
YouTube there grew a business and that
never that never would happen just thank
you that's really the all I wanted to
say it was 9 years has gone by
incredibly fast and I look what I looked
like nine years ago the kid to now I
guess an adult who's married with two
kids my life has changed as much as
YouTube has change you guys
andaman along the ride there with me and
look how horrible i was on camera how i
used to stutter how nervous i wasn't
self-conscious i was on camera and if
you guys are thinking about creating a
channel and you're nervous you're
self-conscious on camera to watch those
earlier videos it was horrible I was
nervous I was nervous wreck but I stuck
with it and hopefully maybe you guys can
do that same thing and something that
you feel passion about as well I know
there's a lot of people doing YouTube
videos now but it's an opportunity for
someone new to get recognized and some
of you to get attention maybe that
person could be you like it was me nine
years ago just thank you again from the
bottom very bottom of my soul thank you
for the opportunity you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
