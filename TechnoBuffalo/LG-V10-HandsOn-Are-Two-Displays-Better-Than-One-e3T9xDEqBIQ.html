Hazleton from TechnoBuffalo I'm here
checking out the brand new LG v10 it's a
brand new phone also a brand new series
of phones so we have the juice bore from
earlier this year and now LG is
complementing that with the v10 so
you're looking at a really awesome
device that it's built out of stainless
steel they said similar material to
what's used in omega watches actually
show that's that border running around
it
you can see and it's built to really
withstand force and drops then you've
got this sort of silicon based based
back panel here the fingerprint reader
volume controls 16 megapixel camera dual
LED flash still the laser for autofocus
and then of course like the rumor said
there's that secondary display you can
see it right there up top and it's a
technically always-on see so I was a
little dim before and then you can power
it right up with that back button and
the finger per meter and it sort of
disappears but not really if I swipe on
in the tread you have at the camera here
in my hand you get a whole set of other
controls there so you can put whatever
you want customized with different icons
or whatnot settings if you wanted social
networks say for example Instagram or
something and you always want it there
but when it's in the let's see if I can
get it back into the screen off mode
it's also used and I don't know if I can
either there we go the shortcuts here
you can get the flashlight real quick
power that on the quick memo all kinds
of other things like that when the
screen is off other ones we're also
looking at let me try to get the light
right here but there's two five
megapixel cameras up front ones
wide-angle ones not you could take
pictures let me see if I can even get a
picture of myself here hanging out you
can take pictures using all three
cameras let's see here
flopping around so there I am and let's
see then I can also activate the other
camera so you can see I'm switching
between the two one just has a wider
angle than the other one and I believe
somewhere in the modes you can actually
access the rear camera at the same time
too but one of the cool things to see
that top screen there that's the
secondary display giving you additional
options in the camera and LG said one of
the one of the points here was to create
a really good camera video experience so
they said the g4 with photography but
this is really about video and those
kind of things and other features on the
bottom here you've got the 3.5
millimeter headphone jack it's got
special chips right there and on the
inside right near it that allow you to
up the audio experience I don't have the
exact figures on me but improve it using
the onboard audio chips other features
android 5.1.1 four gigs of ram a 3000
milliamp hour battery you can remove it
64 gigs of storage you also have a
Snapdragon 808 processor I'm not sure
the clock speed and then you can also
add up to 200 gigabytes of additional
storage using a microSD card slot and
you'll notice that unlike the g4 this
has actually a flat screen so there's no
curve or anything like that really the
focus is on this additional screen
instead at the top so I just only give
you another quick look at that with the
device powered off this is gonna be
pretty convenient I think for folks yeah
you just pick up your phone look at that
they said you know the entire day this
will drain about 5% of battery life so
really not that much and they think
you'll actually end up saving battery
life so while it's draining it on the
phone you'll actually end up saving it
because you're not you know going back
and forth and just turning the phone on
and off and on and off and all that so
otherwise software features real quick I
mean pretty typical stuff here that
we've seen on on devices like the g4
already but really you're looking at
and some actually I just noticed there's
some blown wear as well from Verizon
this is a Verizon brand device but as of
right now LG's not telling us what the
carriers will be but we should know a
lot more very shortly on the site keep
it directed there any case quick look
here at the LG v10 this is Todd a sultan
