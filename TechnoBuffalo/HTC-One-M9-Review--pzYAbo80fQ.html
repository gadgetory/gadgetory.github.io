from TechnoBuffalo here at the floor of
you for you of the latest lecture from
HTC it's the third iteration of their M
line this is the m9 as I do with all my
reviews let me start with a disclaimer
this is an international unit that I
tested with AT&amp;amp;T I use it for four and a
half days before filming this review I
like to evaluate all the phones I check
out based on whether or not I could use
them for 18 to 24 months its most of you
let's keep your phones for around that
period of time so anything I talk about
bears that in mind also we've got a ton
more stuff including galleries in our
full written review put the link down
below if you want to go check that out
so let break this review down into two
simple categories what I like you know
what I don't like and give a score and a
bike don't buy recommendation at the end
of the review so I'm in a good mood
let's go ahead and just start with the
positives let's begin with internal this
thing is a beast the spec Department
well for the most part but we'll get to
that the Snapdragon 810 is super fast
and few gigabytes of RAM make sure
everything runs really smoothly
we didn't initially have the shipping
software on the device we had an older
version but once that hit things
absolutely flew and not fast like I'm
used to things somehow it seems smooth
here also speaking of software a lot of
commotion is made regarding heat once we
got the shipping build there's got no
hotter than any other device and in fact
ran cooler than a one plus one we used
for testing so don't really worry about
that that was done on pre-production
software so I get to focus more on user
experience but because I know you guys
love dem benchmarks here you go the
quadrants core is 28,000 837 and the
antutu using the five point six point to
64-bit test was 48,000 795 so pretty
good all around pretty good scores so
next up is expandable storage which is
quickly becoming just a relic in the
phone world I would have liked you has
more than 32 gigs onboard internally
being able to swap in a car up 228 gigs
makes it's not only a great feature but
also oddly now differentiating factor
amongst the big flagships that's a
prized link for HTC build quality is
pretty awesome here as it always tends
to be the phone feels solid looks solid
and is built to be solid just plain and
simple I also like the 2 color tone
around the edges the subtle but really
nice touch I still don't like the
antenna bars in the back though as I
sort of ran baguettes these all on the
iPhone
second six-plus but they're here so
lover hate them that's where they live
boom sound is still the best speaker he
can get on a phone and this incarnation
sounds awesome about a less teen and
really anything else out there and you
come with me to sacrifice though in the
design department the form of black bars
but we're gonna talk about them in the
next section so spoiler alert set seven
could probably fall into both categories
here but I'm up again with the positives
the ability to create and download and
share your own themes is far from novel
or even original and Android HTC is
built in no additional launcher needed
approach is really elegant
I like the array of downloadable choices
and the ability to create your own based
on a picture is kind of a neat touch as
well I was rocking a Lucy theme here for
most of my testing the rest descent
additions I really don't use to be
honest the sense now would you did
adjustments L base to where you are
based on work Homer etc was nice I'd
rather Chad has bass available for other
info the big thing about sense for me
boils down to this it doesn't detract an
overall experience which is way more
than I can save some of the others out
there I don't find myself struggling to
download apps that make it look like
stock Android or scour the internet for
custom roms so that's about the best
thing I can say about custom UIs
blinkfeed is good here in this iteration
i quickly found myself going back to
google now instead i'll but i suppose
that's the beauty of android right you
get choice based on whatever you want
alright so now let's go the other side
of the coin what I don't like HTC's
design used to be what made the company
stand out and to see a flimsy plastic
the m7 and m8 stood high above the rest
in their metal towers this generation
though they got company when it comes to
printing materials and now the great
build quality isn't really a unique
feature anymore as good as it still
might be the m9 is evolutionary at best
design wise from the m8 which again at
best was evolutionary from the m7 third
generation of phones and almost 36
months in the design language hasn't
changed much I get it if it ain't broke
don't fix it type mentality but I assume
HTC want people to upgrade from the m8
they're looking at the two side-by-side
and hard press really see a reason why
we've come to accept phones looking the
same for two generations think of it as
the iPhone iPhone S model but after
three years it was time for something
fresh we just don't have that here at
the
so this is a phone after all which means
you're going to spend all your time with
it looking at that screen that 1080p
screen
I don't wave the qHD flag so much but
it's noticeable emission here to 12
months from now qHD is going to be
common place and apps and games will be
designed to use it and the m9 will be
able to deliver the same digital
experience as other phones purchased at
the exact same time so having knocked-up
resolution it does have excellent
outdoor visibility great viewing angles
it overall looks pretty good but it's
far for the best 1080p screen out there
also flaking the screen or black bars
you need to add a room for boomsound
speakers they are an eyesore and
otherwise really nice looking phone the
decision to include a 5-inch 1080p
screen was supposedly made to deliver
killer battery light performance from
its 2840 million power pack which it
doesn't really do there are two schools
of thought when it comes down to battery
test real-life usage and drain test we
ran both with the battery fully charged
right it's a hundred percent and volume
turns all the way down we're able to
stream 1080p YouTube videos for a little
over four hours so in real world just
normal person usage for me I was able to
get home at night while getting me
forward to bed 45 percent battery life
left if you're plugging it in don't
expect to just drop this thing on a
wireless charging pad it'll be as useful
to the m9 as the bicycle is to a fish so
my usage for me generally kicked off the
charger around 7 a.m. picked the Wi-Fi
at home in the office about two hours of
phone calls decent matter social medias
and video watching light gaming going on
to email accounts being pulled down and
checked every five minutes and again I
always kept it to Wi-Fi and when I'm out
and about using the AT&amp;amp;T network which
is going HSPA+ on our testing device so
45% left into the day I get sounds good
my daily driver before I started testing
this was the Nexus 6 let's get on with
an inch bigger display q HD resolution
and with the same usage at 35% Balak and
get me the day ask yourself that 10
percent savings is worth it for you for
me it's not I'd rather have the bigger
screen and qHD yeah mate introduced a
much high quality pixel camera that to
be kind let's just say didn't sits that
well with all fans this time that which
pixels are saved for the front selfie
camera now you got a 20 megapixel sensor
on the back the calistri 4k video we
have a ton of gallery shots over at the
written article so yeah hit the link
down below if you want to see those in
full res I'm
it's a pretty awesome sensor coupled
with a dual LED flash
however it's not in the like part of the
videos but I guess from going with this
there was noise and images even in
really ideal lighting conditions there's
a lack of detail if it comes super
evident when you zoom in as well
low light wasn't great either and it
wasn't helped by the lack of oh I ass in
the camera the pictures came out worm
and some came out uneven it was just
really couldn't tell what you're gonna
get from the camera but on the other
side the shutter was really fast it she
see me the settings really customizable
the UI is clean clear and also easy to
understand if all you want is a Facebook
Instagram snapchat etc kind of camera so
gonna be a fine choice for you if you
want more you're gonna be disappointed
though there's a lot to like about HTC
m9 and there's a lot that just left me
scratching my head on one hand you have
an incredibly well built and well spec
phone that's outdated screen about
myself balancing out my like sittin
there dislike though throughout the
entire review don't get me wrong it's a
good phone even a very good phone but
it's not the best phone out there right
now or even the best one I got
announcement of World Congress which
makes you really nervous for us
considering using this for up to two
years if you have an m8 I cannot see a
killer reason why you should upgrade to
this one get this phone if you love HTC
and you want a modern film that's built
like a tank consider all of your options
if you wanna devbytes can offer
compelling relatively future proof set
of features for me though I don't think
I'd ask the HTC m9 out on a second date
but maybe you will and who knows people
even hit it off if you see one m9 gets a
seven on the TechnoBuffalo scale so what
do you guys think do you agree disagree
is the m9 the phone for you I love to
hear your thoughts on it please leave
