to you by domain.com what's up everyone
jon rettinger from TechnoBuffalo here
the folks at one plus are trying to
bring some fresh air into the oneplus
one and they just debuted and release
the new oxygen OS let's see if it does
the job most 1+1 users were waiting for
one of two things either cyanogen 12s
based on lollipop or 1 plus his own much
T's oxygen OS also based on the ollie
pop and that's what we have here fun
fact the original one plus one actually
shipped with cyanogen 11s based on
KitKat it was for dot or dot for here we
have one plus one oxygen OS and it looks
very much like stock lollipop it's based
off of 5.2 a lot of things that people
loved about the original are here in 1
plus is own OS let me start with the
off-screen gestures and a lot of these
were ape to directly from cyanogen
double tap to wake up you saw that guy
in LG devices of course on cyanogen 11s
go and turn that off again so you want
to launch the camera go ahead and do a
little circle that's going to turn on
there if you want to launch a flashlight
you can just make a V and that's going
to turn on the back not sure if that's
going to show up on camera if you want
to play music you can draw your fingers
down if you want to go fast forward or
back you can draw arrows depending on
what you want to do those are all here
and those can all be tweaked in settings
so go ahead and jump right in let me
jump into settings and show you some
that stuff that I was talking about
first we'll go down to about phone and
you can see this is running oxygen 0 s 1
point 0 point 0 and it's five point 02
based and go ahead and jump back so the
one plus one is when a few phones
actually ships with physical buttons or
you have the option of using software
buttons they're kind of Lowell it down
below you can still turn those on or off
in settings to paste depending on what
you want to do one of the big features
that they're touting here is in quick
settings go ahead and pull that down
this looks pretty standard what you see
on lollipop except see those little four
squares will go and push them four
squares and now you can rearrange or
even hide these quick settings icons if
you want so it can rearrange them
anywhere you want you can tap it to turn
it off and it goes black and then once
you hit that Save button they are going
to go
and of course you can always bring them
back or reset to defaults go ahead and
exit out of that jumping into settings
here scroll down scroll up rather and
you're going to see buttons this is
where you can determine without you want
your on-screen or your physical buttons
turn that on or off you want to have on
screen nav bar go ahead and go back
we've got gestures this is where you can
turn on or off all this stuff that I
showed you previously so we just
installed this on here if you want to
know how to do it i will put a link down
below to show you the instructions can
be a little bit complicated but if
you've ever installed a custom OS on a
phone i should be able to do it yourself
a few other things that one plus is
having it's got a built-in file manager
now which it's not that big a deal but
there's one built in San to go ahead
install a third-party other that we're
going to get to your testing and see
what other new features we've got here
other things are on board you have
google now if you swipe on over if
you've got to turn down from the side we
don't have it turned on here but it
looks like the Google now launcher with
a few new tweaks built into it we stop
real fast thank our peeps at domain.com
it's the place to go when the next great
idea hit you like in the middle of the
night so one-stop shopping for all your
domain name and web hosting email needs
domain.com wants to hook you up with a
pretty sick off for say twenty percent
on domain names and web hosting and use
coupon code technobuffalo it's all one
word in caps at domain coms check out
when you think domains think domain com
so a pretty nice look especially for a
100 build appears to be relatively
stable but we'll continue testing into
anything that sort of jumps up as
gigantic big gross crawly bugs or not
it's pretty stable if you are one plus
one user and you really want to use at
your daily phone you might want to wait
a little while let us test it at a see
how stable it is but of course 12s first
I engine is coming soon that's the
device you'd be able to put that on
there as well you can really just take
your pick anything else you guys want to
see us cover with the 1+1 leave in the
comments located probably in my pants
