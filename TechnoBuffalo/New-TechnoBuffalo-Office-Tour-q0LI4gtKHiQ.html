to you by Full Sail University what's up
everyone
John render from TechnoBuffalo here and
welcome to a very special episode of
renter's rifts we've been in our new
office for about two months we are far
from moved in but not even asking for an
office tour so we are going to do office
tour 1.0 as we get things moved in in
the studio set up or revise it and do an
updated version we're going handheld
here so things might be a little bit on
the shaky side so come with me as we do
a tour of the technical Buffalo office a
lot of people have been asking why we
moved our lease on our previous space
was up and was a little on the smaller
side and rents were going up so I
figured as long as we got to go to a new
space let's go to space that can grow
with us over the next few years so that
brought us to where we are right now
when we first look at this space it
looked completely different
it was monotone as one color was kind of
drab carpet look little dumpy so we kind
of TechnoBuffalo dedup so we're walking
right through the front door we've got
our mascot here this is Shia LaBeouf
alow just just chilling out we'll show
you guys also everybody's desk set up
I'll talk a little about what we're
planning to do as we get more moved in
since we are sort of working here as
we're also trying to set up things are
taking quite a while to do so come on in
the first thing that you see first thing
that you see when you come into the
office is our lounge we use this for
twitch streams usually we have live
traffic up on our TV that's the Vizio P
series a 70-inch 4k TV that we unboxed
and took a first look at we've got
pretty simple setup we've got two
couches set up here we've got a table
you can see some of our controllers on
it we've got all major consoles
underneath here I've got the ps4 Xbox
one and the Wii U we've got a PC that we
use for our twitch streaming we've got
some capture stuff I've got this Lenovo
sort of all-in-one that we used to see
comments within our twitch streams we've
got some dropcam's that we use just to
serve monitor the office and do some
decoration
here like the Nexus Q so first look
here's everything here just some setup
how it looks you know in general go and
show you guys the studio so this is
definitely it's probably the most sort
of work-in-progress thing that we've
that we've had first thing which I kind
of thought was most fun is our recording
sign so since we are recording we flip
that on so here's the studio this is
where ronmark myself spend the majority
of our time you can see there's still a
lot that we need to do us probably the
set you guys are most familiar with we
use this one you know the most because
was easy to set up we have the wall
painted blue put up couple pictures and
we were done we're using an up desk the
standing desk it's pretty easy it's a
white top we can use dry erase on it we
can adjust the height if go on do a
hands-on or just me standing in front of
the camera this wall you're going to
start seeing it a lot of other videos
we're still kind of getting it set up we
got some minion pictures we're going to
put up or an interchange a whole bunch
of things here you can see some of our
letting equipment down here I've got a
chest restore camera equipment which is
currently a c100 and a 60d actually 260
DS that we use this wall here we're
going to start using a bit more these
just kind of cardboard shapes that Roy
put up for us I've got some LED lights
do you want to back that I'm just from
change the color you'll probably see
this set a lot in that some of Euro that
we use usually we got Ron or mark
holding out a device like this you know
doing some b-roll against that wall and
behind me looks just like some plywood
this is our last set that is still under
construction Rory's building is for us
because you know Roy is super handy this
one I'm going to keep this one a little
bit of a secret what it's going to be
there's going to be a lot of wood
involved on how this is going to look
now hopefully we'll get this up and
running though the earlier part of 2015
he's some of our lighting equipment here
one of the cool thing about the new
office in the studio is that we finally
have LED lights in the ceiling soon
enough to have the same elaborate
lighting setup we have we're not
fighting outside light we're not
fighting newly bad lighting you know
that normal office lighting so we can
sort of film almost anywhere which makes
life marketable
easier here deserve a quick first look
at our studio let's keep walking and
then we've got serve desks set up here
this is Brandon
everybody knows Brandon probably all
Brandon's stuff when we tried to get our
desk we wanted kind of a collaborative
workspace we don't want cubes all cubed
up so we got these sort of little pull
out things you can sit on and are all
storage this is Brandon's setup
he's got a 13-inch MacBook Air set up
with a cool dock and a custom stand that
by trained design and I stand that he
bought from the Container Store here's
the gaming PC that he built he in the
Ralph have very heated contest almost
most recently though they're playing
Minecraft they're still pretty into the
Minecraft this is this is Brandon next
this is the back of Ralph's side Ralph
isn't here right now Ralph was in Sweden
with Todd at an event for Volvo which is
kind of neat Robinson kind of cool he
went and bought an arm for his monitors
make it look a little more seamless
Ralph is a very organised fellow
anyone's everything could look kind of
just soso here's his setup usually he's
using a 13-inch MacBook Pro there is his
gaming PC as well down there with his
Dell monitor and some comic books and
background stuff you move anything on
Ralph's desk even like a quarter of inch
he always knows so movie leave that one
alone
here's Mark's desk mark is a very into
wood as as you can tell things are very
streamlined and modern looking here
Mark's got the set up looks very nice
cut docks and all kinds of things here
mark does always editing editing as well
as Ron in Adobe suite so primarily in a
Premiere Pro will go ahead and take a
look at the last taken desk here we've
got a few open ones as well obviously we
want this for for growth this is Ron
run into much Ron's a simple man with
simple tastes so here's a who's Ron
setup we've got a couple open ones as
well I'll show you when they'll cool
open ones that we're using here we are
currently testing a 3d scanner which is
kind of cool it's by matter and form
paired with a 3d printer
it's an Athena setup here so this is
could be coming out for an upcoming
review we got this pair to a lenovo
that's the yoga2pro and a few other pcs
we've got setup that we use for kind of
a ton of different things here I'll take
you guys to the back of the office here
this is our kitchen kind of tried to
make it look a little modern we've got a
great carpet and kind of the faux black
floor the white cabinets the blue
background we've got and espresso
machine and it's gets used super a lot a
nother open desk here kind of using for
storage this kind of we can see we're
definitely not fooling with ania things
are just kind of absolutely everywhere
primarily these Macs in the office a lot
of the editing at least what I used to
do it got done an apples editing suite
and the guys here are familiar with
Premiere Pro on the Mac side Ron did a
lot of the editing for the first almost
eight months he was here on a custom
Falcon PC using Premiere Pro we switched
everybody over to make a consistent
which is easier to be able to uh airdrop
files back and forth this is the back of
the office open for room for expansion
and got at Z board moves quite a bit of
our packing supplies and stuff are still

storage these are for around as we grow
this is Sean Ani our editor-in-chief and
this is Sean ah nice fat head every year
Sean grows a crazy mountain man beer he
sent us a picture one time and we
printed out made a giant fat head of it

xbox 360 and ps3 back there really likes
race that around once the works done
think it's fast so this is Roy's office

things so I'll go and keep doing the
tour here I'll show you guys where I
spend majority of my time can see a lot
of stuff here still not up on the walls
and just a lot more left to go and a lot
of clutter if we still need to iron out
here but this is my office
I have thing to Jeff and this is looks
to be a very similar to Roy I've got two
chairs here we do all of our conference
calls every week in my office of people

moved them in here nothing else overly
exciting at the family pictures it got
