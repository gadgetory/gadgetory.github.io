TechnoBuffalo here it has been just
about two-and-a-half months since this
little guy the iPhone 6 hit the market
want to share my thoughts and
impressions what I like didn't like
which changed institutional review of
the device if you're thinking about
picking up an iPhone 6 maybe already got
one I want to see if we agree with you
let's go ahead and get started so first
in the phone world two and half months
is kind of a long time with phones that
only have you know twelve thirteen month
life cycle this phone's been out for a
little bit of a while which is crazy
because now you can just finally walk to
Apple store and get one about you know
ten weeks later so I did initially
review we liked the phone a lot overall
things that I didn't like about it I
still don't like about it starting with
that design I get design is totally
subjective beauty's not beholder no
County for tapes all those cliches you
want to think of I want to weigh thrown
phone looks I feel like Johnny Ivan
company who's really helped themselves
to super high standards phone the design
in completely I like doing the antenna
bands look on and everybody's like oh
John
the HTC m8 has antenna bands you don't
say anything about that I knew it I knew
you're a fan boy I think that looks
better on me m8 because of the shiny
material and sort of the anodized
aluminum that you've got on the iPhone
so that's my thought their camera hump
still don't like that camera hump it's a
hard thing to accept on a phone that
doesn't have optical image stabilization
the lens isn't going in and out why does
it camera to be humpy I don't get it I
feel like it shouldn't be bending issues
wasn't that big a deal with the iPhone 6
more 6 plus but keeps your worried no
bending issues at all on this guy I
think that got blown way we we had a
proportion so let's talk about battery
smaller battery in the iPhone 6 I
started using a 6 plus 2 def months ago
I like big phones it was really too big
for me
so I thought I would try the iPhone 6 I
started using it pretty regularly and
battery life wasn't as good as I thought
it would be and I want to give a
disclaimer the counterpoint that is
Brendan Russell's been using and I have
phone 6
pretty
much every day since it came out while I
was testing other devices his battery
life has been the complete opposite of
mine his has been really really good
isn't pluck isn't even every day but the
difference is he didn't use his phone as
much as I do I keep my brightness for
90% I'm making hours of phone calls on
it
checking I'm watching video I'm playing
some games on it a lot of iMessage and
text messaging going on pretty heavy
usage primarily connected to Wi-Fi at
the officer home I don't have them
somewhere between 20 or so percent
battery life by end of the day I'm just
cutting it really close for me whereas
on the 6 plus they'd be more on the 40
50 percent battery life level so that
was a really big issue so I figure most
people probably gonna fall somewhere in
between I think we first get a phone are
using it a lot and might be like oh
battery life is awful John you move you
I'd can't use this phone but then you
drive it for a couple weeks start using
it less than last I think people are
gonna fall in between Brandon and myself
battery life is about the same as the 5s
generation so if you had a 5s you get
through a whole day you're gonna be fine
with this lower screen resolution then
we've got on the iPhone six-plus Saint
PPI that we had for previous retina
displays I always equate phone screens
to shopping for TVs say your walk around
Best Buy and you see a wall of 10 T fees
ranging from you know cheap to really
expensive and a variety of resolutions
from 720 up to 4k you see them all
together you notice a really really big
difference in TV sets you look at them
side-by-side you pick one of those sets
maybe want somewhere in the middle take
it home it's gonna look good not nothing
to compare it to it's get same thing
with phone screens the iPhone 6 screen
looks fine it doesn't look like the best
phone screen Rose doesn't like the worst
phone screen in the world looks like a
very serviceable phone screen and maybe
the premium price Apple charging it
should have a better device that's sort
of going to be up to how you feel
apples doing on the pricing scheme but
just how it works from an average user
the screens been fine video looks good
text looks crisp there's no pixelation
you can see with the naked eye
obviously things just look decent on it
again not the best I think the best mark
right now probably goes to Samsung for
the screens on the note 4 is absolutely
ridiculous others a good screen by no
mean the best but hasn't been an issue
for me
speaking of issues one thing I had with
the 5s was really tough time with touch
ID I just didn't work for me
hardly ever not so with the 6 and 6-plus
touch ID here is now firing like 90% of
time works really really well we first
add Ryu applepay
wasn't out yet we only knew what's
coming I love the way that works I think
it's a really elegant pretty solution
which is kind of typical of all the way
Apple dustings might not be the best
solution but it's probably the
best-looking solution a lot of places
are starting to accept Apple pay so I'll
be using that quite a bit and I love
that it's built in I wish I could do
more tat NFC antenna though but you know
lock down camera so we talked about not
having oh is it's still pretty good
in low light after the review is done I
don't really do much with the camera
other than post a facebook Instagram I
mean we get a couple 5x7 spits out for
my grandparents that was really it for
that kind of stuff the camera looks fine
low light shots still look fine despite
oh is the video still looks fine as long
as you're not like doing this with it
they're both very serviceable I would
have loved higher megapixel count to
here in case you want to blow it up or
case you want to do it on particular
area and crop it and print that out but
it's not a deal-breaker you're not
getting the best camera phone but you're
not getting the worst which if you
notice it's kind of a trend with the
iPhone 6 not getting the best one in the
world getting a good phone I'm fuzzy out
there that wants something that serves
in the Apple ecosystem iMessage is
important to you I thought it was
important to iCloud is important to you
yeah you're going to want to stay in the
iPhone lineup this is the least
expensive way to get into the most
current generation of iPhone devices you
can be pretty happy with it
speakers pretty good not great sort of
seeing again seems to me a theme here I
still really like the way the phone kind
of curves around it feels really nice
Ben you're swiping from side to side
I haven't had need to put a case on it
haven't dropped it yet so that's been
kind of good the back isn't wearing as
well as I would have liked still sort of
showing fingerprints and smudges not so
many scratches would be nice you know I
again haven't dropped it on pavement yet
fortunately but sort of being in the
same pocket with keys it still looks
pretty new if I cleaned it up and
buffered it you know I could probably
pass it off as white almost
brain
so the moral here is and I think the
same thing was the review it's a really
good phone it's one of the best Apple
phones that have ever been made if
you're the kind of person that wants an
Apple phone and wants a
current-generation phone you're going to
be pretty happy here if you want the
latest cutting-edge specs from Apple
device you want to look towards the 6
plus if you want something that's going
to work well for a year two years and
again you want message to Apple the
ecosystem it's again a really solid
choice for you to pick up I don't know
if my review score would change at all I
think the experience you get first day
you use an iOS device it's kind of
similar to extend experience you're
going to get you know maybe a year later
two and half years later which I guess
the testament iOS that's fast it works
quickly I've never really had any
stutter or slowdowns and that kind of
goes back to the very first iPhone aware
quickly for what was out at the time I
think though as phone's guy resolution I
think next generation iPhone 6 to
probably have a higher res screen you
know maybe that might be an issue maybe
we start seeing apps get coded for more
RAM that direction phones you're going
to have but for right now in this world
at the end of 2014 it's a good phone
choice just might not be the best one Oh
