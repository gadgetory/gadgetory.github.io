technobuffalo here with an unboxing that
i have never done before this is the
biggest package I have ever opened this
thing is absolutely gargantuan let's go
ahead dig in and see what's in the
mystery crate
so I want to give some perspective about
how big and giant is crate actually is I
couldn't carry it up to my office we got
to do this unboxing downstairs let me
show you so a sort of a size comparison
for things you might be familiar with
here is an HTC evo for you android fans
check that out palm pre to look how tiny
iphone 4 you can hardly see it so let's
go ahead and dig in to this monstrosity
of course we have to bring in signore
stabby for this guy go ahead and pull it
out just a little bit see it's actually
on wheels there's some tape go ahead and
pull some tape on the back of it let's
go ahead and see what we have inside
alright so tape has been cut let's see
if I can actually slide at the top of
this right off which may be harder than
it looks or sounds all right we're gonna
have to tack this guy from the top
instead of just cutting this off so
we're going to do a lot of tape card but
seven dramatic music here don't them
darling so I like big bets as to what's
in here I got Matt pro oh I got office
furniture nobody was even close actually
guessing what's in here go ahead and
keep slicing all this stuff off to the
side there we go and that should be just
enough to
here's the big reviewable recent check
that out push all those things off to
the side we've got a gigantic crate from
the folks here at a reese's missing is
absolutely huge it is part of the next
big thing if you can see that right on
top the next big thing let's go ahead
and open up these locks and actually see
what this big crate holds inside all
right so here's one lock and let's see
what the next big little thing is got
one lock open twisted and down let's go
ahead and move on over to the other side
got lock number to open almost open and
it is time to open this sucker up
alright so now it really is time for
some dramatic music I'll do a drumroll
on the top of it the next big little
thing is
one word awesome
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
