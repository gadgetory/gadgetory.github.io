to you by gamefly what's up everyone
welcome back their pursuit of rettinger
risk I'm Rios John Rancher this is the
new show or I can just talk about
anything up this week there is a awful
hideous for we're swirling that Google
is going to be killing my sweet sweet
nexus line at 2015 let's talk about it
and see if it's probable not probable or
maybe is just a rumor mongering this is
right in jerz wrists go and get started
so the rumor in question can be traced
back to mr. elder more taisen who is an
industry experts got a pretty decent
track record for leaking news according
to his tweet he says and i quote nexus
line by google is over in 2015 winky
face yes this line i'll be replaced by
play edition current name it will be
rebranded so before you get that
guttural reaction like i had like no we
can never do that it is the worst idea
I've ever heard I love my Nexus devices
think about it from a business
perspective so Google has to negotiate
with partners to make these next device
they usually sell relatively cheap
compared to other unlocked phones the
profit margin presumably is not very
high essentially they're white labeling
which essentially means putting their
name on existing product line with maybe
a little bit of repackaging den and
they're sort of like what costco does
with their blenders and model numbers
always a little bit different at costco
but usually the same product you can
find almost anywhere else so i don't
assume that google is making giant
profits hand over fist of these devices
there are more reference phones for
developers to use and for google to show
off the next generation operating system
their annual devices you always
coinciding with annual software releases
usually the next big version of what
android is going to be but monkey wrench
came flying them and Google started
doing Google Play edition phones we saw
it first the galaxy s4 in the HTC One
I've got Sony devices in their got
Motorola MOTO G all kinds of other
Google Play devices and those are just
standard phones with Google's native
android on it and that's it completely
unlocked used with any GSM carrier
sometimes even cdma carriers depending
on which device you're using
those now our reference devices are
showing off the latest version of
google's operating system so with those
phones Google gets to sell up to the
Google Play Store presumably getting a
piece on the back end they have to do
pretty much zero point zero work other
than optimizing the software for those
devices to get them out the door they'd
have to worry about negotiating
redesigns they have to worry about
updates coming for those phones they
have to worry about really doing the
returns or maintaining any sort of
customer service on those I know those
sometimes go to LG for the last two
devices but Google is always in the
middle of those things taking out a lot
of middle players these devices
presumably making higher profit margins
for those google play experience devices
so as much as I hate to admit it this
actually makes financial sense for
Google to do but don't fret too much
Google doesn't always follow the what
makes most financial success because
they do all kinds of crazy things like
Google glass and building barges in the
middle of San Francisco Bay so I think
it's going to happen I give it proud
that six percent chance that the next
Nexus phone we see will be the second to
last followed by the last Nexus phone in
2015 just funny fun fact it will not be
called the Nexus 6 because Google does
not own that trademark for it maybe
we'll see another name moto Nexus or if
LG stops making a motorola get to next
one or so many Nexus whatever it might
be but I do think the sad sad flagship
Nexus phones are done the perhaps
instead of Google Play devices will be
called Nexus phone so you can have the
galaxy s4 Nexus or the HTC One Nexus
which is no I seem like the worst idea
so Google giveth Google take it away but
we're pretty excited to see what they do
and I've excited to see what comes next
regardless more Google Play devices the
better I'll of native Android so then
you get more storage space also on those
devices go you don't get all the
bloatware on there so thumbs up for that
where you guys think would you care
would you cry if the Nexus device stood
out the window but if it meant you've
got more google play experience devices
