what's going on guys the marked and sang
I'm from TechnoBuffalo and in today's
video we'll be taking a look at IO s9 on
the iPad air 2 yesterday at WWDC Apple
talked about the new features coming to
iOS 9 and shortly after the keynote we
actually did a video showcasing the new
OS in action using an iPhone we'll leave
that link down below just in case you
guys haven't seen that video yet the iOS
9 update includes a plethora of cool
features like the addition of a smarter
Siri an updated Notes app a new search
menu and transit inside maps among other
features
but it's the multitasking features
coming to the iPad we're most excited
about there are a few different methods
to do this slide over and split view
slide over lets you open a second app
without leaving the one you're in so if
you're browsing the web you can also
have the messages app open but if for
example you're watching a YouTube video
you can also look through your Twitter
feed slide over will fill the screen
70/30 but unfortunately you can't adjust
these panes you can however easily
switch the app that shows up in a right
pane by swiping down from the top now to
enable slide over your iPad must be in
landscape mode and you simply swipe left
from the right side of your screen and
it'll start showing apps that are
available for slide over split view
meanwhile takes that one step further
instead of a 70/30 layout each app will
be open and active on each side of your
screen with a break directly down in the
middle this feature will allow you to
interact with both panes and be more
productive like if you're writing an
email and doing research online for
example but as I've now split view only
works with Apple's own apps like Safari
calendar and notes but hopefully we'll
start seeing more apps get supported for
iOS 9 both of these new features are
designed to make the iPad a more
powerful productivity machine other
tablets have already boasted these
features and now that they've come to
the iPad it makes Apple's device that
much more exciting there's even a new
picture in picture mode which will allow
you to do something like FaceTime while
writing an email just press the home
button your video will scale down and
continue to play while you use another
app we tried it out and it works
flawlessly so far now picture-in-picture
mode obviously isn't new but again it
makes the iPad more powerful and last
but not least is the new quicktype
keyboard apple redesigned the keyboard
in iOS 9 for iPad giving users a
built-in shortcut bar it'll give you
options to copy and paste bold italicize
or underline of text you'll also be able
to quickly add attachments if you're
writing an email by using the paperclip
icon
typing on iPad has never been a fun
experience but these features certainly
make it more manageable you can also use
on-screen keyboard as a trackpad so you
quickly control the cursor on your iPad
by simply moving two fingers across the
screen with this feature you'll be able
to move the cursor more accurately and
you'll also be able to highlight text
much more easily Apple also added
keyboard shortcuts for wireless
keyboards like the ability to switch
between apps or bringing up search but
you'll also be able to interact with
your apps using a keyboard own built-in
custom shortcuts which is an awesome
feature if you made the switch over from
a traditional PC to a tablet let me stop

now all of these features are meant to
make the iPad a more powerful device
especially for people who use the slate
to get work done the multitasking
feature are borrowed from other
companies but that doesn't make them any
less exciting all these new iPad
features like picture-in-picture mode
slide over and the new quicktype
keyboard will work with the iPad air
iPad Mini 2 and iPad Mini 3 while the
split view mode will only work with the
iPad air 2 now since this is just the
first beta we can also see new features
in future updates and if there are any
major changes in future iOS 9 beta as
well be sure to keep you guys in a loop
