to you by the LG OLED TV on a new TV a
new category of television how's it
going guys mark burr Steiner here with
TechnoBuffalo and I thought we'd do
something a little bit more casual a
little more intimate get the camera
right up in here and appropriately sit
on the couch because we're going to be
talking about some televisions I got the
opportunity recently to have quite a bit
of hands-on time with some of LG's
brand-new TVs and they're not just any
TV so they say these are OLED TVs which
LG is saying is an entirely new category
of television just like when we went
from CRTs to plasmas to LCDs and now to
O LEDs if you're if you've heard the
term OLED before that's probably because
you have but generally with the prefix
am you know we do a lot of stuff in
mobile so a lot of high-end devices of
course have AMOLED displays what that
means is let's start all the way back to
LED right LED is a light-emitting diode
that's very different from an LCD which
is a liquid crystal display what we see
in a lot of phone displays and in these
TVs in particular are organic LEDs those
are actual organic molecules that are in
between some layers and cathodes and
diodes to make the light that you see
come out of your TV now the major thing
that LEDs do better than LCDs do is LEDs
can be shut off to create true blacks so
for example if you're looking at white
text on a black background an OLED
display can actually shut off the pixels
that aren't displaying black meaning you
have some really really true contrast
meaning you have deep dark blacks
because the actual area of the display
isn't even turned on and emitting light
now for mobile devices we're talking
about AMOLED displays that's
active-matrix OLED displays and that's
very very different also because we're
using that uses an active matrix that
uses the kind of the brain behind what
you might see if for example a TFT LCD
display use to actually send the
messages to the pixels to basically you
know play captain among the pixels and
tell them what they should be displaying
that's important on mobile because that
allows manufacturers to have incredibly
low refresh rates on the displays on
your mobile phones which means
you can get it down to less than a
millisecond even if you want to that
means far less power consumption now for
a nice big display for example the LG 65
e G 9600 yes it's a bit of a mouthful
but it's gorgeous as you'll see for a
display like that that's plugged in all
the time so you don't need to worry
about having an active-matrix brain
behind the scenes running the operation
but on a nice big display you get you
still get those really rich true crisp
blacks that you love to see on a mobile
device
now these LG TVs are fairly new and
they're definitely on that higher end of
the price spectrum but my god I haven't
seen a TV that looks that good in quite
some time
I spent a little bit of time today and
I'm going to spend some more time later
today playing destiny on these things
and they are phenomenal one of them the
lower end model which is the 55 EC 9300
that's actually the one that we have in
the game room anyway so it's a dream to
play on both of these displays are
curved they look fantastic when you're
sitting right in front of them dead-on
because they're all LEDs they also have
incredible viewing angles so you can
just I mean you can you can seriously
just be at almost like a full flat and
still see what's happening on the
display which is not something that you
can do with older stuff like going all
the way back to plasma zone and so forth
the remote controller on these TVs is
also fantastic because if you're
familiar with webOS which was the sort
of operating system from the Palm Pre
and the palm pixi HP picked him up and
what happened to webOS after that I mean
go do some googling you'll figure it out
it was the saga webOS is saga ended on
televisions with LG and these TVs run
that webOS software and it's a dream to
use I honestly I'm not huge on Smart TVs
because I have a bunch of other smart
devices that I plug into my TVs you know
I always have the ps4 plugged in but the
OS is fantastic on these TVs you've got
Netflix you've got who you've got all
kinds of apps you've got a really really
easy to use interface not to mention the
remote is basically a Wii mote so you
just point out what you want to do and
start clicking around it's such a
delight to you
and I have to say the bigger model of
the two just looks astounding you'll see
I shot some stuff playing destiny you'll
see the blacks really are black the
contrast on that thing is fantastic
everything is crisp and smooth I said it
to game mode so just so you know I said
it to game mode so the refresh rates are
where they should be just no lag latency
stuff like that because it is a
first-person shooter at the end of the
day but I gotta say this TV is just
incredible both models just look
fantastic as far as TVs I've seen these
days it seems like this one's the one to
be granted there's not a whole lot of 4k
content floating around on the internet
these days but with a YouTube app you're
you're bound to find some so that's my
quick little first impressions hands-on
quick look quick play at LG's OLED
display TVs they're just fantastic I'm
really really happy I've gotten to play
with them I really just want to take the
big one home but I don't think they're
gonna let me do that unless LG if you
want to send me a TV then I mean I won't
say no anyway thank you guys so much for
watching hopefully you enjoyed this
