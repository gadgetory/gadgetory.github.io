stage we have call of duty black ops
please put your hands together and don't
forget to tip your waitress they work
hard for their money
all right I'll silly stripper jokes
aside let's go ahead and dig in and yes
I fully realize this is just an unboxing
of a disc in a box but that has never
stopped me from doing it before being a
nerd gamer whatever else you want to
call me I love to see what these things
look like inside granted they always
look the same circular and shiny on the
back but I thought I would try and make
it as fun as possible here we have call
of duty black ops for the Xbox 360 it's
got sort of that new Xbox look to it on
the top I am dying to go and dig into
this game I could make it to the
midnight launch unfortunately try to
pick it up today which is launch day on
November 9th I'm going ahead and jump
right on into this and get my plan to go
ahead and pull it out it's just a disc
its shiny on the back or just what you'd
expect I can go ahead and guys can pick
this up whenever you would like and if
you want to get your game on with me I
will be playing my xbox live game is
John for Lakers if I haven't played with
you before I'll go ahead and sort of
clear my friend list in the next few
days so we can go ahead and get our game
on together this is just sort of a
preview of the game we got ton of
gameplay footage and coverage coming up
I hope you guys enjoy and I'll see you
in the next video and I do want to know
by all reflows you that have played this
game already if you play it on the Xbox
to the ps3 which version actually looks
better I love hearing conflicting
reports that ps3 version may have a bit
better graphics but the gameplay as far
as controlling scheme may be a bit
better on the Xbox it's sort of rumor on
the street I want to know what you guys
have to say of course we've got the Xbox
version right here anyway see you guys
