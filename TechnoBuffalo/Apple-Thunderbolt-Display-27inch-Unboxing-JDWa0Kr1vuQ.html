John Retton Jeff and TechnoBuffalo here
that obvious unboxing for you of a
thunderbolt display this is the more
modern take on the 27-inch Cinema
Display that we see now for a few years
there's a lot to like about this guide
right now you're just staring at a buck
so I'll run through the specs as I hack
it open this is the first actually a
second unboxing video ever done in the
new office and I don't yet have the
big-ass knife so we're using the normal
sized scissors so go ahead and cut the
plastic boom plastic has been cut so
this is a 27 inch TFT active-matrix
display with in-plane switching or IPS
you might have heard that term thrown
around a lot tablets have IPS technology
resolution ears are pretty high res 2560
by 440 16.7 million colors 16.9 aspect
ratio or 16 by 9 aspect ratio that's
enough specs for right now we'll get
some more we've got a design by Apple in
California let's see what's in here or
designed by Apple in California sure
it's printed in China um Apple
Thunderbolt display some warranty
information no stickers oh not that I've
ever stuck a sticker anywhere but if you
are the kind that likes to stick an
apple sticker to your Prius you're not
going to be happy with a thunderbolt
display this has 178 degree viewing
angle horizontal and vertical 3 USB 2.0
ports Gigabit Ethernet Ethernet firewire
800 let's go ahead and pull this rest
out of here in the Thunderbolt port
which can do 10 gigabits per second 20
times fashion USB 2.0 or at least up to
and up to 12 times fashion firewire 800
so it should
right off styrofoam good for the
environment inside we've got what books
just like every other cinema display
monitor out there it's got a FaceTime HD
camera with mic 2.1 speakers at 49 watts
and it weighs twenty three point five
pounds which are about two three
Oh twenty three point five pounds of
fury ticket ticket cuz I'm mad going to
put it right down here let's take a look
at what it's got all right so we've got
it up on the desk in what's going to be
it's a new home it's got a little bit of
packaging on it pull off this fake
fabric and a satisfying farting noise I
might have just been me you'll never
know get this off of here only time is
probably won't have fingerprints on it
even if I never touch it it's somehow it
gets fingerprints we've got some more
plastic on here it is Energy Star
certified so yay for that plastic
microphone sits right here on top so for
skyping or whatever you want
FaceTime via FaceTime HD camera the
microphone or whatever other Nadi uses
you kids are up to now it is left a
piece boom we're just going to look I
just leave this here you think anybody
saying anything in the comments and pull
it rest the way off it looks identical
to the outgoing 27 inch LED cinema
display all the specs we just mentioned
let's turn it around though and see what
makes this guy a little bit unique so go
ahead and tell tur so we've got three
USB 2.0 ports there's the firewire 800
there's a Thunderbolt port which was
causing all kinds of delays and what
sort of makes this new you've got your
Gigabit Ethernet and some interesting
here on the cable there is also a
Thunderbolt ports they don't have to
take this one up to connect it to your
a MacBook Air or your iMac or Mac Mini
it leaves this one open so if you want
to say daisy-chain or put on another
monitor you want to plug in a
thunderbolt hard drive or whatever other
upcoming Thunderbolt accessories this
might have you can go ahead and do that
through the open port also has a max if
adapter so if you want to charge your
laptop go ahead and do so right here
it's it almost like a mini docking
station and these three USB ports as I
flipped off the camera are all totally
powered so should be able to use
whatever you need those for so spin this
guy around unboxing of the 27 inch
Thunderbolt this blade will do a full
review as I get to use it get to know it
and we become acquainted I'm John Rhett
interpret TechnoBuffalo
you guys get a sneak preview of what my
desk is going to look like and of course
there will be an office tour coming up
soon as the office is ready to be toured
see you guys next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
