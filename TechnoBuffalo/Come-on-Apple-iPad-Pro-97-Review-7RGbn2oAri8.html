pretty much know what it is let me
introduce you to the new iPad pro the
smaller brother to the almost 13 inch
iPad promised gonna call it iPad pro not
gonna call it nine point seven inch iPad
pro I'm not gonna call it Steve it's
just it's just iPad pro and you pretty
much know what you're gonna get with an
iPad you're getting iOS which is gonna
work
Jack great expect you access to Apple is
pretty awesome ecosystem just what you'd
expect you're getting tablets gonna
perform really well what I could expect
a 9 X in here hums along I wish that
Apple would have added 4 gigs around
like you did at the larger version of
the iPad pro but I have no speed issues
at all apples vertically integrated all
their stuff that control that hardware
the software so you'd expect it to be a
relatively fast machine but there are
some nice surprises at Apple premium to
this the biggest one for me is the true
tone display the resolution stayed the
same same rent display we've had it for
a few years but the warmness is going to
change depending on what environment and
the idea is for holding a white piece of
paper and different light to reflect
lights they look different to your eyes
this does almost the same thing it's
really subtle but it makes reading
things and watching video on the screen
a little bit more pleasurable and
enjoyable and you definitely notice it
when you're using in fact we try and
turn it off it's gonna be very obvious
that it's not there so a really nice bit
of technology from Apple and one I hope
makes its way to the rest of Apple's
product one other additions here you now
have a 12 megapixel camera on the back
essentially there's a the same sensor
from the SE and the 6s so you know it's
a pretty solid sensor pictures look
great colors look nice good low-light
good normal light pictures don't be the
purchases your iPad as a camera even if
it can shoot 4k video just don't don't
be that person don't get your kids
soccer game folding up over your head
you're Luke Silla use your phone just
it's better that way but we do decide to
use this take pictures which I'm telling
you shouldn't
you're gonna be welcomed by camera hump
on the back but for the life of me I got
a really hard time understanding why
it's there but it is pump and all I just
ain't the same Humpty not Steve so the
same accessory line is available at the
larger version you can get here as
welcome paddle at the iPad pencil you
can get a smart Keyboard take advantage
of that connector on the bottom you've
covered those at length with the first
of the iPad pro so dock no too much
detail suffice to say the pencil works
really well if you're graphic designer
it's gonna be an incredible tool for you
like
take notes in class or meetings if we
want to consider picking one up I was
going to cost you at your 100 bucks
picking a price we're gonna talk a lot
about this end of the video the price
has gone up now from $4.99 - $5.99 that
is going to get you actually 18 gigs of
storage so 32 is not your entry level
point all the way up to 256 now so
there's a lot of storage in this thing I
couldn't like a color palette before you
can now get rose gold here in the iPad
air 2 iPad pro that's something that you
would want to take advantage of it boils
down to this it's fast multitasking
worked great NX is a fast processor
despite not having same RAM as a larger
iPad pro active any performance issues
touch ID as quick as you'd expect a lot
of this iPad exactly what you note would
be when you buy it but that's not the
end of this review a lot of an admirer
of Apple's products but I've also called
them out and fill up they are wrong I
feel like they are wrong with the iPad
pro not because it's not a good tablets
probably one of the best nine point
seven to 10 inch tablets you can buy my
issue though is with the price since the
iPad first debuted in 2010 almost six
years to the day of filming this video
it's been $4.99 and when you went from
the iPad to the iPad 2 to the iPad iPad
4 which really just iPad Retina display
the iPad air 2 the iPad air 2 to this
guy price has always been $4.99 Apple
slapped a pro name on it the Lynx $5.99
now we sing speck increases before we've
seen increases in RAM gives you 6 to 512
to a gig to now two gigs we've seen
screen resolution bumps storage start
the same note 16 gigs and I get that
it's doubled here to 32 an extra $100
for those increases make no sense to me
at all especially you factor in
economies of scale that if you're
sifting through the storage costs apples
and knees and you expect updates and
upgrades from generation generations but
this offers up grid wise versus the iPad
r2 is something different than we've
seen for other iPad iterations as they
get better after 800 all or something
really hard to rationalize I don't know
what you guys think am i off-base do you
not care you still happily pay the price
I'll let us know in the comments down
below and please a good video thumbs up
we always appreciate it till next time
I'm John render protective Buffalo guys
