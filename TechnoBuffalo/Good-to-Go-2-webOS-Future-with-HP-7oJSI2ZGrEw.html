to good to go is thursday march 10th as
we're filming this from oakland
california i'm noah Kravitz
editor-at-large for TechnoBuffalo calm
I'm James Kendrick for ZDNet mobile news
James what's going on today how are you
oh good it's been a busy week I've been
interviewing or reviewing stuff like
right not an interview a reviewing
product like crazy I'm like my brain is
fried well plug it man any any good
reviews coming up on your blog well I
actually just today I finally got around
to publishing my motorola xoom review
which yeah maybe wasn't as a fortuitous
as some android fans would have liked
that there's your there's the one line
one line teaser so if you want to find
out just how James ripped it apart you
can head over to the blog and no I I am
I think I know what you're talking about
i think i experienced some similar
things John did the review for us but
definitely some stuff I like about it
some stuff maybe not quite ready for
prime time you know put it that way yeah
why I guess by my basic take of it was I
see a ton of potential in the zoom and
honeycomb with Android but it's not
there yet you know it's just going to
take some time and you know the big
question is how much time does any any
of these guys have in this game yeah
yeah there's a there's a product going
on sale tomorrow friday at 5pm that I I
forget the name of it we don't need to
talk about it magical i hear ya that's
cool exactly exactly also a quick note
to everybody who's watching first of all
thank you for watching the show last
week the feedback we got was awesome and
you know just like to be doing it all of
the comments about the audio especially
on my end or not especially with the
audio on my end duly noted I've got a
mic that we're using this week that is
not you know straight
it's probably not going to yield a
hundred percent results we want so for
next week I will be fully prepared I i
made i may go you know we should get
some headset sponsors i think and a lot
what a lot of people i've been doing
these kind of things for a lot of years
and it's pretty funny audio is the
hardest part of video stuff to get
straight I mean it still blows me away
why doubt it and I'm used to doing you
know the stuff whether reviews are at it
shows or whatever with a camcorder setup
so doing this off of the computer you
know I'm sort of scrambling around I've
got a I've got a USB interface I've got
a I've got a lavalier mic somewhere I
don't know so you know this one should
be better but but for next time I got to
raise my game I know it so anyway enough
of that you know speaking about that
that magical thing coming out tomorrow
that uh that we're not going to talk
about what should we talk about you have
any ideas well I've been given a lot of
thought to the competition you know why
with there's no shortage of tablets
hidden hitting the market or about at
the market and I've been doing a lot of
thought well which of these if any even
have a shot you know it scratching into
the deep trench that Apple has dug with
that other product right now and it's
it's tough I mean I was I was really
looking for more from the zoom just the
first half honeycomb tablet that we see
it's not there I mean the zoom is the
one that I was hoping was going to be
the most potential good competitor
because of honeycomb and it's not there
I mean quite frankly it's going to take
some time and it's not there I thinking
back on all of the various tablets and
and things that I've seen directly I
mean right in front of my own face and I
i really think that webos with an HP
TouchPad has the most potential because
everything that I saw I mean I watched
that thing for well over an hour I mean
it would let us touch it which was you
know but I was I was right there was
right in front of me and and they were
pretty open i mean the the
representative who was running things
did everything I asked just right I mean
it was it was like I was touching except
without feedback right and I came away
from that convinced I'm still convinced
today well so let's dive into that a
little bit then what do I what do they
need to do really you know obviously
they've got what was that release it
release it exactly you know well that's
a mean I you know it's impossible not to
look back to you know the first pre and
you know like you alluded to there's a
long gap between the CES press
conference and knocked everybody socks
off and when they finally shipped it I
would you know also throw in there I
carrier choice distribution channels and
developer support you know this time
around especially with developer support
I keep talking to people who say it's
going to be a big big hurdle for them to
to get over and and as much as I like to
scoff at the importance of apps you know
the numbers don't lie the number of apps
out there the itunes store now you know
the growing android market i mean even
going back to the zune for a second for
me that's one of the things that you
know there are some bugs there were some
issues with the display quality there
are some money on whatever but there
aren't that many apps that are 30
optimize that are dual core optimize
that really show what this thing can do
and set it apart and you know at that
event we were both at four for HP with
webos afterwards i ran into somebody
very high up in a well-known technology
magazine and we'll leave it at that and
i asked this person you know what they
thought
and they said you know we got to the the
products are cool the pre three you know
looks like a nice a nice evolutionary
upgrade the tablet you know looks really
great but man we got to the developer
part of the thing and they bring up you
know the the time thing showing some
magazines and then a fourteen-year-old
kid nobody's ever heard of and ya know
that where the where the big gaming
partners where the where the developers
and how are they gonna get well i agree
apps are really important but I I have
to step back from that a little bit
because quite frankly apples lead with
the the ipad is so large no one is ever
going to catch them right right so if
that's going to be our big criteria then
let's just games over let's just all go
buy iPads we don't have to catch them
but but but but we're apps are really
important and this is what got me
thinking a lot about the touchpad or to
fill the needs and the gaps that the out
of box experience with the tablet gives
you agree and I think that's why the
user experience I've had with the zoom
has been so frustrating because they're
all tie gaps and no apps right but
everything that I have seen the ops not
gaps that should be are you ganna gaps
not apps or something like that but what
I saw from the touchpad with webos okay
this does the real core functionality
you know the email and the web and the
the social networking and all the stuff
that we do all the talk was rock solid
right kami out of the box and I'm
thinking about the you know my family
members not the geeks that that have to
have a product that works that could
just open up take that out of the box
and just do stop right that's the appeal
of the ipad
quite yeah yeah that's what they do well
and I really think that webos has
already got a leg up on Android and from
my actual what I've seen and experienced
right Oh doubt about that you know
there's been the term post-pc has been
flying around you know over the past
week there are a couple yeah Vittorio's
and you know yeah and but i but i think
the sentiment is true and i think the
way you just put it you know is
something that I I sort of struggled to
talk about in a way you know that makes
sense to our core audience which is more
of you know at least the commenters on
the block tech blogs the tech videos
eyelid stuff you know sometimes
sometimes I refer to them as the vocal
minority but you know these are kind of
more of the geeks more the enthusiasts
and you know and those are the people
who I learn a lot from through the
comments even if we disagree try to find
a way that you know talk to them about
that notion that in the bigger scheme of
things when you're talking about
shipping millions of products you know
yeah you want to create buzz you want to
have good specs you want to you know
appeal to those people and to the people
like you and me who you know right and
talk to these people but you gotta have
it work right out of the box you got to
have it be you know simple and solid at
those day to day tasks with you were
just saying and you know the family
analogy you know can I can I can mom
open it up and get it working is going
to do anything for you know is is huge I
also you know I i also wonder about how
HP is going to make a difference in
terms of i mean you alluded to it they
have to release these things and you
know lots of comments about you know
we're cutting way down on the other time
from launch to ship and leading up to
the event i even you know part of me was
thinking man maybe they're going to go
on sale today you know they're going to
announce that there until today and no
summer
and it looked ready quite frankly I
didn't see any deficiencies right so how
much of it you know how much of a
difference is HP going to make and you
know they obviously have deep
distribution channels they have deals
with you know the big box retailers the
online retailers the whole thing you
know how important you think that that's
going to be relative to again in my eyes
nothing against sprint but being locked
into sprint with the pre for that first
year was you know one nail on the coffin
the you know they had some build quality
issue stuff like that with the original
pre the marketing campaign was another
nail in the coffin to me those those ads
the creepy girl ever lads were just you
know it's terrible and so yeah you know
how much of a difference can HP make
relative to that stuff and how big of a
difference you think you know that needs
to be well I think they can make a big
difference and and I think they will as
they I think right now they're focused
the people i've talked to at HP they're
focused on getting getting it released
properly the big difference i think that
will that HP is going to bring is the
instant back support I mean it's going
to be great quite frankly they're good
at that and so they just need to get it
released and get everything in place and
they're still going to have the same
situation with the apps the developers
but what I a lot of people don't realize
is after HP first pot bought palm you
know and brought brought them into the
organization then we're still doing the
pre to and the other phones they had and
they were upgrading webos for the smart
phones and stuff flip and I knew they
needed more apps so they actually made
an internal competition that a lot of
people didn't hear about okay where they
said okay all you smart HP employees we
have here right apps and we're going to
give prizes for the best apps they wrote
almost 5000 half Wow in less than a
month Wow okay they didn't make a big
deal about it because that's
the whole point no point was just get
good solid apps into the marketplace
right there there right and so I think
they have a shot at getting their
long-term I'm like that like I said
before no one's going to catch Apple
anyway there's no better their head
starts to far so I think that the key
here is focus on the core functionality
which looks really really it really does
i really came away with the impression
that i could pick one of those up today
and just start doing what i do well and
that's that's a big deal they met out of
box experiences really vital and it's
what apple so good at and what google
and honeycomb and now motorola with the
zoom is so bad at because quite frankly
honeycomb was rushed to market it's not
ready it should it shouldn't be here
it's it's incredibly frustrating to
people who know how it could be and
should be why guts yeah as opposed to
what it is and yeah and and I've gone
you know to be fair people people
watching this you who followed by
coverage you may be thinking like wait
no what's up man your flip-flopping on
this like I thought you didn't like
efficient for sponsored your logo here
you know I kind of went back and forth
when I first saw a honeycomb in a
similar what you're saying a hands-off
demo at the launch at CES I was really
starstruck by it's like wow this looks
different than Android this might be
kind of cool and then when I saw you
know kind of more up close I was like no
it's just Android but with a different
you know have a truong skin on it and
then I got the zoom and I started using
it and I actually liked it more than i
thought i would but i actually still
like it right today through but the more
i used it the more those things came out
like you were saying like it's just not
quite ready it's another kind of typical
Google you know beta product I don't say
Google because not just Google no no no
that's true it
and yeah one thing that I've done with
honeycomb because it does look so much
better and different than the old
Android that's why we like it because
we've been playing with a circle oh I've
handed the zoom to a bunch of different
people who are not techie yeah like I
always do just hear what do you think it
is and the main reason is so i can
observe their reaction and how intuitive
they find it absolutely Jack and they
just do it honeycomb in it it's too much
of a desktop metaphor it's got controls
all around the place and all four
corners of the screen they're not
consistent with in from one app to the
next and I as I've been observing that
while I've been reviewing evaluating
this thing it that's when I the the
impressions of webos and the touchpad
have really started eating on me because
I guarantee you I could just came to
hand that to anyone of the same people
and they'd say oh well I love the email
oh well I love Facebook you know I love
doing this you know that's out of box
experience came over at that poor yeah
there's an interesting article i read
that i think was linked off of off of
Gruber's blog but it was about
notifications daring horrible yes off
Darren fire I'm sorry boy yeah get to
plug in right oh yeah absolutely am I
you know you know what Gruber's bloggers
and say yes internet fireball which I
read regularly so there's plug dad yes
and and I and I forget I'm remiss here
because I forget who authored the
article but it was about the problem of
notifications and you know how do you
deal with with notifications here and
the article and that's still terrible on
the iPad and IRS well and that's the
article was written from that
perspective what's happel going to do
they gotta do something but but it was
talking about something that I hadn't
thought about which was you know the art
the author of the article was was
praising webos for its handling
I fully agree and it's even better on
the touchpad I saw oh wow you could
triage your email without even opening
the email app that's freaking cool and
so one of the things that they were
talking about was how Google puts you
know in Android and it's different on
honeycomb but in in 1 dot x + 2 X they
put all the notifications on top and
they've got that that you know status
bar and you can pull the window down and
how in Apple's human interface design
guidelines whatever they call for OS X
develop or at iOS developers they talk
about how the most often used controls
on a mobile device should be at the
bottom so that you can get to them with
your thumbs without having to you know
and it's something I hadn't thought
about before but you know it's
interesting because and so that's how
palm does at the palm has their HP nub
when Wes has that nice way of stacking
them up and there's more information you
can slide them out the whole thing
honeycomb has them on the bottom as well
but I've been noticing on the zoom that
I will get you know if I can I use the
device put it away come back to it you
know a couple hours later I'll have
multiple notifications from the same
apps down there I've got yeah it's it's
it's not well done yeah yeah that's that
kind of stuff and and that's that's
exactly right and when I was using my
original pre and I had one of the
original pries from day one the the
webos notification system has been
outstanding from day one they they got
it right young Tom did they nailed it it
has been at yeah obviously involved
because what was on the touchpad that we
saw last month was even better I mean it
just looks like it's well done so I just
personally can't wait to see that thing
get released because I think from a
sheer
a usability standpoint it is the most
competitive alternative I've seen to the
ipad today I mean no question in my mind
and so let's get it out there and let
people start playing with it get-get
marketing going and let's because we
need competition competition is good i
mean i love the ipad and I'm not saying
it's not good enough for everybody
because it you know maybe it is maybe
it's not but competition is good and I
I'm really anxious to see that getup I'm
kind of excited still for the flyer or
two which rumors kicking around flyer
looks good but you know that's very
telling that HTC went with Gingerbread
and not honey yep cuz they know
honeycomb is not ready yeah and there
are going to release a device with a row
with it and so that's that's telling to
i'm looking forward to that I'll tell
you what I'd love to see is the the
rumor later this year 7-inch webos town
yeah forget personally I'm a 7-inch
tablet god I like that form factor to
the I love her I've got a new color I
was going to say before you know and
then I checked myself because that's
getting a little carried away when you
were saying that touchpad looks like you
know perhaps the best competitor for
ipad right now nookcolor to say that
would be hyperbole but i do think you
know there's something that maybe it
just comes back to simplicity but for
people who the form factor the 7-inch is
great the price 250 bucks 200 lately on
sale terrific the the ereader
functionality you know it's a customized
version of Android of 2x and so the
barnes and noble layer on it connecting
to their services books and magazines
and stuff really easy-to-use really
attractive and then it's got a web
browser and you know if they through
email in there which you know again
there's an there's or not again but I
say again let's think about the email
con
versation I'm having with their PR
person there's a what there's an app
store coming not sure when just yet you
throw email on there it's got an audio
player built in how much more does you
know to go back to the mom analogy how
much more does that person need and
maybe that's a little bit of a 180 when
I was talking about apps before but it
is sort of this dichotomy that on the
one hand apps are hot release buying
apps apps for making money apps can do
so much stuff on the other hand you know
what you're talking about with out of
there you go right with a way to tap its
further viewers who were wondering
that's my favorite mobile device right
now also a 7-inch its 7-inch and it's
running froyo which is good enough quite
frankly but it's not as polished as what
I saw the touchpad weba with no so nice
to get it out there yeah a tree well
ortley or at least send one over here
exactly exactly well speaking to get it
out there I'm looking at the clock and
we got we got some feedback that the the
length of the first show people seem to
like it so so let's put a cap on it for
now and we'll we'll come back as always
be back and gives us more to talk about
next time exactly exactly the well I
can't say it on air some somebody
somebody likened Steve Jobs marketing
strategy to that of a oh how shall we
say adult performer who's always teasing
you that there's something more but you
know knows that if they reveal it all
you know that's it you're done you're
going to leave so well that's true but
to his credit then they deliver and
that's that's what the competition has
got to learn how to do quite frankly all
right HP you've heard it you know what's
got one last thing before we go actually
there's an HP event coming up soon that
the CEO is yeah I don't know what that's
about the now I don't I mean HP's
business is so broad it kudos I mean
they're one of the biggest PC makers in
the world sleep but dropping a little
bit
this this tablet stuff is just fun and
games off to the side there it is
although you know its but it's moving
that way I mean that's a whole nother
show because and they day they know that
that's why they're that's why they
bought palm they paid over a 1.2 billion
dollars for palm they're serious they
know that yeah and they're puts a webos
on all the pcs in some form and I think
that's brilliant yeah all right but for
another show for another shot yeah you
said a billion dollars i immediately
thought about Microsoft and Nokia of it
another show another show yeah yeah all
right so in the meantime people who want
I want more from you sir where can they
go on ZDNet I'm at GT dead calm / blog /
mobile dash news terrific or just look
for mobile news on ZDNet i'm there
alright so next time I'm know next time
front our dinner out here in a foggy
foggy Oakland California just look out
the window it's looking like a scene
from one of the twilight movies out
there kind of crazy 60 degrees sunny
here in Houston there you go James
always a pleasure will do to Noah
alright see ya
