to you by full sail university welcome
back to another episode of rumor roundup
this to show we round up all the tech
rumors from the we condense them into
one video so you know what is coming in
the future up this week though we only
have one topic and one topic only we're
going to talk about the next generation
playstation the ps4 Orbis whatever you
want to call up but there's a ton of
rumors coming and they are coming fast
and furious so this is rumor roundup let
socks and ps4 the rumor mill has been
churning fast and furious with ps4 news
we published an article earlier on
TechnoBuffalo sencha lee said the same
anonymous source who was leaking a ton
of next-generation Xbox 360 info late
last summer actually was trying to sell
it online is now bringing us some pretty
specific info about the ps4 or orbisonia
is internally calling it super day is
he's known as provided the website
kotaku with the set of 90 PDF files that
outline specs related to the systems
developer hardware as well as the
controllers and accounts the sheer
complexity of the information and
conjunction with his credibility based
on other known rumors makes this pretty
probable unlike some other xbox related
rumors have been floating around the
internet for the past few weeks
information is at least probably going
to be somewhat accurate it's important
to note that specifics below are for
development Hardware only not the
console consumers are actually going to
buy it a retail some are all the specs
might be different and retail versions
they likely will be this does though
give us a pretty good idea of the
possible maximum power of the system as
a retail console wouldn't be beefier
than development hardware of course
system memory 8 gigs you're gonna be on
board video memory it's gonna have a two
point two gigabytes CPU is gonna be
pretty beefy you're gonna have for dual
core AMD 64 bulldozers GPU is an AMD r10
it's gonna have four USB 3.0 ports to
ethernet ports audio output we're gonna
have hdmi optical two point O 5.1 in 7.1
channels blu-ray support and 160
gigabyte hard drive you expected hard
drive size 0 to get much much much
larger probably by the time the console
launches is going to be a huge push for
downloadable content in addition to hard
drives on the console itself a documents
have some pretty interesting tidbits
about how you control the games it plays
the system of course support six access
and Dualshock 3 controllers and it peers
to support to move controller as well so
if you want to use that little ice cream
cone looking thing so obviously has a
lot in common with the current
PlayStation controller the big key is
ads going to feature rather than a
touchscreen as a lot of folks have
guessed before it's going to feature a
capacitive touch pad to can support to
multi-point touch and click input shape
for the controller be it of the
boomerang liquid-solid the original ps3
and they announced it or something more
like the Vetus totally unknown it's also
going to feature improved motion sensing
vibration RGB LED and a ton of other
awesomeness in there so what we might
get is a sony up we you type control pad
so despite rumors to the contrary the
documents don't make any mention of any
sort of biometric features at all the
other big surprise here is a controller
is going to have a share button there
nothing usually known about what it
could entail will that be for sharing a
screenshot from the game you're playing
or send it out via social meters
something really specific with
interacting with the console
documentation goes into a ton of detail
about how accounts are going to work on
the system as well one of the most
interesting aspects of the account so
that they apparently will sync with the
controller when the system is well
automatically bring up the option to log
in with your personal account although
it counts are locked to controllers this
could bring new meaning to the age-old
that's my controller fight that we might
have been having with siblings for the
past few decades I know I have with my
sisters when I was growing up with my
wife now I got to use when I play my
games the gold controller makes me feel
like James Bond again I let's remember
those is a rumor but it does seem pretty
plausible it could be pretty interesting
to see how this compares to whatever
Sony ends up showing at e3 games con
wherever else it finally gets unveiled
at those specs are incredibly beefy Auto
specs enough though to keep the console
current for 10 years that really is yet
to be seen I will say this for Sony the
PlayStation 3 when it launched had crazy
awesome beefy specs and as kept up
pretty nicely with technology over the
past decade so you gotta figure Sony
knows a thing or two of making sure the
console does not become obsolete over
the years I'm really curious see what
developers can do certainly you don't
the full power of the games until three
four or five years of the consoles
lifespan but if you think current
generation ps3 games like awesome I
cannot wait to their to look like on ps4
assuming we'll have support for 4k which
or the next decade a probably come
pretty mainstream it is going to be
awesome so what games are you looking
forward to most lafitte your comments
down below do you agree or disagree with
any of these ps4 rumors one thing is for
certain though all these rumors can be
put to rest in the coming months as I
think we might get a hint of what sony
has to offer perhaps even before e3 that
we've rounded up all the console news
