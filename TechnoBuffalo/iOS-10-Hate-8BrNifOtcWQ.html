itself following up are 10 things to
love about iOS 10 I've got the flip side
of that coin here are 10 things to hate
about iOS 10 let's jump in with number
10 the look and feel while you're
filming our retrospective on the
original iphone I noticed that the icon
placement on the homescreen hasn't
changed at all in a decade and I get the
faint broken don't fix it approached but
maybe once every 10 years change just
for changes sake is a good move number 9
apps automatically install message
extensions so if you install the yelp
app you're gonna have the Yelp messaging
app extension already pre-installed
communit number 8 notifications are not
grouped by app and this is infuriating
give me all my mail notifications under
one and my weather vacations under
another don't don't mix and match just
make it simple Apple number 7 Apple pay
triggers way too easily when i'm not
near NFC if you accidentally touched at
home button twice appliques gonna pop up
small annoyance when I encounter
probably two to three times a day number
6 you still can't add a direct dial to
the home screen why can I not directly
call my wife with an icon on my home
screen number 5 well Syria's way
improved in fact it was something that I
loved in iOS 10 Siri is still way behind
what you're getting with Google now and
even Cortana contextually she's a hard
time answering questions she's not gonna
read you news or give you answers like
Google now well I just feel like Siri so
it needs a lot of work coming in at
number 4 this was something that a lot
of you were telling me about confusion
between long press and 3d touch take
your iphone 7 and try to move an app
from screen screen for example a few
tries get this actually work and the
phone to figure out well and I kind of
do a 3d touch or a long press it just a
little bit squirrely needs to be ironed
out coming at number 3 you still can't
replace the default apps I don't use a
default mail app on iOS 10 for example
if I want to send pictures via email and
sometimes could be a convoluted mess to
use apps that apple hasn't bestowed as
first-party commit number two this one I
got probably more than
anything no slide to unlock it's weird
it's just different I'm not saying it's
bad but I asked you guys on Twitter what
you didn't like this one came up to the
top and number one and this is my own
personal annoyance about iOS 10 more
swipes to do things the goal with
touchscreens has always been to require
fewer steps a new control center is
probably the pinnacle example of how it
takes way more swipes do something in
iOS 9 so these are my top 10 more
annoyances about iOS 10 what are some of
yours what are some things you're
getting used to anyway thank you guys
for watching listening and generally
hanging out the video thumbs up we
always appreciate it until next time
this is jon rettinger and i'll talk to
guys next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
