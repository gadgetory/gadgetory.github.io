from TechnoBuffalo and today we're going
to take you on a little tour this guy
sharp aquos crystal it's probably the
most interesting device in a world right
now it's the first bezel this phone out
when the markets so let's take a look
and see what it's all about what makes
aquos crystals so unique is its vessels
or lack thereof aside from the devices
chin there's basically no bezel around
the top and sides making the aquos
crystal an incredibly attractive phone
compared to other handsets it's crazy
how the aquas crystal is essentially all
screen right below the actual display is
where the front-facing camera and
proximity sensor sits and you're
probably wondering where that your
pieces well that's what's really cool
about this device it uses the vibration
motor to emulate sound letting use
entire screen as an earpiece it sounds
strange but it works surprisingly well
well the design to certainly premium the
sharp aquos crystal was equipped with
some mid-range specs it comes with a
5-inch display with a resolution of 1280
by 720 and a pixel density of 294 PPI
it's also packing a 1.2 gigahertz
quad-core Snapdragon 400 with 1.5
gigabytes of ram a decent size 2040
milliamp battery which can't be removed
a gigabyte of expandable storage of 228
gigabyte via microSD card and an 8
megapixel camera in the back that's
capable recording 1080p video and a 1.2
megapixel camera in the front now
probably one of the best things about
this phone is that it's only a hundred
fifty dollars off contract which is even
cheaper than the Moto G now even though
the processor isn't the fastest out
there the aqua sees performance is still
pretty decent was able to play games and
run photo editing apps without any major
hiccups it's not as blazing fast as some
of the other flagships we've tested this
year but nonetheless it's pretty good
especially for a device that's so cheap
while this is mostly a vanilla version
of android 4.4 sharp has included a few
features such as Harman Kardon audio
along with some tweaks to emphasize
devices bezel of screen now when it
comes to how the display actually looks
there's nothing to really rave about it
colors look pretty accurate viewing
angles are pretty solid though overall
it isn't anything spectacular that
didn't really expect anything great from
this phone other than the bezel is
design though being able to use the
screen as an earpiece is actually pretty
revolutionary and we give props a
sharper thinking out the box here
and on that note the small bezels make
content like videos games look really
awesome and there are no big frames are
on the display to distract from what's
on the screen now unfortunately the
aquas is pretty thick at ten millimeters
compared to other phones that recently
came out like the iphone 6 and note for
which are 6.1 millimeters and 8.5
millimeters thick respectively but
nonetheless the device looks really cool
and with that being said it still feels
great in the hand and oddly enough it
doesn't even feel like a 5-inch screen
because of its small footprint for
example the Nexus 5 is another device
that sports a 5-inch display though it's
still a bit taller than a sharp aquos
crystal and same goes for the iphone 6
which has a 4.7 inch screen other parts
of the design you'll find the power
buttons a 3.5 millimeter headphone jack
the volume buttons and on the bottom is
where you'll find the mic and microUSB
port for charging now looking at the
back of the device is where you'll find
the second mic speaker grille and an
eight megapixel camera which and all
honesty isn't that bad we've got some
pretty good shots indoors and outdoors
though it's still can't quite compete to
devices like the note 4 or the iphone 6
plus now this is just the beginning for
sharp and the aquos crystal is one heck
of a device's just one hundred fifty
dollars off contract and we can't wait
to see what sharp has first in the
future if you need a good looking fast
prepaid device there's no reason not to
get this device the design is beautiful
and bezel lyst display looks so awesome
and futuristic that's it for this video
