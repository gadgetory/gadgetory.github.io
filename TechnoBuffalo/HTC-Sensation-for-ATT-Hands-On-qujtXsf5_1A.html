technobuffalo here if you are watching
this video chances are you're a geek
like me and you may also get smartphone
envy like me and if you've been
lustfully looking at your t-mobile
friends with their HTC Sensation all of
its dual core HTC sense 3.0 action I've
actually got your answer right here
let's take a look
so on the outside this looks like any
other HTC Sensation it is unlocked but
it's unlock of a bit of a secret it has
support for 18 T's 3g bands which is
pretty awesome let me go ahead and show
you and this came to us courtesy of our
friends at negri electronics if you want
to pick one of these up links going to
be down below to go check them out let's
go ahead and jump into settings go to
wireless and networks will check out the
EPN settings here and mobile networks
and you can see that it says AT&amp;amp;T right
there and even more excitingly we've got
that age logo it's not hspa+ but it is
3g and it is working so no Wi-Fi
connection going on here we are straight
cellular data let's go ahead and do a
quick speed test I'm in Southern
California obviously this page you're
going to vary depending on where you are
so restart the test and we'll see what
kind of speeds we are getting with the
HTC Sensation looks like we're getting
about two and a half 2.7 about 3
megabits per second ish oh we crossed
three so pretty decent speeds and
actually almost close to what we've seen
a real world testing with hspa+ on AT&amp;amp;T
and t-mobile and even the wimax on
sprint with their 4g network i'm getting
about 1.1 up which is relatively fast
you're looking at decent speeds here
that you can get on your unlocked AT&amp;amp;T
capable HTC Sensation this isn't just a
TNT capable if you are anywhere else
that uses the 850 3g band so if you're
in canada and you're on rogers this will
also work with you guys so everybody now
can get in on this sensational action
check out it's pretty badass camera and
all of the awesomeness that is HTC Sense
three-point oh I'll chop up my link down
below of the original HTC Sensation for
t-mobile so you can check that out and
see if this phone is for you I am jon
rettinger from TechnoBuffalo not see in
the next video
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
