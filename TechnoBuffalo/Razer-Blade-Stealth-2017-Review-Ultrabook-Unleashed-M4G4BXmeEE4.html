of this perfect laptop something between
an ultra portable laptop that slim and
lightweight and something like a regular
laptop that's powerful but not exactly
slim for the past month I've been using
razors latest Ultrabook the blade self
and I have to say it's not the laptop of
my dreams but it's pretty darn close i'm
rob rosenberger wood TechnoBuffalo and
this is a review of the 2017 a razor
blade stealth so first things first this
is the gunmetal version of the south and
it's only available in the 13-inch model
and with that gunmetal stealth you're
gonna lose a couple of things you're not
gonna get that backlit illuminated Razer
logo on the exterior of the laptop and
you're not gonna get the option for the
all the colors of the rainbow
RGB chroma backlit keyboard Razer is
really going for more of a business kind
of an understated for lack of a better
word stealthier looking laptop for an
audience that wants it and those two
things you're gonna lose but I don't
think it's that big of a deal so one of
the first things that stood out to me
about this laptop was just how it was
built and how light it is and I know
that we live in this digital age and
it's kind of assumed that college
students don't use textbooks anymore and
as much as I wish that was true it's not
exactly true I still have to carry a
bunch of books for classes so the weight
of my laptop really doesn't matter its
then it's lightweight it comes into
under three pounds and it's just built
to feel very premium for the price
segment this thing comes in I wouldn't
really expect anything less so it's a
slim and lightweight altra book but it's
made by Razer so the specs aren't going
to be too bad inside this thing is a
dual core i7 processor 16 gigs of dual
channel memory a 256 gig pci based SSD
and Intel HD 620 integrated graphics and
yes it's got integrated graphics but
we'll go back to that in a minute
one of the most important things on a
laptop is the display and the display on
this stuff is actually really good it's
a 13 inch quad HD plus display with a
resolution of 1300 884 K like you're
getting a smaller version but it's a
really good looking screen watching
videos on this thing was a pleasure
colors just seemed to pop off the
display text was super sharp even just
plain text on a webpage look really good
very easy to read it's a really nice
display
it also has touchscreen capabilities
built in which is really nice and it
works well in Windows 10 though I'd say
for the 98% of the time I didn't care
brought the touchscreen it was just a
really good discipline I like that razer
didn't make any sacrifices to push that
touchscreen technology into the display
but as good as this thing is indoors
outdoors is where it really starts to
crumble if I'm outside like this on an
overcast day I just can't see the screen
very well the screen just doesn't get
very bright and that's really my biggest
knock on this thing is that I love this
display inside but outside it just
doesn't look good if it's even readable
at all but for as bad as this display as
outdoors I can almost forgive that
entirely just for how good this keyboard
is everywhere it's just a really good
keyboard I've typed a lot over the past
month on this everything from notes in
class to slack messages to emails to
papers and it's just a really
comfortable keyboard to type on it
doesn't have as much travel as a
full-size mechanical keyboard but if you
compare this to the chiclet style on the
new Apple laptops like on the MacBook in
the MacBook Pro I would totally any day
of the week prefer this keyboard over
that just because it has a little bit
more travel and it feels more like a
full-size keyboard below that keyboard
is a full-size trackpad which I also
really happen to like on on the 2017
version of the south it now supports
Windows 10s precision drivers that means
it supports gestures it's very fluid
very nice to use and I just really had a
good time using it and as a whole it's a
really good sized trackpad especially
considering that this is an ultrabook
speakers built into the self are pretty
good there laptop speakers so they don't
carry a lot of bass or a lot of volume
but they're decent if you're just gonna
listen to music or watch a couple of
videos I know that battery life is
always a very hot button issue when it
comes to laptops especially ultrabooks
and I'm pretty happy to say that I got a
really good battery life out of this
stuff I was easily able to make it
throughout a full day of classes with
note-taking and web research and reading
a bunch of PDF documents online also
with a little video watching and maybe a
little video editing sprinkled in there
as well but then again do keep in mind
that this is an ultrabook
so any CPU intensive task is gonna eat
away at that battery life though the
stuff does have USB type-c so you can
charge this thing with a battery bank on
the go if you want
speaking of USB type-c let's talk i/o
the blade self has two USB 3.0 ports a
headphone jack a full size HDMI port and
a USB type-c federal port
you can use for charging as well as any
fast storage devices or something like a
razor core as a student I spent a
majority of my day researching things
taking notes in class maybe watching a
couple videos in between classes and
maybe a little gaming here and there and
happy to say that the blade handles all
that really well as they'll jump between
Chrome and Evernote and watching videos
and email pretty much any multitasking
this thing was able to handle I was also
able to do a little bit of video editing
in Premiere and I was able to edit 1080p
video on the south just fine
though I did have a little bit of issue
with 4k as to be expected
I could actually still edit a 4k
timeline but I'd have to drop the
playback quality way down I was able to
do some light gaming with the south I
could play rocket League at 60 frames
per second on low to medium HD settings
I could play battlegrounds or really
didn't run very well this really isn't
targeted to gamers though it's made by
Razer mainly because of that integrated
intel HD graphics system it's just not
powerful enough to do a lot of heavy GPU
intensive tasks however with all that
being said because this thing does
support thunderbolt over USB type-c
plugging in a razor core with a decent
GPU in there totally changes the story
at our office we paired the stealth with
a razor core with a 980ti inside and the
results were completely different we
were able to render 4k video and
premiere 80% faster and playback the 4k
video in the timeline at full resolution
flawlessly we were able to go back and
play battlegrounds at high settings and
easily maintain 60 frames per second
throughout as well as go back and play
rocket league with ultra high settings
and get some crazy high frame rates
obviously I know what the razor core
you're paying an additional price for
that piece of hardware plus a GPU but I
know plenty of people who have a beastly
gaming rig in their dorm room or
apartment and a puny little laptop or
the opposite with a heavy desktop
replacement laptop with no desktop
inside their apartment or dorm room the
razor core kind of gives you the best of
both worlds you can have a super slim
lightweight Kerbal laptop but take it
back to your dorm room or apartment plug
in one cable and turn it into a vici
gaming room so let's get down to it this
is a $1,400 books book and for that
price you expect a couple of things you
want a well-built laptop with good specs
and a computer that will handle pretty
much anything that you go to throw at it
that's also going to be slim and
lightweight and portable and I think
that the razor blades self checks all
those boxes the 2017 blade South is
almost a laptop of my dreams
I love how portable it is I love that I
can take it around with me pretty much
anywhere I liked how it performed and
despite my issues with the screen and
the integrated graphics system I really
can't recommend this thing more
especially if you're paying a premium
price like this 1,400 bucks you want
something that's going to last you for
years of college and well
I think this thing it'll definitely stay
on the test of time so what do you guys
think of the 2017 razor blade self I've
had a blast using this thing over the
past few weeks and I'd love to hear what
you guys have to say in the comments
down below thanks so much for watching
this video guys it's been a pleasure
once again i'm rob rosenberger buffalo
and i'll see you guys in the next video
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
