this it's cuz I've got the Galaxy S 4
Google Edition right here one of the
highlights of Google's i/o this is
everything you loved about Samsung's
Galaxy s4 and everything you loved about
stock Android nailed it into one awesome
phone so I'm really really looking
forward to taking this guy out of the
box put it through its paces and giving
you a for review let's get started so
here we've got the box looking very
familiar to the Samsung Galaxy s4 carry
editions and surprisingly incognito with
the table so it's the Google editions of
play edition it's a Google Play edition
whatever you want to call it it is the
stock Android version of Samsung's
flagship the galaxy s4 specs here are
exactly the same but to refresh your
memory simply provided them for us on
the back it is 4G LTE compatible with
AT&amp;amp;T LTE network
I don't believe compatibility with
t-mobile's LTE our objective same five
inch Super AMOLED screen that's 1080p
2600 milliamp hour battery that same 13
megapixel camera the 1.9 Gertz quad-core
chip and the rest of that goodness what
I don't know is what version of Android
is gonna be on here perhaps we will have
4.3 and what sort of Samsung features
are still here although I think we don't
have any I think it's surf stock Android
but be courtesy of any of the TouchWiz
features I made do it over to the device
so it looks identical to every other
galaxy s4 although on the back obviously
no carrier branding or anything sort of
denoting that it's the Play edition here
here's the AT&amp;amp;T galaxy s4 you can see
the difference there no galaxy s4
branding on this either which is also
kind of interested in dressing just
Samsung so there is the device that's so
you're also going to come in the box
sketch all this stuff off the side for a
minute we've got a book I've got a
charging cable we've got headphones with
inline mic and we've got some earbud
adapters we've got the f1 mentioned
battery for powering this sucker up when
wall wart and that is about it so not
much really new to talk about the device
it's the same galaxy s4 that we've seen
know and love for a while home button
two capacitive buttons on the side
volume rocker up and down power and lock
now is cancelling mic there's your
charge and sync port 3.5 millimeter
headset jack and IR port so let's go
ahead pop in the battery and take a look
at it so while there's not much new to
talk about the hardware the story here
is all about the software so this guy
has just been set up I have not taken a
look at any of the specs yet from the
software same points let's take a look
at it together first of all it's pretty
weird to see stock Android running on a
Galaxy s4 obviously you could do it with
routing the images were available just
right out of the box same stock Android
on this incredible hardware it's pretty
awesome let's go ahead and check out
what its gonna be included on here so no
carrier blow work because this thing is
not really on a carrier Google Wallet
though and I see that support I will go
into settings will scroll down to the
bottom about Phone Android 4.2.2 I
thought maybe we might see 4.3 but no
dice on this guy so this is stock
Android and all of its stock Android
glory we do have photosphere is here
back as well we don't have any sort of
the TouchWiz stuff let's go back into
settings and just confirm that and see
what we have here but everything appears
to be really just stock Android as
Google intended I know this phone is
gonna be very exciting for a lot of you
folks out there unlocked baseband and
ready to be tweaked and hacked and
played with I'm most excited just for
stock Android you also get much more
storage about two gigs more then you get
over a Samsung TouchWiz conversion so
obviously there's that TouchWiz space
and to be taken up here so quite nice to
see anyway anything particular you guys
want to see about this phone be here to
let us know I love to I'm sort of give
you my opinions that of course we'll do
a full review this has been a first look
and unboxing at the Samsung Galaxy s4
Play edition
