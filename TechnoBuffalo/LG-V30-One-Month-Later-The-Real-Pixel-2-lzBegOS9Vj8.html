pre-production unit for about two months
and we've had the real deal production
model for about one month I wanted to
sort of do a review one month later of
the phone and this phone goes way under
the smartphone radar it gets over shadow
session in the Android world by the
Samsung's and now the pixels of the
world but LG does what LG does really
well and they made an incredibly solid
phone that takes almost every flagship
box that perhaps you're not thinking
about when it comes to buying a new
smartphone and I think part of that
blame goes to LG the general thought
process is that the G line is their
flagship the g5 and this year the g6 and
the V line was kind of something
secondary the perhaps sat below it and
that's never been the case the V line
has been their flagship but based on the
marketing you wouldn't really know it
and there's a lot of things to like here
I think the things that I like the best
about the phone are on the back and this
is the cameras and the cameras are
incredible
this generation on the V 30 it's like a
lot of phones there are dual sensors
here it's got one that's a regular 16
megapixel sensor with an F 1.6 aperture
and optical image stabilization the
other one though it was ultra wide it's
13 megapixel with F 1.9 and these things
take incredible pictures just in auto
mode and what LG's done with the
software it's nothing short of almost
incredible there are 15 modes for
pictures and video inside of this phone
there's even a separate mode just for
food one of my favorites though is
actually the cine profile it's kind of
like what we're shooting with right now
on our sony a7s 2 it's a flat profile if
you go back later to edit and post
fraction you can tweak the colors and
bring out a lot of things it's really
cool to see that built into a phone I
guess there's gonna be one knock LG kind
of hid features inside of other modes so
inside of the cine mode for example
we've got kind of a smart zoom where if
you taps an area on the screen you can
move a slider up and it'll zoom in right
on that area it's really cool effect if
you don't know that it's there it can be
next to impossible to find but if you're
just gonna shoot pictures in auto mode
predictably the pictures are going to
look beautiful I was really surprised at
how good things looked in the low-light
you're shooting outdoors obviously
things are gonna look good almost every
situation that
through it this phone pictures looked
awesome this is one of the best camera
setups out there and they don't have
that a that unsightly camera hump it's
it's it's it flush so nice work LG on
the camera front so screen is also a big
deal when it comes to phone this is an
area where I think it gets out shadowed
by the note and the Galaxy s8 and USA
plus but the lg screen is really good
it's a six inch P OLED panel with a
slight curve to it
and it's almost bezel free it's got like
a about an 82% screen to body ratio it's
1440 by 28 a that's that stuff you'd
expect LG says the ratio is 18 by 9 I
don't know why the companies don't just
call that two-to-one it supports both
HDR formats and things look really good
on it it's not as poppy and vibrant as a
Samsung displays they new to the colors
a little bit which mean watching things
like TV shows and movies that are
usually a little more muted I think look
better watching YouTube for example and
YouTube does a lot of processing to make
the colors kind of pop a little bit more
preferred kind of the Samsung screen
this is a really nice middle ground and
the fact that it's OLED the blacks are
really black I had some concerns early
on about brightness but I had no issues
at all in direct sunlight with auto
brightness turned on when I say that I
mean to go out in direct sunlight it's
gonna detect it it's gonna kick the
brightness all the way up so you don't
have to do it yourself overall though in
almost every way that I use the phone
and looked at the screen it shined did a
really nice job so if you were gonna
take one knock on the v30 it might be
the way the phone feels if you're used
to the flagships of last generation I've
been playing with the flash stripped of
this generation you used to having kind
of a hefty foam that's got a lot of
weight to it built of very premium
materials you pick up the V 30 it is
definitely not that it almost feels too
light to even feel like there's a
battery inside and there is a battery
inside this is not users replaceable
that's a slight knock-on it's a little
bit plasticky it doesn't feel as premium
as what Samsung's our devices are and
what the pixel devices are which is
surprising especially on the pixel 2 XL
because it's it's based on this phone
and if you picked up LG stablemate the
g6 that phone felt way better to me
maybe it's a weight thing and I'm sure
it's subjective after using the phone
for a little while I got totally used to
the lightness up in the way it felt but
if you switch phones a lot or you shop
cross shopping in a store and you're
holding different device in your hands
don't let the weight of this fool you
it's a premium phone in perhaps a less
premium package those good-news-bad-news
when it comes to durability on the v30
we're actually using it with our phantom
4 in the controller we didn't secure it
well enough obviously didn't have a case
and it fell from about three and a half
feet face-first onto the screen you'd
think the screen was gonna be cracked
the phone is covered front and back and
Gorilla Glass 5 the screen was totally
fine like nothing happened but oddly the
back part that didn't touch the concrete
was completely shattered everything
still worked though the fingerprint
reader still worked and the camera was
fine just the back got completely
cracked up the hardware side is pretty
much what you'd expect from this
generation flagship at the snapdragon
835 it's got Adreno 5 4 v and 4 gigs ram
maybe 40 gigs a ram isn't gonna be
enough in a year at least for right now
I had no issues and that brings me to
LG's software I still don't like lg
software I don't like the way they
separate the menu buttons I don't like
the way they made things really granular
I like the broader settings you've got
in stock Android I even liked with
Samsung's on the software side more but
I think said that the UI here does not
slow the experience down it's not laggy
it's not buggy and you often times get
used to it I solved a lot of my issues
with just putting a Nova Launcher on and
I was able to deal with the settings
menu and how it looks like but it's not
buggy it's not laggy at all so personal
preference I didn't mind it especially
after I threw nova on here and kind of
made the phone look the way I wanted it
to look also on the software side it's
based on 7.1 - released as a filming LG
said Oreo will be coming but it's like a
big shrug emoji when that's going to
happen so assume you're gonna have
nougat for probably quite a while I do
like that they put the fingerprint
sensor where they belongs on the back
and not next to the cameras it's also a
button so you can actually push it in I
really like that as well I kind of got
used to having a power button on one of
the sides of the phones I would have
liked that here but LG's got that sort
of double tap to wake it up and that
kind of served in its place and speaking
of the double tap and to wake it up not
necessarily the seamless segue always-on
this boy I think
does some of the best always on display
here so it's here it works it's not
gonna tell you the song that's playing I
like the pixel will but it works it's
functional and it's slightly
customizable other things you'd expect
to be good or good here namely battery
life my usage is gonna be wildly
different from yours but I'm still
around 40% buy-in to the day so that
gives me about a 20% buffer to kind of
do anything else that I might do on a
heavy day like watch a lot of video
watch a TV show or do an unnecessary
amount of social media so if using the V
30 you might want to pair it with an
Android wear watch like for example the
Casio protrek smart who actually spawned
to this video to make it possible it's a
pretty awesome watch first of all if
you've ever been a fan of Cassio's like
g-shock this is an incredibly durable
watch that is meant to handle the
elements whether it's cold warm
underwater whatever you want this watch
can handle it so my favorite feature
it's got built-in low-power GPS it's not
gonna drain your battery at all one push
of the button is gonna launch Google
Maps you know exactly where you are
thrown so take those maps offline if you
want battery life is absolutely
outstanding it's got almost two screens
built-in you've got one that's black and
white to say battery and one that's that
full-color screen take advantage of
Android wear 2.0 looking for a smart
watch that's gonna be smart for your
active lifestyle I'll put a link down
below to check out to the Casio protract
smart so what do you guys think about
the V 30 I haven't been this overly
positive about a phone I think in a
while there really isn't that much to
not like about it you guys pick one up
are you debating picking one up did you
skip it completely I kind of like to
know why I'm in the comments down below
give the video a thumbs up you always
appreciate it so next time I'm drown
Ranger
