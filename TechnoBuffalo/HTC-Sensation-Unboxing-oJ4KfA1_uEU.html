TechnoBuffalo here with the phone that i
know a lot of you have been waiting for
this is the HTC Sensation for tmobile
this guy packs a tremendous punch and
really brings the super phone specs so
with a name like the sensation let's go
ahead and see if it really is all right
take a look at the box here is the
picture of the device this is running
HTC's new sense three-point Oh kind of
neat there's a seal which I think it's
probably broken we've got some specs on
the back 4g and Wi-Fi capable 1.2
gigahertz dual-core processor this is
one of the new Qualcomm dual core chips
we've seen Tegra 2 which has been
clocked at one gigahertz dual-core 1.2
so this should be an absolute screamer
4.3 inch screen matrix okay imma the
rest of that good stuff of course we're
going to talk about let's go ahead and
get to the unboxing looks like has
indeed been open to assume their selves
and sort of sim card in here go ahead
and pull that off nothing on top and
here is the sensation looking very
Android esque pull it off much thinner
than I expected you might have seen this
guy leaked months back it was called the
pyramid it's like I just powered it on I
was called the pyramid when it was
internally at HTC and it looks just like
the leap shots push it off the side for
just one quick minute see what also
going to get in the box with anything
new here t-mobile has been pretty good
at including the annuals which I will
throw on my desk they're going to live
inside of that box start guide and the
rest you can see the boot up screen
there HTC's new tiny little wall charger
we've got a pair of stereo headphones
and your sync cable all the required
stuff great and exciting let's go ahead
take a look at the phone which is most
important is something that I actually
am really excited to take a look at Noah
salvus I saw a few of it at the ibelieve
is a GD GT gathering a few weeks ago
this is the first time I've actually had
any sort of chance take a look at the
device all right so now that we've
unboxed the phone let's go ahead and run
through the specs because this guy
really packs some heck of a punch card
honestly as you can see something this
is going to be highlighted by it's
brilliant 4.3 inch qhd super LCD
capacitive touchscreen and what does
that qhd means mood you're going to get
a resolution of 540 x 960 with 16
million colors and all this is weighing
five point two ounces and i will say it
does feel very very light in the hands
i'm curious what that qhd screen is
going to look like when put up against
AMOLED Super AMOLED spray millet plus
and all the other high-end touch screens
available right now as I mentioned
earlier it's being powered by 1.2 gig
our dual core Qualcomm built Snapdragon
processor so for those of you out there
like the benchmark this thing should be
an absolute screamer and best what we
currently have from the Tegra 2 built
chip from Nvidia so it's got HTC Sense
new 3.0 we're going to go and try a real
quick it's highlighted by this new sort
of lock screen evident that you can put
a little widgets there and you can
unlock and do stuff when you get there
so here we are at the home screen then
go ahead and continue to walk you
through what else you can expect it's
got a 1520 milliamp hour battery curious
how good battery life is going to be 4
gigabytes of internal memory in a
pre-installed eight gig card of course
you can up that to 32 Wi-Fi 802 11 BG
and n on the hump this guy you got a
camera obviously with a dual LED flash
the camera is of the 8 megapixel variety
and that can record video at 1080p which
is kind of neat that's not the only
camera living on this guy all right
there's a teeny tiny little sensor which
is of the 1.3 megapixel varieties you
can go ahead and get you a front-facing
video action on achieving that's
actually a VGA camera I'm not one point
degree when these phones come in the
mail they come with some press release
you can see all
that goodness so it is a vga camera not
1.3 scratch that it's got a lot of other
goodness in here it is gingerbread
powered so this is android 2.3 no froyo
no Eclair no donut let's see or that no
cupcakes or cupcake donut Eclair Froyo
and gingerbread which proves that I know
at least the early part of my alphabet
which is quite nice that we are going to
have full gingerbread support here
really everything that you could have
wanted in a modern smartphone this guy's
packing including support for hspa+ on
the left hand side you've got your
volume rocker up and downs or
traditional HTC fair micro USB charging
got some microphones on the bottom for
noise cancellation on the right hand
side really got nothing on the top you
got your power and lock button located
on the upper right I really like that
location I'm used to it there's the vga
camera got your branding across the top
3.5 millimeter headset jack on the back
was that 8 megapixel camera with
dual-led flash there's a little bit of a
bump right there so when you put the
phone down you will have a little bit of
a rock you can keep in mind there is an
integrated kickstand here I assume the
battery gonna slide out somewhere from
the bottom okay I'll take a look at what
you guys know where the batteries going
to come from where the sim card is going
to live looks like everything was
already pre-installed ah there it is so
this comes off if you can do this live
on camera this whole back actually pops
right off look like it was three
separate pieces but it was not you've
got some soft touch here a bit of
plastic and then some other soft touch
got really nice feel on the back there's
where all the action is going to happen
and it's just one piece go ahead and
snap that back on or at least attempt to
I am not the best at getting back to
phones off but I'm not as bad as Noah
can be sometimes so there you go we got
everything all back and working let's go
ahead and run through the setup process
real fast and i'll give you guys a full
tour of sense so you guys can see what
to expect it will presumably be coming
to all HTC devices the sensation is the
first to get it so leave all your
questions comments down below things you
want to see
the sensation yeah real quick size
comparison so here we've got a 4.3 m
sensation that would just inbox here is
the droid charge also 3.5 inch the
charge is definitely not one of the
thinner phones out there you can see
sort of that size difference we go ahead
and stack them if you want to see what a
4.5 inch screen again look like next to
sensation here is the again the Samsung
built-in fuse and the 4.3 inch screen
just looks downright tiny next to it go
ahead and stack these guys you can see
what those look like and lastly let me
go ahead just power down the Samsung let
me bring in an iphone 4 take you guys
are curious how this is going to look an
upside-down iphone 4 so go ahead and do
a little stack job and if we make our
very tasty smartphone sandwich you can
see all these size comparisons are these
guys but this video is just about the
sense station so anything you guys want
to see you leave it down below be sure
to stay tuned to technobuffalo for all
the sensational coverage and i promise
you there will be very bad jokes in the
video i am jon rettinger from
technobuffalo and this has been an
unboxing of the t-mobile HTC Sensation
