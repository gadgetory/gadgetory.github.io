are brought to you by domain.com what's
going on everyone John Ranger from
technobuffalo here Android is a
fast-evolving platform going from phones
to tablets and now wearables and there's
a lot change and a lot that can happen
the next 12 months toub you decide that
you should wait or by here are my top 5
predictions for Android 4 2016 coming in
at number 5 and Android wear UI overhaul
Android wear is finally starting to hit
its stride in a wearable front but
there's still a lot of improvement on
the software side and Google knows it at
Google i/o this year we're going to see
a complete redo of what the UI looks
like for Android wear this emphasis on
swipes emphasis on gestures make you I
overall just look cleaner and more easy
to use we'll also see for the first time
manufacturers can put light skins on top
of Android wear but the core experience
and how you navigate is going to have to
say the same number for enhanced
biometrics next year Google is going to
follow Microsoft's lead and integrate
retinal scanning built into android
Nexus imprint will also see fingerprint
sensors get better be prepared to unlock
your phone with your eyes making for a
safer and easier to unlock experience
number three the return of google glass
you heard it here rumors of glasses
resurgence have been circling for the
better part of almost 12 months we've
heard rumors of a larger prism and audio
focus version and one that's got two
prisons for each eyes what we are going
to see next year is a brand new version
Flatts gonna wrap around your head come
over your ears and let you choose which
I you want to have the prism on we've
already seen the patents filed out
expect google to show it to us at Google
i/o coming in at number two Android
seven points Oh Nutella I said it and it
still sounds delicious we'll see you
hundreds of new API is but the highway
features finally going to be
split-screen multitasking built right
into Android a better backup restore
functionality and a continuous Android
experience across devices and chrome
similar to what Apple has for continuity
and expect this to be unveiled and
available for download in beta form
again at Google i/o and coming in at
number one the Google built-in Nexus
pixel will be the flagship Android 7.0
Nutella smartphone and
the only nexus in 2016 the pixel team is
setting up to the big leagues this year
part laying their experience for the
Chromebook pixel to pixel see to finally
have a phone that's google's vision of
android no longer they rely on HTC
Samsung LG or wall way to make a phone
for them Google the control everything
from start to finish delivering a phone
that I think should be absolutely killer
2016 is going to be an awesome your
friend right no matter what Google does
what do you guys looking forward to the
most up to your thoughts I don't leave
it in the comments down below till next
time gendrich and TechnoBuffalo see you
