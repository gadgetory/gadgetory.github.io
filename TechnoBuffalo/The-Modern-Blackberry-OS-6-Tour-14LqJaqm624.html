TechnoBuffalo here I want to give you a
tour of the new BlackBerry operating
system OS 6.0 a lot has been made about
this I'm sort of being the first modern
blackberry operating system it's got a
full web kit and multi-touch browser and
a lot of really cool features under the
hood so I want to show you what you guys
can expect when you pick up your
blackberry torch or another OS stick
capable device that will be coming out
in the future let's get started
all right
so let's start with the home screen
there's gonna be a lot to talk about the
home screen here completely redone from
what we've seen on previous devices so
we'll start at the very top to go ahead
and tap the time now you get all your
wireless controls right at the top sir
actually quite handy to see
notifications are being handled very
elegantly now with OS 6.0 I similar to
what we see on Android with the pull
down tray you get full notifications
here but the top you can see I've got 16
messages that little icon at the Social
Feeds there's full integration right out
of the box for Twitter for Facebook and
for MySpace yes notifications pop up
right on top you can send them to every
time you have a not reply every time you
get a message on facebook however you
like this message to appear you now have
the option doing it the social affines
as well you also have a full RSS reader
and I think notifications whenever your
site that you're looking at has closed
did something new let's go and see what
that looks like if you go ahead and tap
it you can see I've got messages
calendar social feed will show up right
there and phone down below will show if
you have missed calls or whatever is
been going on I really is quite handy
jumping on over to the right side
there's a little magnifying glass you
now have a full universal search which
is quite nice so a search across
calendars contacts or world search the
web I was he Universal search on a lot
of other devices and I'm gonna hear me
say iPhone and Android this is really
what this is aiming at but this is a
very elegant and it works very well
solution Universal search if you want to
change profile you can now just tap to a
profile guy and select what you'd like
but that's not the most exciting thing
let's talk about these rows of icons and
at the home screen here so it's now been
divided two different sort of
subcategories we've got frequents you
can see right here if you go ahead and
go to the right you can see downloads
can you view all your downloaded
applications and go to media and see all
your media and we'll talk about media a
little bit later keep going over
favorites if you want to set favorites
they show up right there and here is all
now I've got two rows of icons right
here you've actually set it to show how
much or how little you'd like so if you
only want to show one row of icons and
go ahead and set that and as you go
through the phone you come back to the
home screen remember how you had it set
last so it'll come back to the one row
of icons
I feel like more ayat that I showed you
before I - you can have three or you can
have the whole screen filled up with
icon depending on what you like and with
the capacitive touchscreen here it's a
very smooth experience this is not a
sure press scream that you've seen on
previous BlackBerry devices the storms
in particular this is a typical sort of
traditional capacitive screen it doesn't
move at all
but it is very responsive so go ahead
and push that back down to - it makes it
a very easy way to navigate your
programs moving things around are really
easy if you go ahead and hold it down
you get sort of new options that will
come off you can sort of mark it as a
favorite and go to the favorites
category sort of get that star a
reminiscent to what you see in Gmail you
can move it or move it to a folder hide
it or you can surf show things up in the
full blackberry menu works very well
it's really easy to use and the menus
are very finger friendly and speaking of
the menus previous blackbriar operating
systems had what I like to call a simple
elegance the very list century had a
scroll through it and certainly wasn't
very finger friendly as we saw with the
storms right now though however with the
the BlackBerry OS 6 you can do a lot
more let me show you what that looks
like with options all right so go ahead
and open this up and I see that the
options menu think completely redone all
the options they've had in previous
devices are here they sort of been
categorized in different of different
ways so I'm going jump back to sound and
ringtones you can see that now
everything is a very finger friendly so
you can set you know ringtones it can
pick what you like and this is sort of
similar what you've seen in the past
it's not a complete review by any
stretch of the imagination but it does
make things much much much more
finger-friendly
so go ahead and to jump back so being a
blackberry obviously email is really
important to BlackBerry users it's
really its BlackBerry's bread-and-butter
if they've been known for there's a
fantastic integrated email experience
and that is really quite true with OS 6
really get just a fantastic through
email as we've seen in the past it's
very smooth scrolling can view all your
emails in your folder your exchange
connectivity if you like it with a black
break exchange server it just works
really well there's not that much talk
about Blackbird email it's probably the
best email experience on any mobile
device if you haven't tried blackberry
email it's really worth it if email is
very important to you
it's very hard to beat blackberry and
I've said many many many times for all
the great things the iPhone does its
email application is awful absolutely
atrocious for a power user or a business
user what you can do with mail on
BlackBerry's so far superior than what
you can do with it on an iPhone Android
is probably second behind blackberry
it's certainly different options from
mail and how you want to set it because
of androids are open infrastructure you
can sort of choose the best mail client
again apples it's closed yet they're
going to deal with what they have so
really the conclusion of that would be
email experience here is fantastic let's
go ahead and talk a little bit about
keyboards high input text and this is a
software tour but that sort of plays
into some of the devices are some of the
things you can do with the device I'm
going to open up tech message here I'm
go ahead and open a a new method and you
can see that right off the bat I have a
keyboard that shows up it looks it's on
the front like it's just a slate device
you can use a keyboard in portrait or
landscape and go ahead and start typing
it doesn't work very well of course this
is actually the first device that RIM is
made that has a full spied out keyboard
looks very similar what you've seen on
the bold it's a very nice keyboard
however the on-screen keyboard is not
bad although hard to get used to the
screens can be considered on a small
side of 3.2 inches however when you're
typing in landscape it's not so bad I
didn't want to show you here the
keyboard looks like let me go ahead and
jump down to a field and it's go ahead
and hide it for a second alright so you
have to keep we're ready to go you can
sort of see how it looks here now
admittedly I'm not that used to it but
it does have a pretty solid autocorrect
feature so this is a test so not the
most accurate but not bad it's a little
bit better when you type in landscape so
if you do want to input a quick method
without sliding out the keyboard you
definitely be able to do that here with
the torch I know also you may have seen
the operating system works fully in
landscape mode as well I can go ahead
and just give this little twist and you
can go ahead and operate the phone just
as you would in portrait it still shows
those two rows you can move it down to
one and I'll just talk about you can
still do here as well so let's talk
about browsing which is really important
BlackBerry has been so far behind when
it comes
web-browsing really and that's what
they've lost a lot of their market share
people that are looking for a
full-featured browser they weren't
getting people were jumping to webOS
Android and iPhone
well blackberry has an R in particular
has responded they bought a company that
really was making some WebKit browsers
which is the same browser sort of
standard I suppose that we've seen on
other manufacturers and they've done a
pretty nice job go ahead and jump into
the browser
we've got TechnoBuffalo here queued up
looks a little bit on the small side you
can double tap to zoom in first of all
that's not the only way you can
manipulate text you now have multi-touch
you can pinch to zoom your way through
the operating system and now it's
through the web browser a little bit of
the sort of checkerboard pattern here it
does have I believe of 624 megahertz
processor and web browsing is really the
only spot where I saw the phone lag a
little bit so you go ahead and
multi-touch and zoom in and out just
work pretty well sometimes they'll get a
little bit of a lag if you saw right
there but it does work so you've been
waiting for a browser on a BlackBerry
device stuff sort of up to par to modern
standards you are going to get it with
iOS 6 in this particular case the
blackberry torch the other area where
RIM was a little bit deficient as well
was medius let's talked about that sort
of very quickly I'll go ahead and jump
on into media the multi-touch we just
showed is also true now pictures you can
go ahead and view pictures with the
multi-touch capabilities to go ahead and
look at the wallpapers for example go
ahead and look at one of them you can
zoom in or zoom out if you'd like you
can go and scroll to the next one it's a
pretty smooth experience and so you get
that same sort of pinch to zoom and
they'll rotate as you move your phone as
well sort of what you would expect
overall I've been very impressed with OS
6.0 I was a blackberry user years ago
and I had had to have the user version
of bold I used the first dishing out of
the purl 9700 is a ton of BlackBerry
devices I'm really happy to see a rim
sort of embrace finally sort of the
modern world of smartphones I think they
really have a nice package here a lot of
potential the following out racism is
not without its bugs I've had a few
freezes I've had these menus not show up
of how to restart the device a few times
but I guess it's served to be expected
with a first release of the operating
system I think when the first update
comes I'll probably see those issues be
fixed overall a very impressive
BlackBerry OS 6.0 what are you guys
saying are you guys been waiting for a
BlackBerry device I could do the stuff
are you over BlackBerry already jump
ship crews hear what you guys have to
say stay tuned of course TechnoBuffalo

torch coverage we will be doing a ton
more coming up and for exclusive content
