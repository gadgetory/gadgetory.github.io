berlin at Aoife at the asuste booth they
have a lovely showcase going on and this
is a really cool product I can't wait to
show you this is the transformer book
trio this is actually three devices in
one which is pretty neat we've seen a
lot of kind of multifunctionality
devices and this one really kind of
takes the cake so obviously you can see
we have your Windows 8 Start menu here
that you're flipping through you know
let's say you're pulling out in the mood
for windows 8 let's say you're in the
mood for Android boom click of a button
right there Android 4.2 point2 for you
on this 11.6 inch display you are able
to use the dock and it has a lot of
power inside the stock this dock
actually will give you four gigs of ddr3
RAM 802 11 AC Wi-Fi Bluetooth 4.0 and a
Haswell chip that is serious business in
here it's really fast like shockingly so
which is really really neat and you can
see just click of a button it just
changes right away really really quickly
now you can use your android device just
the way you would a laptop use your
Android holo theme any way that you want
to do it however let's say you wanted to
take this thing off of the doc well you
just push a button and boom there it is
you can now take this beautiful 11.6
inch tablet all around show all your
friends put it in a bag whatever you
want to do and if you don't want to deal
with the doc fits too unwieldy for you
you can take it around so let's take a
look at the back same kind of brushed
look that a sous is really famous for a
5 megapixel shooter on the back of here
in case you ever needed to take a
picture got some speakers here they
actually have audio inside the dock by
ice power and there's Bang &amp;amp; Olufsen
technology inside the dock itself here's
your volume rockers for the tablet part
of it and the sleep button on top really
easy to snap back on it feels really
sturdy it's not it doesn't feel like
it's wobbly or anything like that if you
take the tablet off of its dock you
actually have some compromises that need
to be made so once you take it off the
dock you're actually looking at only and
I hate saying only 2 gigs of RAM 802 11
and Wi-Fi instead of 802 11 AC Bluetooth
3.0 and a 1.6 gigahertz Intel at
processor so there is a little bit of a
trade-off there's it there's a sacrifice
to be made when you take the book trio
off of its dock but this is a really
cool device and for anybody who uses
windows maybe on their desktop and is a
really big fan of Android I mean look at
how fast it is that is really quick it's
amazing how quickly you can switch back
and forth between Android and Windows 8
and I'm sure this will only get better
as things like Windows 8.1 comes out
where it's a lot more optimized but
really great job from Sue's this is it
this is such a cool product and I think
that a lot of you guys out there would
be excited to see it let's say you got
your tablet you got your laptop you can
use this as a laptop with this screen
let's say gosh somebody wants to use
your tablet your kids want you to have
your wife your husband you can give this
to them and then take the stock it is a
desktop PC that's right ladies and
gentlemen you can take this device plug
it into a monitor or any kind of screen
that will take the display out or USB or
HDMI and you can use this as a Windows
computer that is pretty incredible and
impressive so really you're getting two
devices in one that can be used together
or separate individually super awesome
so you're probably wondering when you
even get your hands on this if you're in
the US mid-october no pricing yet but I
think it's going to be worth it for any
of you out there who are really into
this device and this is this is very
cool I mean you're getting three
different use cases out of it you got a
laptop a tablet and a desktop PC it's
pretty amazing stuff happening over here
