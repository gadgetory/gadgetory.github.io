TechnoBuffalo here unboxing the brand
new ipod touched this is the one of the
front and the rear facing camera Retina
display and ready for FaceTime let's go
ahead and dig in so here we've got the
box of the new iPod Touch looks very
similar what we've seen on older models
this is the 8 gigabyte version right
here I'm just going to set you back just
about 220 bucks if you want the 32 gig
it's gonna be 299 and 64 is going to be
a whopping 399 so let's go ahead and
open this sucker up so there is the Aero
tape go ahead and pull that off there we
go should be able to slide this open and
here we've got the new iPod Touch which
we will close off to the side for just
one moment and I expect it will find the
usual Apple goodies in here fingertips
got a USB secant cable
nice that boasts 30 pin connector and
we've got headphones just simple
headphones no inline microphone there
and that's about it so enough for the
box it's going to take a look at the
iPod shuffle it's often quite excited to
see how this thing works go ahead and
pull off plastic peel off the covering
and this thing feels very small it still
has that tapered edge you don't have the
little black part in the upper left hand
corner anymore that shows where the
Wi-Fi radio is it's now it's sort of
hidden in here looks very nice let's
take a look what we got so here is the
home button you've got the front facing
camera on top which I believe is just
about a third of a megapixel on the back
there is where a lot of the action is
going to happen a lot of where the new
things are the rear-facing camera is
capable of shooting Full HD video so at
720p up to 30 frames per second I'm
still photos with a 960 by 720p with the
backhand which is pretty cool you know
not too bad the front can shoot VGA
resolution so this play is the same size
we've seen in the past 3.5 inches
although it now has the new Retina
display what are you going to up its
resolution
960 by 640 this thing is quite a beast
so I'm very excited going to take a look
at let's go ahead and pull this next to
let's say an iPhone 4 and see if there
is much of a difference go and do put
those four side by side let's go ahead
and stack them you can see that there's
huge huge difference when it comes to
thickness and pull that off so stay
tuned for the channel and TechnoBuffalo
for a ton more coverage on the ipod
touch I'll be showing how 3d gaming
works on it we're showing some FaceTime
demos a ton of other I think pretty cool
stuff so I'm John writer from
TechnoBuffalo stay tuned and I'll see
you the next video
buh-bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
