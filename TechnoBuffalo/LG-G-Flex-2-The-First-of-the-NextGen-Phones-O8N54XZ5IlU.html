to you by the all-new G flex 2 from LG
life's good
what's up everyone John render from
technobuffalo here LG Justin veiled the
G flex 2 and I figured what better way
to learn about the phone then the
gentleman who actually announced the
phone to the world I am here with
frankly who actually has a device with
him I do I do here it is so can you tell
us a little bit about the device and
where you guys saw room for improvement
versus the first generation I mean there
was so much excitement last year we've
unveiled this and consumers just simply
told us Full HD please so that's the
first thing we did I brought that into
the phone and then we brought it down to
about 5.5 don't that that's important I
think that has broader appeal and it's
funny right now 5.5 is a sweet spot at
one time I don't know you know it's
rather large but now it's sort of
standard so 5.5 is average go back a few
years look like a monstrous device it's
incredible so one of the cool things
about the phoniest and a myriad of cool
things SD card supports here but now
support for 2 terabytes of storage
that's right and I mean that's great of
the industry no overall so that ability
now to put that so the consumers and
control other content and just making it
easier and not creating confusing plans
or confusing options for consumers so
you can just put in your own micro SD
card and you're good to go so if
consumers want to download the Library
of Congress six times there's there's
plenty of room for it they're good to go
so one of the I think the flagship
features aside from the curve design is
the back yes the ability to heal and
that's been improved as well versus the
first gen card yes and of course I mean
it this device for us was like a proof
of concept for us it does stress test of
hey we've all these core technologies
and rather than just building prototypes
and showing conceptual ideas can we go
to the market when the action so the
self-healing back was important because
people are telling us that you know that
yeah yeah I don't want it tomorrow I
don't want it to pick up fingerprints so
we've seen that with like the g3 how
that's improved in that place but for
the self-healing technology working with
our partners we've increased the
capabilities so you're looking at now in
seconds in fact the video that I show
today that test video we actually had to
cool down the room just so you could see
the scratch is being traded by that
brass brush and you explain the self
healings people can understand what that
actually means yeah absolutely so what's
happening is the material that the this
back is made of has a lot of hydrogen
atoms okay and so I'm gonna put this
phone down now and what happens is when
when when there's I got a scratch what
happens to the surface if there's an
indentation at a very you know
microscopic level so you and I were
hydrogen bonds and we get pushed to one
another hydron has a natural probability
of that equidistant itself or one
another so once we get crushed together
like no I hey give me my space and we
all begin to push eventually we push
back out and that a dent or scratch gets
pushed back by the material itself so
therefore and I want a disclaimer is if
you scratch the point the materials
coming off then the healing process is
going to be limited but natural scoffs
wear and tear no minor drops all that
stuff you should see repair that you
wouldn't be able to enjoy with a regular
phone and a lot of these phones that
have unique designs usually there's a
sacrifice on powers a curse on
performance you guys this is you turn
this phone until we the next generation
of super phones being powered by the
snapdragon 810 ship which I'm pretty
sure is more powerful than my laptop
like two years well I know it's crazy I
mean it's a 64-bit octa-core was that a
difficult thing to get into the device
or was that sort of on your plans from
day one well absolutely I mean that that
was our ambition right we really wanted
to go hey this is not just going to be
this a prototype phone that we just saw
right there we want this to be
legitimate phone that people are going
to want and so we definitely partnered
with qualcomm how do we make sure that
we could take advantage of your 64-bit
octa-core and so we even had to change
the chipset architecture of our display
to be able to fully take advantage of
what the qualcomm trips that can do for
us so it's a law collaboration and we're
excited because it's not so much about
oh it's the fastest and all that but
it's just demonstrating that hey LG
wants to continually consistently bring
the best product not just new and faster
bigger but bring the best to the market
and legitimately allow the G flex 2 to
get a chance to be that flagship premium
product with mass appeal and that curved
screen addition to just looking really
cool has a few advantages and certainly
it's it's ergonomic for the back pocket
you know I think a lot of people are
excited about but also brings a couple
other cool things to the table am I
telling a little bit about that
absolutely rath about durability right
so the fact that it because of its form
factor it already will begin to disperse
any impact over the full surface of this
of the screen plus the fact that we have
put our own treatment on that glass to
improve the strength by twenty percent
RAF the bat it is an aesthetic its
respective right that it hasn't been
there it's been a long time since a
product a piece of glass and plastic and
composite metals have gotten consumers
excited I haven't been excited now with
the G flex 2 from a color standpoint
from a design standpoint it allows
people like especially you to go wow you
know things that I've heard about
prototypes concepts they can really be
coming to market soon they're not future
they're near future stuff now thank you
very much for the time I appreciate and
go look at the rest of the show thank
you my pleasure this episode of
technobuffalo is brought to you by the
all new G flex 2 from LG life's good
