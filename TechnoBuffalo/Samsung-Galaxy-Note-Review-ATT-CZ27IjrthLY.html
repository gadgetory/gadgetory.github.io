TechnoBuffalo here at the full review of
the AT&amp;amp;T branded LTE capable galaxy
notes this is the largest smartphone on
the planet is it a phablet is it a tone
is it too big for your pants let's go
ahead and answer all these questions as
we take a look at the Galaxy Note
so if you aren't a monster phone nerd
like me chances are you don't have the
spec to this phone memorize let me recap
what you can get in your 5.3 inch
package just go ahead and make your
jokes it is running Android 2.3 and that
is of course gingerbread we are living
in an Ice Cream Sandwich world and a
phone with Gingerbread certainly isn't
looked on with giant Smiley's and happy
faces
Samsung has said that Ice Cream Sandwich
will be coming we're expecting it
sometime in March from a price
standpoint it's going to be 299 bucks
with a two-year contract but you know
sometimes deals happen so you're gonna
want to check your retailer for updated
pricing from a dimension standpoint five
point seven eight inches down three
point to seven inches across and a very
thin point three eight inches there on
the diameter so it's a large phone but a
very thin phone and all that's gonna
come in at a six point four five ounce
package so not the heaviest phone in the
world despite its size so that display
5.3 inches it's a resolution of 1280 by
800 WX VGA HD Super AMOLED screen so
that giant resolution screen something
we Raph they're gonna talk about it's
gonna give you an extra row of icons
especially when you're on the home
screen as opposed to most Android phones
that give you four we got five across
and we'll talk about that screen a
little bit more as we move along through
the review a giant phone giant screen
giant battery as a 2500 milliamp hour
battery which Samsung says is gonna be
good for about 10 hours of talktime
we'll talk a bit more about battery life
oddly enough it's a 100 milli amp hour
smaller than the European and loft
version comes in at 2600 million by our
batteries and speaking of differences
between the European version this guy is
running a 1.5 gigahertz dual-core
Qualcomm built chipset I did a
comparison of the European versus the
AT&amp;amp;T version so you can check that link
out down below in case you want to see
the differences are but this is the 1.5
gigahertz Qualcomm model it's got a gig
of ram 16 gigs
storage internal with micro USD
expandability on the back we've got boom
8 megapixel camera with LED flash I can
shoot 1080p video at 30 frames per
second that guy 30 frames per second of
course LED flash but it also has 18
megapixel camera on the front right
there boom that's the front-facing
camera that's why I said boom in case
you're wondering it is running on AT&amp;amp;T
LTE network with backwards compatibility
for HSPA+ or fallback rather for HSPA+
it's got bluetooth 3.0 one other bit of
note that I'm not really gonna talk that
much about because for me it's not
overly useful it's got something called
an S Pen don't call it a stylus Samsung
will get mad S Pen uses Wacom technology
you can draw right on the phone
the most useful thing about the S Pen
for me actually was that if you hold
down one this here button on this your S
Pen and it tapped the screen take
screenshot and then you can edit that
screenshot and you can draw right on it
so I'll show you a little bit about the
S Pen we'll go ahead and hit that the
color stay red because I'm feeling like
I'm in a red moon go ahead and exit out
of that and now I can draw hi and I can
write stuff and I can do different
pressure sensitivity I think it's got 32
different points of pressure you can go
ahead and race and do it everyone so why
did that be useful if you need to draw
something or sketch something if you're
sending at Google Maps to someone go
ahead and draw some notes right on there
for me I didn't really use it but the S
Pen doesn't take up much space doesn't
really bother me so it's always nice to
have and not use then to need it and not
have it so for my personal needs I
didn't find they're really useful but
perhaps for you you might so hey
yes pen lives there and that happened
alright so a lot of this stuff on the
for review I covered when I did the
review of the International Galaxy Note
and I also did a 30 days later with that
Galaxy Note both those videos are gonna
be down below so I'm going to talk about
what makes this version unique and my
thoughts and opinions on it and I'll
recap very quickly my thoughts on the
Galaxy Note
so as using the
Arpi inversion for the better part of a
month and a half and then I switched
over to the 18 T version so for about
two months this has been the only phone
that I've been using only phone died
very happily I've been using the first
thing you got to know about the Galaxy
Note is it's a big phone and on paper
you look at 5.3 inches you're gonna say
no way too big that is ridiculous
silly I'm gonna look like a madman or
woman talking on this phone uh yeah you
look a little bit silly holding up to
your head I personally love the extra
screen real estate it's been absolutely
tremendous for me when you go ahead and
look at a website let's go ahead and
launch TechnoBuffalo here you can see
where things really come in handy the
extra resolution extra screen size means
you're gonna get more content on the
page so if you're someone like me that
likes to do a lot of work on your phone
this is gonna be tremendous right here
you know I can view almost five articles
on one page and generally
high-resolution phones I haven't enjoyed
because this thing's looks so small for
the screen so small 5.3 inches though
looks quite nice the next fear that I
had but it's not gonna fit in my pants
in my pocket it will and it does
definitely it takes some getting used to
but it's not as odd as you might think
this is definitely one of those phones
that are in the market for a new device
you want to go to the store and try it
you have to hold in your hand to see if
it's going to work for you
it's not so easy for one-handed use
because it is so big I have relatively
large hands with a freakish thumb
actually I know my thumb is gigantic so
for me it's been okay but if you're you
know smaller frame Dora if you're a
woman with smaller hands definitely
gonna need to hand operation this is a
phone that is not for everybody this is
a phone that is not meant for everybody
I look at certain mainstream devices
you're gonna look at a device like the
iPhone 4s and you on the Android side
let's pick the Galaxy Nexus as a phone
with a more conventional form factor as
a phone with the more reasonable size
that could fit in most pockets and fit
in most purses this phone is not that
certainly it's meant for a certain
subsection of users that want that
bigger screen real estate and I think
that if you're a fan of Android that
means you're also a fan of device choice
you like the openness you like that you
can have sort of different screen size
different resolutions so you can find
the phone
that best fits fits you and can fit you
know your friend or every else might be
you might might eat it and for me this
phone fits me perfectly where is
something smaller like say the Galaxy
Nexus I appreciate that it's around
I like having more screen real estate so
this phone has been wonderful for me but
again not gonna be for everyone you're
really gonna have to go and check it out
as you can tell by effect I'll be using
it for the past two months I have
absolutely loved it and it's probably
been my favorite phone of the past 12
months I'd say the past a year but you
know we're only in February at least
when I'm filming this review wonderfully
powerful device a knock on it though
certainly is that it's running
Gingerbread and Ice Cream Sandwich world
hopefully we'll see a Samsung build of
gingerbread with TouchWiz on top of it
soon if not we can hope that the
cyanogen team can release their version
of a custom ROM for the so at least we
can get our Ice Cream Sandwich nest on
next thing let's talk about battery life
and that was one of my big concerns one
of my concerns that completely went away
when I used the European galaxy note I
was able to get through a full day
taking it off the phone or off the
charger rather at 7:30 I was able to get
to about midnight was still 4050 percent
battery life which is pretty impressive
it's about five to ten percent less on
the 18 key LTE version we have LTE here
in the office so it has LTE signal
connected to Wi-Fi most of the day and
generally now I've got about 40 percent
to 35 to 40 by time I go to bed at night
which it's wonderful I charge my phone
every night I expect to charge my phone
every night you're probably not gonna
get two days use out of this but you can
easily get a day and a half if you have
battery fears or concerns I don't really
need to worry that much the battery is
removable though so you can always pick
up another one and go on your way
so that was one of the other big
concerns that I had LTE is certainly
gonna vary depending where you are the
screen here and a lots been made about
the screen
it's a beautiful display one of the more
beautiful displays I've seen but it's a
pentile display meaning the arrangement
of pixels has a bit more of a blue and
green pixels and other devices but for
me things look great you know blacks
look black colors look vibrant
probably one of the better-looking
screens I've seen that's my dog Lucy so
you can see Lucia the demonstration here
of the camera I'm trying to cover things
that are unique to the particular device
that I didn't cover in my review of the
European version TouchWiz is this
TouchWiz I mean you sort of know what
you're getting again it's custom overlay
on top of Android you're getting a
different way to go ahead and view icons
and shortcuts that sort of pops up here
nicely you can pick widgets you get it
all right here from the bottom it's a
little bit processor intensive and RAM
heavy I do like I'm a pulldown I can go
ahead and adjust things right away
airplane mode is here on the GT version
on the European version get an option to
set it to vibrate which I really did
like having the option to have again
Android you can't really customize and
make it your own but you know I've done
a little bit of to sort of make this
phone work for me I've got a custom
unlocker here I can go ahead and unlock
it I can go jump into Mayo and go to
messages or I can call my wife so go
ahead and unlock I'm not gonna call her
on camera
the next thing people be making a big
deal about and I think rightfully so it
was a processor Samsung has elected to
go with Qualcomm for the ETA version
that has to do with LTE they need
chipset that's compatible of LT radios
Qualcomm currently is one of the leading
providers of those so yeah it's got a
slower it's a slower processor there's
no way around it then the accessor I
found the European version you saw that
one did my comparison and we saw the
quadrant scores I haven't noticed any
difference though in real-world usage my
reload usage isn't very processed or
heavy I used a lot of email on it I'm
not playing 3d games very much I don't
have time unfortunately so I haven't
done as much of a difference but if
you're the kind of person that likes to
push your phone to the max to the max
then you know you're gonna want to
consider perhaps looking at the HSPA+
European version if the galaxy notes
what you want but if you're an everyday
user that plays and likes to play games
and you know use your phone for email
text video and web you're not gonna
notice any problems with the device at
all I really enjoyed the Galaxy Note one
thing that I do want to mention that I
really haven't liked are these four
capacitive buttons across the bottom I
really did much like more it didn't much
like more I speak English
the main home button here on the
European galaxy note but that's a design
choice and if you never had the European
Galaxy Note you're gonna be used he's
capacitive buttons next question that I
always get is what's gonna happen with
these buttons once Ice Cream Sandwich
hits good question
you've probably seen the Galaxy Nexus
that doesn't have any physical buttons
that uses sort of virtual buttons these
are gonna be repositioned the menu
buttons are gonna do something a little
bit different a home button if you hold
it down you can watch multitasking
they're still going to be in use you're
not gonna have virtual buttons here with
the Ice Cream Sandwich build that
Samsung is going to put out or that the
cyanogen team is going to be putting out
so hey hopefully that helped answer your
question so overall I really enjoyed
this phone it's a film that's going to
be in my pocket and I've got access to
you know pretty much every device out
there this is the one that I am choosing
to carry with me it's definitely a very
polarizing device it looks a little bit
odd at first something you have to get
used to but for me this is where I would
put my smartphone dollar right now if I
was looking to get a phone today on a
two-year contract this is the Galaxy
Note 4 AT&amp;amp;T sure check us out at
