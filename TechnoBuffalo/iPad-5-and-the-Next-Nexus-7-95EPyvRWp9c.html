to you by carbonite welcome back to the
episode of rumor roundup I'm your host
Jon Rangers to show we round up all the
rumors from the week and condense them
into one video that tells you everything
you need to know we are shooting this
video in Scottsdale Arizona we are here
for some automotive events thought to be
a beautiful backdrop to shoot this
week's rumor roundup so up this week on
rumor roundup the ipad 5 parts already
starting to leak weirding rumors of the
next Nexus 7 youtube looks like they're
getting ready to offer subscriptions and
lastly Nokia's getting ready to announce
some new device that mobile commerce
only a few weeks away it's from around
up it's go and get started so you know
that brand new nexus 7 you've been
loving for a few months now looking like
it might be outdated google reportedly
announced the second-generation Nexus 7
tablet in May rumors all suggests
they've kept a sous on as the
manufacturer Nexus 7 is one of my
favorite 7-inch tablet it really helped
bring that 7 inch size mainstream looks
like the sequel is coming right up
presumably upgrades will be a little
better screen hopefully 1080 and Tegra 4
on board expect the same size and
overall build quality a little bit of a
smaller bezel I'm pretty excited to see
declarations the nexus 7 hopefully it'll
bring with it a brand new operating
system maybe we'll finally see key lime
pie take its bow on stage no more of
this jelly bean business so apple seems
to be on a tear with the ipad is only a
few months between the ipad 3rd
generation in the ipad 4 and now they've
announced they're going up again to 128
gigs they can't leave well enough alone
and it looks like the iPad 5 is going to
be coming as early as March 9to5 mac
publishing photos that look like just a
bigger back panel of an iPad Mini it's
got that same matte black look there's
only the white version also follow suit
and follow design scheme from the ipad
mini looks really nice I loved away the
black iPad Mini look I'd love to see
that design carry over to its larger
brother nothing else is really known
here expect to have the next generation
processor perhaps even a jump to a core
but I wouldn't get your hopes up
so if you're thinking about getting an
iPad as a moral here you are much better
off waiting a few months if you can to
see what might come to very least get
the last generation ipad 44 i discounted
price especially for looking at that 128
gig model the tragic 800 bucks for
that's a lot of moolah so Mobile World
Congress is coming up next month do you
guys don't know what it is it is one of
the largest phone shows of the year
where most manufacturers showed their
hot new hardware that's going to grace
our pockets over the next 12 months
nokia announced their keynote for
februari 25th in barcelona of course
technobuffalo will be there rumors
already swirling about what they are
going to announce so you can expect an
update to the Lumia 920 to include a
true PureView camera out of this peer
review light we've seen on the 920 a
legit PureView camera sees you guys
looking to ditch your DSLR or at least
your point and shoots you can look
forward to that in the coming weeks no
other rumors of specs but I'm hoping
we're gonna see support for 1080p
displays from Microsoft I would
certainly expect Steve Ballmer to come
aggressively running on stage baba also
love to see the Lumia line slimmed down
a little bit the flagship 920 is quite
the chunker like at sea go on a diet and
the last rumor of the week is kind of an
interesting when this one's been
swirling for it seems like years now but
looks like YouTube is finally getting
ready to offer subscriptions and I want
to see I'm not really sure how I feel
about this one so essentially what the
model is going to be gonna offer content
creators the option to offer
subscriptions not gonna force anybody to
pay those guys that don't want to watch
ads content providers can charge either
one to five dollars and you can watch
all the contents you want ad free if you
don't want to pay the price then you can
just watch the content as you would in
the past and i want to see i'm totally
on the fence of this i watch a ton of
youtube videos i watch probably 10 to 20
videos a dane quite honestly i don't
want to pay to watch all those videos i
don't mind watching at it serve an
expected thing that when you watch
videos content providers are putting up
those videos for freely not asking me to
pay right now so I don't mind sort of
giving them a reward for their hard work
me making relate to that a little bit on
the other side I suppose it would be
nice to have additional source of income
I think the scripture models gonna be a
bit of a tricky thing at least at first
people aren't gonna be used to it I'm
not sure what we're gonna do if it comes
to it love to hear your guys thoughts on
it I'm not the biggest fan of
subscription service I think YouTube has
all
it's been a free service and I think
it's always worked out very well it
certainly gave us our start and I
certainly wouldn't want to charge the
audience something they were already
getting for free but we'll see what
happens when it finally gets announced
I'm surely be of plans or hopefully it's
not gonna affect the end user you who
watches a video but it's very
interesting to see youtube sort of
changed a paradigm for video hopefully
it'll be like the partner program
everybody can have access to it and
people can decide whether or not it's
right for them I supposed end of the day
choice is better and the content
provided as an audience we figure out
what suits them best so we go and stop
