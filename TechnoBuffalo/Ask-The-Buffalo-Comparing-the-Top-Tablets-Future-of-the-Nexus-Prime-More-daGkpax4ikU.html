to you by Squarespace because people
love corners welcome back everyone to
another episode of ask the Buffalo this
time though we are in our new set new
studio my new office
conceal a new background behind me
excuse all the white walls in this area
we are still decorating with me for
suggestions of what we should put behind
me so as to Buffalo's a series where you
can ask me John rector
any question that you have from the wide
wide wide world of technology today
we're gonna be talking apple we're gonna
be talking tablets we're gonna be
talking Android of course how we're
gonna be talking some personal in
history so let's go ahead and get
started
this is ask the Buffalo so if you want
to spend in question is to ask the
Buffalo and have your name and question
featured in one of these upcoming videos
you can do it in one of two ways first
you can go ahead and go to TechnoBuffalo
calm every tuesday afternoon we will put
up a post asking for questions it'll be
live until Thursday you can leave them
down below in the comments or if
sticking to a calendar is not your thing
you can send questions any time a day
two at TechnoBuffalo using the hashtag
ask the bee ask your question I will
read it and I will put it in this video
so without further ado let's go ahead
and get to our first question
our first question comes from Lee who
wants to talk about Android tablets John
how do Android tablets compared to the
iPad so of course you're talking about
androids tablet operating system
honeycomb uh that's really the same
question that people have when they ask
how Android computers - I owe s they're
both excellent could be both do very
different things Android is going to
give you a ton more customization
options certainly a honeycomb is a
little bit less customizable II then say
gingerbread is the operating system used
on the phones but you do get a lot more
flexibility over what you can do with
your device I can go ahead and change
your settings you can change the way
icons look and there's a lot more things
you can do in the legal hacking realm if
you look on over in the iOS side things
are very tight-knit completely
vertically integrated and you're in
Apple's walled garden if you're okay
with an icon-based
interface and you're okay with using
iTunes and you use iTunes anyway and you
want to stay that ecosystem it's going
to be very smooth and fluid and it works
very well Apple controls the hardware
applicant role is a software absolute
vertical integration means you can get a
very very seamless experience but if on
the other side of it let's say you're
not an Apple user you don't use iTunes
very much you use this third-party for
managing your music and you want the
customization you want the flexibility
androids going to give you you want to
determine what your tablet's gonna look
like you know what your tablet to
determine itself what it's going to look
like then Android is going to be a very
good way to go they're both awesome
tablets and they both make awesome
tablets some Android tablets are better
than others in my experience the two
best Android tablets and these thus far
are the Samsung Galaxy Tab line 10.1 if
you want the big size is great or any of
the smaller variants the Asus Eee Pad
Transformer was also one of my favorite
Android tablets and of course on the
Apple side you have the iPad 2 or if you
want to go to use route the iPad one so
hopefully leave that helped answer your
question just a bit
our next question wants to know about
the Nexus line of phones it comes from
user Paul mo2 who asks John do you think
Google will stop their Nexus phones
after the Nexus Prime or you think
they'll keep the Nexus line of phones
but the next one after the Prime built
by Motorola so I was a very convoluted
way of I think asking do you think
Google is going to continue with the
Nexus line of phones after the prime
comes out or is Motorola going to keep
building them after the acquisition goes
through presumably goes through I should
say so first the Nexus Prime hasn't been
announced so there's no guarantees even
going to come to market despite rumors
we're hearing a Verizon being one of the
early launch carriers I do think we are
going to continue to see a Nexus line of
phones Android is very much a
developer's platform on developers often
times each reference hard
so from a technical standpoint it makes
perfect sense for Google to release a
nexus line of phones that consumers can
always take advantage of but the
developers can use is sort of the
archetypal example of what their
programming for so we had the Nexus One
and the Nexus S and now we're coming up
to the Nexus Prime spec so really what
everybody's wondering about the Nexus
Prime we first heard dual core now we're
hearing super firm quad core rather now
we're hearing superfast dual core but a
giant 4.6 inch or bigger screen really
is yet to be seen presumably though
we're looking at the launch of Ice Cream
Sandwich with variant of Android the
Nexus Prime will hopefully launch with
coming out in October which is very soon
so we should know much more about the
Nexus Prime and enter your question I'd
expect a new Nexus line of phones
probably built by Motorola once a year I
want to take a minute to thank our
friends and sponsors at Squarespace if
you want to create a website maybe

we thank you our next question comes
from Twitter user eye Steven Zhu xu e su
who has john do you think the iPhone 5
is going to be an international phone
the answer is yes of course first of all
it's a GSM based phone using some of the
most common bands in the world so
assuming we don't have LTE in there yes
of course hippie international you can
obviously get one unlocked Canada cells
in my mom in the US now sells iPhone 4
is unlocked I'm proud about the iPhone 4
I presumably the same thing will be with
the iPhone 5 get in the locked version
you could pop in your SIM card anywhere
you are but the iPhone also has
international support it's launched in
the majority of countries all over the
world so assuming you know that same
launch pattern will stay through yes
kids are you'll get an iPhone 5 in your
country it doesn't always launch pan
globally or all over the world and
globally probably not great choice of
words
I may not launch all over the world
right at once sometimes it launches in
four countries at first and then it'll
sort of roll out or the next few months
but chances are you will get and iPhone
5 in your country so thank you everybody
