with technobuffalo calm today we're
checking out the new LG Lucid it was
just announced officially by Verizon
Wireless this week it's an eighty dollar
smartphone it'll be available in stores
on March 29th let's dive in real quick
and look at it here's the Box really
small compared to others but not that
big of a deal here's the phone itself
nice finish on the back kind of reminds
me of the older Samsung devices with the
red here some of these two have blue I'm
thinking all the way back a couple years
ago the 5 megapixel camera capable of
recording 1080p video and you also have
a single LED flash and support for 4G
LTE networks quick look at that phone
we'll go over that more in a bit you got
LTE also you have in the box regular
microUSB charging cord start guide you
can figure out how to use the phone and
of course the charger alright let's
power up the phone alright let's take
off a ugly little sticker kind of
ruining the phone really nice design you
can see it's got this sort of curved
metal accent there looks like the power
button let's find out nope doesn't
appear to be anything at all but an
accent that little metal thing micro USB
charging port nothing on the bottom
nothing on this side up here's the power
button will power it up you've got the
four buttons on the bottom there for
menu home return and search and of
course at 3.5 millimeter headphone jack
on the top of the vice
alright we're all booted up this is
running android 2.3 gingerbread I
haven't heard word yet on Ice Cream
Sandwich I don't know if they're going
to add it you'd hope so given today but
that you know most phones are getting
announced with ice cream sandwich so
it's kind of weird that this just came
out without it but that's fine
gingerbread here it's got a 1.2
gigahertz dual-core processor seems to
be pretty quick so far but I don't
really have anything installed on it
let's see what they've added so I guess
we can pinch to collapse all the
categories that's kind of unique here go
through I'm sure if I dig it owner I
guess we could turn it off just go right
to the list so we can see what's
installed backup assistant guided tours
not too much though we're here my
verizon netflix always like that plans
for zombies obviously probably just a
demo and a couple of other applications
they're not too much not too bad of
course you've got LG's layout that they
include on most of their phones it's
pretty simple it's not as in-depth as
you'd find in cents or even really
TouchWiz from Samsung not a huge fan
usually of this kind of colored logo
stuff but that's fine I kind of like ice
cream sandwich in the bear but order I
gingerbread in that case also let's
check out the camera real quick the loop
kind of seems to be a little slow it's
not really keeping up with the
viewfinder trying to take a picture of
this good touch autofocus see how that
came out not too bad looks all right all
right let's i'm going to quickly install
a speed test and we'll go through over
what we can find with Verizon's 4G LTE
network here in New York City here you
can see we have a pretty good signal so
we'll see what that society we've got
speed test installed let's get going
usually I see about 11 megabits per
second or so in whoo New York City
that's insane that's 25 megabits per
second well we're actually left we're
looking at kilobits per second so and 19
that's insane throw this in megabits per
second let's do that again that's going
to Washington DC
wow I've actually never seen speeds that
fast before 36.3 megabits per second and
18 megabits per second up that's
incredible that's about three times the
speed of my home internet connection
here Time Warner pretty slow so wow
there you go that's a quick look we'll
give you the results there 33 36 26
megabits per second down and 18 18 and
19 megabits per second up that's
incredibly fast $80 all right now the
loose it also has a video editing app I
record a quick video of a nerf gun here
it's sort of a company thing we all have
them for protection it's called video
producer so here I filmed a quick video
of the nerf gun you can do so well here
I'll show you the original video and
then I'll show you what you can do with
it so go to so here's the quick clip I
just shot just going over the nerf gun
there so then I opened up video producer
took that video and you can add so you
can add music to it and save it this
adds showcase feature so showcases like
it's a template we can have this show
real one converts it real quick we hit
yes you can hit play I'll take that
original movie add music and effects
so the volume is pretty good there but
it seemed a little slow so then when
you're done you can save it we save it
to 720p quality you can see a little bit
of how fast the processor renders here
again it's a 1.2 year it's dual core
processor to be rendering about
percentages second or so just a bit
faster than that
so it doesn't seem like you can do a
whole lot but you know it looks like a
little fun feature for anybody that
wants to kind of spice up their home
videos I'd much rather put it on my
computer personally and edit it there
but ok so it finished rendering took
about another minute or so sit play
here's our video
so pretty cool wasn't wasn't it all
Jerry that time I guess that's because
it was fully rendered definitely a neat
freak feature you get with the LG Lucid
ok so quick recap you got a 4 inch
screen it's pretty sharp here I like it
so far got the 5 megapixel camera on the
back you've got the glossy finish that
obviously attracts fingerprints like
crazy volume controls here on the Left
microUSB charging where else can we go
over here gingerbread in the while i was
actually editing this video i did find
out it will be upgraded to ice cream
sandwich is unclear one eighty dollars
with a new two-year contract and
incredible data speeds as we've seen so
not a bad value proposition for anybody
in the market for a new smartphone LTE
not looking to spend too much money this
