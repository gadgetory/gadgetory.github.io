thursday or friday or saturday whatever
you're watching it but it's thursday
right now for us welcome to good to go
I'm Noah Kravitz from TechnoBuffalo and
I'm James Kendrick from ZDNet mobile
news it's our it's our de facto
sponsored by the HTC Flyer edition but
we were talking James and our session
before we set for the money part with a
sponsorship II the sponsorship except
for the money part except for the money
part you here i'm gonna make a i'm gonna
make it a note here i'm gonna say talk
money next on your oh i forgot to turn
my other phone off oh yeah those HTC
guys are fast they are they are you're
at your dollar signs here put your money
where your mouth is and it'll show up on
our erasable tablets James how you doing
today I'm doing well are you doing naw
I'm good I'm good I'm having fun I'm not
he paid attention to you I got phones
ringing I'm drawn notes you know it
salts it's all good I you know it's
funny I was uh with the news we're
taping this on Thursday and so big news
this morning about google wallet and all
that stuff and i was at a thing earlier
this week talking a lot about NFC and so
that was on my brain and then we got on
the line to talk about what we're
talking about and we're playing with
gadgets / you know over the Skype
connection here and that's good man it's
good to bring it back to the fun you
know because that's what it's all about
i'm sitting here taping the thing i got
three devices in my lap ready to talk
about so let's just let's get into it we
both got a flyer you're liking the flyer
tell it tell the people why well I am i
it's a gingerbread bearing tablet and
I'm finding the gingerbread and the the
new HTC sense 2.1 for tablet which is
what this is running it's called is
really nice I'm actually finding it a
better tablet experience than on eco
personally
yeah no I would I would tend to agree
with you there no I mean it's solid yeah
a truck saw the camera's not too good if
you wanna know it's get down to brass
tacks I mean HTC cameras have never been
what I found to be great right this one
is is average you know it's not bad it's
not good it's just a right it's just got
one but I mean the whole thing that
separates the flyer from all the other
tablets android council market of
courses the the magic pen and write i
mean bility to take note yeah there you
go there you go instead of paying
attention to you you know I took your
picture and wrote your name and we'll
see that's that's that's the way it
should be it and that what makes these
notes if anybody's not familiar I mean
it does off I just kind of been able to
take notes does sound like a little bit
of a gimmick right but I'm actually
finding it because of the way it
seamlessly integrated into the Evernote
service yeah it's absolutely very well
implemented I mean I took this good to
go I wrote this just as we were dialing
up I'd ready for a call Here I am I mall
with my note saying I just ripped off
your you did it and I said that looks
like fun so yeah well they I wrote this
down and instantly because of the
Evernote cloud that note in my actual
handwriting appeared on every single the
Bison computer i use right but it
actually i could i can prove that i
won't just don't take my word for it
i've been known to be a compulsive liar
on my on my EVO 4g they'll get running
running evernote yeah and it's actually
even appended to the top in realtek no
this is a screenshot on the note that
you created on the HTC flyer right I
didn't do that right just right just
appeared right and so what I use as we
were talking before the show I mean I
I'm all the time thinking about articles
i'm going to ride ahead and stuff and
and all the time wanting to jot down
quick notes yeah you don't want to lose
it you just want to write it down yeah
and with this I can't be sitting there
in front of the big screen TV and just
jot down some notes and not have to do
anything else instantly no matter where
I happen to start working on the article
my notes are there yep yeah that's the
way technology is supposed to work yeah
you know and I'm the same way for for
you know when I got an ipad the first
time around and then with these other
capacitive tablets I've tried a handful
of those uh you know ten fifteen dollar
capacitive ah you know the little stylus
with the little foam on the end whatever
they do with it to make it competitive
and yeah they never I just I cuz I like
I write I do my work on a keyboard on
the computer but but like you were
saying you know for notes and
brainstorming that kind of stuff Pat a
paper and pen you know that's really how
I think best and so I would love to have
a digital way to do that but those you
know those cook those that the whole $80
pen thing or whatever it's actually
going to cost you know I'm starting to
feel like there's a reason because it
actually works i can actually write and
draw with it and well I I think that the
reason that the best buy wanted it
separate the pen was because not
everybody's going to want it yeah and
you know how everybody wants to keep the
cold the price down as cheap as possible
yeah now I have been told led to believe
by spread that you know they're going to
carry this under the name HTC view 34
day or rent evo view or something like
that evo view with it whatever it's
coming with the pen yeah yeah yeah see
ya yeah and what a lot of people don't
realize that you may not even because
you don't really use Evernote I don't
think no I after talking to you I'm soon
as we're done i'm signing up what's
fantastic about ever know that as
probably a lot of our viewers already
know because everyone's been around for
a bit used it for years without this you
know it it once you capture an image and
I can be text ink that you write or
picture that you snap or whatever as
soon as it sinks to the Evernote servers
which is instantly it starts OCR in it
in the background right right so all of
your little notes that you jot down in
front of your TV you can search on for
key words of those in your handwriting
right and Evernote it will find it oh
you being this though where you wrote
that I mean that's just yeah yeah
awesome no I mean that's the i have a uh
I gotta a neatdesk scanner for review
you know to deal with business cards and
and receipts and that kind of thing
between that and you know something like
like Evernote you would think I should
be able to organize myself so maybe
that'll be my you can if you if you set
your mind today that'll be my challenge
for the summer I've used Evernote on my
phones to capture business cards before
yes sure enough at OCR's it you got
search for the name get get all their
information yeah yeah it works pretty
well so another besides HTC now ever
doubt you you know sponsorships are open
everything exactly exactly I me I mean
the point is I mean we like to talk
about the the stuff that we use that we
and that really works for us because
that's more beneficial to viewers than
its talk about someone we read about
writers right yeah this is a real I mean
this is a mess yeah that's you know for
me I'm always within arm's reach
literally of either my smartphone or my
computer often both and so tablets to me
are neat but I don't actually use them
very much beyond reviewing them just
because it's always like if I have work
i need to do I need a computer that can
you know video edit and I want a
keyboard the whole thing and if i'm just
reading stuff it's usually just quicker
grab my phones in my pocket or my phones
on the desk then to you know go find a
tablet kind of thing but you know this
is that that use case of digital paper
basically a digital paper that syncs
digital paper that can be ocr'd digital
paper that conclude photos and colors
and drawings and you know the whole
thing and audio and audience you could
step pictures like you just showed right
right you can record voice notes and
then in fact if you get going with
Evernote that's a that's one of the big
uses i use for most smartphones because
just far up Evernote Tillett knew not
new audio note and just capture quick
voice you don't want yeah I don't want
to type anything I don't want to do
anything right and it's there and in
that way I can always access you too
yeah just the one the winning stuff the
one thing with flyer that I will have to
turn off is I it's got a neat feature
when you do a note it checks your
calendar and it'll say oh it looks like
you're in a meeting do you want to make
this known associate with the meeting
but it keeps telling me it wants to
associate it with my Facebook friends
birthdays because i have my facebook now
look up and I don't actually know any of
the people and Facebook friends with
yeah but you you know when their
birthdays are I know it as our which
means I owe a lot of yet I think there's
a way you could tell it turn out okay
yeah that's that's that's an Android I
didn't right thing but yeah it's it's a
pretty easy love it when technology does
what it should and helps you out I mean
that's not always the case I know yeah
sometimes technology is cool and while
we're the geeks of us like to play oh
this is cool or something new it's cool
if it doesn't really benefit us is you
know after a day you're like what did I
do with that I set that up somewhere it
was kind of not as cool anymore right
right but I can see this really useful
for me i actually won't be surprised if
I had a buying one of these at some
point right right because a sucker for
ya one one for me one minor drawback I
do find it a little bit heavy
and it can get away with it because it's
a seven inch device but you know I want
it to weigh less yeah that's uh that's
true be compared to my galaxy tab which
is a little bit lighter yep although I
believe this is about the same or maybe
even a little lighter than the plate the
blackberry playbook oh is that right
okay but it's it is is cuz the sturdy
aluminum which is nice that's the price
you pay any and it's actually a good
price because I I it's kind of slippery
and I actually dropped it today alcohol
aged see if they're watching this is
their sleep and they get about but it
did do anything I mean no rush no
stretch dance nothing so hey speaking of
uh speaking of not telling people stuff
I think last week you teased some really
cool product that you wish you could
talk about but you couldn't I guess two
weeks ago now because we don't do the
show last week last time around you had
a product that you were psyched about
but you weren't allowed to talk about it
yet oh it's the law oh yeah can you talk
about it yeah yeah well yeah I can't had
actually I've reviewed it in everything
it's a as we skipped a week so right
soon's baby he actually missed it but i
was referring to the thinkpad x1 2x1
yeah you know the the thin finished
think back there and i had been using it
for a while at our last show and arash
really impressed the other thing I mean
it's not macbook gear thin but its way
thinner than you expect a thinkpad to be
right right and it's got all of the it's
a full-blown Sandy Bridge core i5 and
rap fast hard drive I mean the thing
just slice yeah flies and gets good
battery has a little slice wedge battery
no cop shrimp right to come on and
double the battery life on it so that's
what it was right now it just wasn't out
there because at that time we weren't
sure we weren't going to do the
show the next week right loss akal or I
teased it cuz i was thinkin we were
gonna do right right right I did get I
did get a I've had some Twitter comments
and follow up you know like what was
that product James talking about uh yeah
we always get ya get why it's easy for
us to forget sometimes blackley well
what did I mention last week I I need to
address but yeah viewers keep us honest
and I think that's you jerk good you
said he didn't say I'm not happy exactly
I'm guessing I'm guessing it's about
that time yes you're guessing right I
was just about to give you a sign give
me the high sign raht real quick at 30
seconds or less on mobile wallets your
thoughts on mobile wallets we'll have to
see our pans out I've I'm just NFC has
not excited me yet because I i see a
long roll out period yeah yeah I I don't
want to have to keep track of okay I'm
running out the door where can I pay for
with this again right I forgets yeah
yeah that's the kind of thing but we'll
see only six take two I remember the
when debit cards first really got right
yeah same way where where can I use it
where could I not yeah yeah yeah yeah so
