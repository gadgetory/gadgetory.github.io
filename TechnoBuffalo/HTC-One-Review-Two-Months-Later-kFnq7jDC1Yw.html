technobuffalo here it's been almost two
months I started using the HTC One in
that time I have learned a ton more
about the phone so in the initial review
I said it was one of the best phone i've
ever tested and one of the only phones i
would happily sign a two-year contract
for is it still the case stick around
and find out so one of the things I
really loved about the phone when i did
my initial review was a build quality i
love the all-aluminum feel the phone i
love the construction I like the way I
felt in the morning when I picked it up
but it was cold and that hasn't changed
at all the phone is held up really
nicely over the past few months in fact
it's even survived a few drops and I
don't use a case on my phone at all so
the drops have been fine it landed on
the corner one landed on the front with
really no issues at all some people are
reporting quality issues with HTC One
gaps around the screen I haven't had any
such issues at all build quality has
really been outstanding and a
surprisingly held up as well as the
phone did from the first time I used it
alright so let's jump from build quality
to battery life there's been a lot of
concern about battery life when i first
started testing it battery life was
actually fine for me i was able to get
through a full day with between 20 to 30
ish percent of battery life but for the
most part that's held true i've had any
sort of battery degradation my use has
gone down a little bit the battery
percentage that I've used into the day
still stays the same again my usage
usually comes off the charger around
7-730 goes back on the charge around
11-1130 set it to Wi-Fi most the day
whether i'm at home or in the office two
ish hours a phone call pulling in two
email accounts that are being checked
every five minutes in an hour so phone
calls from social media some video
watching and all that battery life still
is able to get through a full day so
nice for HTC so don't need to worry if
you're concerned about battery life
sometimes what you read in the forums
are very vocal minority people have a
problem someone that make a big deal out
of it but for the most part this phone
has been absolutely outstanding for me
and speaking of outstanding the speakers
on this guy boomsound are still
ridiculous for somebody who watches a
lot of video on their phone is every
time I hear it is just surprising in
fact one time I was using the phone and
I pulled it away from my face a little
bit of deactivated the proximity sensor
and my cheek hit the speakerphone and I
thought I was going to go deaf the thing
is
so loud I gotta turn the volume down at
almost half in order to make comfortable
so if you want a phone that's got all
that speakerphone sounds great when
you're watching video or music this is
absolutely the way to go and it's not
just loud by you know like volume
standards the bass sounds really good in
it this is hands down the best speaker
phone I've ever seen so HEC did a killer
job with boom sound of course that's
just augmented with the beats technology
in there as well so yeah for that the
speed of the phone has been absolutely
blazing fast you'd expect out with a
quad-core phone I've had no slowdown
what sorts I've used it have any sort of
weird memory leaks try anything iphone
is as fast as it is now as it was on day
one so really no issue there at all the
same cork so that I've had when I first
I using the phone i still have right now
the button layout i cannot for the life
of me understand why there's a huge HTC
logo in the middle that i can't touch it
has been infuriating but fear not
there's actually a way to kind of make
it HTC logo act almost like a home
button a very own managing editor Roy
Choi found that app called swype home
button that works almost like a regular
home button all you gotta do is instead
of tapping it you got to sort of swipe
up a little bit and it'll take you back
to your home screen so it works pretty
well that's gotten rid of some of my
gripes the other grapes I have those
multitasking I like the way it looks on
here the whole grid layout you can see a
ton of applications I don't like having
a double tap to get to it I would have
liked to just had one single button like
every other Android phone out there I
don't like having to close everyone
individually a close all would have been
super nice to have here some other
gripes occasionally the phone can get
super warm and snow really rhyme or
reason when it happens it's not when
it's looking for a network or dropping
from LT hspa+ happen just very randomly
and sporadically maybe once every two
weeks phone won't get really really warm
take out of my pocket i'll put it down
and eventually it'll start to cool
itself down there's a huge battery drain
obviously when that happens no not sure
why and again it's not so regular but it
is happening another great i'm having is
with the gps i'm not sure it's because
of the aluminum construction or what but
i am not able to lock into gps signal
very quickly and sometimes not even at
all so whether or not i'm using
foursquare a google map something else
use the gps radio it's just not that
good it'll eventually lock in and it
works fine once it does the log in
getting that first connection has been
really
slow and slower than almost every other
phone I've connected so if you rely
really heavily and you need quick GPS
you may want to look elsewhere so when I
started using this phone i did the
initial review i said this the first
phone the iphone 4 i would happily
signed a two-year contract for and I
absolutely feel that same way right now
I love the foam this is my daily driver
or not testing something new this is
what I pick up this is what goes into my
pocket I love the way the phone feels it
performs great i really like actually
the way sense is laid out here it's not
as heaviest previous versions the email
application i think works very well I
don't use blinkfeed all that much it
hasn't changed I've got it relegated a
few pages over I like the way the apps
you laid out like you can change the
grid size like you can range by
alphabetical order and this is one of
the first android phones i haven't had
to use a custom launcher for
surprisingly it's not rooted or anything
else it's the way it came right out of
the box and i really like it so hats off
to you at HTC if you're thinking about
getting a new phone and you're not sure
which one is right for you you owe
yourself to look at the HTC one if you
want to check out the galaxy s4 as well
i'm sure to check out our HTC one which
is galaxy s4 video you can check it out
right here of course the link is going
to be down below as well so I figure out
which flagship Android phone is right
for you hope you guys enjoyed please

definitely appreciate it I check us out
