technobuffalo here a full review for you
ally windows phone 7 powered Samsung
Focus this is arguably 18 T's flagship
windows phone 7 it may very well be the
flagship windows phone 7 device
worldwide so today being launched in
november eight i thought it would be a
perfect time to share with you my
opinions on the phone let's go ahead and
get started so before we get into
operates some nuances and what the phone
can do or not do let's talk about call
quality call quality on samsung focus
very similar to what we've seen on the
Galaxy S lines of phone is outstanding
call quantum is extremely clear in my
typical 20 call test I experience no
drop calls as able to maintain a very
strong signal strength wherever I was
speaker phone on the back of this guy
while looking rather miniscule was
actually quite loud and in my opinion
delivered better speaker phone sound
than the HTC surround which is meant for
obviously speaker phone use so from a
phone standpoint you are knocking around
for samsung focus in fact even go as far
to say this is one of the best sounding
AT&amp;amp;T phones that I've used and I not
experience any sort of dropped call or I
have any sort of death grip signal
degradation issues alright so let me
refresh you about the specs of this guy
and what you can expect when you pick it
up it's available today for 100 99 99 on
a two-year contract it's got a four inch
Super AMOLED display with a resolution
of 480 x 800 and what's super amoled
means you might sort of hear it here and
there it's the touch mechanism actually
used for the capacitive screen doesnt
sit on top of the glass actually
integrated into the glass and that
translates into darker blacks richer
colors and better visibility in direct
sunlight it's also good to me you're
gonna get a little bit of almost a
bluish hue though on the device so if
you look at a Super AMOLED screen versus
a non Super AMOLED screen you will see
just a hint of color what are you
looking at images and let me go
and show you very quickly what that
looks like it has not been enough to
sort of steer me wrong for Super AMOLED
screen i think they absolutely looked
gorgeous but you are going to get a bit
of a hue so i'm going to open up the web
browser here you can see we've got
TechnoBuffalo up and queued you go ahead
and move these two over here I can see
the screen definitely has a little bit
of a hue and color to it despite a
difference of brightnesses just keep
that in mind but super amoled is really
a big selling point of the phone as well
it should be it does have the usual
proximity sensor and light sensors
built-in it's got a fifteen hundred
million power battery good for about six
and a half hours of talktime and 300
hours of standby time I was not
overwhelmed with battery usage on here
I'm pretty heavy user on the phones by
the end of the day I was running to an
outlet so that's in 6.5 hours of talk
time it's probably a little more liberal
than it should be you're going to want
to manage your usage rather not you're
using push what's your email that you're
doing all these things and I talked
about this one did you overview the
operating system they're all live tiles
that points are information in the
background which can be and is a drain
on battery it's got a 1 gigahertz
Snapdragon processor 512 megabytes of
ram and 1024 megabytes of ROM it has on
the back a 5 megapixel camera with
autofocus and LED flash unlike its
galaxy s brethren the camera on the back
can shoot Full HD video at 1280 by 720
more commonly known as 720p and it can
do that at 23 frames per second and
becoming more increasingly in common in
mobile devices this guy has 802 11 NY 5
to sit along with its B&amp;amp;G alright so
let's go ahead and talk about the
samsung focus there's been a lot of talk
about this just being a windows phone 7
version of the galaxy s and that is both
true and not sure a lot of emails and
questions on two people have been
describing this as the galaxy s line of
series of phones are using a hummingbird
processor which is developed by samsung
also very similar ones found in the
Apple products this however is using a
Snapdragon processor and does have on
back an LED flash that the Galaxy S line
the phones do not those are the big
differences you still have the same
capacitive buttons at the bottom
obviously operating system and that
gorgeous 4 inch Super AMOLED screen
alright so let's talk about this i'm
going to try and make this less of a
review the operating system again like
I've done with the HTC surround and my
windows phone 7 overview talk about the
whole phone itself as a package first i
will say i love the thinness and i love
the 4 inch screen on this device I
really actually missed when I went back
to the iphone having that bit of larger
screen real estate I use this one by
daily driver for almost two and a half
weeks and i gotta say i was very very
very impressed if you're looking to get
a new phone right now you happen to be
on a tnt whether you have your heart set
on a galaxy a few hearts out an iphone
palm pre whatever it might be yo
yourself to go at least look at Windows
Phone 7 and pacifically the Samsung
Focus which out of all the phones I've
tested for ATT running Windows Phone 7
samsung focus is definitely the best it
manages speed ethnic efficiently did the
best job of battery life even though it
wasn't outstanding the super-mo of
screen is absolutely gorgeous and that
sort of the combination of looks and
style really made it does scream out to
me the biggest problem I think that the
focus is going to be fighting is
microsoft itself people including me a
very hard time separating Microsoft what
they've done in the past and their
preconceived notions let me operate
system as a whole and the phone as a
whole and they're not going to look at
it because of that this operating system
is very unlike rasathi if you can
understand what that means you don't
have a start menu you don't surf have
that compartmentalised system that we've
seen in windows mobile 6 + 6.5 and
previous generation before that this is
a very sleek modern operating system now
it is missing some few key features
suppose it will be coming cut copy and
paste is the most glaring although at
the developers comments you did see an
example of cut copy and paste working
out windows phone 7 so suppose that will
be coming towards the beginning of the
year there's no flash support and
currently we
don't have any html5 support which is a
shame because it's phone features and
outstanding browser and all the windows
phone 7 that I've tested the browser
reacted very very quickly multi-touch
gestures however the Samsung Focus react
even quicker than those this it has the
fact that sort of pinch to zoom
recognition I have seen on any device
and that includes iphone ipad and all of
the android devices that I've tested
this is a very full-featured minus those
extension web browser that really gonna
have a nice time using it's very fast it
worked really well and I was very
pleased to a browsing experience and I'm
very demanding on my mobile browser I do
a lot of work on it and it was very very
easy to adapt to Windows Phone 7 as my
daily driver now they don't want to talk
to about whether or not this device the
opportu in particular doesn't support
multitasking it supports smart
multitasking sort of what Apple did they
first launched the iphone so you can
play music in the background the native
applications can run in the background
right now third party applications can
not something to keep in mind speaking
of third party applications i know i'm
getting a bit into the operating system
maybe more than i would have liked there
is a significant amount of developer
support now growing in the marketplace
so if you were concerned about apps and
things that use quite quite a bit don't
worry I'm Netflix Twitter all sort of
the big ones flixster that you might use
are all here and more coming on a daily
basis Samsung has done a nice job with
their cert of Samsung hub this is the
way that you can customize windows phone
7 but developers are limited to what
they can do from the home screen but
they can make their own hub essentially
this live tile and Samsung is put sort
of their own little skins in here you
can go ahead and view some whether you
can check out news stocked if you'd like
and go back to weather and Samsung has
promised more and more features going to
be added to this hub as we move along
overall I've been very impressed the
build quality phone camera was
relatively unimpressive the five members
of camber exactly what you'd expect from
a 5 megapixel camera very blah the flash
sort of washed out some images but it
worked you know if you're outta
departing you want to show picture your
friends
it's definitely going to get the job
done for you so if you are in the market
for a new phone right now definitely
check out the samsung focus i really
recommend it you guys know me i'm an
apple guy but i really enjoyed a windows
phone 7 as a whole I think it's got a
lot of potential in the marketplace
right now two very immature operating
system it's missing key features its
competitors have android and iOS I think
it's going to make sure i think is
device to the other support those new
and updated versions note for the
carriers will push them out but I think
in one to two years we're looking at
operate system that really is going to
compete for a significant market share
so oh it's yourself go check it out on a
one-to-five scale here I give this phone
a very very very solid for missing out
on that extra one because the operating
system is missing key features from a
phone hardware standpoint this guy is
screaming fast and has a beautiful
beautiful screen and I really think it
would make a nice addition to anyone's
bucket so if you guys have any windows
phone seven questions let me know I am
jon rettinger from TechnoBuffalo and I
will see you in the next video bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
