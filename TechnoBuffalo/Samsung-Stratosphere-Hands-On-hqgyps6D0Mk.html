first look at the samsung stratosphere
coming to verizon wireless and ask me
now what network until be running on 4g
quite obviously so there's a packed into
this small package first and foremost
it's going to make it differentiate is
that slide out qwerty keyboard so you
can see the keys right there not overly
raised but you have a full row for
numbers the jew decent amount of key
throw it actually goes down quite a bit
so even though there isn't sort that
high raise that you're used to there's a
lot of key throw on first blush that
keeps feel pretty easy to type on you
also have that full 4-way navigation and
your typical android buttons so what are
we looking at here so it's got go to the
home there are looking at a four inch
super amoled screen of course with
TouchWiz sitting on top of it wait at
menu button and see what version of
TouchWiz it's not 4.0 on the back you've
got a 5 megapixel camera with LED flash
1.3 megapixel on the front it's being
powered by the tried-and-tested cortex
a8 hummingbird processor have you seen
before in previous generation Galaxy S
series of devices I've got your to a
quick tour of it volume rocker up and
down on the left hand side on the right
there's your power and lock button
microphone on the bottom and you've got
your there's a charging microUSB port
there as well on the top 3.5 millimeter
headset jack and of course that spring
assisted slide it just slide out
relatively easily go ahead and slide
that guy right out let's go ahead and
load up technobuffalo calm and see what
things look like on here using the
qwerty keyboards long it's there

any sort of Wi-Fi now we're connects to
Wi-Fi excuse me I'm a liar alright so
we're technobuffalo calm and here we are
take a look at our mobile site go ahead
and switch on / given see our new mobile
site give it a look so let's see how
fast things go no checkerboard pattern
at all first loading the loading the
page pinch-to-zoom appears to be very
smooth and you've got that gorgeous
super amoled screen so let's put on an
article and see how text actually look
so i'll go into a mikes volt review
which check it out if you're interested
in two cars it was a very well done so
well zoom in we have no pixelation there
at all so that's pretty nice it's go
ahead jump it take a look at the camera
so go to applications we don't have a
hard button to launch camera but we've
got that right there and if it got sort
of that Samsung ask camera interface
somebody get Mike to step in front of
the camera we take a picture of Mike and
we could see what the camera and face
looks like here so I've never seen Mike
that's what it looks like it's got tap
to focus so it is autofocus can slide
this out you can get a whole bunch
different settings including want to
take pictures of let's say us so now you
