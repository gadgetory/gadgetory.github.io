TechnoBuffalo here Apple sent out
invitations for an upcoming March 9th
event I think it's going to focus mostly
on Apple watch thought it could be fun
to talk about other things that they
might announce I think they've been a
rumor for quite some time so here are
five things that you can expect from the
apple event number one just ones the
obvious and certainly way most likely
just tons of apple watch news so you
already know the apple watch will do we
know that it's coming out sometime in
April we don't have a precise release
date nor do we know how much things
going to call us how much more expensive
models are going to be in all that
pricing information better yet Apple
stilton said how long the freaking
battery's gonna last the company might
take the opportunity to talk about that
especially following rumors about the
device potentially getting less at a day
with regular use so Apple typically
likes to rehash informations already
talked about the event so at march nine
it's probably gonna spend plenty of time
talking about the oh weddings bar be
seen but the advice is a rival said to
be just over a month away so hopefully
we'll see how to play i was some of the
bigger apps are critic on the market
hopefully get some demonstrations what
it can do apple supposedly he's been
putting a ton of pressure to the biggest
app developers to finish and get
anything is ready for launch as
possibility we'll get some slick on
state demos about how the wearable you
can just draw pretty pictures with it
them to your friends number two the 12
inch macbook air it's been a long time
coming but apple might finally announce
the rumor 12 inch mba which isn't
circulating in the rumor mill since
since i was like eight but beginning at
2015 it was one when the biggest rumor
bombs was drop an act of five mac when
they should have ton of confidential
details about apple's new laptop same
device will be the company's thinnest
and lightest yet which kind of expect
report to the 12 inch macbook air was
supposedly be even narrower than apple
is 11 inch model suggesting the device
will be both bezel list and feature
keyboards that's smaller and more
cramped than what we're usually used to
and also look at those renders it looks
so pretty and number three you can
probably put this one under like the
less likely of things to happen but it
has the river for a while it is just a
larger iPad sometimes called or
reference as the ipad pro apple's new
macbook air might not be the only new 12
edge gadget getting at
the company's portfolio I've been plenty
of rumors about a new 12 inch iPad
dubbed ipad pro coming to apple's other
ipad lineup hasn't found the same
success in once at over the past few
years which could give Apple the freedom
to experiment with just new form factors
fits our little what with two different
compared to the current ipad air 2 just
larger and it could have some feature
rich emphasis on content creation Lisa
putting expect now we're getting
probably the more unlikely but I don't
know what to call this one's i'm going
to call it the apple surface so apples
12 inch ipad could simply be that just
the 12 inch ipad some of the more
dubious and juicy rumors of the vice
feature kind of a hybrid of sorts like
Microsoft Surface Apple has already said
it's got interation to combine the
experience of OS 10 and iOS what is it
that bold introduced a hybrid device it
seems unlikely especially with a 12 inch
macbook air on the way would certainly
give apple's ipad lineup a nice jolt of
adrenaline which it certainly needs and
Steve Jobs once famously said when asked
about cannibalizing their own products
saying rather I can't advise my own
products and somebody else do it so i
don't know maybe a 12 inch ipad and 12
inch macbook air and this crazy hybrid
can live together in synergy and number
five this one is definitely gonna happen
in some form of surprises prize there's
a chance Apple mind reduce a new
subscription-based streaming service
based on beats music although that might
not be official until WWDC in June
beyond that what kind of surprise might
have in store I mean I don't know basic
information about allowing users to beta
test future versions of iOS there's also
been a lot of crazy patents that shown
up for the past several years and those
generally are not indicator at all of
what to expect but imagine like Apple VR
it seems unlikely Apple lightsaber Apple
pay rolling out to more countries so so
many questions but fortunately march
nine not that far away so what you guys
think most likely it's gonna be just a
ton of Apple watch news but that'll be
fun to say five things an ideal world
that we could see come from an apple
product launch want to hear your
thoughts on it thumbs up if you're
excited at what they're going to
announce until next time I'm John render
