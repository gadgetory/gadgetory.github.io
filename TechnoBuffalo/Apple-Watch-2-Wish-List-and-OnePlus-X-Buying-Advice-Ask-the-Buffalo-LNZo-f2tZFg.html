to you by domain.com how's it going guys
my first nighter here TechnoBuffalo and
this is ask the buffalo we've been doing
things a little bit differently here in
terms of video so we figured we would
take a different approach with this one
too so this is kind of ask the buffalo
2.0 we've got a couple of questions here
i'm gonna answer some john's gonna
answer some so one and we go ahead and
get started what would you like to see
inside the second Apple watch so for the
second generation of this I like it to
be a little more like this at least in
the screen Department I would love to
see a round display on the next-gen
Apple watch Apple is always sort of
pushing design at least that's their
claim but you see the design be pushed
with Gentoo I think they wasn't very
safe with here small bezels they had a
little bit on the thicker side I would
love to see something around like to see
a higher resolution screen more things
take advantage of forced touch or 3d
touch I think would be nice and just
more apps that can run natively on the
watch hopefully that'll come view of
that blesses develop more first party
apps
those are my hopes and my dreams and
hopefully we'll see them what do you
want to see what the next update of
Android marshmallow so in terms of what
I want to see next in a marshmallow
update well marshmallows out so at this
point we're at incremental updates so I
would really like to see them do what
they normally do and just you know
polish off some rough edges what I would
love to see in the next version of
Android though like 7.0 l MN which could
be nougat who knows but what I would
love to see is some deeper exploration
into multitasking and how we multitask
on our phones there's a lot of great
concepts flowing around on the internet
actually this week I saw one of how to
handle using multitasking for actually
accomplishing tasks not just for one
particular app so I'd really love to see
something like that come out in the next
version of Android hey Mark huge fan of
the show I was wondering where's the
best place to go to register all of my
million dot ninja domain names idea I'll
do it to think on it keep up the good
work
you and that other dude nice job Wow
John great great question I really
appreciate you saying you're a fan yeah
the other guy on the videos is like
whatever but I really appreciate the
question anyway you caught me just as I
was registering a domain with domain.com
so what I was actually going to go for
was allergic to daunt soy either that or
check out my new hip surgery which is a
a brand new website for people who are
just recovering from hip surgery I use
domain.com for all of my stuff because
they've got so many options they've got
great support they've got all kinds of
great stuff plus I get 20% off because
I'm a technical buffalo of you or you
can just use the code TechnoBuffalo to
get 20% off your order and remember John
when you think domains think domain.com
in 20 years where do you see
TechnoBuffalo being and what are your
future visions for the company my vision
of technical always remained the same
when we started it I want to just be the
voice of the consumer and I hope that in
20 years we are still the voice that
consumer I hope we've grown we'll be
giving more people a chance to live
their dream to talk about tech like we
get a chance to do I hope that I'm still
reviewing tech I still love it but I
hope people care what a 55 year old man
has to say about technology I hope that
we're still here and I hope to be
experiencing a new medium I'm gonna go
on the record though I'm saying I want
like the RTG - holographic displays to
be coming out he can be like help me
obi-wan I want that I want to take out
my phone and just have everything just
pop up on it that's what I'm hoping for
and that was your question but my mind
wandered there something hoping for Le
thank you for asking the question
hey John here is the oneplus X just a
better design one plus one and is there
much of a difference is the $50 worth
the extra screen size so the oneplus X
is not just a one plus one or a one plus
to rescan to rebrand it or anything like
that the oneplus X is really kind of
aimed at a really sort of I guess
fashion conscious but still
affordability conscious market it's it
makes a handful of compromises lots of
compromises in fact but it still feels
really really premium it still feels
like a great device haven't gotten it
into the office yet for a full review
but I did do a hands-on with it
obviously at the event which you can
check out up here when we were there a
week or so ago I wouldn't say that it's
just the same as a 1 + 1 or a 1 + 2 and
in terms of the difference in price you
know 50 bucks is getting you a little
bit more than just screen size so I
don't think oneplus is attacking their
lineup the same way that a traditional
manufacturer would I think they're
trying to stay agile trying to do
different things and see what sticks so
I wouldn't look at them
Plus acts as a direct successor to the
1+2 well that's it for the first episode
of the kind of 2.0 asked the Buffalo let
us know what you guys think of the
comments we'd really love to get your
feedback and let us know what you want
to see kind of out of this kind of a
video series as always thank you guys so
much for watching be kind of one another
and I'll catch you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
