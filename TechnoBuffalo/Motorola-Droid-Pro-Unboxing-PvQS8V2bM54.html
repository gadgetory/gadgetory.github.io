TechnoBuffalo here at the unboxing of
what's sure to be one of the hottest
handsets this holiday season for
professionals and consumers alike this
is the Droid Pro for Verizon Wireless
let's get started so as you can see from
the box the Droid Pro is a form factor
that many people have been asking for
it's a touchscreen on the top it's got a
full QWERTY keyboard down below there's
no sliding needed it's always accessible
and available so let's go and start at
the Box own talk about the specs as I
pulled the phone out you got a picture
of the device on the front we've got
some packaged content listing on the
side but we'll see that on the right
hand side you've got some jumbly stuff
about handling and Erica Pat ability
another picture of the device on the
back alright let's go ahead and dig in
here is the Droid Pro which is sort of
like the randy quaid of smartphones it
might not be the best-looking out there
it's not going any beauty contests but
you know it's gonna do a good job it's
gonna be reliable and it's gonna be able
to get your hair you need to go alright
so let's go ahead and pull this thing
out first off this eye for just a minute
and see what else we're going to get in
the box this is actually one of the
devices that I mentioned as being one of
the hottest and probably most desirable
smartphones for this holiday season so
we've got a micro USB charging port or
charging cable rather with the wall
adapter we've got the back of the phone
we're gonna need that got a few European
adapters here and we'll go ahead and
talk about why those are here and some
are European some are for other
countries and will work in other
countries so again push those out they
do come with three sever ones and I'll
show you which ones they are
in case you're gonna be travelling I
don't ask you to name the countries that
they are for go ahead and see what both
of those are and the third all right so
we've got a battery which will talk
about capacity wise again in just a
minute is a nice heavy battery actually
now we've got a micro USB cable
alright so enough of all that let's talk
about the phone and let's go over the
specs that
this guy is packing because it brings
quite a lot to the table it's gonna set
you back about 179 dollars on a two-year
contract and this is a global phone with
3G compatibility it's actually 3G radios
it'll work in the US but the phone is
not going to be unlocked if you want to
see something very weird and something
you're not used to you turn it over I've
got a SIM card slot a few of the Verizon
global phones have this it's still a
little strange to see a Verizon Verizon
bandid branded SIM card in the device
kind of fun alright so it does have a
3.1 inch TFT capacitive touchscreen with
a resolution of 320 by 480 the battery
that we just mentioned is a 1420
milliamp hours so you should be able to
get a decent amount of use out of it
probably about six to seven hours of
talktime this guy is running Android 2.2
with a new version of motoblur on top
it's got a TI OMAP 1 gigahertz processor
so it should be plenty fast 512
megabytes of RAM we're gonna help that
on the back we've got a 5 megapixel
camera with dual LED flash and autofocus
and that same lens can shoot 720p video
so it's gonna be 720 by 480 at 30 frames
per second and of course it's got Wi-Fi
interestingly enough it's got Wi-Fi B G
and n let's go ahead and power it on and
see what we can expect from the Droid
Pro this one really does bring a lot to
the table grow global roaming
capabilities a full QWERTY keyboard
which will see if it is worthwhile or
not and a lot of networking options it's
supposedly very long battery life let's
go ahead and pop it in and I'll go ahead
and power this guy on alright so we put
the back on and I know how much you guys
love when I leave stickers on the
devices so I will pull it off and the
back is made of just plastic it's not
soft touch sort of has that fingerprint
II look to it just hard plastic and
there's a bit of a hump there on the
side for the camera front we'll go ahead
and peel off the label here as well see
if we get that whooshing noise that
everybody loves and we do and this is
running motoblur it's sometimes these
phones don't actually have
a search button look at some the other
motoblur options this one actually does
have that search button the buttons are
capacitive so I will go ahead and power
it on I'll do a tour of what's on the
device and while that's doing its thing
so as we just talked about your 4
capacitive buttons buttons that are
sitting below the 3.1 inch screen you do
have a full QWERTY keyboard here let's
do a first blush to see how this
keyboard feels the keys are beveled and
slightly rounded they do have a decent
amount of throw to them the number keys
are embedded and overall I think it
feels very nice we'll see how it works
so in some real-world usage on the left
hand side of the buttocks we've got a
volume up and down microUSB charging
port on the right
we've got a hard button probably for as
it yells at me droid I assume that's
going to be a camera shutter button you
can set that for whatever you like on
the top you've got your lock and power
button 3.5 millimeter headset jack and
there is some droid action going on here
welcome to the Droid Pro I'll go ahead
and do the setup and come back and show
you what that looks like before I do
let's go ahead and do some size
comparisons here so you know what the
Droid Pro is going to look like next
some smart phones make you familiar with
so it's Android stablemate in the
Verizon lineup here we have the Droid X
4.3 inch screen versus a 3.1 but this
does have a full core to keep where it's
easy from a size standpoint they're not
all that different to go ahead and look
at them thickness and see that they're
just about the same there's a more
pronounced camera hump however on the
Droid X a from phone that you guys all
are generally familiar with I think here
is the iPhone 4 go ahead and see what
those look like and we'll make a smart
phone sandwich here with the Droid Pro
as the meat in the middle and you can
see what all those look like from a thin
the standpoint so I'll come back in just
a minute when this guy is all booted up
set up and ready to rock
so I'm activating the phone right now
obviously the speaker volume on this
actually surprisingly loud and I wanted
you guys to hear in this initial video
quite surprised at how loud this is so
go ahead push one and let it do its
activation but if you're worried about
speaker phone volume on your mobile
device not going to be a problem right
here the phone is now being activated so
we'll go ahead and simply a stand alive
when they program the phone I will say
that I would have liked perhaps hard
buttons especially having a QWERTY
keyboard here for sends an end you canif
rely on the touchscreen for that so this
one's getting activated I'll come back
again in just a moment alright so you've
got the phone all booted up and you've
got the less obtrusive I'd say version
of motoblur here start any sort of
colors at the bottom like you've seen
other devices and jump right to the home
contacts or menu let's go and take a
look here at some of the options that
are going to come on it and what's sort
of pre-installed it's all your typical
home screens have seven of them to
choose from let's see what applications
are going to be pre-installed on the
device we'll go ahead and jump back to
the home and we'll see what's here
that's unique this is a mobile hotspot
capable device so if you have that plan
you can go ahead and use this - it's
Heather I believe up to five devices you
can see all the applications that are
going to come pre-installed here and
there are quite a bit including Skype
mobile which is always handy to have VZ
navigators to your onboard as well if
there's a demo for Need for Speed Shift
you forgot of course Google Maps
Navigation which is awesome by the way
totally free and surprisingly still in
beta got some mobile share and some
modal blur apps overall this is in the
phone that I know a lot of people have
been waiting for there's been a lot of
times when I've been really wishing I
had a full QWERTY keyboard and without
having to give up touchscreen or having
to sort of slide something out and give
up the thinness of the candy bar form
factor so this is the phone that I know
a lot of Verizon users have really been
looking forward to myself included so
I'll put it through the paces and let
you guys know what I think if you have
any questions or things that you want to
