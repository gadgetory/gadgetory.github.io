to you by full sail university what's up
everyone i am back from CES and is good
to be sitting back in the rants chair
although this might be the last official
retina schrantz i'm going to be running
the show renters riffs cuz i also like a
lot of things and i wanted a show or i
could talk about the things i like
things i don't like and rants was kind
of pigeon following me into being all
mad about stuff so there's still be
plenty of rants in there has give me
some positive stuff there's gonna be
some just talking getting to know each
other so I guess we'll make this one the
last episode of renters rants and coming
soon renders riffs so up this week I
talked a lot to the audience about how
to get through some of negative comments
that happen I had a sort of bear through
it and get your skin tougher but it's
still really really hard to get through
so i was watching jimmy kimmel the other
week and I saw celebrities reading mean
tweets about themselves so I thought
that I would share some of the mean
comments people have left me over the
past few weeks and talk about how I deal
with them in some ways how I don't deal
with them it's gonna get started
so let's just jump right into the
meanest these comments were all left on
YouTube these are all the usernames that
i'm going to read because you go to the
YouTube channel you could actually see
the comments and actually read them
yourselves so the first one comes from
mr. Chris Kelly who says used to like
this channel but John's high-pitch
cringey voice killed it for me thank you
for all the good work peeps I don't know
what I could do about that I've been
told a lot of things but another so that
my voice is high-pitched but I guess it
is alivio Lopez says lol John stop
blinking your eyes so much and stop
being so freaking awkward just stop
Peter Smith John is getting annoying
Devin silver John's beginning to change
he's becoming annoying so just some
examples and I didn't really have to
look that hard or long to find negative
comments and they're really hard to deal
with and I thought that since I tell
people to sort of fight through and get
a thick skin I was only fair to sort of
shares from the things that people say
about me and it sort of in all honesty
my skin is still not that thick it's
sticker than it has been in years past
but things like that still bother me and
anybody says they don't you know it's
probably lying i was talking to Ashley
about this earlier and I guess you
really have to either laugh about it or
you have to cry about and I sort of take
the laughing approach you're putting
yourself out there being online not
everybody's going to like what you're
gonna do it just kind of have to accept
it those comments happen all the time
some are meaner than that some are
funnier than that some are moderately
nicer than that but it never gets easy
to deal with it gets easier deal with
but it's never ever easy so everybody
out there who wants to start a YouTube
channel to everybody out there who wants
to make videos about tech whatever it
might be just know that your every move
breathing you where how often you blink
to what your voice sounds like things
that really can't control are going to
be scrutinized it's just the way it goes
and if you go in knowing that you can
deal with the fire that comes at you but
if you're going with your eyes closed
and everybody's going to love you you're
in for a really really really hard trip
so I make sure buddy's eyes are wide
open know what you're getting yourself
into I love what I do and I wouldn't
change it for anything in the world and
I know not everyone's gonna like and
that's just the way the world works I
serve him a broadcaster so to speak and
I sort of speak to a large audience and
sort of broadcast to the general public
but they're still gonna be a ton of
people that just aren't gonna like me
for a myriad of reasons and that's just
the way it goes so know that going in
guys and I thought we'd have a little
bit of fun I'd share some of the
negative things that happen and just
sort of talk to you guys about what it's
