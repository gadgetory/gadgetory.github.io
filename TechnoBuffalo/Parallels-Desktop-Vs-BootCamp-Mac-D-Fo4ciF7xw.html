popular questions that I get on here is
in regards to running Windows on your
Mac specifically parallels versus
bootcamp what does what and how you
install them so I'm going to do my best
to try and answer those questions for
you
so first parallels which is what I have
is not put out by Mac at all so software
and what parallels does is it emulates
hardware on a computer so what that
means it kind of essentially tricks your
computer into seeing almost like a sea
drive and it lets you install an actual
version of Windows so you're running a
real version of Windows on a virtualized
computer so they're both good and bad
things to that running on a virtualized
computer depending on how much RAM you
give it to be a little bit laggy I've
got about a gig of ram that I give it
and it seems to be pretty fast it's not
necessary to reboot with parallels you
can run both at the same time as well
meeting you can easily switch between OS
10 and windows and with parallels 3.0
you can actually drag files from one
operating system to the next if you have
a word document you created in Windows
you can actually just drag it right over
to your OS 10 desktop and automatically
covert to your Mac version of word very
cool and you can just shut it down right
from windows no need to again restart or
reboot your computer when it comes to
games that's where things get a little
bit tricky parallels claims that it
supports three games I haven't tried it
but I know people who have and it it
runs doesn't run smoothly as a real
Windows machine so my conclusion is what
parallels is good for is anything non 3d
intensive if you want to run Microsoft
Office parallels is great if you want to
run the dhobi Photoshop parallels is
great if you're not playing games really
parallels I think will be will be fine
for you as long as you give it at least
two gigabytes of RAM so that's parallels
for you
nice and easy I've enjoyed it for a
couple months that I've had it it's a
great great feature and it runs I think
about $80.00 so it's reasonably
affordable
well on the other side of the spectrum
is boot camp which is Mac or Apple's
answer I guess to two parallels and it's
currently in beta version it's a free
download it will be included with
Leopard and what boot camp is it
actually makes your window your Intel
based Mac machine a full fledged
Windows computer so take advantage of
absolutely everything anything you can
do on a Windows computer you can do on
the Mac to make that more clear it turns
your Macintosh into a Windows computer
and the way that works is you create a
certain amount of hard drive space based
on what you decide and it makes
something called a partition and what
that does is it allocates certain amount
of space just for Windows so when you
boot up your computer you hold down a
key and you'll have an option as to
whether or not you want to boot into OS
10 or Windows now you can't run both
side-by-side like you can in parallels
so once you choose Windows it'll load up
windows XP or Vista so depending what
you want and look and run just like a
Windows machine it'll run 3d games just
like o comparable Windows machine will
it takes all your specs and turns it
turns it windows I guess to make that a
little more clear for people go to
apple.com look at the specs for your
computer whether it's a MacBook MacBook
Pro whatever and where it says running
OS 10 put Windows and not to spec to
your computer right now so it's great
it's great for games hardcore gamers and
people that want to run strong 3d
windows-based apps and when you want to
get back to OS 10 you have to shutdown
windows and actually we boot the
computer and then select OS 10 again
both are good options both offer
different things
I have not installed boot camp my own
computer yet but I've played with play
with it in stores and friend's house who
have it and it works great it's flawless
the drivers work on the new version
drivers the built-in iSight camera just
like any other webcam so then that's you
know again that's that's free I hope
this helped
answer some of your questions that you
guys have had he feel free to shoot in
my way when you get through here and I
guess the last side note when you
install a boot camp I what you need to
do is you go to apple.com
and slash boot camp I believe and there
are steps there that'll guide you
through the installation process you
created disco drivers and you actually
install your version of Windows then
start your driver disk so both are
pretty easy to install and both sort of
do the same thing with a little bit
different specialization hope this
helped clear things up for you guys feel
free to ask some questions thank you
guys for watching thank everybody for
subscribing and I'm glad we were able to
keep this active and hopefully answer
everybody's questions
so enjoy have a good afternoon evening
or day or wherever you are and I'll talk
to you guys soon bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
