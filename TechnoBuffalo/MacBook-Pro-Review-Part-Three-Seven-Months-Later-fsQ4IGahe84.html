my videos and i realize it's been almost
seven months as I first got my mac
whipped was my my first mac but you guys
may or may not know so I thought six
seven months to be a good time to give
an update on how the macbook pro is
doing how I've enjoyed using it I was
holding up and things like that so first
off I guess to recap I have the 2.4
gigahertz macbook pro with two gigs ram
and the standard hard drive
configurations 160 gig and I think 5400
rpm so I gotta say I've been so happy
that I decided to go Mac instead of
Windows things are just so much easier
to use I can do what I want with without
having to spin my wheels and go through
15 steps get things done deleted program
just things like that are just so easy
and what I like the most about it so far
I guess this is an OS 10 thing and not a
macbook pro thing is that if an
application crashes at just that
application that crash is not the whole
computer just little side note there
anyway the macbook pro over seven months
is really held up very well an extremely
durable machine I transport it quite
regularly I have a nice leave or sleep
i'ma show you guys woulda got I've got
one of these things I've been carrying
around in a in case a little um neoprene
sleeve and I put it just a backpack and
it's it's really held up well no
scratches no dings thing has been been
rock solid you know I got the computer
thinking I was going to be doing a ton
of video editing and some intensive
stuff I really haven't I probably went
overkill with the macbook pro I probably
would have been just happy had I gotten
the macbook you know say the couple
hundred bucks but live and learn so the
computer like I said is held up very
well I do wish that I had gotten a
faster hard drive I didn't notice that
sometimes when I'm trying to open up a
movie or something it takes a little
longer for the hard drive to spin to
open it up so that's a recommendation
nothing major nothing I let me I regret
but if I could go back I would
probably go for a little faster hard
drive took you bytes of RAM I bought it
thinking I would for sure upgrade to
four but two gigs has been plenty you
know what the ISTEP pro I can see how
much memory i'm using and i'm always
under well under one hundred percent so
you know two gigs is suffice even when
i'm running parallels or running I movie
or playing poker online whatever it is
remember i'm using two gigs has been
been plenty so there's a note right
there one thing I would recommend though
if you're getting a macbook to de max
igan random because of the processor
dependent rememory dependent video card
I wish the macbook pro had more USB
ports talked about that before having
only two with a little bit of a pain but
I got a powered hub that made it made a
lot easier see what else the computer
does get a little bit hotter than I
expected it to be and i did a video on
he have a macbook pro it's not that bad
you know you can't put on your lap and
worry about frying your balls off it's
not that bad but it is definitely some
noticeable heat so be aware of that and
hasn't gotten it hasn't gotten any worse
over time but it's it stayed pretty
constant with relative heat my fans are
still going strong even with keeping the
the fan set at about 20 800 rpms I've
had any troubles with it six months in I
haven't had any hardware issues at all
haven't had anything fail haven't had
any if anything repaired haven't had to
had monitors fixed or displays fixed or
anything they keep weather computers
just been very solid very well built and
excellent for for travel like I said
memory guys there's nothing really else
to show you or tell you wanted to give
you an update on the macbook pro and I
was holding up for me and I was enjoying
it you know what they say is true once
you go mac you never go back so anyway
guys hope you enjoyed ask the questions
about the macbook pro if you want and I
would be happy to answer you know some
of the questions I get a little
difficult to answer some of them just
say should I get a macbook or macbook
with no explanation at all so you know
things like that are kind of hard to
answer if you're looking for some advice
if you're a college student that's not
doing video design work go for a macbook
the macbook is an awesome computer just
a little sign out there and we guys hope
you enjoyed watching and have a good
afternoon evening day night or ever you
guys are anyway talk to you guys soon
thanks for watching and thanks for
