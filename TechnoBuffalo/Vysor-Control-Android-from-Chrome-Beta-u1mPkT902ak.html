Sangin from TechnoBuffalo and on today's
video we'll be showing you how you can
control and marry your Android
smartphone on your computer without the
need to root your device the developer
behind all casts and raw manager just
release a Chrome extension that allows
you to marry your Android devices screen
to your computer whether you're using
Windows Mac or Linux as long as you're
able to run chrome you'll be able to see
and control your Android device on your
computer the first thing you need to do
is make sure you have Google Chrome
installed this method relies heavily on
Chrome in its extensions so we need to
use that as our primary browser next up
we need to download an extension called
visor now this will allow us to use and
see our Android devices screen on our
computer in order to mirror your device
properly make sure that you've installed
Android debug bridge or ADB for short on
your computer
ADB will allow your computer to send
commands to your device and it's
essentially a way for your computer and
your Android smartphone to talk to each
other if you want to know how you can
install ADB we'll leave a link down in
the description below where you can find
all the necessary files once ADB is all
set up we'll need to enable USB
debugging on our Android device and to
do that we need to head on over to
settings about device tap the build
number five times and once it shows you
that you're now a developer head inside
developer options and enable USB
debugging
once that's done plug in your Android
device and launch visor it should
automatically connect to your device but
in case it doesn't just click on the
find devices button and your phone
should be listed as a device inside the
app once you're connected you'll see a
live video feed of your screen and while
the quality is integrated it's still
pretty cool to see your actual device's
home screen on your computer so why does
an app like visor exist and why should
you use it one it's a simple app that
allows you to display your phone's home
screen on your computer without the need
to root too if you're an Android
developer and want to be able to use
your device as some sort of emulator by
is just a neat app that'll allow you to
do that last but not least probably the
coolest feature that will be available
soon is the ability to screen share your
device to others meaning you'll be able
to access devices remotely if you have
the proper visor link this could be
great to how family members or friends
to troubleshoot their phones so mom if
you're watching this we need to download
this is it right now a visor is still in
beta so not everything is fully
operational the video quality should get
better over time and the ability to
share your screen with others will be
available soon too
is available right now for free but the
developer said in a Google+ post that
visor is going to be a paid app with
different tiers and different features
if you want to give visor a try we'll
leave a link in the description below
and if you guys enjoy this video make
sure to give it a thumbs up and we will
see you guys in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
