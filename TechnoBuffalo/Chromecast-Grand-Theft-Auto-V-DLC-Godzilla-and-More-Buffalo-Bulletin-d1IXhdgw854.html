streaming to your television over the
coming days chromecast will gain access
to VEVO Red Bull TV Songza post TV viki
revision 3 and beyond pod as for local
content streaming Plex avea and
realplayer cloud will also be arriving
sometime this week unfortunately you're
still relying on third-party apps for
chromecast support and you can't stream
content directly from your device to
your television but honestly we're not
really complaining about those apps
google also in the news this week for
some new products hitting the google
play store the sony z ultra a white
Nexus 7 and the LG G pad google play
edition all hit the play store earlier
today the Z ultra is running 4.4 kitkat
sheds the xperia named sony typically
has on their devices and will put you
back 649 bucks off contract the Nexus 7

bucks off contract but for now is a US
only launched over in gaming Rockstar
released the post to their own newswire

their own custom jobs and publish them

a definitive edition of the critically
acclaimed tomb raider reboot would be
headed for next-gen consoles the game
will run natively in 1080p have nearly
four times the texture resolution and
include all the DLC previously released
I kind of like this idea of later last
gen titles re-released for next-gen with
better resolutions and a bunch of DLC
don't you Tomb Raider definitive edition
drops for ps4 and xbox one on January 28
2014 lastly our wildcard story for the
day comes from legendary pictures who
drop the Godzilla trailer on us this
morning in a big bad way everyone's
favorite lizard of destruction will be
hitting theaters May sixteenth of next
year and if the trailer is an accurate
depiction of what we'll be seeing in
theaters holy jeez are we excited here

tears of happiness seeing Godzilla back
on the big screen again mega excitement
