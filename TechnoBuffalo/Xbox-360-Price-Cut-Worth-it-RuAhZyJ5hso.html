technobuffalo here effective last Friday
August twenty-eighth the microsoft
slashed one hundred dollars off the cost
of their xbox 360 elite console bringing
it now to and down to a more reasonable
299 which surprisingly enough is now
head to head with the price of the sony
ps3 so i think we can officially say
that the console price wars our on your
now getting great value really much ever
way you go it definitely makes the
nintendo sort of force their hand that i
would expect a wheat price drop probably
coming soon but enough about the other
consoles let's talk about what microsoft
didn't talk about the xbox hundred
dollars off the elite that's awesome
save 100 bucks everybody's happy get the
same 120 gigabytes black console but you
could have gotten last week except now
you save a hundy which you can save for
candy also the pro model got a fifty
dollar price drop that's all supplies
last because microsoft is actually
discontinuing that model and the arcade
model which really doesn't include any
sort of hard drive is now still coming
in at two hundred dollars the same as it
was before one point of note though the
elite bundle that used to come with
really just a ton of cables is now i'm
going to be shipping without any HD
cables so it's really bring your own if
you're looking to get xbox 360 elite if
you've been holding off for a price drop
this is a great time to jump in you're
getting a really excellent value on a
pretty outstanding console with a great
online experience and really fantastic
library of games so guys is this going
to be enough to get you to buy an xbox
if you haven't yet are you not even
going to look at next box you're gonna
stick with sony or gonna get a ps3 or
wii or even no interest in video games
very curious to hear what you have to
say so leave a video response or comment
down below for exclusive content check
me out on twitter twitter com / John for
lakers an exclusive content sure to
check me out at TechnoBuffalo one last
point of note is i actually bought the
elite xbox 360 you bought it probably
about eight or nine months ago and i
paid the higher price and i still feel
okay with that you know with technology
you're bound to get decreased production
costs you're about to get decreased
manufacturing costs and component
costs surprises are bound to fall but I
think that this price point we're at now
the 299 today we're going to see things
fake for quite a while so feel free to
jump in the water's warm see you guys
next video bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
