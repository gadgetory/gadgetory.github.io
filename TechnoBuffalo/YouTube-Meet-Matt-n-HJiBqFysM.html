technobuffalo here it's been a while
since I've last seen you not really if
you're like me you watch a lot of tech
reviews I can't get enough of a maybe
watch me maybe watch other channels but
there are a lot of people doing
fantastic video work a lot of them have
very different approaches than me some
are more product oriented some of more
personality oriented but just very
different and they do awesome awesome
awesome job but forever reason they're
not getting the exposure that they
deserve so often times when I find some
such youtube or I will try and lure them
into techno buffalo's grasp and I saw
that a few weeks ago with John Q who
just does an absolutely fantastic job
and I found another such youtuber
diamond in the rough if you will by the
name of Matt so I would like to welcome
mat to the John for lakers TechnoBuffalo
family you'll see Matt making a video
maybe once a week 3 or 4 videos total
per month it's got an awesome awesome
sense of how to make videos are really
into products and gadgets and has a very
different style of video making an idea
so please meet Matt and welcome him to
the TechnoBuffalo family
hey everyone well John asked me to
introduce myself to you all and I was
looking at it and I've got about 5,000
subs and he's got about a hundred and
twenty four thousand sub so it's just
about a hundred nineteen thousand of you
don't know me I better get on this hi is
this Commodore kitty 64 my name is Matt
and i'll be doing some videos for
technobuffalo and i just want to
introduce myself think i'll count that
all right well that's probably not gonna
work that way let's just do it like this
here are the three things you guys need
to know about me one I like to make kind
of lame but somewhat endearing intros to
my videos like you just saw and you can
of course see more of those on my
personal channel that's Macintosh ooh I
love vintage check ipod sixth-generation
lame iphone for garbage real ipods have
click wheels that move and firewire
ports a three I have a lot of fun making
videos and I want you guys to have fun
watching them and we can both learn to I
learn how to be a better amateur
filmmaker you guys learn some things
about tech and it's a win-win and
everyone has a great time so I want to
go ahead and thank John and
technobuffalo for this opportunity i'm
really looking forward to it and i'll
