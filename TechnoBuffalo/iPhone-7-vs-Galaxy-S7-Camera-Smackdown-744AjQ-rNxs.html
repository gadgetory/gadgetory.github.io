everybody is asking the same question
one of the biggest updates with iPhones
always is that camera people want to
know how good is this camera is it any
better is it just marketing and more
importantly how does it stack up against
the competition today we're gonna be
doing our classic iPhone versus Samsung
the best from an iPhone and Apple with
the iPhone 7 versus the best from
Samsung with the galaxy s7 let's go and
get started what's really interesting to
me about phone cameras as of late has
been we've seen improvements move away
from speck and more towards the
direction of aesthetic and things that
are immeasurable rather than megapixel
count improving color rendition and
highlight roll off the iPhone 7 is a
prime example of this where Apple has
really put their effort into the way the
camera sees light rather than just how
many megapixels it has or how sharp the
image looks with that said you do
resolve more detail however the optics
seem to be better and seem to be sharper
this time around or maybe it's the wider
1.8 aperture when it stopped down does a
better job of resolving light moving on
to the s7 things are as we have come to
expect from Samsung images are very
clean very crisp resolves a lot of
detail but a good amount of it is over
sharpening in post as well as saturation
boost from built-in software when
looking at the images side by side I do
prefer the iPhone sevens image and again
as mentioned at the beginning this is
really down to the way it looks and sees
light everything just seems a lot more
natural and a lot less forced which the
Samsung seems to be trying to do it
seems to be trying to show you look at
how good my camera is rather than just
having a simple clean clear image in
some of our photos I did notice a
slightly warmer tone coming out of the
samsung nothing you can't correct with a
quick little color correction in your
phone but something to note nonetheless
both cameras are putting out 12
megapixel images so your image size here
is pretty much the same and moving on to
the front-facing cameras the iPhone is
now upgraded to a 7 megapixel camera but
I still prefer the 5 megapixel ultra
wide front facing camera on Samsung I
have always said I am a huge fan of
ultra wide front facing cameras and I
think Samsung does it best
and let's also not forget that Samsung
here has a wider
faster aperture on that front-facing
camera at an F 1.7 where's the iPhone
has a seven megapixel F 2.2 lens in
terms of video it's pretty much the same
stuff as photos into using the same
color profiles from the same company so
their approaches here are similar as
well with Samsung having higher
saturation and more vibrancy with slight
over sharpening where the iPhone goes
for a slightly subtle more flatter more
neutral looking image in low-light both
phones look absolutely terrible I want
to make it a point to dismiss this myth
that phones can be good in low light
it's really a matter of which phone is
less terrible as of now though maybe in
the future they will get better in this
case I will give the slight edge to the
iPhone this was just from the
circumstances that I used it in I did
think it resolved noise a little bit
better and I thought the noise looked a
little more organic rather than the
Samsung's noise which looked a little
more digital and kind of all over the
place in terms of color and so that's
really it guys I didn't want to dive
into pixel peeping for this video I'm
also wanted to use it as an opportunity
to show you guys some photos from both
phones side by side and really get what
your opinions were in the comments down
below as well as share mine in this case
they're both phone cameras they look
very very similar but if I had to pick
one I would pick the iPhone because of
those subtleties over the over
sharpening and the over saturation
that's more my interest in Apple's color
profiles really in the way they render
out the image rather than the optics
necessarily but it's very hard to
separate both of those factors when
looking at any camera really phone or
otherwise let me know what you guys
think in the comments down below which
phone has a better camera which one do
you prefer I'm very curious to hear what
you guys think give us a thumbs up if
you liked this video please subscribe
for more tech content and coverage and I
can't wait to see you guys in the next
video thank you for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
