Kravitz from technobuffalo calm one of
my favorite tablets of this year or when
I first saw it at Mobile World Congress
in Barcelona was the HTC Flyer now that
I've had the Wi-Fi only version for
about a week now along with the magic
pen it's still my favorite let's find
out
you
otherwise we've got snap booth which is
a a little kind of Apple photo booth
type app for I mean you compared to
apple but you know they have it out
there so whatever it's a little
front-facing camera app just kind of fun
you know some other little stuff like
that you've got the e-reader and this
looking into talking about the pen which
is what I want to talk about so you
write your e-reader in here and it's
powered by Kobo and you know it comes
with some books pre pre loaded so here's
the here's the scarlet letter and I can
read the scarlet letter and so now I can
go to Kobo and i can download books i
can shop so here's the ebooks by Kobo
store and I've got got books and
periodicals as well and again you know
cut was a big player but again you know
you can access you can download the
kindle app this little different because
you can download kindle you can download
nook for the device and use those if
you'd rather which you know some people
might because those are sort of the
bigger players but the reader works well
and we'll get back into the reader
actually go back in here and start to
use the pen and so when i'm in the
reader i can draw to make a note i can
erase by pressing you see the pen has
two buttons there so i can press the one
button to erase and i can press the
other button to highlight and so this is
where using the pen you know gets into i
think the pen can be very valuable for
very specific situations HTC has you
know it's an ecosystem and they're going
to talk to the recording developers
they've got an API for the pan the whole
thing and they really need to build
functionality around the pen to bring it
to a larger market because right now I
think for a student you know a device
like this with the pen could be great
because for highlighting for note taking
all that kind of stuff if you know your
school or university supports ebooks
that work with HTC's pen system and you
can carry this thing around instead of a
whole stack of books and you can
download books instead of you know
having to go to the library especially
it's a book you have to get from a
different school or library on a loan
that sort of thing you know that's where
technology can really be empowering and
being able to use this device to make
notes in the margin you know if you have
handwriting that's somewhat legible
unlike mine you know it can be terrific
and then here's a little pen button and
you tap it with the pen and you get you
know you can change colours and you can
change you know pen tips and all that
kind of stuff but as it is now you know
you can use the pen in the reader you
can use the pen anywhere if you tap you
get a screenshot and it automatically
launches the scribble app and then in
the screen you know in the scribble app
I can make annotations and I can talk
about you know how and let's uh let's
change my color here and we'll go to
something we can see a little bit better
there's the clock and maybe we'll make
make this a little bit thicker so it's
easy to see clock and so on you know so
but there's not a ton you can do with it
right now you can use it in the reader
you can use it in the scribble app and
you can also use it in notes and you
might see her the way that HTC explains
me was basically anything that you would
do on the screen normally on a tablet
with your finger you do with your finger
and anything where you're going to be
drawing that's where you use the pen so
in getting used to device I took a lot
of screenshots I didn't mean to take
because I want you know i have the pen
in hand and I said all right well let's
uh let's launch notes and then instead
of launching it took a screenshot
because that's that's what it's set up
to do but if I go to notes notes is cool
because notes is set up to sync with
Evernote so if you use Evernote this is
pretty awesome I'm not in a noted always
I've oh my facebook friends attached
here and so it always be certain to note
it says it looks like you're in a
meeting which is a nice feature except
that I need to take my Facebook friends
out because I'm not actually in a
meeting with Tyler Murray's birthday but
happy birthday each other so I'll start
a new note and you can take a picture
you can add audio notes which is cool
all kinds of stuff and you can type
or you can draw so I'm going to do
here's my note yay and then here hola
we'll give the gift that I cannot
receive anymore which is the gift of
hair and there you go so here's my note
now when I'm done with my note I can
share it I can save it whoops I don't
mean to discard it I can share it I can
save it I can do all that stuff and
it'll automatically get saved to
Evernote if you're logged into Evernote
and everyone oh it's really cool because
this note will then automatically show
up on any other device I can I can
access Evernote on so a smart phone a
laptop a desktop etc so if you're the
kind of person if you use Evernote a lot
of people do you know this is a really
great system for productivity I think so
anyway in a nutshell you know that
that's kind of a quick look or an
in-depth look I should say not quick
look at what the flyer can do and I
think basically you know you've got your
music player you've got support for all
kinds of codecs audio and video like I
said performance has been really good
you know the cameras are kind of
mediocre which is too bad that's sort of
how lots of a lots of tablet are right
now the pen functionality you know it's
very pricey and for an extra 80 bucks on
top of a five-hundred-dollar tablet
that's kind of a big ask right now given
the limited use of the pet I think of
HTC you can get some more developers on
board and build an ecosystem around it
then great I think there's really a
market for a pen stylus in environments
like you know enterprise environments
and school environments where people
want to use this thing they want to take
notes they want to carry this and you
know use it for highlight and use it for
you know annotating things you're in a
meeting you want to scroll down to note
that kind of thing that's where this
could become kind of a more legitimate
laptop replacement in a Productivity
environment it's sort of a general use
environment I think it just comes down
to you know what what do you want out of
your tablet and if you like HTC Sense
and you like the 7-inch form factor this
is a great device a little bit pricey
but a great device if you don't
necessarily need sense or you want
something that's bigger but maybe a
little bit lighter even you know the
galaxy tab Ted won the transformer with
the dual core nvidia chips ah the G
slate from t-mobile and LG the optimus
pad is they call it you know those are
devices which their honeycomb
and you have access right now to the
honeycomb ABS maybe a little bit less
polish but you know that's going to
improve over time for sure and with
three dot 1 rolling out as well and I
definitely compelling choices so overall
a thumbs up to the flyer but it's a
reserve thumbs up because it has to fit
your particular needs it was my favorite
tablet at at Mobile World Congress now
that I've had it in hand for a while and
I've had a galaxy tab 10 one in hand
honestly if I had to choose I think i
would personally go with the tab 10 one
and for me you know holding it holding
the 10 one maybe think oh wow a tablet
this big and light is really nice then I
don't mind holding it in one hand but I
you know for portability sake the
smaller footprint of the fly are
definitely good anyway it's all about
choices these days and smartphones and
tablets and everything else and you have
plenty of choices thanks for the folks
to HTC for loaning us the HTC Flyer
wifi-only edition again it's on sale now
for 99 from best buy the pen will run
you an additional 80 bucks and now we
should see the sprint version the first
carrier version coming soon much much
more on the flyer all the other tablets
