with technobuffalo you're looking at a
white box but inside this box has
actually Sprint's Optimus G from LG yeah
I guess they sent me this because they
didn't have the final packaging ready
yet here's the phone very similar to 18
T's model which I just filmed so you
should see it on our channel but I'll
get it right here very similar looking
but you'll notice this one kept the
13-megapixel back it has absolutely no
sprint branding on it which is kind of
strange it just has the LG logo and then
if you look closely you can see the
camera sort of pops out a little bit
it's not flush with the surface as it is
on a TNT's model in any case through the
box and I'm not again I don't think this
is final packaging there's no documents
or anything you just get the charging
cables you get a bat that's it so let's
put up the phone and I'll show you some
more features ok while it's booting
volume controls on the left hand side of
the device 3.5 millimeter headphone jack
up top power button on the right that's
loud micro USB charging on the bottom
another difference again with the AT&amp;amp;T
version is this comes with storage but
18 TS has a removable micro SD card slot
on the left hand side device Prince does
not here we are we're looking at it it's
very similar to a tease otherwise has
got some bloat where they all do moving
around very quick this is again a
quad-core processor it's clocked at 1.5
gigahertz I believe its Qualcomm
Snapdragon s4 pro super super fast 2
gigs of ram everything's been amazing on
these devices so far let's see no
downloaded apps widgets your standard
fare here this is running Android Ice
Cream Sandwich LG has said that a jelly
bean update is coming I don't know when
you know that usually takes months this
should be a 4G LTE device here I am
though and I have 3g in New York City
which is supposed to be one of sprint's
LTE markets quick memo I went over this
in the AT&amp;amp;T video I'll show you here
it's really easy to use so when it's
activated you can use it to
say circle something and say hey this is
the app that I told you to download so
go get it and then save it and you can
see what your notebook or gallery I
prefer gallery and then send it off to
friends so it's great with maps I don't
want to bring up the map because then
you guys are all going to know where i
am and come and get me but say on the
calendar and then I go to quick memo and
I say this is the week that I'm going on
vacation don't tell John saving it to
the gallery done so it's really really
quick and easy to use you don't get the
s pen or whatever from Samsung but your
finger works really well it's great for
notes like that let's see what else I in
the video section and I don't think this
has any video is preloaded on it you can
actually play them no we don't you can
play them over anything you're doing so
you can change the opacity and write an
email and sort of have the video up top
clear or we're fully viewable it also
has great deal on a so you can share the
video to your DLNA enabled TV or your
xbox or anything like that mmm excuse me
I'm getting over being sick let's see
settings different settings menu here
that on the 18 tiver j'en this is sort
of typical wireless networks immediately
right there and go to more NFC you've
got it all can change the lock screen
just a bit there's different clocks and
shortcuts you can have on it this one's
cool i like this one the best because it
just looks awesome you can have your
owner info on there everything like that
there's also quad core control I showed
this in the ATT demo too so if you want
to save battery life you don't need all
four cores going at the same time right
so you can hit eco mode and then the
only operate when they need to so I
would recommend using that another thing
in settings I wanted to go over the
display I've noticed this on both
versions so far when you try to change
the brightness where is there it is it's
at sixty-three percent sometimes it says
it's too hot to go to one hundred
percent it'll go back to like sixty-six
percent so that could be something with
the quad core control I'm not sure yet
I've seen various reports online
it has happened to me every single time
in any case that is a quick look here at
the optimus G for sprint it's coming
soon this is todd Hazleton with
