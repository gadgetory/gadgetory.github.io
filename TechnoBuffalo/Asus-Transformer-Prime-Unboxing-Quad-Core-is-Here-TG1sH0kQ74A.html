technobuffalo here every now and then we
get the chance to unbox a
paradigm-shifting product and we've got
that opportunity today with the first
quad-core product on the market this is
the Asus built epad transformer prime it
is running in videos latest Tegra 3 it's
been hyped it's been rumored it's been
leaked let's go ahead and see if it's
worthy of all the hype this is the asus
eee pad transformer prime
alright so here is the asus eee pad
transformer prime and all of its pre
unbox glory a Suzy pad transformer prime
you have a picture of their vice with
its optional keyboard dock there you've
got some information on what it can do
but we're going to run through all that
we've got a profile shot let's go ahead
and pull off the top of the box doesn't
have any sort of cellophane or plastic
on it inside you've got a little bit of
cushion to protect it in shipping and
here is the asus eee pad transformer
prime the first Tegra 3 device and right
off the bat you can tell this is a much
thinner device than previous generation
asus tablets feels very solid and
surprisingly light in the hands push it
off to the side for just a quick second
and we'll see what else we're going to
get in the box epad transformer prime
looks like we've got some specs and
stuff in there a little bit of an
information card and then in here
probably got some warranty information
yeah warranty card stuff push all that
off not overly exciting got a cleaning
cloth because you need to wash your
hands and you touch your tablet with
dirty dirty fingers so you can go ahead
and clean it with this blue cloth here
we've got the charging stuff is a
proprietary charging cord this guy of
course plugs into the wall USB boom goes
in is how you do all your syncing and
charging and I think that that's that's
all we're gonna have in the boats let's
take a look at the actual tablet itself
and of course we'll run through all the
specs on it us you've got some asus
branding looks like it's letting you
know where all the power buttons are and
the rest of the stuff that it can do
with the diagram here Tegra 3 quad-core
8.3 millimeter slim super IPS panel
we'll talk about all this stuff as we go
through let's go ahead after plastic i'm
pretty excited to see what take a look
at this guy my original review of the
asus eee pad transformer the first was
actually very positive is one of my
favorite and still remains actually one
of my favorite android tablets this guy
feels
world's better from a build quality
material standpoint got sort of that
brushed metal look and feel and it
appears to be a very high quality build
so let's push this down here I'm going
to go ahead and power it up I should
have looked better where that power
button was I believe that's where it
lived like it's already turned on and
let's talk about the specs of this guy
there's obviously a lot going on here we
will unlock it in the first thing you'll
see is it is honeycomb alright so let's
talk price and retail availability this
guy is going to be available in stores
the week of 12 19 we don't have any date
for potential 3g model in the US it may
be available a week earlier online in
addition to major retail outlets to be
available on newegg Best Buy staples
fries amazon it's also gonna be
available at gamestop and this guy is
very gaming heavy we'll talk about that
in just a few minutes what is this thing
going to cost you well it's going to
have two choices the 32gb model is going
to be four hundred ninety nine dollars
if you want to double your storage
pleasure it's going to be five hundred
ninety nine dollars and the optional
docking station we'll take a look at
it's going to be a hundred and forty
nine bucks operating system wise it is
going to ship with Android 3.2 point one
honeycomb will be upgraded though to ice
cream sandwich we've seen ice cream
sandwich actually running on this and a
proof of concept that we publish on
TechnoBuffalo and that asus has shown us
and they have said that it's definitely
coming absolutely coming and should be
coming soon and of course this is
running Tegra 3 which is quad-core it's
actually five chords it's kind of
interesting so i'll give you the very
brief synopsis and we'll do much more on
how it works it's got a fifth companion
core running at about 500 megahertz
that'll do a lot of the background
processing for you when you don't need
full four cores doing stuff so you're
going to get improved battery life at
least allegedly and from a battery
standpoint here you're actually going to
get close to 12 hours of battery life so
it's quite surprising you're going to
get these hypothetically close to double
the performance
you're going to get about thirty to
forty percent better on the battery side
alright so let's talk dimensions of this
guy it is eight point three millimeters
thin and you can really see that than
this it is a very very thin tablet aces
clearly spent a lot of time with the
hardware making this not only a
functional and enjoyable tablet to use
but also a tablet that feels good in the
hand so the screen that we're looking at
is 10.1 inches and that is of course a
measure diagonal it's LED backlit and
it's got a wxga resolution so that's
1280 by 800 it's a super IPS plus panel
and it's got go really glass on it so it
should be pretty durable may not be able
to put this guy in your pocket with some
keys it's got a gig of ram storage as I
mentioned it's 32 or 64 there's a lot of
camera stuff going on here let's go
ahead and flip this guy over to the back
side and let's take a look at the camera
we have here so that is an 8 megapixel
sensor that can do 1080p recording and
it's got a front-facing camera which is
1.2 megapixels so you can do all kinds
of vanity shots with the front-facing
camera if you like so network Wi-Fi only
for right now again no word on a 3g US
model though presumably we will see it
keyboard dock again it's going to be
available for 150 bucks that's going to
be available in two colors gray or gold
alright so let's walk through the tablet
and take a look at some of the hardware
here so obviously in this particular
orientation you've got the camera in the
middle the Asus logo is facing the right
way in the upper left hand corner if we
go ahead and flip it on its top we've
got a microphone there is your power and
lock button and nothing else lives on
the top a little bit of a taper design
to it on the right hand side 3.5
millimeter headset jack continue the
tour down there's nothing on the bottom
here that is through a bit of a cover to
keep that dock connection clean you
don't have to keep this with you though
if you like but that's where it's going
to live alright so continuing our tour
across the tablet nothing
is going to be on the bottom but a lot
of stuff is going to be living here on
the left-hand side here you've got a
user accessible microSD slot go ahead
and pop that out tiny go ahead and up
your memory if you like button pop that
back in that just a dummy card got some
microphones there as well continue the
tour you've got a hdmi out a little bit
right there and a volume rocker up and
down got some speakers as well on almost
hidden on the left hand side of the
tablet go ahead and start this
orientation backup course will have a
ton of hands-on and impressions with the
asus eee pad transformer prime this has
