probably know we launched technobuffalo
calm today something that I've been
talking about for months and that we've
been working on for a better part of a
year well we ran into some issues and
I'm going to be honest with you I've
always been relatively upfront in my
videos we're trying to work through them
we had some server issues due to massive
traffic and we had some issues with the
code itself during our beta testing you
really was impossible to simulate almost
hundreds of thousands of users hitting
the site in a very short period of time
and unfortunately things just didn't
work according to plan so instead of
leaving this site up with known bugs we
pulled it down for a little bit so we
can review the code and sort of see
where the problems were the site will be
coming back at full strength very soon
and we've got a bevy of awesome
giveaways that are lined up for you
we've got Zhu Neng DS Playstations
xboxes and a ton of really good stuff
all I'm asking for is your patience as
you bear with us you look at Apple when
they launched the iphone 3g in the
in-store activation that they had you
look at the shuttle launches and those
are so much more complicated things the
ways happen this is just one of the
things that won't happen to occur then
fortune as it might be but hopefully in
a few months no one's going to remember
this we just ran into problems I like
into this and a video yesterday to
birthing a child and already my baby is
causing quite a stir so just want to you
know thank you guys for your patience
please bear with me and bear with us as
we get the site up and running and we
can show you the vision that we have for
TechnoBuffalo close you they've got a
sneak preview of it today and you may
have run into problems registering will
rectify those and you'll be up and
running on your account in no time I
promise so guys I just want to sort of
keep you in the loop and let you know
and as soon as the site is up running
and functional which I expect to be soon
I will definitely let you know kind of
crack age is one of those delays it
happens but I thought that instead of
posting Twitter and people wondering it
might be best just to be a front with
you and tell you just what was going on
so thank you guys again
or your patients and for those to you
that I've ever tried to launch a site
you're probably aware of some of the
things that we're going through there
just growing pains so as we build
TechnoBuffalo and try and get it to be
the solid platform and we usher and we
think will be the next generation of
technology blogging it's gonna have to
be after din act a later time as we iron
out these issues so guys again just
thank you and know that we are working
around the clock to get this right for
you I'll see you guys the next one bye
bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
