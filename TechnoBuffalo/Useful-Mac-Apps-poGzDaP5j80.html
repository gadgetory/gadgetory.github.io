from TechnoBuffalo and normally I do app
videos for you guys but those apps tend
to be on your phones today I'm going to
be giving you guys apps on Mac on your
desktop that can improve your workflow
can improve your day to day the number
one thing we're going to be looking at
is parallels 12 for those of you who
don't know which I'd be surprised as
many of you don't parallels allows you
to run Windows on your Mac within your
Mac OS what's new with parallels 12 is a
plethora of features like OneTouch tools
at a bunch of other improvements in
performance and fluidity that integrate
some of the best features of Mac such as
Do Not Disturb software updates into
parallels making it a much more seamless
experience for Windows and Mac and in my
experience of using parallels that's
kind of what it was I've never really
used parallels before so it's hard for
me to compare really parallels 11:00 to
12:00 but it was a very fluid smooth
experience I was a big fan and if you
are going to use Windows for certain
types of software for gaming on a Mac
this is a great alternative and all the
new improvements are very welcome as
they all are minor improvements that add
up to the bigger picture to make a big
improvement in the experience as a whole
next we have unity now unity was a big
problem solver for me because I use
about three to four devices if not more
and I have different files different
Clips different video clips different
photos different documents on each and
every one of them and every now and then
I have to access another one and I know
I'm not the only person with this
problem I know a lot of you guys have
that as well now of course there's
things like remote access or cloud
sharing and you can do the old-school
just transferring stuff on an SSD but
unity sort of takes the best of each and
every one of these worlds and then cuts
out the bad stuff so you don't get the
downsides of cloud storage you're having
to wait for syncing and that kind of
stuff file stay privately on the hard
drive or the flash memory of whatever
device they were on you're simply
accessing them through the app it's sort
of interlinking all of your devices
whether it be desktops laptops phones or
tablets what's also cool about this is
by accessing any of your files you can
also share any of your files with one or
two clicks you can export it and then
share it via email copied to your
clipboard texted upload to a cloud
storage whatever you want next we have P
ia which is a VPN service
and service for those of you who don't
know is a Virtual Private Network and it
basically masks your IP address of where
you're accessing the internet from PIAA
is great because they offer a full sort
of end-to-end comprehensive service of
everything you want from a VPN encrypted
Wi-Fi peer-to-peer support five devices
simultaneously unlimited bandwidth no
traffic logs awesome awesome stuff and
if you buy their one-year package it's
only three bucks a month or about 333
it's a little bit more if you go
month-to-month but it's always a great
option and I personally really enjoy
using it myself for security because I'm
a little sketched out by certain things
in the world and that's just what it is
and last but not least we have radiant
Player which is an app that I installed
a while back when I switched to Google
playing music and that's kind of what it
is it's a desktop player for google play
music kind of weird that Google doesn't
have their own first party version I
guess they want you to use it within
chrome but if you do want to use it
separately from chrome radiant player is
a great option they do a really good job
of updating and one of my favorite
things was right after download it'll
work automatically with your play pause
skip buttons on your Mac keyboard and
before I let you guys go one more
service that I'm a fan of it's not
really an app is audible and a big fan
of audible because I spend a lot of time
in my car and I like reading but in most
cases listening to books a book that I'm
currently listening to is the war of art
by Steven Pressfield another book I'm
really looking forward to getting is ego
is the enemy by ryan holiday but let me
know what books you guys are looking
forward to reading or listening to you

day free trial by signing up using our
