Phone teams out of New York City today
and we're excited showing off our newest
windows phone 7 that are coming out this
holiday we go through what I'm going to
show you here is the Samsung Focus
renounced it today with a TMT it'll be
for 199 and will be on the market this
holiday season this is my Start screen I
bring that was a little bit more on the
Start screen action absolutely 3300
enjoy do doha the law kyrenia absolutely
so let me show you my lockscreen first
so what you see with the lock screen
here is you'll see that all the
information that I actually care about
is right here on this lock screen you
see the time the Davis Barry stamina
have friends with lunch with friends at
the cafe at twelve o'clock my messages
are coming through so there's our 66 new
email messages that I got this morning
with them right from the launcher is
your new text you can't
so you actually need to pull up the lock
screen and come right on in and find the
child to get that information you'll see
out here I bring up my lai my Start
screen and what's on my Start screen is
completely different than anything out
there on phones today and what you see
is all of my live tiles I put several
different live tiles on my screen so I
came to ask I pinned my workout mix that
I did this morning when I went out on a
run it was being brought in from the
zune I pinned some office documents and
you can order these your hands really
easy to customize I can change the color
and then I can also change the order so
if I decide that I want to put Fandango
up closer because I want to go out and
watch a movie later I can move it up or
if I decide that I went delete it all I
need to do is press the delete button
and it's gone from my screen and I can
also change the color so sometimes i
decide that i wanted to like a pink I
can head on over here to my settings
it's easy as pressing my cuddle time
around
and my screen is now so I can decide the
way that I want it to look and I can
make it look like my own phone if it
bring into my people hug what this does
is this brings all the people that I
care about into one place you'll see it
brings them all into the local contact
information so i can sort down or i can
press the Search button and I can easily
get to one of my friends contact cards
and this is putting information from
social networks it's pulling it from my
facebook account and my windows live
account from those two accounts as well
as it's calling the Miss case is pulling
from my outlook to be falling for my
hotmail yahoo etc if i go back to the
house you'll see I pull over to the
right what this is is bringing in a feed
from my facebook as well as my windows
blind so as my friends are updating
their status updates just posting
pictures on facebook in real time I get
that update tube assembly to my people
hub I can scroll down and I can find
that when my friend please say I just
posted this picture of my friend Craig
right from that screen I can go to that
picture and then i can post a comment or
i can post interpersonal multi-touch
alone
was right from here okay whoa look at
that eyeball Craig looking good resuming
is very serious something's very smooth
it's very serious so that's what people
have i'll show you two other things that
i love i think i go back to my Start
screen I go to my calendar what this is
doing is just ringing in the calendars
with travel to places for me it's
windows live as well as my outlook
calendar what i can do is i think our
code it so my personal went to orange
and my work ones are purple I could go
down and I can find it to meeting that's
happening later tonight you'll see that
the address here I have a late model
where I would have had a written it down
take it all i need to do is press on the
window and it's going to bring up my map
so i don't even need to do that one's
for you to get to this map location it
brings that's straight from here and
when I can do my hair as i can say fine
where I'm located address this button to
pull out it's going to bring me out to
New York City show me exactly where I'm
located and i'm going to say giving
driving directions all right definitely
don't want to drive its location today
but if i wanted to it's going to pull it
turn-by-turn driving directions tell me
how much time is gonna take karate so
that's the calendar
one of the features i personally love
and use all the time it's games greatest
baby into our experience
not all of our mouths I press the Search
nuts and it brings up the big experience
that you would see on your desktop I
don't know if you're a big user of
things that I am and it brings up all
these fun pictures what I love to see
every day in this case i can find out if
this is weasel or ferry or whatever this
thing is and then from there I can
search right from biggs i can do that
two ways i can either take it in and
search I can decide that I'm going to
use voice recognition and say pizza
this house
it's hard collapse let's type in it
today but it works fast
that's right hand from tell me it works
fantastically so here what it's doing is
it's bringing in pewter and what you'll
see here is at the top the panorama is I
can go from naught to write and I can
decide how I want to search for pete's
like a full of all the latest news on
pizza I can go over and find out keeps a
website or i can see that there are all
these locations nearby because i'm jory
and I wanted or have pizza if I decide
that I want to go on a pizza and I want
to make sure that it's a place that's
sort of reputable I can see that their
start and that's actually bringing him
reviews so I just bring up here famous
original rates by death I can find all
the information and pictures they're
ours on their website i can use ours
down there giving me my maths and I
directions and then i can scroll over
and it would be no with you i also use a
lot when i'm done with pizza I can't
decide you know what I need to run a few
more errands and they can find all the
places near lie I could decide that I
can we go have those days hey after
