samsung propel pro and i lost a bet
so the samsung propel pro is one of the
newest windows mobile phone in 18 T's
lineup I know it's probably are dating
seriously cowboy getup but as I
mentioned in the intro I lost a bet and
I'm a man of my word so let's get to the
review samsung propel pro is a windows
mobile 6.1 standard meaning
non-touchscreen smartphone comes in a
very square form factor it's actually a
lot fatter than most phones but that's
due to its slide-out QWERTY keyboard
which I'm very happy to admit it is
really easy to use it actually has a
keyboard very similar to the blackberry
bold mean the sides are bevels I kind of
walked through the keyboard a little bit
more through my unboxing so check that
out for reference it is very easy to use
it's really easy to type and one of the
gripes i usually have with slide out
keyboards it's very hard to type on the
first row of keys because your thumbs
are always hitting the top not so
actually with the propel pro you put a
little buffer up there so there's a
little bit of room between the bottom of
the phone and the first row of keys most
keyboards have a general learning curve
would take you a week to two weeks so
you're kind of typing fast on it really
not the case with this one i was typing
very quickly almost when the first time
i used it so really putos the samsung
for putting together an awesome keyboard
so it's hard to review this phone not
making a review of windows mobile 6.1
standard but i'm going to do my best and
talk about how the operating system
works with this phone not how it works
kind of asshole on this phone actually
works relatively well and i've gone a
record in the past of saying that i like
windows mobile 6.1 in particular the
sliding panel interface i did a video a
while back demonstrating it and outwards
kind of versus the iphone so you can go
ahead and check that out if you want to
see it in action but that's not the
purpose of this video 6.1 standard is
really easy to navigate the sliding
panels make things easy to change your
ringtone change your profiles add a
contact at calendar item really most the
most important tasks are very easy to
use the nice thing about this phone the
reason it's a little bit fatter than
most as well it comes with a very big
battery windows mobile and coupled with
3g make for a huge battery suck but the
big boy in this thing will get you
through two days of pretty
tensive usage so that's actually quite
nice so some of the positives of the
phone some more positives rather it is a
phone so it's got to make phone calls
and as like most Samsung device up
tested actually a signal strength was
very good reception was clear I heard a
little bit of white noise on my end but
the collars on the other end didn't
report hearing any of that so it's
something that you got used to very
quickly Wi-Fi strength because it does
have Wi-Fi was actually quite strong so
I was very happy to hear that I've
always been a fan of the slide design as
well and I think it works relatively
nicely with the samsung propel low pro
you can open it up the answer calls and
close it to end it you can set the
phones when you close it actually locks
of device so you won't dial anybody in
your pocket which is a very nice feature
in my opinion so some of the iffy things
about to be buddies it does not have
actual deep at it uses a still a
joystick in the middle here let me zoom
into guys can see what I'm talking about
right there in the middle it's not enjoy
it actually serves as five way
navigation so you push it out for up
down for down left or right obviously
and select it right in the middle well
it's cowboy heads big so I'm going to
zoom back out a little bit here the
navigation takes a little bit of getting
used to with the joystick it's not so
intuitive and sometimes your finger
slips off of it it's not raised terribly
much it's only a little bit of room for
your thumbs to slip on the underneath it
or the side or whatever way you're going
hopefully you have to be very conscious
of your movements but once you get used
to what it does work very well and it is
certainly fluid hardware-wise aren't
many hardware buttons actually on it two
buttons on the top for selecting the
menu items ascend an end key in your
typical home and back button for windows
mobile nothing revolutionary there I do
have to say that build quality on the
phone is also actually very nice as well
since we're talking about some of the
positive thing I felt solid the sliding
mechanism spring assisted and ever felt
like it was gonna break which is nice
slider phones can sometimes have four
but she fields then if the mechanism
isn't built properly so I'm very happy
to report that in this case it was built
very nice some of the negatives big is
negative for me is this thing is a
fingerprint magnet and choked during my
unboxing how reflective it is in fact
it's all team so does a mirror but man
anytime be touchless or plug your pocket
you're gonna finger prints
all over and no matter how many times
you wash your face since you pull this
thing away it's gonna have some gunk on
it which is not going to be so cool
you're always kind of going like this
cleaning off the phone or web done your
sleeve or using the tissue whatever it
is to clean the phone you're always
going to be using that so because of the
unique design the phone is a little bit
big it's certainly a pocketable phone
but if your cowboy for example wearing
some tight jeans you have a hard time
fitting in your pocket so they'll be
something to being aware of it is kind
of short it's stout as well something
makes a very noticeable no bulge in your
pocket but you know it's nothing that
bad nothing you can't deal with I do
like the 320 x 320 screen that's on here
it's actually the first for a windows
mobile standard device until she makes a
very easy for navigation you can relieve
you emails and texts and the internet
tech space was very nice easily so again
props to samsung for that I don't have
any negatives with this phone windows
Mobile's for you that you're going to
like it if you don't like windows mobile
and stay very far away because it is at
its heart windows mobile 6.1 standard
device so guys is jon rettinger with a
