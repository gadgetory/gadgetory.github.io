to you by Dollar Shave Club what's going
on guys a m√§rklin Sangha from
TechnoBuffalo and this Tuesday we're
going to do something a little different
yet again today I'll be sharing with you
guys my top 5 launchers for Android so
let's get started if you guys haven't
seen what's on my phone video make sure
to check that out because the first one
on the list is Nova Launcher prime this
is my go-to launcher and it's one of the
lightest and most featured pack
launchers out there it offers tons of
customization options like transition
animations use icon packs from various
icon packs from the Google Play Store
and the ability to prompt Google now by
using a hot word like okay Google how
tall is Anna Kendrick this feature is
something we've only really seen on the
Google now launcher and everything about
Nova Launcher is great I haven't had any
problems with this launcher in any of
the phones I've tried and just the other
day nova launcher updated their app to
version 3.1 and it introduced a few new
features like transition animations
which allows you to set a certain
animation when accessing your app drawer
for example and overall this launcher is
just super stable and if you buy the
add-on prime version which i have here
you can actually unlock a few more
tweaks that you may find useful like the
ability to swipe on an icon and set
custom actions for swiping ability to
set unread counsel and supported apps
like hangouts and there's a few more on
here that I'm sure a lot of you guys
will probably get a kick out of the
second launcher would probably be the
Google now launcher which I really
really like for some odd reason I know
John uses this launcher on his oneplus
one and he can't stop raving about it if
I wasn't using the oneplus one with the
updated trebuchet launcher and wanted to
get a bit more of a stock Android field
then the Google now launcher is probably
my first choice like I mentioned earlier
with nova launcher you can profitable
now by using a hot word but with a
Google now launcher you also have access
to Google now page by just swiping to
the right which can be really useful if
you want to use Google now on a daily
basis unfortunately it doesn't offer
many customization options like nova
launcher this is bare bone minimum stock
Android and if you want to get a feel
for stock Android then the Google now
launcher is the best one out there
third launcher on my list would have to
be
and launcher right now it looks just
like my Nova Launcher homescreen because
when you first set up Action launcher
you have the option to actually import
your homescreen from your previous
launcher and the cool thing about action
launcher is that it looks and works like
any other stock launcher but comes with
their own little twist they have this
thing called shutters which sort of acts
like mini widgets for various apps so if
I swipe down in my calendar it'll show
me my agenda for the week and that goes
for the other supported apps as well
talent is supported and I can view my
timeline impose a new tweet without
having to launch to the app if I want
and up at the top there's a few icons
like search where I can search various
things on my phone or directly to Google
and right next to that is a shortcut for
the Google Play Store and there's also a
menu button right next to it to access
things like the launcher settings now
they also have quick drawer which acts
as your app drawer it will list all your
apps in an alphabetical order and you
also have access to your widgets here
which you can drag to either your home
screen or your quick page if you want to
quickly access your most weakened apps
or most use widget with just a single
swipe unfortunately most of the ideal
functionality that users would want in a
launcher isn't available in a free
version and action launcher really wants
you to buy the pro version which is
pretty much everywhere in this launcher
let's take a quick break from this video
to thank our friends at Dollar Shave
Club buying razors suck right you got to
walk to the store pick out a razor and
shell out $20 for some ridiculous shave
tech you don't even need fortunately
there's a company that's doing away with
all that ridiculousness it's called
Dollar Shave Club and it couldn't be any
simpler for a few bucks a month Dollar
Shave Club ships amazing razors and
other bathroom stuff right to your door
their blades are just as good as the big
shave companies at a fraction of the
price they've also got dr. Carver's ez
shea butter to make your shave even more
buttery smooth shave time shave money
join now a dollarshaveclub.com/tekzilla
buffalo thats
dollarshaveclub.com/tekzilla Flo the
fourth launcher I wanted to share with
you guys is buzz launcher maybe the most
prominent feature of buzz launcher is
that it allows its users to download
complete homescreen setups now don't get
that confused with theme since it's a
bit different apart from coming from
their own icon sets and wallpapers these
setups also Rock their own layouts
making each homescreen set up completely
different now when you first download
buzz launcher you have the option to
choose from your first home pack but you
can always choose from thousands of home
pack
through the home pack buzz and download
the one you think is the one for you
there are tons of customization options
here and you can change pretty much
everything and anything on here to where
your Android device won't look like an
Android device anymore all these themes
are user made and if you happen to make
one from scratch you can also choose to
upload that home pack you just made for
others to try which we've never really
seen before in other launchers overall
to say the least
buzz launcher is a community based
launcher and if you're one to tinker
with your device I think you'd want to
give buzz launcher a try now the last
launcher I want to show you guys is a v8
which Yahoo surprisingly bought earlier
this year for 80 million dollars this
one's probably one of the more unique
launchers of you so far it essentially
allows you to change the way you use
your home screen and it gives your phone
a completely different look from the
typical Android home screens that were
all used to sort of like what we saw
with buzz launcher but with a more
toned-down look when you swipe left you
have a collection of apps that are
organized in different categories and it
basically organizes your app collections
based on what you're doing or where you
are whether you're at home or at work
and when you swipe again to the left you
get a list of your apps in alphabetical
order sort of like any regular app menu
now if I swipe to the right from my main
home page this is my today view sort of
like Google now and it basically shows
what I have going on for today today's
weather Yahoo's own newsfeed and you
have the ability to add your own widgets
to like I have swipe one more this is
where you can access different modes and
settings that a v8 offers for example
when you're out and about your home
screen will automatically change to
moving to quickly give you option to
navigate to home or work access Google
Maps uber or whatever transit app you
have installed on here and the same goes
for the other mode that's on here too
it's not as complicated as buzz launcher
but it does look really nice and very
unique in my opinion all five launchers
are available via the Google Play Store
for free and the add-on prime and pro
versions for nova launcher and action
launcher is only four dollars which i
think is worth the buy anyways that's it
for this video guys if you guys have any
suggestions on what launchers we should
try out next let us know in the comments
down below and as always a Marklin
saying you from TechnoBuffalo
