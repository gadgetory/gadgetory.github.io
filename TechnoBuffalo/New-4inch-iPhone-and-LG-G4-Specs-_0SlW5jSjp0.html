to you by domain.com hey what's going on
guys a marking segment from
TechnoBuffalo in today's episode over a
roundup we'll be talking about apple's
plan for a new 4-inch iPhone the LG g4
and the Oppo r7 this is rumor roundup so
let's go ahead and get started kicking
things off with Oppo the Oppo r7 is
already primed to be one of the sleekest
phones of 2015
thanks to this edge to edge display
reveal in recently photos now it turns
out the back of the device might look
just as nice as the front a leaked
runner published by Chinese site mobile
dad claims to show the Oppo r7 from both
sides the rumored phone appears to be
sporting a unibody metal design with
curved edges similar to the iPhone 6
overall it looks super thin and there's
no camera hump so there's that the Oppo
r7 is expected to offer a twenty point
seven megapixel rear camera an octa-core
MediaTek processor and a large display
there's also a row of capacitive buttons
along the bottom and a front-facing
camera up at the top the real star here
is that edge to edge display which looks
unreal if this truly is the r7 we can't
wait to get our hands on what's shaping
up to be a gorgeous smartphone the LG g4
announcement is just a week away and
there's still a few key things we don't
know about the flagship device however a
new report out of Korea may have
revealed several of those details just
ahead of launch business Korea claims
that the LG g4 will sport a 3000
milliamp removable battery giving it a
possible edge over the more permanent
battery in samsung's galaxy s6 and s6
edge the g4 will also allegedly feature
a slightly curved display with the
radius at three thousand millimeters
which may be barely noticeable compared
to the 700 millimeter radius curve on
the G flex 2 now I use the G flex 2 for
a while and the curve was definitely
something I needed to get used to well
it was a nice feature in all I don't
really see the benefit of having a
curved display on a mobile device
LG's event will be on April 28th and
we're excited to see what else the g4
has to offer well of course keep
everyone up to date with all the g4
goodness over at TechnoBuffalo comm
lastly let's talk about Apple's 4-inch
iPhone rumor has it the Apple could
unveil three smartphones later this year
including a 4-inch iPhone 6c but a new
report suggests we may have to wait a
bit longer for the cheaper device
according to kg I analyst Ming Chi quo
iPhone 6c may not arrive until next year
latest note which was obtained by
MacRumors argues that Apple has no
reason to release an iPhone 6c in 2015
he also adds that the iPhone 5s is still
going strong
adding the Cupertino may not need a new
4-inch handset until 2016 based on
earlier leaks we were expecting to see
the iPhone 6c to include NFC and touch
ID for Apple pay support along with an
upgraded 89 processor instead we may be
stuck with an iPhone 5s which packs an
older a7 chip touch ID but lacks NFC let
