with TechnoBuffalo today we're checking
out the Moto X just picked it up I have
an 18 t version I have not opened the
box yet so we'll go through it together
designed and assembled in the United
States
Motorola made real specific about that
that it's assembled here not necessarily
manufactured here that'll happen in
Texas get the Moto X the charger cables
sim removal tool and quick guides but
let's go through you wanna see the phone
right so here it is we'll go through
that just as you can see probably from
this ste AT&amp;amp;T model you'll be able to
customize it but right now and what
happens is you'll be able to order it
from these stores direct in black or
white now if you want to use the Moto
maker tool discuss that in a second
you'll have to use the website and
that's only limited to AT&amp;amp;T at launch
but real quick let's go through the box
this little let's get started guide it's
like other stuff let's get stuff out of
the way okay so it comes with the
charger let's assume that's the sim
removal tool it is the same removal tool
it uses a nano SIM and then the wall
work here
so let's actually get to the device
itself okay so you've got the 10
megapixel camera on the back on the
right you have the power button the
volume keys you can see the contour here
it's rounded so it sort of slopes the
bottom you've got the micro USB charger
3.5 millimeter headphone jack up top and
there's the nano SIM tray on the left
now with the adroit devices the sim tray
was with the volume keys that's not the
case here and when you can customize
this phone that's a 2 megapixel camera
up front sorry and we're looking at a
4.7 inch 720p display you can see you
can can hardly see the borders right now
in case when you customize this phone
through moto maker and again that's
exclusive through AT&amp;amp;T at launch though
this is coming to Verizon t-mobile
Sprint US Cellular as well you'll be
able to change these accents the volume
keys here
this metal border running around the 10
megapixel camera that
and accent as well there's I believe
seven different choices for that and
then sixteen different colors for this
back plate and there's a bunch of
customization options let's turn it on
now you can watch this boot it's going
to run Android 4.2.2 jelly bean
I asked about 4.3 motorable I said they
actually don't work that closely with
Google even though it's owned by Google
and that they've kept the the software
customizations relatively low so that
hopefully you'll be able to get through
to Android 4.3 quicker than you would
with other devices all right let's see
your start except you don't want to do
this now no no all right let's go you
could migrate all your stuff over it
looks like we don't care about this all
right now right okay okay so here's your
home screen again that's a 720p display
4.7 inches you can see how it nicely
runs edge to edge there there we go a
little better and focus for you um this
device is going to launch with 16
gigabytes of storage or 32 now 16 is
gonna cost you 199 32 will cost you 249
and the problem with that is 32 is gonna
be available they said with AT&amp;amp;T first
and this is relatively mid-range specs
for that price range it the one for
example or the s4 has a Snapdragon 600
processor this has a 1.7 gigahertz
dual-core Snapdragon s4 pro chip two
gigs of ram is nice but you're
considering the faster processor not
necessarily clock speed with more
powerful clock processors and the other
high-end phones the price is a little
high I think I think this could have
come in at $99 any case let's see what
we have for storage on this review unit
here ok so 11 gigs total space remaining
so that means we have a 16 gigabyte unit
now there's some neat and features here
so let's turn this off and do a little
screwdriver shake they tell us ok
now we're automatically in the camera
app so you can always just pull it out
of your pocket and jump right into the
camera by doing that screwdriver shake
let's show that again just a quick Bubba
block not that time huh it looks like
we're on the let's try it again you have
to do at least twice all right there we
go I felt the buzz and now the camera is
open so that's neat ten megapixel camera
ah so many options here okay then you
can quickly take pictures motorola said
they spent a lot of time on the
autofocus software here so let's pull
this aside and then you get the manual
controls if you want to dig a little bit
deeper but they told us that a lot of
the feedback was actually that people
didn't want it deal with all that they
want that auto focus out of the box now
we should be able to say at certain
points I don't think it's gonna work
with me now but we should say okay
Google now it's not gonna work so maybe
we can set that up
so you can get phone calls to make
directions set reminders we know all
that but you can do this hands-free I
haven't set it up yet with my voice and
I'll have John do it John will do it
when he does the review and some more
hands-on things but basically you could
be in your car across the room and say
okay Google now it'll pop up and listen
to your voice and respond to it with the
search query that you offered we saw
that on the original let's see the Droid
Maxx
the new Droid ultra and the droid mini
all offer that too so really similar
under the hood I should I should mention
this has a 2200 milliamp hour battery
you see that curve design to the top
motorola says they built the battery
specifically to take advantage of that
space and they created the curve in the
first place because they said they
wanted a phone that's easy to hold and
it indeed is and you can actually easily
reach across the screen I really like
how it runs
edge to edge as well no bloatware
installed on here either okay so you get
my AT&amp;amp;T but that's about it
quick office that's not really blower
migrate that's used to actually pull
over your stangs from another phone okay
so in any case you can see this is a
really relatively simple device you're
on 18 T t-mobile Verizon Sprint US
Cellular again $1.99 at launch for the
16 gigabyte option really it's about
customization so Motorola is making the
big bet that people want to you know
customize back the phone the accents and
other features and then take advantage
of those hands-free controls that will
show you in later videos overall I
really really like this device I know it
doesn't have the most high-end specs but
right now I think it's really cool you
know you get a bright brilliant screen
here you can control with one hand you
get the customized device I kind of like
the red ones and I wanted to change the
accent colors maybe get some blue
anodized aluminum volume keys that's
what you're paying for and you know it's
not for everybody I think a lot of
people power users especially are gonna
look for the Snapdragon 600 power
devices maybe hold out for Snapdragon
800 devices but overall nice phone moto
