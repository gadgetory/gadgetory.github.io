your films with the notch meets the LGG
7 thin queue no matter how many times
you read that name don't pronounce it
think and if you stick around to the end
I've gotten my worst pun I've ever had
in nine years waiting for you
so despite a silly name that g7 is I'm
just gonna call it and you should too is
a really solid phone boasting some
unique specs which is becoming
increasingly tough to do pretty much
every phone out now is just some version
of them good I know on paper a lot of
people are gonna be upset the 6.1 inch
qHD plus full vision display is LCD and
not OLED I even did my own eye roll when
I heard LCD but once actually had a
chance to use it
it didn't matter simply the screen looks
amazing regardless of the tech colors
look incredibly vibrant and blacks were
black the screen
despite his technology remaining to be
and the Samsung displays on how they
often don't look real they look like a
sticker instead of a screen it's the
same here at the g7 which is about as
big a compliment as I can possibly give
a display the screen though is a pretty
useful trick up its notch sleeve it's
got a brightness boost mode which boosts
things up to 1000 nits of brightness
which in the real world means to be able
to clearly see the screen even in the
brightest of direct sunlight which is a
gigantic win for LG automat note that
boost mode is gonna do a number on the
3,000 lamp our battery belly's quick
charge and wireless charging are here to
juice sucker up faster so the G line
sits below the V in LG's lineup and I
get that but the spec list seems to be
kind of like a grab bag of 2018 in 2017
tech on the awesome side you got the
Snapdragon a 45 which is a piece of a
processor on the shrug emoji side four
gigabytes of RAM which is still plenty
for smooth operation but is a bit anemic
by mid 2018 standards especially I've
got phones coming out with 8 gigs I
would have liked you've seen six here
help extend the life of the device 64
gigabytes of storage is standard but at
least it's expandable also here's a
headphone jack and I think that might be
the biggest reason people buy LG phones
it's got a 32 bit hi-fi quad DAC LG
really seems to get audio files which
makes it next thing about to say see
dick cut victory at first no stereo
speakers instead LG's using the entire
chassis the phone as a resonance chamber
to boost the base the means of phone
kind of gonna vibrate when you're
playing music but the bass does sound
sound AC it just sounded good
this newish resonance technology is
called LG's boombox and imagine we're
gonna see it show up in a ton of future
LG flagships in the hand the phone feels
awesome I didn't really like to feel the
v30 it almost felt Hollow
the g7 though feels really solid with
its glass back it it feels premium it's
narrow body is really reminiscent of the
galaxy s 9 - the curved screen on the
side I think they just nailed the the
tactile in your hand test with this one
there is a dedicated assistant button
which mercifully is tied to Google
assistant and I give LG a ton of credit
for not making their own assistant and
then just cramming it down our throats I
asked them if it was remappable and they
said nope but they could open it up in
the future so there's that non-committal
answer for you speaking of design it's
got a notch it doesn't have any sort of
advanced facial unlocking hardware so
I'm not sure why the notch is there but
hey at least it fits in with what seems
to be 2018 flagship design standards as
making of that notch it can actually be
hidden via software I was kind of
worried at first since the screen isn't
OLED but it hides us a notch pretty well
LG's also utilizing software that you
customize and not charriot different
backgrounds so that's that's a thing you
can do now LG's done a really nice job
with their cameras here the dual sensors
on the back are both 16 megapixels one
of the 107 degree field of view and 171
degrees making a g7 all about that wide
angle the software's also utilized a
wide angle sensor to map the background
for portrait mode which is here in the
g7 and at least on first impressions
worked pretty well much like the V 30s
AI is a big part of the camera
recognizing what you're snapping pics of
and adjusting the sensors to suit it
other small bits to know it's running
Android 8.1 and LG's custom UI on it I'm
not gonna talk too much about LG's uy
but I will say pray for launchers so
overall LG made a really solid foam they
aren't trying to lure you in with fancy
gimmicks like AI base emojis are trying
to force their own assistance down your
throat instead they're giving consumers
a well rounded phone
that's good at almost everything at a
price point below the v30 so I'll a g7
might not be for anyone in particular
it's a device that's built for everyone
thank you for watching
