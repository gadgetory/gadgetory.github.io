to you by Linda calm what's up everyone
welcome back the episode of ask the
buffalo i'm your host jon rettinger i am
in the ask the buffalo chair just to
show you could ask me any question
you've got from the world of technology
sometimes outside of it we take personal
questions here we take other related
questions up this week though it's all
tech I'm talking about advice for
aspiring tech reviewers is installing
Yosemite in its beta formats safe we're
going to talk g3 versus m8 and went to
talk from surface pro 3 vs macbook air
so that's the buffalo let's start asking
Buffalo's first question comes from
Twitter og techies ass at John for
lakers what advice can you give to new
and upcoming tech companies so assume
you mean like people want to check
reviewing not like one plus this tech
startup company I did a whole series on
advice for aspiring youtubers I get this
question all the time I'll put a link
down below check out that playlist and
will annotate it here as well so you can
serve see all those all those videos I
go into how to get products how to try
and get sponsors had generate your
content how does her conduct your
business or ethically it separate
yourself from the rest of the pack
doesn't go and check those out if you
want to get started in tech review angry
just want to be a youtuber in general
hopefully it's gonna help you next
question comes from Twitter as well the
art of Joshua ass at John for lakers and
safe to download OS 10 Yosemite on
primary computers at this stage of beta
hashtag ask to be so until your story
currently it is in beta 4 i've been
using it in beta 3 for about two and a
half weeks down then i upgraded to beta
4 i've had no issues at all with OS 10
Yosemite it's now in public beta you can
go ahead and get a code pretty easily
and go ahead and install it now the one
caveat there is third-party applications
that's going to be up to that developer
that's going to work or not work but my
experience every third party app that I
use has worked no problem at all so if
you don't use that many third-party apps
you use all of apple's first party stuff
then absolutely jump in I probably ought
to have any issues at all might not even
notice that it's beta and a lot of
people have said otherwise my experience
has differed I was having really bad
Wi-Fi issue
with my imac at the office it was just
connecting every three or four minutes I
did all the updates I went and talked to
Apple there was no fix for it so i
figured i would try yosemite see if that
fixed it I couldn't justify getting a
new computer now especially this phase
in the life cycles we got new imacs
coming in new laptops so I tried it and
it fixed the problem immediately so if
we're having Wi-Fi issues on an imac or
a macbook pro then you might want to
consider trying yosemite open up and
your question next one comes from i am
fam 143 at john for lakers HTC One and
mate in LG g3 which one do you prefer so
when I first tried it using when I made
of I dude it's not gonna get any better
than this this is the best phone that's
gonna come out this year then I got my
hands on the LG g3 and I was like oh
sweet cheat three I love you a ton of
bezels and your buttons on your back and
I still think that the g3 is the best
phone to come out to here it's going to
be really really hard to be dead if
you're trying to pick one or the other
I'd be hard pressed not recommend you
pick up the LG g3 yourself the questions

TechnoBuffalo learned something new and
the last question comes from at tweets
of summit who asked at john for lakers
can you recommend the surface pro 3 even
when i'm thinking about a macbook air if
we were thinking about a macbook pro I
can totally recommend the surface pro 3
listen I know I'm in the minority here I
understand that i love the surface pro 3
I like surface pro 2 I am in namur dough
with the third iteration of it you can
easily use as a tablet it's light enough
getting the keyboard dock is awesome
it's powerful enough to be used as a
full computer can handle games a little
on the expensive side but I think you
could absolutely use it for the best of
both worlds and I could wholeheartedly
recommend it in fact I've never said
this before since i'm not doing
video editing if I was getting a new
laptop for the office I would pick up a
surface pro 3 instead of a macbook air
or macbook pro the one caveat being out
of wait until the surface pro 3 dock
comes out I could use that with an
external monitor so yes absolutely for
my money I think the middle SPECT I five
with eight gigs Aram Tony 2d6 gig solid
state is like the perfect middle ground
so get go wrong either way but don't
discount the surface pro 3 you guys
