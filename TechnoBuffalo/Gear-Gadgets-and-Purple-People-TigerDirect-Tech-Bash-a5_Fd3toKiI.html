from technobuffalo here and i am at
marlins park in beautiful miami florida
covering tigerdirect tiger tech bash we
obviously cover a ton of shows we go to
a lot of places every year you guys
always see the videos that come out of
that but you might not know what goes
into making those videos maybe you're
thinking about going to a show yourself
so i thought i'd show you a little bit
how the sausage is made what it's like
for us at a trade show what we do what
happens behind the scenes before all
these product videos come out and hit
YouTube in the tight so let's take a
look
robocop is here
so Ron supposed to be filming me here I
turn around for a second
yeah the floors too rough that's why
so a really cool opportunity to
interview one of the stars of shark tank
kevin o'leary because he's got to say
welcome to talk about take your order
take three
so as you guys can tell it's all
business for technobuffalo at trade
shows no time for jokes no time for
having fun I am a slave driver and I
demand everybody be working 24 hours a
day seven days a week thank you guys for
watching I do hope you enjoyed it so
next time I'm drawn into from
technobuffalo and you're gonna have to
drag me kicking and screaming out of
Miami</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
