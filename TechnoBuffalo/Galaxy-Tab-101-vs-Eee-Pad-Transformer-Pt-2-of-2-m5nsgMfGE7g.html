all right and finally we'll get to a
little bit of the real world
considerations here price bang for the
buck value whatever you want to call it
and then kind of a wrap-up ah the 16
gigabyte galaxy tab 10-1 Wi-Fi only 499
the 16 gigabyte epad transformer Wi-Fi
only 399 so right off the bat you know a
hundred bucks difference in terms of
retail price you know on the street and
especially as time goes on that that
difference may change a little bit but
for right now it's a hundred dollar
price difference is the tab worth a
hundred dollars more it's up to you if I
was going to pick one not looking at the
accessories just looking at you know
what the two devices offer I would go
with the tab myself because it is
thinner and lighter and I like the look
and feel of it better and to me for
using a tablet you know that's a big
consideration the extra ports on the
asuste the you know the mini HDMI and
the microSD slot definitely could be
critical for you for me they're not all
that critical for my tablet usage you
know I haven't found that I've used any
other tablets all that much for those
kinds of guys use them on their own most
of the time so for me you know the extra
money is a big deal and a hundred bucks
is a lot to pay for something that's a
few millimeters and a few ounces lighter
that being said you know money no object
I'm definitely going with the Samsung
now you consider money you also consider
the the wild card here of the crazy
docking keyboard again there is a
docking keyboard available for the
samsung but I haven't seen it haven't
got a chance to check it out yet you
know hands on from what I've seen it
doesn't offer the versatility Tamar just
kind of a stand up stand doesn't offer
the versatility of the the assu stock
here a sous went to great lengths to
really design something that could turn
the the epad into a full-on transformer
like the name suggests into a phone kind
of hybrid tablet notebook netbook even
standing I think what's holding it back
the keyboard is a little bit small like
I said for some people find a little bit
small I think what's holding it back
though is software honeycomb you know
it's getting there it's not quite there
yet in terms of total polish for me
although 31 definitely helps a lot an
ice cream sandwich is gonna be really
interesting but then looking at running
you know this device as a netbook
replacement notebook
placement it just depends on what you
want to use it for if the software is
available and you can stand a few little
quirks that already you know the
firmware update that a sous pushed out
for the keyboard has helped quite a bit
in terms of responsiveness trackpad
typing that kind of thing but you know
they really did a lot of work with all
the customizations to the buttons and
the trackpad functionality and
everything and it really works really
well you know for a lot of use cases and
you get that great flexibility tablet
now I want the whole keyboard you know
back and with that kind of thing but for
150 bucks you know that's a lot of money
and now you're looking at instead of a
four-hundred-dollar device 550 + 4 550
you're getting in the low end laptop
range or you know kind of high-end
netbook range if there is such a thing
but again you know it's all up to you
and your use case if you're looking at
tablet anyway and you want this to be
your primary device or at least your
your primary secondary device if you
know what I mean when you're not
reaching for your laptop of your desktop
you know you're the tablet but you want
to have the option for just you know
full flexibility the the extra docking
ports the extra battery life you know
over fifty sixty percent of extra
battery life the the extra memory card
slots all that stuff you know it does
make a very interesting use case but you
know much less portable obviously pretty
thick definitely heavier and then you
compare it to this and it's a big
difference but you have the keyboard so
for me my personal pick I'm going with
the Samsung pretty much equivalent
performance it's lighter it's thinner I
prefer the design a little bit and
that's going to be my choice as a
samsung best bang for your buck no doubt
the ax sous a hundred dollars cheaper
it's basically the same thing just a
little bit bigger and heavier and it
works really really well and the suits
has some nice you know we're still
waiting on the Samsung TouchWiz UX
downloads but as sous has some some nice
little widgets they're just you know
they're just little things but they work
really well in general I just like the
or is it I don't know I just like kind
of the look and feel of that nice
classic update there on the front with
easy fonts and then of course if you
want the full on flexibility you know I
I won't go into it again but right now
definitely the sous is the option I
think you know look at your budget look
at what you need I think we're going to
see a trend and it's already happening
with the toshiba tablets coming out the
acer tablets coming out you know you'll
see more and more Android Honeycomb
tablets and that price point is going to
drop when the first ones came out they
were you know the zoom was 600 and then
we're seeing 504 devices like the tab
now we're seeing 400 for the for the
transformer and you know the toshibas
around in that price range I think
they're just going to they're going to
continue to get lower I think we're
going to see $300 Android Honeycomb
tablets with you know Tegra 2 or an
equivalent 16 gigs of internal storage I
think we'll see them dipping below 350
anyway certainly by a winter holiday so
you know by then we'll have the kollel
tablets out with the quad cores know
what who knows what else but they're
both winners they're both solid solid
devices me my pics the Samsung if you're
on a budget definitely the ax sous there
you go you can't really go wrong with
either one of them if you want an
android tablet thanks again to the folks
from asus and samsung for lending us the
devices and to google and samsung for
giving these out at Google i/o much much
more on the site including jon rettinger

from the transformer he loved it and I
can see why and also including your take
