TechnoBuffalo here and i'm back with my
favorite kind of videos a giveaway one
so last week we ran a review of a
panasonic e60 series smart TV and we
really liked it the folks at Panasonic
read it in there like hey technobuffalo
do you want to give one out here
audience oh I love the chance to give
away free stuff so I said yes panasonic
I do so if you're interested in winning
a brand new pretty baller smart TV stick
around let me get this one out of the
way first so I don't get any complaints
this one has to be us only so my
apologies to anybody outside of the US
not only are their power issues but even
if you live in North America where it's
the same power we have to deal with
tariffs and taxes and it's too much of a
headache unfortunately so this one is
just us we have a ton of international
giveaway so my apologies to you guys if
you live outside of the US so those you
that are inside of the u.s. I want to
give you the chance to win a pretty
sweet smart TV if you don't know what
the Panasonic e60 series has got a ton
of cool features thailand i think by my
home screen which pretty much you just
turn your Viera HDTV into an intuitive
menu of your favorite content presented
on your own personalized screen so it
makes it super quick to find whatever it
is you're looking for if it's TV
programs video on demand personal video
pictures and social media are all just
kind of right there and then probably my
favorite is video game mode if you want
to play grand theft auto essentially
what this is gonna do is going to choose
all the settings that are optimal for
images and super fast response there no
delays you're playing video dark screens
will be delicately rendered details are
really beautiful you can't always see
the difference it's not to worry about
tweaking your TV settings it's just
going to work for you so thanks for
