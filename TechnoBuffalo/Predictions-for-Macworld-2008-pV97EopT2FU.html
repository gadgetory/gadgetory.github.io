a little bit today now you guys have a
nice view in my kitchen you can sing
anyway macworld is coming up one of the
biggest conferences of the year for
apple lovers even from people who just
like mac and apple for iPods or people
are you know are diehard because their
computers and servers and such so
everybody speculum speculating what the
new products coming out are so I'm going
to offer my opinions and ask you guys
but you things coming out first thing I
think for sure we're going to see is a
redesigned or at least new features for
the Apple TV first and foremost I think
we're going to see video rentals movie
rentals on Apple TV I think for sure
it's a no-brainer Apple TV may look the
same policy the hard drive capacity go
up maybe some sort of subscription
service for movies as well sort of like
Netflix next I think we're going to see
some redesigned MacBook Pros with
multi-touch trackpad meaning you can
zoom in zoom out just with your trackpad
you know by moving your fingers around
not having a click an arrow move it
around I think for sure we're going to
see that you know I'm not so sure about
a sub notebook I think it's probably
5050 that will see some sort of
subnotebook with maybe a 10 inch screen
and no optical drive or an external
optical drive I think we can definitely
see coming and also I'd look for an
iphone with 16 gigabyte capacity I
wouldn't assume anything else is going
to change with the iphone at this point
but capacity is going to go up i think
to match the ipod touch maybe even
something bigger than 16 16 gigs maybe
32 gigs of flash storage certainly look
for that you know again nobody really
knows when athens going to do you know
I've seen rumors of some sort of mac
tablet some sort of docking station that
looks like an imac I we just don't know
so people are even saying maybe they'll
release a console I mean I doubt it but
anyone Apple II just don't know what
they're going to do so my question to
you guys is what do you think you think
Apple is going to be unveiling tomorrow
this week at macworld so post your
comments levis
and you know a bit curious what what you
guys think anyway and don't forget to
check out my new website as well the
link is on my main YouTube page and i'll
put a link to it in the notes as well so
you don't look for that and trying to
get some new comments and new new
features out to you guys and that's me
and echo fish so i hope you guys having
a good time where you're at and i'll
talk to you soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
