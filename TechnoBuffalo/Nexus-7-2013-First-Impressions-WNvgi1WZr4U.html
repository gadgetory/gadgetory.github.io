TechnoBuffalo here and I want to give
you my first impressions of the brand
new 2013 Nexus 7 let's get first
impression I've been using the new Nexus
7 for two and a half days not enough
time for me to do a full review but
plenty of time to share some first
impressions so when it comes to all the
performance specs and all the
benchmarking I'll cover that in the full
review so I'm using this as my only
tablet again for the better part of two
and half days and I've really enjoyed it
first and foremost a big difference the
screen it is absolutely gorgeous to look
at well not your browsing websites or
looking at videos or playing games the
screen is absolutely awesome especially
1080p on a 7-inch tablet I really blows
me away so the combination of Asus and
Google did a really really incredible
job with this surprisingly viewing
angles are really good even in direct
sunlight so they're however far you look
at it where you turn it you can always
see the screen so that's been really
pleasant to see as well I tried to open
as many apps that could see if it could
get bogged down and handled everything
really well no slow down at all in speed
performance is pretty baller in the new
Nexus 7 but not everything is totally
Rosie I did have a few issues I had a
really hard time locating at pushing the
power button the upper right hand corner
figuring out where it was just by touch
is kind of difficult that's they've
definitely to take some getting used to
and one of the biggest surprises for me
is the Wi-Fi radio is not that strong it
had a really hard time picking up a good
signal in my home where every other
tablet a test together android/ios had
no issues at all so I'm going to
continue to test out with other Wi-Fi
networks and see if that continues to be
the case so if you things that impressed
me as well is what's happened with
google play over the past few months and
even a year they used to be not very
many tablet-optimized apps there now
they're an absolute ton of apps meant
just for android tablet so if you were
sort of teetering on the fence because
you have that sort of preconceived
notion that tablet apps aren't there yet
do not worry there are huge huge huge
amounts of tablet applications so that
was kind of nice to see I do like the
new back that sort of soft touch feel
it's really nice to hold in the hand the
bezels on the top of the
bottom are still a little bit on the
thick side but the reduced bezel on the
side was really nice it almost feels
like a different aspect ratio because
it's so thin for really liked holding it
that myself actually using it in
portrait mode and not landscape like I
do other tablets so I was kind of
interesting as well I set it up pretty
much the way I set up an android phone
so the ways performed it looked for me
was just like a bigger version of my
google play nexus for them using as my
daily driver I really enjoyed the tablet
performance again was also looking
forward to testing a little more
thoroughly and sing our performance but
at least first impressions wise looking
at getting a tablet this is a really
good choice a few other small notes the
speakers on this well they look like
little dinky speakers are really loud
Google touted their new partnerships if
the speaker volume up and grokken and
they did a really nice job with this so
you combine you know the nexus 7 perhaps
a chromecast at about 40 bucks you got a
pretty nice houma set up for you I
really enjoyed using it again I'll use
it for another couple days before I feel
comfortable doing a full review and I'll
tech Hawk about the camera on the rest
set stuff which early haven't used at
