from technobuffalo and we've thought
about buying smartwatches right whether
it's a gear to the pebble or even the
new android wear smartwatches well today
we're going to be taking a look at the
LG G watch and see whether it's time for
you to buy one and whether it's worth a
two hundred thirty dollars price tag
let's start off with basic
specifications the G watch has a 1.65
IPS LCD display with a resolution of 280
x 2 80 it's equipped with a Qualcomm
Snapdragon 400 processor clocked at 1.2
gigahertz a 400 million battery which
packs more juice in the galaxy gear live
300 million battery 512 megabytes of ram
and 4 gigabytes of storage it's running
Google's wearable OS Android wear which
we talked about in another video now the
overall design of the LG G watch is
similar to the majority the smart
watches out in the market already it's
square and basic the G watch in my
opinion feels great on my wrist thanks
to this rubber watch band though you can
also change the watch band if you'd like
there's really not much to look at with
the G watch other than the screen there
aren't any buttons or heart rate monitor
those offered with the gear live the LG
G watch also has an ip67 rating which
means it's resistant against dust and
water and that doesn't mean you can go
scuba diving with it but you can still
wear in the shower or out in the rain
the screen is somewhat responsive the
colors are ok and the watch face is
included just ok i actually prefer the
gear lives more subtle and modern watch
faces but you may disagree google
recently announced a new watch face AP
case so you'll definitely see new
android wear watch faces in the coming
months the LG G watches displays decent
it's slightly bigger than the gear live
though with a lower resolution the IPS
LCD screen on the LG G watch is somewhat
disappointing the difference in
resolution compared to the gear lab is
much more noticeable at 280 x 2 80 it's
easier to see the pixelation without
squinting and the screen just isn't as
vibrant angle looking as a gear live
visibility however is great on G watch
pretty much in every lighting condition
except outside in broad daylight and if
you haven't seen our video about Android
wear devices in sunlight will leave a
link down below to that you'll need a
charges as you watch daily which is
actually right on par with our
experience with the gear live though
that had a slightly smaller battery and
most other smartwatches on the market
right now last much longer so this is
definitely a huge weak point I work
about eight or so hours here at the
office and by the time I get home
I still have about thirty percent
battery on my G watch I have my 1 plus
connected my G watch all day and receive
push notification from three different
email accounts play games read and send
text messages and check Twitter
notifications constantly around 10 or 11
and 9 and have the G watch already in
its charger and it's time for bed the
charger that came with the G watch is
great too honestly better than the gear
live it's square pretty similar to the
watch and the to connect together thanks
to the magnetic strips in the back which
we really enjoyed let's talk about
Google now integration the core of
Android wear revolves around Google now
Google's personal assistant android wear
wasn't designed to replace your
smartphone it's just meant to reduce the
number of times you pull out your phone
Google now displays relevant cards of
information before you even ask for it
like the weather how many steps you've
taken or how long you'll be stuck on a
four or five driving home it's not
really all there is to it you can send
text messages or reply to someone set
reminders set an alarm all by just
talking to your watch and the microphone
is surprisingly good on the G watch it's
very accurate and John thought the same
with the gear live and we think the
microphones on both devices are spot-on
so to wrap things up I'm giving the LG G
watch a disappointing score of five
point five out of ten why because I
don't think its core features are fully
baked in yet yes if he's you
notification and it tells you the time
but there's really not much more to it
and so now there's only a few apps on a
Google Play Store that are compatible
with Android wear Evernote lift and e 24
just a few there's a lack of consistency
and how one use applications thankfully
more coming by today there's also a
significant learning curve and even
though there's a tutorial for the first
time you use it it'll take a while to
get accustomed to the layout the use of
voice commands is a massive improvement
for the SmartWatch experience because it
reduces the number of times you need to
touch your watch but it's still
impossible to get around your watch
without doing a lot of swiping when it
comes to pricing LG's pricing strategies
a little confusing the G watches thirty
dollars more than the gear alive even
though it doesn't add any features or
performance benefit despite offering a
slightly larger battery I'd be surprised
if the cost doesn't come down quickly
especially once the Moto 360 makes an
appearance is the LG G watch really
worth that much no not right now at
least the G watch looks good in my
opinion it's simplistic and reminds me a
bit of the g3's exterior design but it
still needs more tweaking we're hoping
the Moto 360 can turn things around for
Android wear but we're not holding our
breath on that so what are your thoughts
about the LG G watch are you going to
sit it out and wait a few more months
until a new device comes out let us know
in the comments down below
as always I'll see you guys in the next
video thank you guys for watching please
