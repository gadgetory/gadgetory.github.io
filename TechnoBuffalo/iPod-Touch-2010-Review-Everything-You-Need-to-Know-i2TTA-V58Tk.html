TechnoBuffalo here with a full review of
the mid-2010 ipod touch a refresh let's
see if it's worth the money so being a
touch only device the first thing you're
going to see and what you're gonna use
most with the iPod Touch is the display
which is now been completely updated to
include the iPhone 4s Retina display
which is going to give you a whopping
resolution of 960 by 640 with 326 pixels
per inch and that's just fancy talk for
saying the screen is gorgeous I've
talked about the Retina display on
countless occasions and iPhone for
videos but devices to say it looks just
as good on the iPod touch looking at
older generation iPod touches and all
the generation iPhones for that matter
you really can't see it different to the
screen
it's a highest resolution screen right
now on the market and really really
really does show and just pops images
and texts really look very crystal clear
text you can zoom all the way and you
get no pixelation on images I mean
they're high-res really do look quite
nice on the screen so one of the cool
things always touches then how thin they
are and this generation iPod Touch got
even thinner which is super crazy coming
in now at 0.28 inches thick and this is
I mean razor razor thin to give you a
comparison the iPhone 4 is certainly no
fat boy
but it looks downright chubby next to
its touch cousin really really really
very very impressive
however this thin design does bring some
annoyances that I found while using the
eye pop that's something to keep in mind
if you flip it over we'll talk about
some of the stuff on the back a little
bit it is tapered so it's rounded on the
sides and rounded on the top so the lock
and power button we're using the device
the expected surge is push here to be
able to hit it you actually have to
almost lift up the device and hit the
button down below see it's right there
so you hit the top you're not going to
make them contact so that's become a
little bit of annoying if you're used to
using an iPhone for example you have to
sort of reconfigure how your fingers are
something that I just found to be a bit
of a pain and the same thing is going to
be true with the volume buttons on the
so this is also packing the 1/4
system-on-a-chip
clock being it just about 1 gigahertz
and this thing is very very very fast
certainly it's capable of handling you
know all the multitasking that's iOS 4
is going to bring but it also now is
going to be very capable of handling the
3d games then making their way into the
App Store so a lot of the racing games
and all the sites are now going to build
up the form as they would on an iPhone 4
you're gonna be able to really get that
is immersive graphics on a mobile device
so certainly kudos to Apple for doing
that now I think one of the big change
that most people are talking about are
the addition of two cameras we've got
one guy on the front you can see them
right there and we've got one guy on the
back and they both serve similar yet
different purposes the one on the front
is primarily good use for FaceTime video
calls which has finally made their way
to the iPod touch we've been hearing
rumors of a front-facing camera on an
iPod Touch for it seems like eons now
the fact this mythical unicorn is
finally here it's probably gonna make
some people quite happy you may have
seen my demonstration video I did on
FaceTime it works it very well you just
register an email address and
essentially call that email address and
it works from iphone forward ipod touch
vice versa and hopefully someday we'll
have a desktop client
that'll worked with this as well we'll
take VGA quality photos and so you know
not too bad not great you're not gonna
want to blow these things up put them on
a wall but you know we'll take some
pictures on the front on the back we
have a camera capable of taking HD video
and that is HD at 720p recorded to 30
frames per second out of audio and we'll
take still photos as well at a 960 by
720 with the back camera this case you
were wondering there's no LED flash here
anything just the little camera but kind
of lonely on the back we do have an all
new aluminum design you don't have that
little black plastic panel for the Wi-Fi
suppose the aluminum is going
for the single to come in and out and
it's not an iPhone enough you have
signal drop issues because it doesn't
have to sell you their radio just
probably why this sucker is so thin
speaking of cellular radio this is now
very much more iPhone 4 like - the phone
everything the iPhone 4 to do this guy
can do as well except for make phone
calls however if you couple this with a
Skype or voice over IP application and
using the built-in microphone that this
suckers got you pretty much have a phone
with you all the time if you have sort
of a MiFi or any device others going to
kick out a Wi-Fi signal I've never been
the biggest fan of the iPod Touch line
primarily I've been using an iPhone so I
very much of a need for an iPod Touch
however this is a first generation iPod
Touch today I think really feels a very
big niche first for FaceTime you're not
gonna have people acting video chat
really more widespread for example this
unit here I'm going to let my sister and
brother-in-law use my dad has an iPhone
4 and my sister and brother-in-law do
not and they live a little far apart so
now my dad will be able to see his
grandchildren all the times I having to
tell him how to use Skype which devera
tried to teach your parents that a new
computer you know can be quite difficult
so that's just some personal experience
however if you are an iPod Touch spam
you're given getting much more of what
you love with the iPod Touch you're
getting the great multi-touch browser
based on the WebKit open standard so
it's gonna work very very very well it's
probably one of the best browsers around
if compare this to other Android devices
BlackBerry devices and Palm webOS
devices still the iPhone has the best
browser around still I find it a bit
weird the 3.5 milimeter headset jack is
on the bottom but I guess we're using an
iPod touch you're probably used to that
so we've been looking to get an iPhone
and you want an iPhone we don't want to
switch pairs to AT&amp;amp;T the iPod Touch is
probably going to be a perfect way for
you to go however if you decide to do
that it is not going to come cheap the
eight gigabyte model is gonna cost you
229 the 32 gig is gonna bump you up to
just about $300 if you want to go for
the granddaddy of iPod touches you want
64 gigs for $399 so not cheap not cheap
at all but you're not stuck with a
contract
so this isn't getting very view of
apples product lines of what you think
of Apple this is review of just a
product itself this product itself is
still the best and the preeminent media
player on the market and it's very hard
to not like it it just works very well
be App Store adds kind of functionality
addition of FaceTime the cameras and now
that you've crossed in the retina
display really just our nice value adds
so it already was a very solid product
so on a one to five scale the iPod Touch
in the realm of portable media players
really comparing the likes of the zoom
and some of the sandesh players and some
others it's very hard to not give this a
perfect five stars this is a very
extensive as tend to be an apple
products but you know you're getting a
decent amount their price aside this
really has everything you could want
from a media player so on a one to five
scale they just mentioned this is going
to get a five do you agree or disagree
