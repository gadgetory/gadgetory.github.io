it from TechnoBuffalo and today we'll be
showing you how to install Windows 10 on
a Mac via boot camp boot camp will
essentially allow you to use any Intel
based Mac to dual boot into Windows
which means you have the option to
either boot in Windows or Mac each time
you turn on the computer and before we
get started we're gonna need two things
we're gonna need a Mac obviously an a
thumb drive would at least 5 gigabytes
of free space now if you're planning to
use Windows 10 for more than 30 days on
your Mac you do need to buy a license
key which I know is a bit of a hassle
but you can easily purchase a license
key directly from Microsoft for $120 and
we'll leave the link in the description
below in case you're looking to purchase
one for yourself step one we need to
head on over to Microsoft software
download page to download the Windows 10
ISO file choose Windows 10 from the drop
down menu hit confirm and choose your
language after confirming your language
you can choose to download either a
32-bit version or a 64-bit version we
recommend going with a 64-bit version
but if your system is running a 32-bit
version then go ahead and go with that
one step two we need to move the Windows
10 ISO file from our downloads folder to
our desktop and once that's done plug in
your flash drive in make sure no other
external drives are plugged in on the
Mac to avoid problems step 3 run boot
camp assistant under applications inside
the utilities folder or you can quickly
search for a using spotlight next we
need to check all three tasks create a
Windows 8 or later install disk
download the latest windows support from
Apple and install Windows 8 or later
step 4 if you have moved the Windows 10
ISO file to your Mac's desktop the ISO
file will automatically be located and
selected but if you place it elsewhere
you may need to click on choose and
locate the file manually as for the
destination disk the flash drive will be
automatically chosen as the install disk
if it's the only flash drive plugged in
and once that's done hit continue and we
can choose a partition size for Windows
10 if you're looking to use Windows 10
for a while and one experience the new
OS as a whole you may want to leave
extra space for any data or software you
plan on installing Windows 10 requires
at least 20 gigabytes to install so make
sure you pick the right partition size
for Windows because you can't change
this later on once that's done click on
install and it will start partitioning
the max drive and will restart your Mac
the Mac will automatically boot up from
the flash drive and start the windows
set
process if your Mac doesn't boot from
the flash drive just restart it again
and hold down the option key after the
boot up sound and then choose to boot
from the flash drive step 5
the Installer will prompt you to enter
your Windows 10 product key now don't
worry if you don't have a key yet you'll
be able to skip this part and continue
with the install process after agreeing
to Microsoft's Terms &amp;amp; Conditions and
confirming what windows Edition you want
to install the Installer will ask you
where you want to install Windows make
sure to select the partition - has a
label boot camp now this is a partition
we want to install Windows 10 on click
on that particular partition select
format click OK and hit next you should
now see windows installing files and
updates and this process should take
about 20 minutes or so depending on how
beefy your Mac is after that your Mac
will boot up with Windows 10 and you
will have to go through the normal steps
of setting up a new Windows computer
step 6
when you first log into Windows you
should see a boot camp installation
message pop up click Next and follow the
rest of the installation reboot your Mac
and that's it if you somehow don't see
the boot camp message pop up you can
simply open up the flash drive and
launch the setup file inside the boot
camp folder if you want to manually
select which OS to run during startup
you can hold down the option key and
select which one you want to boot into
then press Enter
if you want to set which OS to boot up
as default you can set that option under
the boot camp control panel Windows 10
is a free upgrade for qualified Windows
7 and 8.1 users for the first year and
