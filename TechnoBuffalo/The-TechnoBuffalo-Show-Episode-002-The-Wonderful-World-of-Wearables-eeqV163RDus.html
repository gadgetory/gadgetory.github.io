TechnoBuffalo show as always online your
three house for this week Shaun on a
editor-in-chief of the site I'm joined
by executive editor of gaming joey
davidson hello and executive editor of
mobile Todd Hazleton there's one good I
get what's up yep what's up dudes just a
couple quick housekeeping notes here
before we get into the meat of today's
show first off the show is now on
services such as iTunes and pocket casts
and also stitcher so you can search for
us we do also have an RSS feed that you
can subscribe to and you will find the
links for all four of those in the posts
on TechnoBuffalo for this episode also
thank you to everyone for the really
positive support we got after last
week's show we are very excited to be
doing this on video now and we're glad
that you're all enjoying it as well and
please keep the feedback coming with all
the housekeeping out of the way we're
going to dive into something I think we
can all agree that March 18th may be the
day we can all right down on the
counters hey we finally entered the
future I'll reward announce that I
wasn't there well okay the hoverboard
stills not here nor are flying cars ah
ah too bad but all sorts of other nifty
things happened yeah so let's go around
the table here and we're going to start
with mobile Todd what happened yesterday
that was so exciting oh we got well as I
was rushing out the door to a meeting we
had android wear was announced which was
it's google's SmartWatch platform for
wearables actually I don't even know if
it's going to be limited to smartwatches
really like it could potentially be used
for anything but first more watches will
say for now Bell and then mode
encryption keys yeah I don't know what
the potential gets there for all kinds
of stuff right sure sure sure sure
places but then moto motorola nounced
the Moto 360 which is coming later
shear and the G watch from LG I think
sort of tease to the Moto 360 was just
aesthetically speaking and in the the I
don't know if their concept pieces or
whatever was gorgeous yeah no I mean
right now I think it very much is a
concept piece which is no I think I was
talking about earlier is kind of
annoying now you're like all these
companies are like oh here check out
this product but you can't buy it now
it's coming later and this is sort of
what it looks like I really want to see
like a tangible I wonder it looks
amazing I want a price point how much
Todd how much is the galaxy gear I guess
would or the pebble even that was 149
but you can also get the pebble steel
for what not 199 I think it still is so
i would i would say these are going to
come in at like probably 200 or 300
dollars that's when it's it all seems to
be picking back on the google Mouse
stuff yes yeah so it's totally based on
google now which is sort of location
aware so you can get alerts and weather
and then put also tell you about like
sports scores and things you're
interested in and then also voice
commands is a huge part of google map so
making heared was Google now has become
almost creepy sometimes like I said is
you're selling minutes from your house
how's that feel right and the thing is
too it's also not perfect yet I mean if
I google something randomly you know
like where is like you the office
location or something in irvine it'll
say like it's gonna take you forever to
get to irvine california i'm trying to
go there right now ya know i think it is
interesting and having that on a watch
I'm kind of of two minds and obviously
I'm not the mobile or gadget editor for
us but um on one hand I think they're
gorgeous and I'm really interested in
the tech but on the other hand I'm kind
of like is this is this a utility you
know is this something that I'll
actually use or is it something that'll
just kind of get in my way or be that
that one-time purchase that I never but
look let's shot well yeah let's yeah so
at CES
I saw all the rest of the staff wearing
pebble watches and I was like okay those
are kind of cool so Todd said he had a
spare and for those of you watching on
the video show where's my spare Todd and
I didn't know how much I would actually
end up using this I've worn it every
single day since Todd sent it to me and
I find it amazingly useful what's what's
been the what's been the thing that that
you use it most for I i don't take my
phone out of my pocket nearly as much
now hmm uh you know i'm able to a little
bit more slightly you know if something
comes in while I'm talking to somebody
oh it's a lot easier to just look down
real quick driving is fantastic because
if i get a text i don't care about
emails while i'm driving if i get a text
and I never I never ever text reply text
when i'm driving but I you know your
hands are up on the steering wheel I can
just go okay you know and the name is in
bold so I can see who it is if it's you
know friend find the wait till you get
to where I'm going you know if I'm
driving somewhere in the office needs me
I can go oh it's john i pull over and I
reply then yeah but I don't I'm never
tempted to look at my phone and yes this
probably still not a hundred percent
safe I fully admit that but it's safer
than pulling my phone out I agree so
yeah i've i've used the heck out of this
thing since i got it now but like you
joy i may not be the use case i like one
day you and I were discussing Twitter
and I'm definitely a power Twitter user
because of the way i set my twitter up
on tweetdeck and with gadgets i'm a
power user for those of you listening to
audio i'm making air quotes so yeah I I
know that the general population
probably is not going to be as
interested in this is I am and I think
that's the big question I saw a lot of
stuff on Twitter yesterday about well
doesn't this holy defeat the purpose of
you know we got rid of watches with our
smartphones we didn't give her a white
man look no yeah works fine
I put mine on for the show but I usually
wear a regular watch too I mean not not
also maybe that's partially why i see a
question over here about a preference
between the LG G in the Moto 360 um the
LG G that's that's the square one right
yeah yeah yeah I I mean just based on
the watch i'm wearing now like I prefer
really traditional watches so I'm with
you I mean that's you I looked at the
Moto 360 and I think Sean you saw me
tweet this like yeah I this is the first
time I've ever seen a SmartWatch and
thought ok I could get into this and
it's because of how classic it looks
yeah I think that's what's going to make
it more appealing to a wider audience
now when I used to wear watches I used
to wear our watch every single day they
were all round however they all had
Marvin the Martian on them yo so if the
Moto 360 will allow me to put yo
Animaniacs raised on my watch I'm all
court why don't you watch no I I think
that's interesting though you know
because I I think the whole thing was
that a lot of people moved away from
wearing watches because they were a
single use case item sure I'm where my
watch I got this is gonna make me sound
ridiculous but I wear my watch is an
accessory it's not that's exactly on the
same way it's not you know it's not like
man I need to know the time like I
rarely look at my watch i look at my
phone faster than i look at my watch but
you know if I used to look at my watch
for the time but I do wear it is an
accessory I actually have like a dozen
watches yeah same here but I mean it I
never I never use it as a watch so yeah
ok so here's a another question from the
honest do you think pebble steel price
will drop when more smart watches are
released uh they might have to I think
that they might have to but I think it
also depends on what prices that the new
watches come in at yeah we're hearing
that the LG G watch will be you know for
the lower and the the Moto 360 is
obviously going to be a bit of a high
and so I think pebble is going to have
to take a wait-and-see approach here and
see you know what is the market bearing
now we also to see and assume that
pebble has an answer to these two you
know mean why would I will not be
considering a color screen and more you
know robust interface and I think we'll
see that from them and when that comes
we'll see the price drop of the pebble
steel to think the thing that the google
smartwatch and if Apple makes one is
well down the line has over pebble right
now in regards to price stems from the
fact that Google makes money on
marketplace transactions where pebbles
making money on their watch so they
can't afford to take a loss at selling
the hardware close to or below breaking
even whereas if Apple makes one down the
line or google makes apps purchasable
for the watch specifically they'll make
up any difference they would have lost
in profits so that might help you know
the Android wear devices come in a
little bit cheaper than this is a really
good point but pebble watch so that's I
think that's the difference and I there
there is no like first party pebble
money maker aside from the watch itself
right like there's no augment like
augments you can buy for it or anything
like that well yeah there's a little
store but I don't think they take a cut
from developers I don't really really
yeah right yeah and I I think that is
one thing well real quick let's get to
this other questions come in about the
subject when people are worried about
our phones listening to us why aren't we
worried of Google now stalking us and
reading our emails and such well if
you're using any google product they
know everything about you i think this
is this is a crazy subject in and of
itself that kind of stems beyond just
smartwatches i think that watches are
just one other way to glance it at the
life of the user i think that companies
like this have established a sense of
trust that i think that we're all
whether we're suspending our disbelief
here whatever remains to be seen but for
now likes to say don't be evil right so
right but I think we're all kind of
buying into that like Google's not evil
enough yet to where we're we're worried
about it and I say that like half
jokingly but that's that's where it is
if you're the type of person who buys a
smart watcher who buys a smartphone or
uses the internet like we do or Twitter
or whatever else you're kind of saying
I'm okay with my privacy being invaded a
little bit and that's a really crazy
subject probably so to be sort of give
it up to right like if you want Google
now to know about you to be useful you
have to say yes give you access to the
search queries on putting into maps and
you know the sports I like because I
want to know the score right you just
kind of have to trust that the company
won't misuse that information and so far
I don't think that we've been slighted
yet but it is creepy and terrifying now
yeah we have a question from jacob
kleinman i am not sure I've ever heard
that name before I tweeted about this
earlier bed been thinking about whether
different shapes square / circle Android
wear watches will mean even more
fragmentation thoughts that's an
interesting yeah possible but I think
when they set I think there's only two
options right now right absolutism so if
they keep it there yeah but then once I
mean no there's not that much
fragmentation or I just one or the other
but then I think as future designs come
and you have sharper displays on watches
because these are sort of relatively low
resolution then you do run into
fragmentation issues and the same thing
with future software updates right as
the processors inside get more powerful
you have more features than the watch is
sort of lead to I think at launch we
aren't going to see a whole lot of
fragmentation but down the road yeah
it's just it's the nature of the beast
unfortunately unless you're a situation
like Apple where they strictly control
you know what it's going to be on you
know and you know you only have to work
with these parameters but you know it's
like when you get into Android
development you know there was a picture
that one
upper published ones of the table just
littered with tablets and phones that
they had to test the half sizes yeah and
so the possibility does exist for
fragmentation down the road but I think
up the initial launch it's going to be
pretty even sure okay we're getting some
more here let's see what do you think
will be after the wearable watches oh
well I think that's a good question
because well it brings up a little bit
of what I was talking about yesterday
what happens with Google glass now
because sure it's this augmented reality
but so I probably wanted google glass
because I warrant directions and it's
know about the world around me but when
that's on my wrist now sort of on my
face which I think looks pretty dorky
then I have no reason to buy google
glass anymore i'm wondering if they're
cannibalizing your over google glasses
Savior will be determined based on
whether or not Google is able to find
third-party manufacturers that can make
Google glasses look cool yeah like Warby
Parker if Ray Bans can step up and make
a google glass that actually looks good
then it's it's no different than watch
you know what I mean in my book it
becomes a multi-purpose tool it's an
accessory yes it looks good but it's
also really useful as that happens i
think i think the google glass will be
ok but Todd I do see what you're saying
right now to me the the average user i'm
not i'm not as engrossed in this stuff
as you guys are silly because of my job
function but to me the average user
Android wear is more compelling than
Google glass right now so yeah we're
getting a lot of questions about google
glass here such as what plans do you
think google has for google glass do you
think they'll change the design to more
of a normal look they have to they
absolutely have to they have to drop the
price yes price as well and you do you
think android wear will be brought to
google glass the consumer version like
comes out possibly i don't know because
then otherwise you've got people
developing for two different platforms
that one thing I did want to bring into
this and it does fit in some what is
that also announced yesterday was Sony's
project Morpheus yeah which is Joey
that's your wheelhouse so why don't you
explain to the listeners what project
Morpheus yeah that that was actually
announced in GDC after I kind of left
for the day so I played catch up this
morning uh it's Sony's virtual reality
headset right now they're just getting
it to developers it's going to be going
to developers soon so the announcement
wasn't as outward-facing is something
that we might see at e3 this was more
this tech is coming here's kind of what
it can do developers go nuts it's a
little bit like oculus rift there are
some differences but the bullet points
for the Morpheus the VR headset for the
playstation 4 it's going to be able to
do tapey which is huge it has what was
it 360 degrees of motion detection which
is also awesome and then a 90 degree
field of view which is pretty cool too
the other really interesting thing with
morpheus that I think kind of trumps the
current state of oculus rift when
Morpheus is projected on a television
like say i'm using it right now and Todd
you're chillin on my couch on my
television instead of seeing that like
pizza eatin pizza bro instead of seeing
that like binocular display you know
that like the vehicles it's an actual
standard television image which means
that the virtual reality experience
isn't really hindered for other people
in the room it's pretty awesome looking
but in my mind it's it's unproven tech
it needs software software sells
hardware so I'm kind of waiting to see
what happens there and the price point
everything else but if any of the big
three console manufacturers is going to
do this well it's going to be Sony so
well I now there's been attempts at
virtual reality before we most of us
remember the VR boy at the Virtual Boy
virtual boy I can't get to boy thank you
I do you think Joey that gamers are
really that ready for virtual reality is
it something they're really craving
it's this one's for okay so we're
looking at a possible 3d market burst
here 3d has tried to crack into gaming
and cinema for four decades decades upon
decades the 3ds has a built-in but if
you talk to most 3d s users they play
with the 3d slider off ninety-five
percent of the time I think that virtual
reality has the chance to go either way
either users are going to adopt it
because of the price point and the
software if if they nail those two
things then I think we could see gamers
kind of becoming obsessed with it and it
being a new phenomenon if it's too
expensive and the software is not
compelling it's not going to go anywhere
yes sir oculus was so amazing like
wearing that I didn't want to like leave
that virtual reality yeah it is so fun
and I can't imagine what like these big
expansive world type games would be like
when you can just run around and sort of
see the possibilities here and I know it
sounds cliche but the possibilities are
almost limitless it just has to do with
pricing 3d television was too expensive
for the mass market to enjoy it's just
too expensive so without the install
base you had developers making nothing
compelling for it right all right all
right Joey here's the seller red dead
redemption too yeah total crunch left
and right by my face oh my god Sean to
be so happy yeah riding into the sunset
with a brawl reality huh man they were
looking at seventy dollars we'd be like
oh my god okay it's it's got you you've
hit the nail on the head joy the pricing
is what's going to determine this I even
maybe more so than the software because
if it comes in at 399 499 you know the
price of a console just possible as end
on then that could be a definite
detractor I mean and it's going to death
my impact sales team I would totally
drop for like 4 99 on the oculus rift I
could buy what I saw at CES oh I don't
think as you know what well yuck euless
rip shot I don't think that's necessary
man I don't have any nines gonna be
necessary I know but it's like a diet
plan to I wouldn't do anything man get
the oculus rift and then that like
octagon trackpad that you stand yeah my
name is todd haselton I got no I'm just
saying cuz I'd be like I can't eat that
now still stuck in this game my wife
would have to come home from work and
like unplug me oh man no you're staying
there in the oculus rift and she's just
yo feeding it into your mouth yeah this
is so real I can taste it I well I think
it's super interesting I think virtual
reality like just all this wearable tech
stuff and I know that it's two different
segments on the same topic but it's
super super compelling and I think that
for both it holy depends on entry price
right i mean that's what's keeping
people away from google glass right now
how much is it fifteen nails and we are
getting some questions here about
pricing let me let's hit up yep I what
is the price of google glass currently
right now for the Explorers it's $1,500
but they haven't announced yet what the
mass market price will be but it's not
going to be cheap on let's talk about
let's talk about regular ray-ban glasses
sometimes costing hundreds and hundreds
of dollars yeah now put a computer in it
yeah exactly I I don't buy name-brand yo
frames and they still run me 150 175
dollars for frames sure if it's
ridiculous you're gonna have a generic
line of Google frames i think you know
but it's still going to be exact so
since you yeah and then we had a
question here about the oculus rift the
oculus rift is expensive as hell that's
uh II think they should but do you think
they shouldn't make a cheaper version
that's the goal right listen yeah that's
the goal and that that's what everyone
has to remember is that when a
technology first comes along you've got
the higher price for the for the early
adopters and it's the early adopters
that make those purchases that help fund
the company to go forward and be able to
buy in mass which brings the price down
for the general consumer so yeah while
things are always expensive when they
first come out then you have to let
people like us that the tech geeks the
first adopters you have to let us buy
the stuff to make it cheap entertainment
oculus they're not trying to make their
hardware the the Ferrari of gaming it's
not going to be this uber expensive
thing that only the elite can afford
that that wouldn't do them any services
so it will come down absolutely yeah
they want to be mass market and I think
the other thing is to their expensive to
start because developers buy it and it's
worth it for them because then they
create the software and hopefully make
their money back mm-hmm deal but the I I
think the whole thing here is we we have
to look at we had two major
announcements yesterday that we're very
exciting and they are two fairly new
markets yes Theo and wearable watches
there's already been you know the pebble
and the original Galaxy gear but we're
going into markets that are not one
Harris improving yet to even have anyone
desiring them yeah I think that you have
to remember that the people watching
this show and us you know the writers
for sites like technobuffalo we
represent a super tiny sliver of the
market so while we're interested in I
don't think that our dollars are enough
to facilitate the existence of these
things on the mass market yet I'm
geeking out over smart watches but I
don't know if my dad is or my wife or my
friends exactly I think that's where
Apple might come in with health book and
stuff and when you
add a reason like when you can actually
see your health stats and find out more
about yourself as devices then I think
well that opens up a whole new market
right and I think that's where Apple
kind of might slaughter away that's
where Nintendo's going I think we're
gonna see Apple and Nintendo clash on
that front in near future Nintendo's
focusing on wearable fitness tech as
well so if you get two heavy hitters
like that going at it in a field that I
mean Nintendo's already proven that it
can get on the tech bus pretty well with
we fed you'll see what happens it's
really compelling and interesting though
uh do you think Google wearables is just
watches that's what I was saying I think
yes to start but I think it opens yeah I
think Connor I could see it on t-shirts
I could see it on hats I'm not even
kidding man why do I know I know in a
far in the future I mean there's
theories that you're gonna body naked
power so these devices oh that's nerdy
an awesome oh my god i mean that's like
that's not this year next year but i do
then okay let me date my age again for
everyone does anyone else here remember
the hyper color t-shirts yeah there were
mostly mood rings for your body yeah
unless you're someone like me who always
runs hot that it was just always the hot
color but oh yeah you you know that this
was a very baseline technology of body
heat yo changing the color of your shirt
right so yeah that's an interesting idea
android wear shirt that you know somehow
detects it detects your body heat and
then adjust climate control in your car
and house yeah I'm ethically to like why
not a ring we've seen those kind of NFC
rings yeah sure sure sure sure I've mean
yeah if my wedding band somehow got like
in some awesome tech in it that'd be
pretty sweet yeah if they make a
partnership with DC Comics and I can
help hey
oh man if I could I can charge it each
night my in brightest day in blackest
night thank you and I won't nerd I think
the risk just makes the most sense for
the size of the screen in it and stuff
like that oh yeah that's why we're
seeing you know watches because why not
had a watch I mean I have a fitbit force
and this has watch too yeah I think that
if any market is in trouble with these
smartwatches it's those fitness bands I
think that that they're the ones that
have the most to be worried about yeah
except for what we don't know is battery
life on all of these things I mean
pebbles really good it gets they're
gonna make tremendous battery life that
the tech is getting is so long as it's
there yeah but that's why these fitness
bands are great because they they do
last yeah but i mean if if they can
create a fitness triming in that in that
little android wear promo video that was
running yesterday I mean that chick
burned like 50 calories or something but
having that act at my disposal at all
times is awesome that's cool yeah here's
another this is more of a statement than
a question google has a track record of
releasing things at very competitive
price point and since the general public
don't have 600 bucks and what not to buy
things they will probably go for cheaper
things they do what they want yes Google
does have a good track record with that
if you look at the Nexus 5 the nexus 7
the student BBC's Nexus 10 they came out
at prices that were reasonable and I
think that eventually the Android wear
product here here's the the sticky point
though the LG watch and the motorola
watch are not nexus type devices they
are products coming from those companies
so they're going to get to set the
prices i think and going off of i think
this is nathan stamen google has always
shown at least an awareness of price
competition and they tend to offer
things that meet the needs of multiple
markets so yeah
they might have that $1,500 glass
experience right now that's meeting the
needs of a very high-end market but
they're also definitely going to produce
something that you and me can afford as
well so I mean their awareness is
promising I think at the vigilance point
and it's it's Amazon's model to where
you sort of settle the hardware probably
super low margin like they do with your
kindle fire and then make your money
back when they buy apps amazon's always
really good it Amazon's always been
really good at making good products out
of cheap stuff I think and and part of
that is why things are so cheap for them
like the kit I can't believe they're
selling Kindles for less than a hundred
dollars right now that's just awesome
but you know they Bank on the fact that
you're gonna go book crazy and whatever
so mm-hmm now we've got a question here
what do you think of the Kickstarter
start up a halo band is bracelets the
next division of wearables I'm actually
not familiar with this Kickstarter
either of you or another mmhmm I'll
google it let me bracelets talk to your
watch I mean isn't a watch kind of
abrasive yeah it is III think I've heard
something about this unfortunately a
actually this I wish we could follow
every Kickstarter out there but yeah we
would have to hire someone just to
follow Kickstarter all day don't want
that job hey I do think there is going
to be an expansion past watches past
glasses you know where exactly it's
going who knows I wouldn't be surprised
if some day somebody goes here's smart
stinkers why not right why not they
talked to your phone via bluetooth they
measure the the pressure you're applying
to your feet when you had our leak there
nike nike did that with with the iphone
there was a there's a shoe that has like
a sensor that you put in the tongue of
ocean itself right but yeah i'm talking
about being built into the shoe itself
you never Sean
it are any of this you have no original
thoughts sorry bad but no I i do think
they're gonna expand into more products
than just what we already know out there
yeah let me look through here real quick
we do you think the future of gaming is
VR this is a lot like mobile the mobile
gaming question I I think that that
couch based at least in contemporary
time and I mean like the last hundred
years uh couch based activities are the
center of home life for a lot of people
I don't see that changing and and
virtual reality will maybe become an
extra wrong of gaming but I don't see it
being the new the new it right yeah I
agree Oh see here uh do you think
android wear Google will finally release
more functionality globally I'd I was
not where Todd Dino is Android wear only
limited to the US for right now I don't
think they said anything on that front
I'm sure their goal is to go global it
Google does everything globally so if
it's not there now it will be yeah Abba
me chromecast Nicholson 11 new country
so it took a while but exactly let's see
here did you do samsung as one of the
partners to make android where do you
think that samsung samsung will prefer
to use their own Tizen OS for their
wearables we're using Android wear Luigi
yes certainly i mean they definitely
want use Tizen and that's why they're
doing that but I think they've seen a
lot of success with Android why not why
not try it i think one of the funniest
things that these companies say or that
they say regularly is well we did it
because we can so you'll see i'm sure
Tizen OS continue to influence probably
not going to shut it down now they're
just sort of building that it out but
they're also not going to just ignore
Android wear because they can use it so
they're probably good I mean would be
stupid not to
here's a similar question and do you
think Samsung will make many
smartwatches wearables like what they do
with their phones but focus on one main
line up I think it's too early to tell I
think I think we certainly will i mean
gear too and the gear 2 neo are examples
of a lineup in the wearable market and
then the gear fit so if this gear line
that goes you know the galaxy line so
yeah I've ever okay and one last
wearables question then we'll get into
the grab bag of questions that have been
coming in which there are a few of them
NASA now's your chance to submit any yes
yes we heard coming up to that point so
please feel free to ask questions about
any topic for the end of the show what
do you think of Fitness wearables such
as samsung's galaxy fit do you think
they are headed in a direction to bring
fitness apps to all wearables yes yeah
we kind of hit hit on this a little bit
there I personally think that the
Fitness wearables are the single purpose
Fitness wearables are going to be in
trouble within the next few years simply
because if this Android wear stuff takes
off it's going to you know people don't
wear pedometers very often anymore
because their phones do that like it's
stuff like that so yeah I'm with you I
glue I think they're they're going to be
cannibalized by later yeah okay one last
one here thoughts on possible i watch
who knows I mean I mean it has to you
Apple has to answer this we've seen
enough it sounds like the guys that mind
if I back know what they're doing and
they're they've seen health book I see
no reason why Apple wouldn't watch i
watch yeah I and you know there's been
some questions maybe Apple a little too
late to the game at their Apple I know I
I hate to put that way they're only
focusing on I'm sure they're only
focusing on the iWatch working with the
iphone yeah so it really matter
thoroughly to the game exactly as their
markets already out there all right yeah
Android wear is not going to work with
the iphone so you know I it's going to
be interesting okay so here we are into
the grab bag what do you think about 4k
display
if you're talking on televisions I think
it's absolutely gorgeous but I don't
think there's enough content out there
yet to warrant the purchase that that's
for sure I own no interest in four days
that were I just don't add no it's not
weird although I mean I when I was at
CES this year i get to see an 8k display
yeah i also the eye Joey you would have
appreciated this the demo video they
were running was all shots from around
Japan shot an 8k cool that's pretty neat
and it was it was almost like hyper
reality I you couldn't tell that it was
almost too realistic and it's absolutely
gorgeous but that brings up the question
ok so 4 k's are out there they're too
expensive by the time their price comes
down here come the 8 case where does the
cycle stop do wheel it doesn't yeah
exactly yeah exactly so 4 k's
interesting but until there's more
content out there I I wouldn't worry
about it uh what do you think of the
newly announced Oppo find 7 i'm i think
that's got a ridiculous camera what uh
was it 13 megapixel sensor it just has
software that allows you to shoot 50
megapixel photos by like super and again
it seems neat I'm not a quantity display
though on the topic I just got here
really that's true would you ever
consider changing your name to Bob yes
but only if I could spell little B
little Oh big be no I like Todd yeah
yeah we're kinda happy with our names
and here's another question what's the
deal with the Oppo find 7 50 mil oh
thank pixel that's all I need some
factories yeah it's crazy it's nuts and
it's another example of people confusing
the number of megapixels with the
quality can you Todd can also it's not a
50 megapixel sensor it's me the rundown
man because I know nothing about this
just so for what I understand it's a 13
megapixel sensor this is
cable using software of creating a 50
megapixel photo really super zoom how
that's good question i'm not an engineer
and I listening I haven't seen the phone
I haven't talked to a boy I just know
that that's how overs cool yeah with a
13 megapixel sensor it's the 50 mega
pixels are gonna look grainy as anything
that's my guest hey we won't know until
we actually try it out for ourselves but
that would be my guess um let's see here
what do you think about the rumors about
the new HTC One camera do you think that
not switching to more traditional
cameras will hold them back with the
market this year Todd this is definitely
in your now I don't think they'll be
held back in the market I think they're
gonna they put a lot of emphasis on the
quality of the pictures that their
phones can take I think the four
ultrapixel camera on the HTC One was
great but I do admit it really degrade
the quality when you try to zoom in and
i think i saw a rumor right like someone
said there's also a 13 megapixel camera
on there I don't know so we'll see but i
think you know from everybody i know my
wife has an HTC One my sister has one
they all love the camera so I don't
think that you know not changing the
camera is going to affect them in any
bad way I mean consumers are like is the
camera good and the guy at the store is
like that's pretty good than five I mean
that's honestly what happens for like a
regular consumer yes not like it was a
bad camera by any means I think it is
great what do you guys think of Oppo
find 7 faster charging technology do you
think it will lower the battery life
again that's a we have to wait until we
actually get our hand yeah I haven't
seen it but Samsung and Sony both do
this too and it doesn't affect the
battery life the only problem is you
need to use their charger so with the
Galaxy Note 3 and spore I think and
Xperia z1 you need to use their charger
so you're at a friend's house you
something else not only does it charge
slower sometimes the charges even slower
than a regular device and a lot of times
the battery trains a lot quicker too so
there's some downsides to this now when
do you think major manufacturers will
make 4k phones oppo find
see this year I guess yeah that was
quite HD racing a really off topic or
Amy you guys excited for Star Wars
Episode 7 and the other new films as
much as I dislike the prequel trilogy I
don't hate the prequel trilogy like a
lot of people I disliked it whoa I'm not
praising it oh gosh saying that the
thing is anything more than a turret is
wrong is like awful just awful hey you
didn't enjoy watching congressional
debate here's look here's my here's my
two cents on star wars and the prequels
and where I hope the new ones go the
original Star Wars films were awesome
because they stay followed a group of
three or four really tight-knit heroes
in their quest in this much bigger
picture the original prequels like the
one is that George Lucas followed up
with they tried to zoom out and cover
c-span in space and then throw a few
feathers and villains into it that we
had no reason to identify with them at
all if episode 7 8 9 7 7 8 9 follow that
core dynamic of heroes in a much bigger
picture those flicks are going to be
awesome Star Wars is a little more than
buddy cop and space with magic that's
how it should work that's how those
films work doing anything else is just
silly so as long as they stick to basic
site could be awesome i I'm curious I
want at least one scene in a Senate it
just has to have no the Senate better be
on fire and there better be a scene
where old Luke and old hon high five
that needs to happen now I I'm excited
for him I am I I can vividly remember
the first time I saw you know Star Wars
before I was called a new hope and a
midnight showing in Phoenix
in September 1977 so Wow yeah I I was
six years old and the only ticket my
family could get was to a midnight
showing so yes a six-year-old nice I
think saw Star Wars at midnight and got
home at like 3am but but we finally saw
how do you feel about the rumors the
Nexus program is going away I don't know
I don't not sure I buy it because it's
sort of Google's when you go to a best
buy now you see the google stand it's
sort of like their way to promote
Android and their products and that
makes a lot of sense to consumers like
Nexus was once for developers and now
it's a consumer-facing grant and I think
then we see like the google play edition
devices that are sort of more for
developers I'm not sure it could go away
sure I just don't know why Google would
have built it up recently than to just
kill it off yeah to stay on top of the
market do you think Google will release
on Nexus 10 or a new Nexus tablet with a
bigger screen we're actually hearing
rumors of what is that 8.9 Todd yeah
something like that an HTC worse yeah I
I think every time I i don't think the
tens coming back I think it was knows
well I when you're in the 10 range
though it's obvious i owe the ipad
controls that market so why not go for
other sectors it says um what is the
song that is used before the podcast
begins in the audio only stream it is
royalty-free zoot suit music yeah it was
the one that I hated least out of the
yes and Sean gave me I spend it almost
an entire day looking for music and I
send the links to Joey and all oh that's
horrible well I think this one's even
worse cuz i was listening to them for
the first time in a video call with Sean
so we just hears me going uh-oh goslee
made me feel great about all the work I
put into fighting slightly crappy el
elevator music
good mediums not like that that's what
you get with royalty free music no so
bad i recently got note 3 how big do you
think most companies will stop enlarging
the screen I think we're close I mean
yeah there's a couple companies I've
done seven inches and yes I I have a
mega 6.3 as a backup phone we can go
bigger okay I used to know three and
it's like about this is large as I'm
willing to go I I my 56 in the United
States is probably that is excuse me
guys my phone's ringing oh my gosh yeah
seriously but in the meetings I've had
with with these OEMs Asia is a huge
market for the big phones so yeah I
don't know maybe it'll keep going bigger
than no I promise you joy that was not a
real fast yeah sure you would bully have
the 6-3 right to Megan that's pretty
huge yep okay two more questions will be
done for today folks do you think that
all those unofficial renders from the
iphone 6 was close to a bezel of screen
can be a reality i can imagine Apple
pulling off a 4.7 inch screen on a phone
not my charger than the iphone 5 but
that's the case now first off those are
not leaked renders those are concept
images so those are surrenders you say
yeah those are completely unofficial the
those are just imaginings by different
artists I do think though with a bezel
lyst display or near bezel lyst display
that Apple could pull off of 4.7 and
close to the same physical space as the
iphone 5s I think they're probably going
to go there I think they almost have to
yeah it'd be cool but the only thing is
yeah i'm sorry i'm just looking at my
phone you have to get rid of the home
button itself yeah that's that's gonna
be the big question mark is the home
button I don't know we'll probably find
out in September may be awesome though
bezel is let's see it happen
uh-oh Joey here's one for you what do
you think of the SimCity offline mode
have you tried it uh yeah I actually got
it with the patch yesterday I put about
two more hours into the game it loads
much faster now that it's doing it on my
computer not relying on the internet
which is awesome um I'm glad that max
listening I did it I think they did it
way too late I think it should have been
there launch I think that the community
was pretty basically pretty obvious and
honest when they announced that it was
online only and we all went please dear
god no and then they released it anyway
what they deserved all of the negative
energy that they got for that and then
by saying that just the whole thing was
a marketing nightmare for EA and maxis
now that it's here I'm glad but I just a
night light anymore too little too late
man yeah little too late that I am
someone that put well over a hundred
hours in the SimCity 4 I have have like
50 or 60 hours into the Super Nintendo
version of SimCity of all things I the
missing i stopped at 25 with the SimCity
I don't see myself going too much
further than that so all right one one
final question and this could be a hot
topic what's the best type of cake on
anyone I got my mom makes an angel food
cake do you guys know what angel food
cake is yeah that really light fluffy
our cake batter eels that awesome cake
and then she puts crumbled up heath bar
on the inside Oh white vanilla icing on
top whoo damn that might take cake might
take the cake my favorite chocolate on
chocolate on chocolate and at my wedding
we couldn't do that we had to have a
vanilla frosting for whatever reason the
national flowers usually uh did you get
a groom's cake at your wedding show our
time no I guess you know my wife loves
me and
she got me a groom's cake she got me a
cookie cake next oh man it was so
awesome so you know I wanted chocolate
on chocolate rock no wait we had the
traditionally multi-tiered wedding cake
and then you see all the groomsmen still
not next to the lyceum cookie cake um
I'm boring I actually like just plain
white cake with it all i care about is
how good the frosting is yeah frosting
key yeah I like cream cheese like the
cream frosting oh yeah cheese frosting
unlike a red cake red velvet Oh had red
wine cupcakes cool so is chocolate but
then the icing and the chocolate was
actually made with them or low whoo Wow
just felt like just a drunk why no
homeless man there's nothing chocolate
into my face so good okay well that that
question got a lot more answers than I
expected don't mess with cake Shawn yeah
well having never been married i haven't
had a groomsman keo Grimm's cake so long
