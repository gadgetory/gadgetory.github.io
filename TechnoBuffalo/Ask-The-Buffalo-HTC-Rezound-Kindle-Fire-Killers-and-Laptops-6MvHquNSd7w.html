to you by Squarespace on this episode of
ask the Buffalo we're going to talk
tablets we're going to talk the Nook
Tablet kindle fire we're going to talk
about the HTC Rezound we're going to
chat about some tasty ice cream sandwich
and when it might be coming and with
phone it's going to be coming on we're
also going to be talking about the
Galaxy Nexus laptops where to find good
deals what to get for your backpack if
you're a college student or a high
school student or just looking for a
great portable machine this is asked the
Buffalo welcome back to another episode
of ask the Buffalo this is a chance
where you can ask me jon rettinger any
question you might have from the wine or
the technology it could be about what
laptop you should get what phoned you're
looking at what Ram to put in your
computer or why your mom can't learn how
to use her iPad mom I'm talking to you
if you want one of your questions
featured on ask the Buffalo you can ask
them in one of two ways you can go over
to techno Buffalo dot-com every Tuesday
will post a post up there asking you to
leave your questions down below and if
Tuesday doesn't work for your schedule
you can go ahead and send us a question
on Twitter and ass technobuffalo use a
hashtag ask the bee and ask your
question and we'll pick generally about
five or six questions every week to
answer on video so let's go ahead and
get started with the first question this
question comes from austin collie who
wants to talk about the HTC Rezound he
asks why is the HTC Rezound getting so
much hate and i are you looking forward
to it i got one step better i have it in
my hand the HTC Rezound with Beats Audio
just came in today and we unboxed it I
don't
think it's getting that much hate it
might be getting lost in the awesome
array of dual core LTE smartphones like
the droid bionic the droid razr and now
the HTC built rosal but I don't think
it's getting that much hate it's got
really solid specs it's got an
incredible screen packing a little bit
of junk in its trunk and its rockin
beats audio this is a still a great
choice if you're looking for dual-core
LTE it will be getting ice cream
sandwich sometime in early 2012 HTC
definitely wanted you to know that so it
really is a great choice at the top end
of verizon's androids lineup or really
any carriers Android lineups so don't
worry look to be a pretty solid phone
stay tuned though for the full review on
TechnoBuffalo com our next question
comes for a guy with an awesome name
Jonathan Torres who asks how do you feel
about the Nook Tablet is it a Kindle
Fire killer it's hard to say anything is
a killer of something that's not out yet
we do not have the nook color or the
note tablet or the kindle fire or any of
those devices in our tech loving review
hands so to say something's a killer who
knows i will say their spectra very
similarly but if i was just an average
consumer with i am and i was looking at
both them side by side i would say that
the nook tablets fifty dollars more
expensive and i'd probably go with the
fire and save the fifty bucks certainly
you're going to get double the storage
space with the belief 16 gigs and you're
going to be getting a few extra niceties
built in but 50 bucks is 50 bucks and a
lot of folks that are looking at tablets
in that price market aren't so spec
conscious so I think that kindle fire is
probably going to outsell the nook
tablet but when it comes time to choose
between the two of them stay tuned to
techno Buffalo we're going to put those
two suckas head to head the next
question comes from richard lu who wants
to talk some galaxy nexus as a lot of
you guys do it's coming sometime this
month it's gonna be rocking ice cream
sandwich it's gonna have all kinds of
new features gonna have a new font it's
gonna have a face unlock which quince
identity lock with just a picture of
your face so use a password or use a
pattern don't use your face it seems
like a
but to unlock your phone way of driving
and be like you shouldn't use your phone
without driving anyway or imagine you're
out on the street and you're walking
this is me walking which looks kind of
dirty I'm trying to lock my phone and
I'm moving and I got to hold it up all
right looks like I'm riding a horse
tenth you're riding a horse and you want
to lock your phone and you're like
butter and it's just not going to work
it seems like it'd be a pain just swipe
it do your little pattern ever you have
make life a lot easier I figure out the
question one do I think that the Galaxy
Nexus is going to be released for any
carrier other than verizon we don't
really have carrier information quite
yet verizon is presumed to be the launch
carrier of the Galaxy Nexus just like
t-mobile was with previous Galaxy
devices but just like t-mobile was we've
seen those Galaxy devices make away to
other carriers and presumably that's
going to be true with the Galaxy Nexus
samsung announced an hspa+ capable
version which only would run presumably
on 18 G's hspa+ network and possibly a
AWS version which essentially would work
on t mobile's 4g network which is also
hspa+ but different bands if a carrier
doesn't officially release it you'll
still be able to get it unlocked from a
wide array of retailers so there
definitely will be a version that will
work for you whether or not it's going
to be carrying support it or when I has
yet to be seen so I want to take a quick
minute to thank our friends and sponsors
at square space because round space
isn't good enough so thank you to our
friends and sponsors at Squarespace
Squarespace is a fully hosted platform
nothing to install instantly updated for
stability and all kinds of other
goodness point and click Sign control
style editor it's very easy to use tons
of flexibility you can list out expand
on different pages you get full widget
modules social widgets so you can get
your Twitter and your Flickr facebook in
their beautiful galleries and slideshows
essentially if you want to make a
website we don't want to go through and
do all the planning Squarespace is going
to be perfect for you if you want to try
squarespace if it seems like some kind
of
helpful for you if you're thinking about
starting a blog for example go to
squarespace com use a code techno 11 at
checkout and get a free two week you see
if it works for you there's no harm in
trying if it's not the platform for you
at least you'll have given it a shot it
works really well it's very easy to code
you could have zero experience and you
can create a beautiful looking blog or
website to host your YouTube videos or
adjust your personal thoughts all right
so let's go ahead and jump back to the
questions so this comes from the dancing
fiend friend disco who asks what laptop
do you recommend for a college student
on a budget that is high performance and
style say 600 800 dollars the use the
laptop market does not get much credit
there are a ton of great laptop options
out there that might be four to six
months old certainly they might not have
the latest and greatest core i7
processor in there but you're going to
get sir second-generation I five I three
or really capable specs and you're not
gonna have to pay those new prices
laptops much like cars have a huge
depreciation as soon as you drive a
month a lot so did you open that box
they are worth much much much less so if
you want to get say a mac for example
get a last generation macbook pro
probably right in that price range
Dell's got some awesome use deals and go
ahead and check out their refurbished
section Dell Apple HP they all offer
refurbished products and they're going
to come with manufacturer's warranty so
check out those stores I think you're
going to find a great deal on a really
exceptional laptop to match the style
and specs that you're looking for so
