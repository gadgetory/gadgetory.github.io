from TechnoBuffalo calm the long-awaited
vs. video is here in this corner the ax
sous epad transformer in this corner the
samsung galaxy tab 10.1 they're both
tablets they both run Android they both
now run Android three dot one they both
actually now they both support keyboard
docks although I only have one of them
the Samsung duck we have not gotten our
hands on yet the ax Sue's keyboard dock
is right here in fact this is a new
model the old one during the firmware
update process something happened to it
so as sous was kind enough to loan us a
new one so finally all up-to-date
head-to-head which is my favorite which
would I recommend to you let's find out
technobuffalo is on revision3 new
episodes every Monday Wednesday and
Friday 5 p.m. pacific time I'm going to
talk about both products kind of in
sequence you're going through a few
different categories so let's start out
with performance performance on the two
devices is very similar like I said they
both now run Android 31 honeycomb the
this is the google or the google the
samsung galaxy tab 10.1 google i/o
limited edition the developers addition
you can see from the back there we also
got the official galaxy tab Wi-Fi thanks
to the folks at samsung PR who lent it
to us john has that one right now but
this device the i/o edition was just
updated this morning the update just
came out to Android 31 and the epad
transformer has had the three word
update for a little while now there was
also an update to the keyboard dock for
the transformer so in terms of
performance very similar they both run
nvidia tegra 2 dual core processor they
both have 1 gig of ram they both have
1280 x 800 displays slightly different
display technology but i found the
displays on both devices to be to be
really really nice performance has been
really good spec-wise is the most
notable difference and perhaps you know
one of the things that people will look
at I don't think it's really all that
important in this case but one of the
things that catches people's eyes is the
spec difference between the cameras on
the two devices on the Galaxy Tab 10.1
you've got a 2 megapixel camera in the
front on the front a 3 megapixel camera
with flash on the bat on the ax seuss on
the the on the transformer you've got a
point 2 megapixel camera on the front 5
megapixel camera on the back no flash in
terms of actual camera quality I i I've
yet to find a tablet that really works
all that well as a camera because of
size awkwardness is taking pictures and
the actual performance not that much of
a performance between the two in terms
of actual photo quality that i found the
samsung has a slightly better quality
front-facing camera as well and because
of the nature of a tablet device i would
actually give the edge on
it's basically a draw I would give a
slight edge to the Samsung because
you've got a better front-facing camera
and a little bit better video capture
but honestly for all intents and
purposes it's really it's really a draw
also in terms of the hardware where the
ax seuss gets a big advantage I think if
you're you know the general user might
not care the average user I should say
but the hardcore user the geeks or if
you have a specific purpose the Samsung
basically has one proprietary dock
connector on the bottom similar to the
route that Apple took and other
companies have taken with proprietary
connectors it's a special 30 pin
connector on the bottom the connection
to everything from USB cable to power
charge and your AC charging to all the
accessories including the keyboard dock
and other accessories that are out in
addition to that or coming out in
addition to that you've got a 3 9
millimeter headphone jack up on the top
you've got your power switch your rocker
switches your dual stereo speakers have
you seen John's videos or my my other
videos on the 10 one and John videos on
the transformer you know a lot of the
stuff already but just by comparison on
the sous you do have a proprietary
connector on the bottom this snaps into
the keyboard dock as well as to the
cable for charging but then you've also
got some standard ports you've got a
standard mini HDMI out over here you've
got a standard memory card slot over
there both devices of 16 gigs of
internal storage there also 32 32 gig
versions available for more money but
then you've got a microSD slot right
here on the asuste device which you can
use for everything from you know
expanding your your memory to hot
swapping movies and other media files to
transporting files from the device to
your computer you know if you do use the
camera or other devices I always fail
with the port's man so you know possible
for more updates or you know hacking and
rooting and modding all that kind of
stuff so you've got some extra stuff
going on port wise and then if you get
into the keyboard dock which is a little
bit of a funny thing because it's
optional it costs more money and there's
also you know you have on top of the
base price and there's also a samsung
dock which I haven't gotten to try it
but I will just mention that on the
keyboard dock you get dual USB ports you
get more battery life which
as a separate thing to talk about and
then you also get a media card slot here
which is even more versatile it's a and
a full SD card slot also takes MMC cards
as opposed to just a microSD slot so you
get you know quite a bit more in terms
of standard connectors and possible you
know expansion use in that sort of thing
off of the transformer particularly if
you add the dot but even if you don't
the mini HDMI out and the memory card
slot right on the tablet gives an edge
in terms of expandability and hardware
compatibility and that kind of thing a
slight edge to the transformer in terms
of design like I said similarly sized
displays 10.1 inch 1280 800 the displays
I found both of them to work very nicely
nice bright colors responsive to touch
all that good stuff in terms of style
you know kind of take your pick again
this is the limit edition iowa version
which i think is really cool but this is
not the one available on the streets the
sous comes in this espresso brown color
kind of a copper brown color which i
think it's pretty nice but the main
difference for me is the the size the ax
sous is larger the footprint is a little
bit large as you can see that I've got
the bottom is pretty well lined up a
little bit larger in terms of length and
then noticeably thicker and heavier now
to be fair the ax sous is not going to
break your back okay it's not you know
an overly heavy tablet it's a tablet
it's easy to use I like the widescreen
form factor I've talked about this
before with tablets I think this is the
form factor to go with right now great
for HD video viewing and then also great
for holding it the long way kind of like
a pad of paper for reading scanning
through web pages and two thumb typing
as well I find very convenient but
everything that's great about the ax
sous is even greater so to speak on the
tab one because it's thinner and it's
lighter and this thing to me is just one
of the sexiest if not the sexiest piece
of tablet hard work out there right now
you know it does i've heard people say
with the black border and the chrome
trim it looks a lot like an ipad
personally i agree i think it does but
so what we're not talking about that now
it doesn't matter just on its own it's
so thin so lightweight so
easy to hold you know one-handed or to
throw on your backpack so I would give
an edge to the Samsung in terms of
overall style and design they're both
you know well made I haven't had a
problem with either one of them but you
know this gets into bang bang for the
buck which we'll talk about in a second
but just you know price not price not
included the samsung is my winter for
kind of form factor on over overall
hardware design</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
