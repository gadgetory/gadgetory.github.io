lakers calm here with a review for you
of the mophie juice pack by mophie
essentially all this is is a battery
pack for your iphone 3g they also make a
similar product for the original iphone
second generation ipod touch in the
original generation ipod touch so what
it is it's actually just a external
battery with an LED indicator light on
the back indicating how much charge you
have push the iphone right in there
there's a micro you or a mini USB port
rather and this is actually a very cool
port so also it's firstly how you charge
it but it also lets you sync the phone
via this my a mini USB port so you put
your iphone in plug the cable and put it
into USB and you can charge it without
the proprietary port that Apple uses
right there so charge and sync very cool
so let me show you guys how it works
give it real quick demonstration iphone
3g mophie juice pack good match slide it
right in get the charging light let me
know you're charging and that's it I
went on vacation last week and flying on
an airplane for six hours I wanted to
watch a few movies make play a game on
the iphone ordinarily the phone would
have only lasted me two or three hours
with the movie juice pack plugged in by
the time I landed I had a full charge
and the juice pack was only depleted two
bars so it really is an absolutely
outstanding product and it's a must-have
if you're a frequent traveler or power
user of the iphone or the ipod touch so
a couple other cool things about it it's
got a real nice soft feel to it it's got
some grips on the side so it is really
nice to hold on to there are other
similar products that are charges for
the iPhone but there are external
dongles that plug into the bottom of the
ipod or iphone it can break off very
easily if you put them in your pocket
this is nice slide it in and it's not so
thick that it can't even fit in your
pocket so that actually is quite nice
slide into a jacket pocket
the pants pocket it's not going to be a
massive bulge in there but you know it
certainly takes up a little more space
in the device itself I also noticed that
the phone charge is actually quicker
than it does been plugged into a wall
using the mophie juice pack I went from
no charge to full charge in just a
little bit over an hour actually it was
quite impressive it and while charging
the phone fully actually only depleted
just one bar of the four on the LED or
one dot of the four on the LED this one
runs $99 available from mophie com put a
link in the sidebar it's a fantastic
product and I really can wholeheartedly
recommend it if you have an iPhone you
have an ipod touch great device I also
really like again that it can charge
with that micro USB or mini USB port you
can also charge other devices via that
mini USB port if you've got a blackberry
if you've got something else that uses
that similar port which is actually
pretty common car gps is for example you
can actually charge them with the juice
pack on its own which is actually very
cool so it's really a portable battery
for everything whether it's an iphone
and ipod or just a myriad of other
devices really becomes a must-have and
then I took it now with me anywhere I go
just in case says we all know the
battery on the iPhone not the best so
