to you by the national campaign against
drunk driving what's up everyone welcome
back there pisode of a rumor roundup i
am your host jon rettinger name of the
title should give it away we take all
the tech rumors from the week and we
smash them into one multi minute episode
to tell you what you missed up this week
the gold iPhones all the rage of the
tech elite the Sony Honami gets a
grown-up name how durable is that iphone
5c going to be in the Tegra 4 is finally
coming to more devices than the Nvidia
shield this is rumor roundup let's get
started gold iPhone first it started as
just a dream and a rumor that Apple's
gonna raise a gold iPhone I said pusher
no way I'm not gonna believe it until
Tim Cook or someone steps on stage and
says look a beautiful gold iPhone and
then we started seeing pictures of gold
plates and gold parts and it seemed a
little more likely and now we've pretty
much seen the entire gold iPhone all of
its gold glory and why was it polarizing
people be hatin on the gold phone when I
here goes phone I think it probably
needs Sabarsky crystals or diamonds in
the apple logo but it's more of a
champagne color people be like yo gold
iPhone you were ugly you're hideous
Apple's latest I never gonna touch one
of them things other people are like oh
I'm sort of in the middle of that camp
i'm holding judgment until i see the
gold iphone perhaps to look more like
champagne color if i were a betting man
I've been known to play a hand at poker
too I would probably wait you at the
gold color will be available only on the
rumored 128 gigabyte iphone 5s which is
a ridiculous amount of storage i think
if there is ever any section that would
be willing to sort of pony up what's
going to be a crazy amount of money for
a hundred twenty eight gigs of phone
perhaps they want the option of a little
special color to go with it so they can
say hey i can store more songs and video
than you can the other big announcement
that we're hearing for that Reuben
September tenth of it is it's plastic
brother the iphone 5c we've seen plastic
phones before from apple the 3g and the
3gs but you hear plastic to think maybe
not so durable the folks at apple daily
thought that same thing and they got one
of them
back plates that are floating around and
did some strength training with it when
I need to hear that I keep thinking
they're doing like the biggest loser
like someone just screaming at it while
doing like little phone sit-ups
especially what they did was I took the
iphone 5c they put in a sandwich bag
full of coins car keys and they shook it
up like crazy to try and get optimum
damage and not surprisingly it totally
rocked it say what you will about apples
recent phones I i phone 4 4 s 5 and
perhaps 5s they were beautifully
designed but they were a little on the
fragile side glass bags things got
dented so the hope is that this plastic
really durable back will be able to
handle a lot of what life can throw at
it and if this test is we believed it
looks like it absolutely will so if
you're more of the rugged style perhaps
the 5c might be a phone you want to look
at the Sony Honami is finally getting a
grown-up name will know everything
September fourth which is the best day
of the entire year cuz it's my birthday
but it's no more gonna be called the
Honami it's going to get an experian
occur it's going to be the z1 and is
going to set itself up as the king the
Grand Poobah of the Xperia line she
forgot the suckers got in it it's got a
20 megapixel sensor which before the
Lumia 1020 would have been like whoa
that's a lot of megapixels pretty
beastly Snapdragon 800 which of course
quad-core CPU and a pretty nice size
3000 milliamp hour battery I've been a
little down on Sony in years past I
thought that their phones kind of stunk
I thought the screen for kind of bad I
got the skins apron on were really
really awful and then I saw the Xperia Z
ultra and I was like mmm super thin and
Bill quad-a was outstanding the screen
look gorgeous they didn't overly skin
and join the limits for of be Android
and that's a directions Tony phones are
heading and all indication as they are I
am really really excited about the
Honami experience you whatever they want
to call it looks me really good
contended might help Sony finally get
some that premium market sure that I
know they've been pining after NVIDIA
Tegra 4 is coming it's coming to more
than just the Nvidia shield our good
friends at Asus looking to get into the
Tegra game so a recent benchmark from
the folks at GF x been spilled all the
details on what they're calling the
latest version in the eee pad which is
rocking you guessed it Tegra 4 it's got
a pretty awesome sounding 2560
by 1500 for pixel display as well as on
screen capacitive buttons android 4.2
point2 no 4.3 by all accounts in my own
tests with the shield Tegra 4 is a beast
so you combine sort of awesome android
power with just ridiculous not only
power the power efficiency with tegra
forney got a pretty sweet tablet so i'm
excited and finally happy to see Tegra 4
devices start filtering out to the
public it's been almost a year at CES of
2012 integra for its first unveiled and
really don't have many products yet so
hop on an nvidia and a sooz given money
tablet i need to get my greasy fingers
all over something else let me step
aside for the rumors for just a minute
to talk to you about something that is
ridiculously important don't drink and
drive don't be stupid that's like saying
don't drink and drive i'd be like saying
make sure you forget to inhale and
exhale up you something that you just
know innately just don't do it it is
probably the stupidest thing we can do
in the folks national campaign against
drunk driving want you to know it
dragonball impaired is not only illegal
it's also crazy stupid the consequences
from driving drunk or impaired are
deadly serious and I say emphasis on
deadly fatalities from alcohol impaired
people that's a blood alcohol a point oh
eight or higher driving crashes account
for an average of one fatality every 51
minutes holiday is like labor day and
weekends are always especially deadly
Labor Day is coming up so just don't do
it for example labor day weekend 2010
saw 147 people kill from crashes
involving drunk drivers or motorcycle
riders with BAC s of point 08 or higher
it is never ever ever worth it call a
cab call a friend call your parents
sleep it off somewhere just never get in
a car if you've been drinking or never
gonna cover somebody who has been
drinking it is absolutely never ever
ever ever worth it never think oh I had
two beers i'm good i know myself is you
don't know yourself you ever know what
your actions gonna be when it has to be
quick take away anything from any ad or
eat or any message I've ever given you
