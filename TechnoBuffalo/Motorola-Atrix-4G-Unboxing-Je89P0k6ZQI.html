technobuffalo here with an unboxing that
I'm really excited about this is the
motorola atrix 4g for AT&amp;amp;T let's go
ahead and dig in and see if this dual
core pack and powerhouse lives up to the
hype so for phone allegedly this
powerful the box is very unassuming it's
typical AT&amp;amp;T package here with the
orange accents got a picture of the
device on the front that was announced
and we had a chance to take a look at at
CES 2011 so we got the package contents
right there but why you read when I'm
going to show it to you in just a minute
got some legal specs on the side and
some kinds of information I probably not
many people are going to look at this is
stuff that is going to matter to you
android 2.2 it's got a web top
application there's an available laptop
dock i'll show you an upcoming video
that actually extends a functionality of
this guy it's got a dual-core processor
and that is the nvidia tegra 2 it's got
2 1 gigahertz processors in here this
thing is an absolute beast and it is
running the newest version of Motorola's
motoblur skin sitting on top of the
android 2.2 platform here's sort of a
overview of what you can do with this
and i'll show you all the success rates
an upcoming video so i'm going to kind
of gloss over them here quickly so there
you've got your atrix 4g in the middle
you've got a vehicle dock of course for
navigation wireless keyboards you can
use probably a wireless keyboard laptop
talk that i mentioned actually turns
this into pretty full functioning laptop
HD multimedia dock for getting content
over to your television and a standard
doctors for docking and charging all
right so I will run over all the specs
the First's go ahead and dig into the
box and take a look at the motorola
atrix 4g this guy really represents a
paradigm shift for smartphone hardware
and how we think about our smartphones
of what they can do dual-core whether or
not it's going to translate to actual
performance increases definitely is a is
a change for
how we think about phones I remember not
that long ago when computers weren't
this powerful so from a hardware
standpoint this thing is incredibly
capable whether or not the software
optimizes the hardware potential is
really going to be the big question mark
so I've got a quick start guide right
here and go ahead and read that if you'd
like we'll push out the phone it is
sitting right on top off to the side for
just a quick second here is the back
pushes that off run through the contents
we can get to the phone looks like it
does ship with an hdmi cable which is
nice of the folks in motor elec to to
include that G we can I can rip into
this here quickly show you what we got
the phone does feature hdmi out so it
does have full-size HDMI and then
there's the smaller HDMI out port we're
just kind of neat and nice they included
got typical wall charger with the USB
port micro USB cord for charging your
monster battery here which is going to
be to 1930 milliamp hours but is not
that large Messiah standpoint large from
a capacity standpoint and then the rest
of the motoblur stuff that you might
want alright so let's talk about this
phone because there is a lot in here and
i'll go ahead and power it on let's run
through the specs very quickly you peel
ups plastics I know that annoys on
everybody there is a lot to like about
this phone so first the price it's going
to set you back just about two hundred
dollars from AT&amp;amp;T it's got a four inch
display with a resolution of 540 x 960
Motorola is calling that Q HD android
2.2 with motoblur as I mentioned it's
got that dual core 1 Giga its Tegra 2
processor so that is that is to 1
gigahertz processors not one that equals
or two that equals 1 gigahertz that's
two separate one gets processors it's
got 16 gigs of internal storage of
course that's expandable on the back
let's see if they include a card in here
it looks like this one does not include
an expansion card but you can get it up
to a 32 gig card in there as I mentioned
that huge 1930 milliamp hour battery if
you're on the biggest batteries that I
can think of that shipped but not that
large in size I hopefully be able to get
to a full day of charge presumably a
tegra two chip is going to take a lot of
power it has a 5 megapixel camera on the
back right there with dual LED flash and
of course it's out of focus as well and
can take video at 720p on the front
we've got a VGA camera for video calling
facebook self-portraits or whatever
other things you guys want to do with
that front facing camera it's gotten
HDMI out port on the side right there
right next to its charging ports it's
also going to be equipped to a swipe on
board support for AT&amp;amp;T hspa+ network and
there's been in sort of conflicting
reports but this is supposedly going to
be upgradable to AT&amp;amp;T LTE network if you
have software update whenever that
network is launched and on the back it's
got a biometric fingerprint scanner
which is also the unlock but you don't
have to use it as a fingerprint scanner
but if you like you can swipe your
finger over at and a locket or you can
just push it in all right so let's go
ahead and put the battery and pop in the
sim card and see what this thing looks
like because it's supposed to be quite a
powerful phone I had a chance to check
out some pre production of hardware when
I was at CES 2011 so here is the back
sort of a plastic feel I've got a sim
card handy i'm going to go ahead and pop
it in and do it off camera because
there's a phone number printed on the
back of the sim card to go ahead and pop
it right in i'm going to cover it up you
can see where the sim card is going to
go right there take the battery and we
will put it in which ways are going to
go it's going to go like it is take the
back snap it on hopefully with relative
ease yeah just snaps right on nice and
easily and we will power the sucker on
and I'll give another quick tour of it
while it is booting up probably have to
go through motoblur setup but I've got a
new sort of dual core screen right there
you've got your for capacitive android
buttons at the bottom this one is unique
to mode
that's going to be your menu button home
button back button search button the vga
camera that i mentioned the gorgeous
four-inch screen this is a really high
resolution display on the left-hand side
you've got your micro USB charging port
HDMI out you can that's what's sort of
optimal for the TV documentation which I
talked about earlier and I will show an
upcoming video on the other side of it
you're going to have your volume rockers
like the backs not fully snapped is
neither there we go you're going to have
a volume rocker on the top 3.5
millimeter headset jack and your lock
and unlock button is actually a
biometric fingerprint scanner which is
kind of neat a little bit unknowingly
located if you want to sort of push it
with your finger here but I suppose
you'll get used to it I'm a bot I'm you
just have a microphone does have some
noise cancelling features as well on the
back that's where your 5 megapixel
camera with the dual LED flash autofocus
is going to live here are some
instructions here for how to use the
back let's pull it off and get a sense
of what it feels like and see what the
build quality here is going to be but
pull it off it is plastic it looks like
there's some texture to it but it's not
it's just a design it's a soft touch
plastic there's a speaker right at the
bottom there overall the build quality
seems to represent the new motorola
build quality which has been quite nice
it definitely has a little bit of a
plastic you feel but it feels solid it's
surprisingly thin for a device packing
this much power let me go ahead and
bring in a few other devices for size
comparison purposes so first let's start
with android brethren we've got the
galaxy s 4g for tmobile the same size
screen there four inches go and stack
those guys you can see that for for dual
core this thing is not much bigger at
all it's almost as thin actually as they
an iphone 4 which at one point was the
finished phone on the market you can
really see what Motorola has done here
very nice job I'm looking forward to
getting into this phone of course we'll
have a ton of coverage on technobuffalo
and
youtube channel so stay tuned for all of
that goodness including the rest of the
accessories that come with this guy i'm
jon rettinger from TechnoBuffalo and i
will see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
