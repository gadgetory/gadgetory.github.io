technobuffalo here and i want to give
you a short overview of some of the new
features found on iphone and ipod touch
OS 3.1 so let me first show you that i
am indeed running 3.1 go into general
about and you can see right down there
running version 3.1 so the biggest
change really want to do only changes
that you're going to see on your iphone
directly is in the app store so let me
open this up and what you're going to
get now is a new genius playlist that
you're going to stay in the feature
you've got new what's hot and now genius
and once you go through and accept some
terms and services you're going to get
access to this full sort of new playlist
essentially what this is going to do is
recommend apps based on your purchase
history so if you're going a lot of
camera apps it's going to recommend
camera apps for buying a lot of raising
games are gonna recommend racing games
use a series of very smart algorithms to
determine what Apple thinks might
interest you now some might find that a
little bit creepy and you can turn this
off and you don't have to use it or send
any information to Apple some may find
it very helpful so here's some
recommendations for me based on things
I've already downloaded and that's
generally what you're going to see as
far as the updated 3.1 there are some
bug fixes behind the scenes I personally
hoping for improved battery life will be
doing a full demonstration of new itunes
nine in a different video I think so
we're discussing the iphone the ipod
touch it's important to show you one of
the features that you get with 3.1 that
couples very nicely with the new itunes
nine let me go ahead and show you that
right now I've got my iphone connected
to my computer the iphone is of course
running 3.1 and my computer is running
itunes version 9 so across the top you
get a very familiar interface what you'd
see when you're syncing your iphone or
ipod touch summary info ringtones music
movies TV shows podcast iTunes U and
photos one of the new things now under
applications that you can see right here
as you get a graphical representation of
your iPhone
ipod touch home screen with full app
management so let's say I want to move
an icon I can just grab it with my mouse
and that ripple effect is just coming
from my screen capture program I can go
ahead and drag it anywhere I want and as
I move my mouse over these applications
you notice that I get an X so I can go
ahead and delete them if I choose and
you get the same representation for each
of your home screen so I've got four
right here let go ahead and clip to I
can manage all the applications on this
screen and the same thing for three
which really does i think come in nice
and handy now in addition you also get
app management here on the left-hand
side you can choose what applications
are going to sink and where they're
going to show up on your phone so if I
go back to my first one for example I
just go back to number two I've got a
Bloomberg application that i use to
track all of my stocks well here's
Bloomberg red appear if I go ahead and
select that notice that it'll disappear
from my second home screen go ahead and
put it back it shows back up at the
bottom and I can move it right back to
where I like so a lot of times if you go
and download applications maybe you're
downloading a ton of free ones you might
not always want them on your iPhone or
iPod touch so now you can determine
which ones show up when and where
they're going to show up and this will
be true with any applications that you
downloaded whether you paid for them or
whether not they were free as long as
you kept them on your computer they will
always be there and a lot of math we
transfer to your computer when you sync
your iPhone's no need to worry about
things not being there or saying you
know I didn't buy applications on my
computer how am I going to get them on
my iPhone or iPod touch no need for
concern so I'm going to do like I
mentioned a further walk through of
itunes not in but I thought it was
important to show how itunes nine worked
with iphone and ipod touch OS 3.1 for
