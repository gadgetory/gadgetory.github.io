to you by netflix what's going on
everyone welcome to another episode of
rumor roundup I'm Rose John renders the
show where I take all the tech rumors
from the week and I condense them into
one show so you know what could come
what might happen what potentially has a
possibility to come sometime this year
next year or six years from now and what
definitely might probably happen up this
week it's all about the iphone 6 the
galaxy s5 and the iWatch rumor roundup
let's start rounding things up let's
begin with the big daddy of all rumors
Korean securities firm DD b day we
securities research has shipped off a
single PDF that alleges both the specs
of not only the galaxy s5 but also what
Apple's gun store for the iphone 6 the
company made its estimates using
industry research so they should be kind
of close or maybe not even close at all
but they were confident enough in the
specs to include it in their letter to
investors so before I get to them a lot
of these are kind of like dust backs of
course but it is still interesting on
what Samsung and Apple could do so let's
start with samsung galaxy s5 according
to them is going to be a 5.2 inch screen
resolution of 2560 by 1540 it'll be an
AMOLED display and if you can do your
quick math that is a whopping 560 ppi
power this guy is a Snapdragon 805 or
Samsung XE no 6 processor Samson kind of
does that the two separate processes
with their devices depending on the
model 3 gigs of RAM which like we saw in
the galaxy note 3 available in 32 64 or
for the first time as far as I can
remember 128 gigabytes of storage that
is a lot of gigabytes 16 megapixel
camera 3.2 megapixel on the front and
the big boy obviously on the back run
the android 4.4 kitkat release date
here's a big one q1 or q2 of this year
and by my math and my sundial already in
February's only two months left in q1 so
maybe very soon omitted though from
their specs and mentions of a finger
a retina scanner if you've heard rumors
of and what the darn thing might be made
of we've heard some rumors that the
might ditch plastic and maybe go the way
of metal but I wouldn't hold your breath
for that but we might know what's going
to be coming very soon sansom hasn't
unpacked event scheduled for februari
24th which of course TechnoBuffalo will
be at sota guys think that seems like
Captain Obvious specs for the next
generation galaxy s5 but the obvious
sometimes said to be who actually comes
to fruition so I would say those seem
pretty pretty solid anything guys are
excited about not excited about is it
worth upgrading from your Galaxy s4 I
want to hear your thoughts Samsung
wasn't the only juicy nugget Colonel
bleak goodness that they had there also
shedding some light on with the very
secretive Apple might have in store for
the iPhone 6 they suggest that apple
releasing the phone in two different
models of not talking six and five C 2
or 60 they're saying one with a 4.7 inch
screen what you're saying hey that's big
it's point four seven inches but which I
get the other part of that rumor at the
other size a 5.5 inch screen which
resolutions of Canadian ein teen 20 and
1280 x 22 72 respectively Apple will
also supposedly be changing the material
of the screen to indium gallium zinc
oxide otherwise known as eggs Oh from
the older low-temperature polysilicon or
LTPS they were suggesting strangely
though the PDF says that the iphone 6
will run iOS 7.2 instead of iOS 8 and it
could launch as early as q2 well before
Apple typical release window that's kind
of funny or like it could release could
release as early as tomorrow I would say
for sure we will see the iphone 6 as
early as tomorrow but as late as the end
of this year so again sort of fun to
speculate those are big phones 5.7 and
4.7 certainly much bigger than Apple's
done to create a little bit of
fragmentation curiously what Apple does
with legacy apps and higher resolution
screens could certainly be nice no
mention though of any sort of inductive
charging NFC your camera any kind of
other stuff which we're going to talk
about in just a minute does look to be
pretty nice i'm kind of excited to eat
apples got in store with samsung's
gotten stored with them just like hungry
hungry hippo battle each other out for
all the little
marbles where the marbles and that
analogy regardless though I'm excited we
take a break from all the awesome rumors
to thank our friends add to netflix if
you don't use netflix you are seriously
missing out on all the great teams in
movies that you're probably didn't get a
chance to go out and see you can catch
up on things like The Walking Dead
Breaking Bad netflix original
programming definitely worth checking
out if you've got any console xbox 360
and xbox one a ps3 ps4 a wii or wii u
you can already get netflix and really
any smartphone app if you got a Windows
Phone iOS or Android it works you should
be checking it out if you're not already
give it a free 30-day trial go to
netflix.com slash buffalo to try it cuz
you should you missing out and all the
great shows again that is netflix.com
slash buffalo back to the rumors well
we're sitting with apple let's go and
talk about them let's talk about the
iWatch at this point it seems like a
close to certainty that will see
something wearable coming out from Apple
presumably this year beyond that though
we don't really know much else the New
York Times I was trying to illuminate
what Apple might have in store they
claim that was focusing on health and
fitness uses for its rumored iWatch and
that iOS 8 make a pact with a health
book app that will help users track
their health progress so if fitness
gadgets becoming their own category it
kind of makes sense that apple would
want a piece that ever-growing delicious
it presumably very profitable pie
wearables are often plagued by poor
battery life New York Times is also
claimed that Apple is going to try to
alleviate that by offering finally I
might add wireless inductive charging to
the iWatch and also will release a
charging plate to accompany it so that
sounds kind of realistic the time takes
it one step further saying that Apple is
experiencing with solar charging as well
something if ever does come to fruition
I would not bet your house on sitting at
any time soon the inductive charging
rumor it makes a lot of sense it's are
going to have inductive charging and i
watch and a charging plate similar the
Qi charger I would assume the iphone 6
will also come with inductive charging
and maybe even NFC let's not related I'm
just just thinking about things I hope
that it might have wistfully and you
guys what do you think would you excited
about not excited about galaxy s5 iphone
six I watched or like the heavyweights
of the rumor world every year sort of
Samsung flagships apples flagships and
let them battle it out I'm excited I
want to know what you guys think lead in
