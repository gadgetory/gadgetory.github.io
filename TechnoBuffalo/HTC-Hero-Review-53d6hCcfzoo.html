technobuffalo here with a full review
for you on the unlocked HTC hero so
before I get started with the review let
me preface this with this device does
not currently support us 3g bands so
won't support 3g for AT&amp;amp;T or t-mobile
since it's a gsm unlocked device however
it will support 3g in parts of Europe
and other places in the world so
something to keep in mind as you watch
this review so when I start my cell
phone reviews always talk about call
quality since that's most important and
phone it can have the best browser the
best you I the most rom the most Ram but
the call quality sucks the phone is
going to be useless so call quality on
the HTC hero is actually quite good I
tested it using AT&amp;amp;T edge network and it
was fantastic call quality was crisp the
radio seemed to be very strong i turned
3g off on my personal iphone so i was
running just on edge and this one
actually had better edge reception
sudden the radio that was put in here is
quite strong I can't speak for the 3g
radio but ed was it was quite good
battery life just running on edge was
fantastic i could easily go three or
four days and that's even with Wi-Fi
turned on however i would expect that
number to drop significantly if testing
could be done over 3g i think if you
want to get a full day of use out of
this you won't have any trouble but
definitely going to want to charge it
every night from a design perspective
it's kind of a lover aight type thing
with the android chin has kind of been
known sort of the Jay Leno of
smartphones I talked about during my
unboxing I actually liked the chin I'm a
big fan of smartphones and you know flip
phones as well and one of the first
phones that I ever had that I loved was
the old razor and I liked it because I
could push the microphone right up to my
face and it wasn't like a slab phone
where it was one piece and wouldn't Bend
so I do like that what I'm talking to
this the microphone is sort of extent
closer to my mouth I think that helps
improve call quality and sneaking out
color quality like I mentioned sounds
quietly good so from design standpoint
it really is either love it or hate it I
personally really do like it build
quality seems solid it feels nice in the
hand it's not terribly slippery the 5
megapixel autofocus camera is stupendous
although I do wish that it had a
self-portrait mirror some sort of flash
something that I can definitely
overlooked because I megapixel pretty
high quality not too bad so let's move
on to the screen and this is a
capacitive touchscreen similar to what
you find on the blackberry storm the
iphone the mytouch 3g and the original
t-mobile g1 meaning there's no squishy
feel to it it's quite nice the screen is
very responsive I'd say it's much more
responsive than the blackberry storms
and on par as far as responsiveness with
the iphone and the g1 meaning it's very
good there is much of a lag which is
quite nice at least when using the
screen however there is a bit of lag
when i try to open multiple programs or
you're trying to flow from screen to
screen now I know they've been talked to
that big fix with upcoming software and
firmware updates but this is the
shipping rom so this is if you were to
buy this right now today this would be
what you would have on your device so
it's only fair that I review what it
shipped with so programs can launch a
little bit slowly it feels like it's
struggling to keep up with some of the
applications and I think that's due to
the pretty resource heavy sense UI
that's HTC put on this device you might
have seen a previous video that I did
going over the sense you i'll put a link
to it a sidebar so you can check it out
there essentially what it is the skin
i'm sitting on top of android i'm sort
of take some of the Android features and
makes them look a little bit better
makes them a little user friendly and
really adds a little bit of
HTC flair you may have seen something
similar done with touchflo 3d found on
windows mobile devices I'm a big big big
fan of the sense UI and I'm encouraged
to see what else HTC is going to be
doing and I think that the Android
platform as a whole is so much potential
and I did that be heroes on the first
devices to really tap into that
customizing potential so overall I think
it's a very very good phone however it
does fall a victim I think to its own of
don't success and the reason the sense
UI is so good as because it's Olga
processor heavy and resource intensive
and because of that resource in sentence
activity you're going to get a little
bit of somas with the device nothing bad
nothing that's gonna prohibit you from
using on a regular basis but it's not
going to be as snappy as you might be
used to on other Android devices however
let's say version 2 point 0 comes out
with a faster processor is a little more
ram a little more rum I think you're
going to have a killer phone here I
really liked using and I was impressed
with the Android Marketplace gmail
integration is fantastic up
notifications when you slide your finger
down that little bar that pops up is you
know really nice the multitasking is
quite good i like the tent too i gives
you a ton of screens you can flip
through the widgets that they put on
here or very useful it's a really very
user-friendly operating system it's also
very powerful as well I kind of almost
put it in the middle between let's say
the iphone operating system as far as
finger friendliness and ease of use and
Windows Mobile on the other end which is
very customizable but not so
user-friendly and I think that Android
kind of sits right in the middle of that
which is a really good place to be so
I'm very impressed with what HTC and I
guess a Google building the operating
system has done so guys in conclusion oh
there are a ton of features that I can
talk about but it really kind of want to
keep this relatively short sound drag on
for a 20 minute video but I am very
impressed with the HTC hero if you have
3g in your area 3g that rather supports
the HTC hero i can recommend it without
hesitation note you're going to have a
little
to slow down from resources but I think
that will be addressed with future
firmware updates make it a little less
intensive if you're trying to import
this into the US where you don't have 3g
you may want to think twice trying to
use three you try to use edge rather on
a regular basis is so painful especially
having gotten used to fast 3g speeds
that's going to come down to personal
preference so on a one-to-five scale i
can really give this a solid for four
and a half stars i think if it had a
little faster processor a little more
ram a little more wrong we'd be looking
at a solid five here this phone is
fantastic and I think HTC really really
did a nice job anyway guys this is jon
