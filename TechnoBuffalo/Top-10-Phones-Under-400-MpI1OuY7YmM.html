good smartphone you have to spend
upwards of seven eight hundred bucks
unlocked to get a phone that was going
to work well for the next 12 to 18
months but fortunately those days are
gone here are the top 10 phones under
$400 in no particular order except for
number one which is definitely my
favorite jump right in
coming in at number 10 the Alcatel idol
4s this VR ready 5.5 inch display 2560
by 1440 a 16 megapixel rear camera 3
gigs of ram and a nice size 3000
milliamp hour battery Plus build quality
feels really good number 9 the next bit
Robin which was just released in red by
the way is still one of my favorite
phones of the year three gigs of ram
same 5.2 inch display we saw the Alcatel
I love for quick charging 32 gigs
internal storage and that pretty awesome
cloud storage for your apps number eight
the Huawei honor 5x this phone is $199
and you were getting just ridiculous
value for that price again three gigs
Aram getting a bit a larger screen here
at 5.5 inches being two CPUs dual
centers that's important to you and a
really well-built good feeling phone
number seven the Moto X pure dish I know
a lot of you guys love the Moto X line
getting a quad HD display it shoots 4k
it's got turbo charging and it's $2.99
next up is the ZTE zmax pro if you pick
this thing up you would never guess it
costs only 99 bucks this thing feels
premium through-and-through it's rocking
a fingerprint sensor 34 hundred million
power battery it's got a really nice
looking 1080p display number five the
Nexus 5x on sale now for two hundred and
forty nine bucks obviously you're
getting the best and latest from Android
or getting updates for the next few
years you're also getting a 5.2 inch
display two gigs of RAM a 12 megapixel
camera fingerprint sensor and of course
a 2700 milliamp hour battery coming in
at number four and again no particular
water a phone that we just reviewed the
Moto G for plus they're getting turbo
charging 16 megapixel camera a
water-repellent nano coating a
fingerprint reader and all for a really
reasonable price 250 bucks number 3 I
know this phone is a favorite to a lot
of you the Nexus 6p got incredible deal
going on the Google Play Store for 399
that's $100 off what it was when it
launched
specs you guys should know at this point
five point
seven inch AMOLED screen 3 eggs aramco
megapixel sensor shoots 4k and of course
the latest updates from Google so if you
want you get when it comes out next
device is going to be your best way to
go number two the iPhone se barely
inking it under that $400 price point at
399 you're getting iOS a 4 inch Retina
display the a9 + m9 coprocessors photo
megapixel sensor that can shoot 4k and
touch ID built in and of course Apple
pay and access to the App Store and
coming at number one and this is number
one for a reason I think one of my
favorite phones of the year so far if
not the favorite the one that's gonna be
in my pocket for a while the 1 plus 3
for 399 bucks and insane 6 gigabytes of
RAM which still feels odd to say 5.5
inch AMOLED display through thousand
million power battery a fingerprint
sensor can shoot 4k 16 megapixel camera
matrix on the front and a really
well-built body and an OS that looks
almost stock and Drain performs like
almost like Android some really nice
tweaks another phone of note under $400
is BlackBerry's latest D Tech 50 we're
still reviewing it but if you want to
pick one up it definitely comes under
that price point 299 bucks the moral
this video is that there are a ton of
incredible phones available which phone
is your favorite if you guys want to see
us do more lists like this for budget
phones do the video thumbs up but a let
us know the next time from John render
from TechnoBuffalo dr. guys our next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
