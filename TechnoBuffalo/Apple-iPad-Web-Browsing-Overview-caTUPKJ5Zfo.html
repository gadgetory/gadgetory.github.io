TechnoBuffalo here and I want to give
you an overview of a web browsing on the
iPad it's really one of the big selling
points at Apple's touting is this being
the best mobile web experience that you
can have so I want to show you what it
looks like what you can do what you
can't do and give you the general
overview of what you can expect if you
pick up one of these devices so I'll go
ahead and launch up Safari and this is
just a Wi-Fi version and all this is
being shown just over a Wi-Fi connection
so you get a few options here you get
your usual search bar which is Google
like you have on the iPhone or iPod
Touch you get your URL bar right there
add a bookmark it'll take you right to
your bookmark as you have any which I
don't have right now it'll open up
different pages if you have them open
here and I'll show you what that looks
like in just a minute I'll go ahead and
go back to new page so let's go ahead
and launch one right here go ahead and
tap the URL and we'll go to
TechnoBuffalo calm and I'll do further
videos showing you how the keyboard
works and all the different applications
so be sure to stay tuned to the channel
and TechnoBuffalo so go ahead and type
it in it's actually the only website
I've loaded up on here just got this
home a few minutes ago you can see this
feed I'm also gonna be doing a head to
head video against the iPhone so you can
see what the differences are so that's
loading up and this is actually a good
site to test because there's a banded
video on here so you get a very very
very large experience with the iPad it's
nine point seven inch screen really
shows off the web quite nicely so as you
browse you really have a lot of options
for you can see what you can do just
based on sheer pixels you can see just a
ton so scrolling very smooth as can be
expected by the a4 chip which is clocked
in at 1 gigahertz very smooth buttery
smooth even zoom and it just says you'd
expect pinch and zoom to clip the video
pinch and zoom goes very smoothly and
very quickly so let's say you want to
click on a link you get a few more
options here than you've had on previous
Apple devices let's say I want to click
on five of the best iPad alternatives if
I tap it'll just take me right to the
link but if I hold
down I get these new pop-ups these
pop-ups sort of show up throughout the
entire operating system so I can open it
open a new page or copy go ahead and
leave that right there you can see what
that looks like so I watch a lot of
YouTube video if you guys are watching
this odds are you watched a lot of
YouTube videos well how is that going to
look on an iPad well let me show you
what the player looks like so here is an
unboxing I did of the Samsung Drive go
ahead and hit play and actually plays
right inside the window almost as if it
had flash which of course it does not
you can go ahead hit play and it will
play right inside the window and if I
make it fullscreen tap that button of
course you can always rotate it and now
you get a full screen video experience
I'll go ahead and pause this and this
does play HD this is a 720p video and
it's playing it pretty nicely I'll do
another video series showing you how
video playback is I just want to show
you how it integrates with the web we'll
go ahead and hit done and of course you
can browse in landscape as well I'll go
ahead and rotate this back and go ahead
and keep scrolling through so let's talk
about bookmarks to get a lot of options
here in bookmarks so if I want to say
add TechnoBuffalo I'm going hit the plus
button and again that new pop-up shows
up and I can add it as regular bookmark
or add it to home screen or I can mail a
link to this page let's go ahead and add
it to bookmark and now you can choose
where you want to add it to get in the
bookmarks bar which I'll show you in a
minute
or just regular bookmark so I'll go and
add to the bookmarks bar and I'll name
it just TechnoBuffalo what is called
techno for right now
go ahead save so you don't see it pop up
but you don't see a bookmarks bar but if
you tap that URL shows up right there
you get a whole list of them that'll
show all the way up and go ahead and tap
it and you can jump right to it let's go
ahead and load another page you can see
what things look like we'll go to
youtube.com/scishow you what different
pages look like here so on go ahead and
open a new page a new page and we'll go
to youtube there you
see things look pretty quickly actually
googled YouTube not a big deal I wanted
to show you what pages look like so
we'll go ahead and take a look you can
see that it opens up in a very nice grid
you can scroll through and pick the page
that you want so we'll go back here you
can see the experience is very very very
smooth let's go to a site like say New
York Times is one that's been touted up
quite a bit that will have been
demonstrated I'm gonna assume it's New
York Times com just a guess and we'll
see how sites like that look on the iPad
go ahead go and I gotta say so far
typing has actually been surprisingly
easy and again I'll do a full video on
typing and how it works but here you go
you get the New York Times in a very big
format the way that really you may not
be used to seeing and scrolling
everything work just as it would expect
and there is sort of embedded video in
there as well David Pogue on the iPad so
I'm gonna go back the TechnoBuffalo and
show you what the difference would be as
compared to the iPhone again I'll do a
full video comparing these two but as
far as screen real estate this is really
the difference of what you've seen you
can tell with it's very small and craft
right here it's certainly you can zoom
in as you can on the iPad but it's much
much larger and a little bit lighter on
the eyes on the iPad it's a little bit
easier to read because it's so big
well you really do feel like you're
getting the full web experience even
though one of the Noxon is a little bit
limited with the lack of flash apples
certainly pushing there alternative
which is html5 but you can just see the
difference on screen real estate and
what browsing would look like I'm also
bit skeptical why do I need a device
where I can just browse but I can do it
on my iPhone or you might be saying the
same thing on your iPod touch but right
here you can really just hit a
difference and it's in sheer size
so guys I'm John Rhett enger' from
TechnoBuffalo with an overview for you
of browsing and how mobile browsing
works on the Apple iPad stay tuned to
the channel and TechnoBuffalo for a ton
of Apple news coming up I will see you
in the next I paid related video bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
