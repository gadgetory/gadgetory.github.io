to you by netflix go to WWF flexkom
slash buffalo for your free trial
membership today ding what's up everyone
John Rhett enger' from TechnoBuffalo
here and you're probably wondering John
why are you wearing a tie I thought I'd
change it up a little bit from my
general hoodie unshaven gross goatee
looking face said I usually have I just
got home and I was wearing this so I
figured why not look a little bit more
fancy what you can't see is that no
pants on but I look dressy from here on
up so one of the questions that I get
probably more than any other is a when
should I buy question when should I buy
my cell phone when should I buy my
laptop is it a good time to look for X
product right now and I thought this
would be a decent opportunity to sort of
talk about is not a sort of consumerism
but sort of when to buy electronics
you're kind of caught in a bit of a
catch-22 when it comes to new
electronics you need something either
you have something that's broken or you
have a desire for something new there's
always going to be something new coming
out so there's always that development
life cycle whether you wait until the
day something is released there's always
gonna be something new coming out
shortly after so it's really hard
decision especially hard right now for
you folks looking to buy a cell phone
whether your contract is up or whether
you really just want a new one um you
should probably been waiting for dual
core I want to do a core I keep hearing
about this NVIDIA Tegra 2 Qualcomm
dual-core Snapdragon dual-core 2 cores
are better than one core that's what I'm
waiting for
and then the blue noise are hearing
about quad core phones and quad core
tablets coming out and you're probably
thinking to yourself crap you know what
do I do that's what I would be thinking
you know if I was waiting for a phone
I'd be saying okay uh I phone five
maybes coming out hopefully we'll have a
dual core a for updated a5 chip or the
Atrix is coming out its gonna have dual
core Tegra 2 mon it that's what I'm
waiting for you and then you start
hearing about with quad core business
and so
it's completely muddled so the short
answer is by when you need and be an
educated consumer if you're watching
these videos certainly you've got a bit
of interest in technology and maybe you
know something that's going on but if
you vineeth through a product right now
get it when it comes to cell phones it's
doubly tricky because you're usually
locked into a two-year deal but you
eventually you have to make that
decision to purchase eventually you hit
a point where you know you need
something new you need something current
and more course doesn't always mean
better a lot of times it's how the
software optimizes the hardware so if
you look at let's say Android for
example because we're hearing a lot of
dual-core quad core Android Business
Froyo the last version of Android is
probably one of the more popular builds
out there it doesn't have full support
for dual cores some of the applications
will access dual cores and certainly
we'll see updates to Froyo and the
carriers for customizing it to access
dual cores that it comes available and
let's not even taking full advantage of
the dual cores certainly you're going to
get better quadrant result test and sort
of higher benchmarks with quad core but
the really the results haven't been that
much better so we're not going to see
quad core completely optimized for
months after these phone to beast or
maybe the second generation of these
dual core chips so the boot time by the
time quad core comes around software's
an item you'll be optimized for quad
core odds are so you're really going to
keep hitting this loop so this is a long
explanation for saying bye when you need
and be an educated consumer look when
things come out certainly you're better
off buying on the more recent side of
the product release cycle when it comes
to a phone generally if you want to buy
it or get it when it's new purchase it
within the first three to four months of
when it's been released and if you can
wait after that I'll die there's
something better coming out around the
corner but if you can get into that
first three months you'll still have
modern hardware for the duration of your
phone usage and also you know there's a
lot of finances that are coming to stake
here new phones are expensive so a lot
of things you can do to sort of help
pave the way in an upgrade you can sell
your current phone that you have for
example is a great way to pay the cost
of a new phone if you've got certain
older
say last generation iPhone or iPhone 3G
you can sell it for a couple hundred
bucks and help subsidize a new phone
purchase or you can sell the phone and
save the money and get a free phone on
contract after all mixed phone calls
might be all that you need and guys has
been up a long winded answer to some of
the more popular questions I hope that
you guys found it helpful I'm more
interested in discussion you guys have
to say about these things and it's
certainly true with laptops as well you
know when you get a laptop is there a
new Intel chip coming out and all that
kind of stuff and at this point I would
like to thank our sponsor Netflix I've
