to you by Harry's hey what's going on
guys a mark and sang in from
TechnoBuffalo and on today's episode of
rumor roundup we'll be talking about the
galaxy note5 the Moto X 2015 the next
Nexus phone and the iphone 6s plus this
is rumor roundup so let's go ahead and
get started as Motorola gears up for its
July 28 event a number of leaked photos
is giving us a crystal-clear look at the
company's upcoming devices similar to
previous Motorola handsets the images
show off devices that share a similar
design language across the board whether
it's the flagship Moto X or the more
affordable Moto G this year it looks
like Motorola is moving in a slightly
different direction in terms of design
the alleged Moto X 2015 has a stealthier
look one accented by a strip of metal
down the devices back side the dimple
has been minimised a bit too while the
Hunchback is no longer visible the Moto
G on the other hand looks like what
you'd expect from Motorola small nimble
functional and we assume affordable as
for specs the Moto X 2015 is expected to
include a 5.2 inch qhd display a more
powerful processor while the Moto G
could include a Snapdragon 410 processor
and a 5-inch 720p display Motorola has
an event planned for july 28 so we'll
know more soon rumors of a huawei made
nexus phone have been bouncing around
for a while now but a new leak reveals
just how awesome the alleged smartphone
could be the latest details come from
eveleigh clue has a pretty decent track
record at least mentioned in a tweet
that the Huawei made Nexus will
apparently come packing a 5.7 inch qhd
display a Snapdragon 820 processor a
fingerprint reader and a metal design
we're also expecting the new nexus
tablets to pack a 3500 million battery
which should be more than enough to get
you through the day a reversible USBC
port seems guaranteed as well
considering Google's recent emphasis on
the technology rumor has it that Google
will also unveil a smaller lg-made Nexus
phone at the same time the device will
allegedly pack a 5.2 inch display in two
thousand seven hundred million battery
and a snapdragon 808 processor Google
isn't expected to reveal any nexus
gadgets until late 2015 when it releases
the final build of Android M now that
typically happens near the end of
October so
we still have a few more months before
the rumored phones get an official
unveiling we've already seen quite a few
images of the iphone 6s but we believe
this is one of our first look at the
rumored iPhone 6s plus the larger of the
new phones apple is planned for release
sometime this fall so the photos you
seeing on screen were recently published
by future supplier which says that the
rear housing of the iphone 6s plus is
stronger than last year's model that
might help with the bending issues which
was a perceived problem when Apple
released its new iPhone last year future
supplier says another big change
includes two new screw holes that may
point to a new speaker module maybe
we'll get better speakers this year too
we expect apple to largely keep the same
industrial design for the iPhone 6s and
iPhone 6s plus as it has in a password
it's s iterations but I guess we'll have
to wait until September to find out more
about Apple's new phones let me stop
talking about rumors for a second and
thank our friends over at Harry's
shaving can be quite expensive nowadays
but fortunately our friends over at
Harry's can hook you up with premium
razors at non premium prices their
starter kit starts to just fifteen
dollars and that includes the razor
three blades and your choice of Harry
shave cream or foaming gel I personally
like the gel it feels nice on my face as
an added bonus you can get five dollars
off your first purchase by using the
code techno after using the code you can
also get an entire month of Shaving for
just ten dollars we've seen plenty of
leaf brenders and mock-ups of the galaxy
note 5 but not the device itself now we
may be getting a look at the actual
smartphone though its final design
remains hidden the new image obtained by
samsung mania claims to show a galaxy
note5 test unit inside a protective
black shell the leaked picture doesn't
reveal much but we do see that the
device is running Android lollipop we
already have a pretty decent idea what
to expect from samsung's new phablet
thanks to earlier lakes the galaxy note
5 will allegedly pack a 5.7 inch qhd
display along with Samsung's own exito
7422 processor and 4 gigabytes of RAM
the design should look pretty similar to
the galaxy s6 would plenty of glass and
metal rumor has it that Samsung will
unveil the galaxy note 5 next month at
an event set for August 12 we're also
expecting the galaxy s6 edge+ you arrive
at the same time giving customers a
choice between a regular phablet and a
curve edge alternative anyways that's it
