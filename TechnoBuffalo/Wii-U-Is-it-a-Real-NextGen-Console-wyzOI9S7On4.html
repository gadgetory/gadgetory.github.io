to you by lynda.com what's up everyone
welcome back their pursuit of Retton
jazz riffs
I'm arrest John rendered I got myself
some new surroundings to talk about
Nintendo more specifically the Wii U and
perception of the Wii U as whether it's
a current gen console a last gen console
a sort of in-between console and all
kinds of Nintendo business that's been
going on in mine hole this ret endures
rest it's going to get started so the
impetus behind this video comes from
social media there's been a huge outcry
tintin those supporters screaming their
heads off as people at social media tend
to do that the Wii U deserves more love
and should get all kinds of crazy
respect as a current gen console and I'm
not sure in all honesty where I fall on
that if you look at the history of the
Wii U came out about a year ago it had
about a year head start on the current
gen consoles Xbox one and the ps4 and
from a purely spectin point was about on
par the graphic prowess of the Xbox 360
and the ps3 so the question I want to
sort of ask you guys is why do you feel
the Nintendo Wii U's not getting
affected deserves and you think it
should deserve any respect at all in the
pantheon of consoles so first I love
Nintendo I always had Nintendo consoles
up until the xbox360 generation which
was the Gamecube a sort of when I
started to veer away from Nintendo I
still say Nintendo makes the best first
party titles of any not only console
manufacturer but sort of game developer
at all Nintendo's games are incredible
the mario Zelda's the Donkey Kong's are
still fun and exciting to play Super
Mario 3d World is being hailed as one of
the best games of the year
you've got Mario Kart coming out very
soon I've got Hyrule warriors a new
Zelda game coming you've got HD versions
of previous Elder games there's a lot of
really good games available on the Wii U
but it's not really being considered as
sort of the go to constant looking to
buy something you walk into a store you
see the PlayStation 4 you see the Xbox
one and the Wii U certainly do we use
cheaper at 249 bucks but why would
somebody pick that up and that's sort of
the big question so who's going to buy a
Nintendo
we you so first now having kids
I really really appreciate the gamepad
my wife always wants to watch something
else on TV I don't want my son watching
television while I'm playing the game or
she wants us to watch something else
records or just play quietly in a corner
that I'm gonna sit in front of a TV
Nintendo absolutely nailed to remote
play that's one big reason to consider
that we you now Sony offers something
similar with the PlayStation 4 we have
to also purchase playstation vita oh
that does work about on par with what
the Wii U's done but the gamepad
controller does come bundled with the
Wii whew get that right out of the box
and extra hardware required certainly
that is a really big one I can't serve
over a state how important that is if
you live in a 1dv household you're
always fighting of what to watch this
sort of solves that if you want to play
your Mario in bed late at night I got to
protect it to Wi-Fi and you can play and
sir get full access that's all your game
so that is a huge reason to consider the
Wii U there's still a bit of nostalgia
that goes in Finn Tendo console of us
always remember playing you know the
original Super Mario Brothers Mario
Brothers - Mario Brothers 3 and sir
fighting with my sister when the Super
Nintendo came out to play Street Fighter
2 so I sort of always have that soft
spot in my heart for Nintendo but that
soft spot so it only gets you so much
goodwill so I think the big sort of
division we see the gamers right now it
was that considered themselves hardcore
gamers will call them for the call of
duty crowd the battlefield crowd it was
it like sort of more I just considered
casual platformer type games I like
you'd see on Nintendo so there really
isn't much of a middle ground for those
consoles Nintendo I think when the Wii U
first came out was making a big push to
try and make that console it sort of had
everything you could get your Mario you
can get your Zelda but you could also
get your you know call it duty your
zombiu games going on you could sort of
have everything you wanted on this
console which finally had HD graphics
but developers sort of started to see
the sales lag a little bit and start to
move towards either not developing for
the Wii U or stopping to create
downloadable content for the Wii U
removing their efforts to the Microsoft
and Sony Worlds and through hard
proposition to go and purchase a console
when you want the best of absolutely
everything he didn't really have that
options I think Microsoft and Sony have
tried sort of fill in that casual gamers
you've got games like a little big
planet out there a ton of games that you
can use it Kinect for that sort of fill
that gap but no-one's done it as well as
a Nintendo I think what you have with a
lot of gamers is a to console household
either have
and Xbox one or PlayStation 4 or last
gen Xbox 360 or ps3 and you have
intended we're a V and you have Nintendo
Wii U the question is is the Wii U
current gen I don't know the answer to
that if you're going just by dates then
yeah it is current gen cos you know it
came out in the same generation of
consoles despite having your head start
of the Xbox one and the ps4 graphic wide
spec was of course it's certainly not up
to the performance standards of those
two flagship but it still has a lot of
great titles and more coming Hyrule
warriors looks absolutely awesome new
Zelda games new Mario's the themes are
just come in left and right of course I
can't forget about my sweet baby Mario
Kart but those games stuff the tempo
it's really forced people to buy those
consoles I don't know let me take a

I want to know what you guys think if
