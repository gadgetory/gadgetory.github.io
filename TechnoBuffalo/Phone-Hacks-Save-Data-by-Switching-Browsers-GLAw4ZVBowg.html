TechnoBuffalo here I want to continue my
tour of going to more detail on some of
the apps I've got on my phone in this
video I want to talk about one of the
best browsers that you should be using
this is Opera Mini so let me walk you
through the UI and chasing the cool
things that it can do so you guys really
simple this is the main screen you're
gonna be entre speed-dials essentially
you can put all of your bookmarks here
it's kind of a fun way to save bookmarks
go to the left you get your history
let's go to the right you kind of get a
newsfeed you can customize what's going
to show up here so you can go ahead and
hit the discover button and you can pick
what you're into and what region you
live in and I'll sort of curate a whole
bunch of news for you a cool way to sort
of view what's happening in the world
but the main reason that I like opera is
for this right here this is for opera
turbo I'm on a 10 gig data plan that
share with my wife we can go through
data quite quickly and Opera Mini has
got something called opera turbo built
in which is going to strip out some of
the excess information on a website and
streamline the experience and also in
turn save you just a butt ton of data
and if like me you also watch a lot of
video it's got something called video
boost built in which is gonna scale down
the video a little bit reduce your
overall buffer times but also reduce the
amount of data that you're using so if
you're on data conscious plan this is an
incredible browser to be checking out
some things are new here though this
last time we took a look at opera
meeting you now have full themes here so
you can go ahead and jump into night
mode of course but you can change things
but your one you'd like let's say you
want to go that one looks a little done
and now you can theme your browser
another reason that I like to use this
is it's completely cross-platform so if
you use an Android device for example so
here I've got a galaxy s6 edge you're
gonna get the same experience login
nothing's gonna look similar
informations all gonna be there and of
course you're also going to get for
turbo again if you're on a data
sensitive plan and I don't want to leave
out the Windows Phone fans at least now
it just can be called Windows once
Windows 10 hits because there's also a
version for you guys so jump in here on
Windows Phone there's opera and it's
gonna look familiar you can get all the
access to all that stuff that you need
including what I think the killer
feature is opera turbo so if you're
looking for a browser it's gonna save
you a lot of data and your give yourself
a challenge try using this for a day and
see how much data you're saving it is
daggering how much dad has been wasted
just browsing websites give it a shot
you will not be disappointed I should
also mention that these are all free
across all the platforms as well so
won't cost you a cent and of course
being a browser you can certainly do all
the browser essential things that you'd
want to do including a private mode and
just normal web browsing like
TechnoBuffalo comm for example you know
guys ii food in a series of getting to
more detail on the apps that I've got on
my phone if you want to see anything
else in particular let me know down in
the comments until next time I am John
