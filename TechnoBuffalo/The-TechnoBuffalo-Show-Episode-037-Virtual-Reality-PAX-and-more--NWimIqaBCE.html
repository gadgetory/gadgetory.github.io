TechnoBuffalo show I'm love your to
house for divination on the
editor-in-chief the site and I am joined
by a long missing member of the team
executive editor of gaming joey davidson
hello it's been what 17 years since my
last yes so I don't know I got a broken
desk chair Sean as you know and it is
just let us say this is this is what you
missed Lyndon reserves listening to the
audio show he's just rocking back and
forth it's a lot more than that okay
well for those that have thought you
were dead you know or not no no
unfortunately I guess yes I'm sure there
are some that wish you know I was dead
but uh sorry I'm still here but so it's
not an accepted charm sorry Todd is on
his way back from Mobile World Congress
after a flight delay it well just before
we jump into everything shall we talk
about the TechnoBuffalo travel that
makes for the past week yeah it's been
pretty bad man um it's just just between
Todd and I and and what's really been
killing me is like we have 10 inches of
snow if I supposed to move in tonight
it's 10 inches of snow man yeah taller
that a baby if babies where I don't know
it's a weird thing parents here would
you get rid of what's my dog I got
stopped in irvine from even leaving
because Dallas had like a half inch of
snow yeah watch out yeah we got a half
inch of snow on the ground yeah and I
was stuck there until monday afternoon
who I was supposed to fly out saturday
morning well I got I got everything all
fixed i knew that i'm going to pax east
up in Boston so that's that's everything
is fixed we're still tending the show we
got our freelancer he's going to where
we're good to go it was just this
morning was me talking to jetblue like a
chart you try to be so polite in those
situations but at the same time I'm kind
of like I know you didn't do this to me
but I gotta take it out on somebody
dad well when American canceled my
flight they their whole time was so long
they were like we'll give you an auto
call back so I'm it was like in more
than two hours I was like how great I I
laid down I was just like I'm just gonna
rest in whatever I fell asleep one would
be in the morning they finally called me
back and they expect me to be coherent
enough to tell them yeah that flight the
choice it sounds great Yeah right it
totally lines up with everything i have
scheduled I don't know at least Hilton
had some soothing calypso music for me
to listen to you oh good grief so yeah
tectum of those having a great time with
travel what's it like we really have but
so you brought up pack see so we
actually have a question here from
social Mahal and regards to that ok Joey
could you explain what packs exactly is
and what is and what is it like for
those who have not gone there um well
okay that so PAX East is actually my
favorite convention but that that's
partially in part because I love the
city of Boston it's one of my favorite
cities in the world it's a really cool
city it's just old and it's clean and
everyone there is really nice pax let's
see it's the penny arcade expo if you
ever heard of Penny Arcade the webcomic
those guys gained such a following that
they were able to put on convention
started with pax prime and out in
Seattle that is their major convention
and then they start at PAX East after
that we've been fortunate enough to go
every single year um for someone who's
never been before if if you have any
experience with gaming or comic
conventions it's very similar to those
it's just gaming focus which is really
neat if you've never been to one it's
like a giant nerd festival where people
dress and silly clothes and you just go
in and play games they have a whole
section i love this of i don't know if
you're familiar with like tabletop games
i know you are Shawn like warhammer and
like us I'm talking about the crab where
you buy the models that you hand paint
yourself like those they have executive
edition tabletop game tables that cost
anywhere from 10 to 15 grand they are
crazy I just like to walk through that
section and think like man
I am a nerd but this is just I don't
know if I can handle this I I had a very
brief dance with warhammer knock then
realized it was going to put me in the
poor house yeah and I like I got out of
it you joke you know but there are
people who like take out second
mortgages and stuff just to stay into
that game that's cried that's correct i
just like collecting pokemon man i don't
know about well of course you know as
you know I go to England every year for
vacation and I see Games Workshop stores
everywhere right and he only ever see
like one or two people in them but one
day I saw one in a mall and there were
two teenage girls that were taking
painting lessons and I was like you
can't hey that's not a demographic that
I'm used to seeing with warhammer yeah I
need more power tool oh absolutely well
I was going to the club and those games
are really cool it's just you got to be
committed Oh hugely committed it's
amazing so it's not just video games
then four packs it's a mixture of gaming
yeah it's it's well it's it's gaming
board gaming card gaming I mean I've
gone and I've learned how to play really
weird card games which is cool to like
but this is kind of getting a little bit
personal i guess but like my my friends
my family i know you know that Sean we
have a family gaming night and it's not
like it's not like me and my mom and my
dad it's like myself and like art 10 or
so couples just come over and we drink
and we play games and so I have brought
games back from pax that we've all
played and kind of laughed about which
is pretty cool too so who currently has
the statue the other it is in actually
first-time winner we have been playing
we have a statue that goes around and
the rule is that you have to add one
piece of decoration to it without
removing any and there is a girl in our
group who never wanted she's like the
only person that hasn't wanted over the
course of like a year and a half and she
finally did so obviously we all accused
you're cheating but whatever it's going
to come back with a spectacular new
decoration if it does not gonna be
pissed I I particularly
of the googly eyes but so yes Joey will
be at PAX East all this weekend he'll be
bringing us coverage along with a
freelancer that he's taken with him
named mike white mm-hmm so you you've
never seen that name on the site but you
you will see it this weekend and it's
always amazing how much coverage it's
not really about them the major you know
the Triple A titles it this out more
about the Indies and that that's the
reason I like it because you're talking
about things that normally we wouldn't
hear about right and what they do for
fan conventions like this the big the
big publishers like Ubisoft ur da they
just send their game out with with demo
drivers like they don't send any any
big-name developers they don't send any
any like actual people of influence over
the game they just send people they
basically send tour guides um so you
don't really glean any huge information
from the games like you wouldn't need
three so that's why I'm more interested
in the indie stuff of pax you actually
go and you talk to the like two or three
people who are making the game and
they're the people that paid for the
booth and they're the people that said
it all out it's pretty cool well I I
know actually Todd messaged me this
morning because he had a message for you
and I just heard I'd save it for here
new HTC virtual reality helmet will be
at pax and we will at the steam booth
just can't odd get us an appointment I i
will ask todd todd is now finally in the
air but i will talk with him and he but
he just wanted you to at least know
who's going to be there and that should
be a demo unit that you can try out what
what a Segway Sean I know because of
course I see why I didn't tell you
before the show I do that leads us into
our second subject this burgeoning
virtual reality market that I'm not sure
its burgeoning for the consumers but
it's definitely burgeoning for the
companies that want to make these
helmets I am I am genuinely nervous
about where virtual reality is going
that's not because I'm not a believer
and I think it's cool tech or whatever
that's fine it's it's that I I think
that right now we're getting
too much in the way of options if if you
were alive in the 80s then you saw the
console crash right before the nintendo
entertainment system became like the
console you had like five or six
different platforms like everyone was
making consoles Kaliko magnavox atari
like who made the ah cheese there was
the intellivision in television
colecovision the atari 2600 the magnavox
and you know panasonic i think was
making something animals I I had a
colleague oh so but that which had a
very weird controller um so knobby thing
here is really good I can't see your
pass just me I don't know what you're
doing down there Oh Europe I'll be in my
hands my eyes are up here huh but but
because of all that diversity and
platforms consumers didn't know where to
turn and there weren't enough sales to
make any one platform successful so you
had all these companies putting all this
money into this tech and then it just
went nowhere in the gaming marketplace
collapsed on there was this fear that
home video gaming was done dead and the
Nintendo came up and you know what
happened next but I'm kind of afraid of
something very similar happening with
with virtual reality I mean right now we
have facebook in oculus doing their
thing project Morpheus and Stevie are
and the way that that steam is talking
about their virtual reality stuff is
that they're going to have partners so
it's not just going to be HTC that's
putting out steam VR it's going to be
every company that wants to get into it
just like the steam machines that's
scary to me I don't I you know I just
don't I don't think it's good news for
companies it might be good for consumers
the the cream of the crop will hopefully
float to the top but what it means in
the meantime I'm not sure now don't you
think though that possibly Morpheus has
the biggest leg up just because of the
installed user base of the PlayStation I
think that the issue with Morpheus is
going to be one hundred percent around
its pricing the way that you're going to
get the PlayStation consumers to buy it
two more pieces by putting it out for
cheap and I don't know if they could do
that
I think that the currently the the
headsets that have the biggest potential
for success or at least long-term
success would be the oculus and steam VR
and the only reason why I put those over
project Morpheus is because if virtual
reality is expensive the only people
willing to pay for it are going to be
your hyper enthusiasts game gamers you
know the people who are on pc i'm not
saying that no one's going to buy a
project Morpheus that's ridiculous i'm
sure people will buy it but it seems to
me that pc gamers are more willing to
spend money in order to get those types
of products and console gamers are there
more like to spend more money on their
platforms because they want the most out
of them whereas pcr playstation gamers
and xbox gamers are kind of work attempt
with what they have making sweeping
generalizations here I know that but I
just don't I think that the biggest
chance for success might be valve if
they can get it right price it right
then it could be huge yeah see for me
it's very much I have been burned so
many times over the years by her fields
for consoles going back to the power
glove yes I owned a power glove I I have
shame in my life me too buddy hire the
wrong okay I didn't have robbed I had
the ps2 hard drive which was pretty much
useless Wow yeah the Sega CD Drive I had
that but that was the only way you can
play off with a dolphin man yeah and
also what was alone in the dark that the
sorority oh yeah it was like that it was
like that killing the slasher game that
was filmed with live action and all that
yeah and start dana plato from different
strokes I didn't know that because you
know that's just knowledge that you have
but no I gave you talking about yeah the
game it came packed it with a sewer
shark yeah the nineties oh I know so I
mean I I have a long history being
burned by peripherals and so anymore
when one is announced I'm just I'm gonna
have to wait and see no
taking the wait-and-see attitude is
what's best for most consumers but you
also have to have the early adopters to
develop a successful platform no no I
will say this as someone who completely
hated the idea of 3d going in 3d
televisions and seeing where that's
wound up like I'm not saying like oh we
predicted this or whatever but it just
seems so very mission overly expensive
unappealing I don't feel the same way
about VR so and that's a grain of salt
in some anecdotal evidence there but i
think it's different I think it will be
successful I'm just not sure how
successful yeah yeah I and 3d television
is a great example because it's gone
nowhere 3d the thing about 3d that I
don't think a lot of people realize is
that it was designed as a gimmick to get
people into movie theaters it
smell-o-vision when when the television
set came out and started to be widely
popular in the 50s and 60s movie
theaters started experiencing a lot of
problem selling tickets that's when they
came out with all this ridiculous crap
and 3d was one of those things it is
non-essential to viewing media so for
those that are not familiar with the
history of cinema smell vision was a
real thing yeah and it was essentially
you were handed a scratch-and-sniff card
before the movie about your ticket and a
number would come up on the screen
telling you which block to scratch
during that scene sounds awesome in a
scene filled with roses and not so
awesome in a scene in the gutter so and
that's that was the problem that
filmmakers had plus people just weren't
buying into these ridiculous ideas of
immersion bedroom 3d was kind of
successful at the time but it's always
been a gimmick virtual reality add
something to the experience that I don't
3d ads and that's why I think it has
good chance there's a definite like whoa
feeling when you put on a headset how to
work i'm not sure but i think it's a lot
more appealing than 3d so yeah yeah i I
don't know I I'm definitely taking a
wait-and-see attitude I've said before
on the show that virtual reality is just
not that intriguing to me at this time
I'm going to have to see something
really
tak really done with it before I'm on
board I'll tell you this if I was a fan
of Survivor horror games which I'm a big
baby and I can't handle them eyes would
be first in line for virtual reality
first in line if you consider like alien
isolation with a VR helmet oh my god I
see I i I'm weird when it comes to
survival horror it doesn't frighten me
it doesn't frighten me enough uh no
can't handle it mm-hmm well he's but see
this is one of those situations where it
comes for I grew up around the costume
industry I by the age of 11 I knew how
to make bullet holes in people's
foreheads oh hi hung out at like age 10
with the guys who did the special
effects for poltergeists and we like
talked in detail about how they did
certain certain shots yes i did i get i
get i totally get the fact that you like
if peeked behind the curtain so to speak
yeah exit if we take a lot to make me
jump it's just it's it's nothing i'm not
scared it by horror films or whatever
but but nothing gets me quite like a
really well done first person survival
for a game it just kidding man do you
remember the first resident evil the
infamous like early hallway with the
dogs yeah when they blast through the
window and yeah we had that in the store
when i had the comic store we headed in
for rental and we would let people you
know try out games right i saw more
people jump at that dog crap ish yeah
yeah that was some scary stuff and you
will get it now and you're like huh who
is scared by this yeah but no you have a
good point I game like alien isolation
done with VR could be really interesting
it could be to be absolutely terrifying
and I will never play it but it could be
good you know I'll take that review off
your hands Oh enjoy well we got a lot of
gaming questions coming in so let's jump
into a few of them here we've got one
from Matthew loogie bow I am sorry if I
mispronounced your last name do you
think valve is the key to the success of
the platform I assume he means
free of you or to a steam vr um valve in
some way shape or form has to be there I
think I don't know if they necessarily
needed to do a steam vr but they needed
to support virtual reality in general
with with with the steam marketplace
they need to make a push for it in order
for it to be successful and whether that
means advertising in on the home page
when you go in or putting on special
sales just for VR capable games with
oculus rift or steam PR moving forward
part of the big buy-in i think is going
to be the showcasing of the games i mean
it's always always always been the case
software sales hardware when it comes
down to mass consumer appeal unless you
have killer software your hardware
life-size our life span isn't going to
be quite as long as if you have nothing
to show and it's that promise of
exclusive content that keeps people
coming it's part of the reason why I
think the PlayStation 4 is doing so well
people know that that stuff like
uncharted 4 is coming it's the same
thing for for virtual reality and I
think Val and steam are going to be huge
in that do I think they necessarily need
to do their own steam VR thing maybe
that's negligible but I do think that
they're going to be a big key player
whether or not it fails or succeeds now
here's a question that i will go hide
under my desk while you answer it from
the game guy which is better a gaming pc
or an xbox one I'll be over here under
my desk no it's it's an easy question
answer uh in terms of sheer specs and
specific statistics it's it's your
gaming PC you're going to have more
games more force power available on that
platform than anything else that's ever
going to be out ever but it boils down
to what type of person you are how you
want to game how much money you have if
you if you like things to be really
convenient gaming on an xbox one whether
you like or don't like the content is
really easy it's just booting it up and
going like there's there's there's no
owning a PC process and I know that that
for people who listen to this podcast
hearing that gaming on a PC is hard is
kind of a ridiculous statement that's
because you guys are all
tech users you all know how to do this
stuff but for someone like my dad if I
hit him an xbox with just a controller
he can go he knows what to do I sent my
dad in front of steam he's gonna be like
no I did you know what's going on right
now so there's that but the answer is
it's it's pc game pc gaming is better as
a platform than anything else but that's
only if you meet the needs of very
specific people if you love halo to
death or Gears of War or the xbox
exclusives that's the way you have to go
my answer doesn't change it's always the
same it's all to personal preference yes
I mean I even though I could i I've done
pc gaming in the past i prefer consoles
because i just like to pick up and go
aspect I don't have time for especially
I came from a period of pc gaming where
once a year you had to buy a new sound
card right or you had to understand unix
just to get a game running yeah yeah I
know so steam machines are looking to
solve that problem and steamos is
looking to solve that problem if that
comes around and there actually is easy
to use and inexpensive as valve is
hoping I think that they could be the
the big answer so yeah I tend to agree
with you I I'm very very intrigued by
the steam pcs hmm they're the steam
machines excuse me yeah me too but this
leads us into another interesting
question a topic I wanted to touch on
with you from Sasha Mahal what do you
guys think of the newly announced Nvidia
shield console I Sean can attest I have
I like Nvidia as a company I think
they're great but I have been a naysayer
of the original shield ever since it was
announced I think we joke about it but
like the guys came back from CES when it
was showed off and they wanted to make
it their thing of show and I'm just
going I don't see the the value of this
thing not that it's a bad platform with
that it's really niche I feel the same
way about the new shield console it's
really mesh you can you can do the same
thing for for cheaper with the new steam
link that they announced which is to
stream games in your own network
um and the whole idea of Android micro
consoles has been toyed around with with
oh yah which is a like a hundred dollars
cheaper get on it so wait where does
nvidia fit in here yeah well i think
about i think this is will make the
fourth android micro console because you
had the oya the amazon fire TV and the
nexus player there are more there are
other ones yeah I'm sure hey there's
been three major players okay and I've
used each one for maybe an hour each as
a console if Amazon can't get there is
to take off I you know there's people
don't want to play phone games on
televisions and I know that there's more
to it than that I know that the platform
has a lot more than that but when they
hear Android micro console that's all
they think I think steam link does what
you wanted to do for cheaper it's going
to get your Steam library broadcast on
to your TV with this little latency as
possible because it's an in-home network
especially if you wire it and that's
that for fifty bucks sounds much better
than two hundred dollars for the Nvidia
shield console maybe i'm wrong i don't
know i don't know it's interesting you
know and the fact that it's also
streaming platform although at this
point there are so many straining
platforms who can keep them all straight
yeah i mean i'll take a look at it but
i'm not i'm not expecting to have my
hair blown back I don't know streaming
streaming presents so many problems
latency among them I feel like the only
games right now that i'd be willing to
stream art would be like line by line
rpgs like that's about it i couldn't
could you imagine streaming like god of
war or something no like button presses
have to be instantaneous I just no
thanks yeah exactly from Simon Tucker
jumping for d3 Joey what do you think of
Bethesda holding a conference at e3
think we'll finally see the reveal of
fallout 4 I hope so I don't know the
the day that they're holding a
confidence means that they're going to
have an hour worth of content and it
depends on how they're going to handle
this when I went to see Skyrim when it
was first presented at e3 and added
behind closed doors thing it was like a
45 minute showing so yes hypothetically
Bethesda could walk out with only one
game like fallout 4 and show it to us
for an hour and I'm sure some people
would be really jammed up about that but
just the fact that it's it's it's a
longer show and that they're holding
their own for the very first time tells
me that it's going to be something big
fallout 4 I don't know I wouldn't be
surprised if we see a new do maybe and
you fall out there goes my chair you
know maybe a new fallout ah I hope
Dishonored 2 I would put money on
dishonor to showing up maybe even a new
Elder Scrolls but who knows all i knows
the last thing III need was another
press conference that day we're going to
and here we go i know ron and i will be
on skype maybe with eric depending on
where Eric is working from and oh that's
such a fun day at least there's food
trucks for me that's well I'm glad
somebody has a food truck oh good grief
well we have a lot of questions here let
me quickly uh well we've kind of already
touched on this one with your series of
posts about the most anticipated games
of the year but from Sasha by Paul hey
Joey what games are you looking forward
to playing from now until the end of
2015 do you hear my side yes I did it's
a really big year for video games I if
you kind of saw it 2014 is kind of a
Down spell this is this is like the
opposite of that we're in a bunch of
hosts one post for each platform
dedicated to games coming up and there's
a lot of them personally what's huge on
my radar I mean right now I'm thinking a
lot about Metal Gear but that's just
because the release date was just
announced and Zelda always I don't had
on Asajj this is a ridiculous
question man my god you gotta understand
that like I am like knee deep in this
stuff all day every day like I all the
games are on my radar I don't know that
right now it's metal gear but that's
only because of all the news was I love
metal gears towards the end of just so
people get an idea i think it was like
it's usually like towards the end of
July early August you present me with
the fall review spreadsheet yeah and you
know which author is going to cover
which story you know and all that and
last year's list was I think 15 16 games
you know I I fear what this year's this
is going to be well luckily they seem to
be spreading things out margin is gonna
be big month but then we have stuff like
that man coming up in June so at least
there's that and Batman's another one
dunno this is what I mean like I could
sit here and i'll be thinking like okay
I'm done talking about so you just
thought if the witcher like the
witcher's another huge game this year I
just there's a bajillion games coming
out I I am unreasonably excited for
Batman I think that's fair i think the
fact that a picked up a mature warning
has gotten me more excited than anything
else i love the way arkham city was
handled and I loved out dark at got and
I think that going 14 to mature
hopefully means something else more
insane is gonna happen and adding the
bat will be old to me is huge I'm wary
of that I like the Batmobile obviously
but I don't want it to ruin the court
with gameplay that makes Arkham so good
Tom I know but I'm anxious for that one
so in short a bunch of games all the
games all the games i want all the games
and luckily that's something we get to
do around here yes changing gears for
just a second from Simon Tucker Sean
which I have never seen anyone's try
spelled my name I know it's a real
spelling but I've never seen anyone used
in a reference to me he spelled to sha
un what do you think of the pebble time
and pebble time steel I got the early
bird
for the standard model but I know you
wear your pebble regularly yes I do I'm
sticking with just the standard pebble
time I the steel looks really nice but
it's not worth the extra money to me for
me it's more about the functionality
than the the looks of the device so I'm
fine was sticking with the basic pebble
and watching Joey try to find a happy
place with this chance tears awful man
I'm sorry just negotiate hear it you
need to head the staples after the
shepherd by not a learner one I ordered
one so yeah I'm just sticking with the
basic pebble pebble time excuse me
double time I just want to watch the
tells time man that's all I know I'm
like a big jerk ah you're a horrible
jerk but for so many reasons other than
what you think about the pebble time uh
just okay from Sarang Shaw do you think
lego batman three is worth buying as a
good TBT game I I guess
throwbackthursday game I know I'm like a
year late but I've seen prices drop to
around ten pounds recently which is
relatively cheap tebow I don't know what
tvt means in this I I don't either bet
lego batman three at ten pounds of the
lego games always have a bajillion of
hours and hours and hours of content but
you just have to understand that the
light of games are pretty simplistic if
you are really familiar with the series
that they happen to be playing with with
the game you're going to love it there's
a lot of in jokes for for die-hard fans
and legobatman 3 is probably the best of
the lego batman trilogy so the the deal
study for arrow for the latest game
Gotham I I watched a let's play a bit
the dlc with arrow was almost enough to
get me to buy the game just to listen to
Stephen Amell god you're such a nerd
Sean I oh no you it was hilarious of the
dlc it's not the 00 Stephen Amell voices
like angels singing but no he's just
freaking hilarious
uh moving over to mobile and general
here first a question from an ab 9900 do
you think Apple be doing something
special on march nine something that is
not on the rumors that is a good
question where we stand right now that
mean we know they're going to talk about
the Apple watch but we already know 75%
about the Apple watch so why hold an
event for it so you have to think
there's something else in the mix we
just don't know what it is yet of course
we've been hearing the rumors of the 12
inch retina MacBook Air and there's also
the endless rumors of the ipad pro so I
think there's gonna be something else we
just don't know exactly what it is yet
and of course we'll be covering
everything that happens on Monday you
will yes yes Oh fine and from sasha hall
going back to vr for a moment what do
you guys think of the HTC vibe which is
a partnership between HTC and valve
hopefully Joey gets strike this weekend
then we can talk about it more
specifically yeah yeah it's interesting
HTC jumped in this that's not the first
company I would have thought of no I you
know I for some reason mentally I would
have put Samsung in before HTC I have no
idea why there's no I have no idea maybe
because Samsung has dabbled in an
entertainment tech before it has HTC
ever made anything like this not like
the snow and Samsung has its own VR
headset the works with its phones well
that's right they do cod there's too
many stupid headsets yeah I know man I
agree with you a hundred percent I think
that is going to be one of the most
difficult thing is there's too many
headsets into many different platforms
yeah this actually plays back to a
question that came in earlier for
Matthew lagiglia lime I have no idea
what I'm saying on his last name it also
the most stylish of the VR headsets
project Morpheus I i would say Morpheus
it if style man
matters to you I I think you like the
problem with like the oculus and the
Samsung headsets is it's too much
forward wait you you feel like your
heads going to tip forward and more
pious looks like it's a little bit
closer to the head and probably a better
center of gravity I just think it looks
cool I mean it just looks it looks kind
of neat I think it's the only one that's
been designed with like aesthetically
pleasing edges so far all the other ones
kind of been like this is totally it a
prototype here we go now here here's a
giant question from Sasha Mahal what do
you guys think is the future of a gaming
especially in the next five or so years
oh uh you know there was a lot of
discussion five years ago about how the
xbox 360 and playstation 3 and we were
where the end of console gaming as we
knew it I think the ps4 and xbox one
especially and even even the way you
have have all kind of proven that
sentiment wrong five years from now
we're still gonna be playing games on
these platforms I would imagine that
they're going to look even better than
they do now just because that's what
comes with time on these machines and
we're gonna see peripherals like VR
elements as for how successful things
are going to be I'm not sure I do know
that the PlayStation 4 is selling at a
stunning rate and I imagine it's going
to keep that for a while they're already
at 20 million console and that's
borderline stupid well yeah I told you
recently I I was a huge playstation
playstation 2 theme for whatever reason
playstation 3 did not really speak to me
iike i went to the 360 during that
generation and I find myself now
gravitating back to Sony this generation
I really liked the ps4 with the
exception of the controller I'm sorry
i'm not a fan of the DualShock oh you're
doing this I i prefer the xbox
controller but it's personal preference
man exactly but in general i do find
myself going back to sony this
generation and
I'm enjoying the experience you know and
that to me says a lot and that kind I
think ps3 lost some people and I think
they came back for the ps4 whoa
playstation 3 1 of being the
best-selling console the general
generation excuse me I think part of
that is because the over the lifespan of
the PlayStation 3 if you look at the
launch playstation 3 its lineup compared
to what we had at the very end it's it's
crazy what changed on that platform and
I think it got really really like the
last three years were exceptional so I
think that's pretty cool but I imagine
the same the same course of action for
these new consoles now I'm not sure
which one's going to come out ahead but
the consoles are going to do well and I
see a lot of growth in pc gaming I think
I saw someone recently say that by 2018
or something pc gaming is going to be
worth 35 billion dollars um that's on us
our money haha but I mean it's it's you
know it's for a good reason the only
thing that I hope goes away between now
and then is the stupid current mobile
version of free-to-play that we have and
i'm not talking about Crossy Road which
i think is success right now but I'm
talking about the games that go after
the whales the people that are willing
to spend hundreds and hundreds of
dollars on the single-game those need to
go away and I hope they do by within
five years so I i think i think at some
point those are gonna have to die off
it's going to have to become a one-time
fee you know like i am thrilled that i
spent money on threes at your
recommendation does one of the most
engaging games I have on my iPad and I
play it probably more than anything else
mhm you know and I paid one time for it
I love that and never never have to
think about oh I have to wait an hour
now or I could buy a heart oh yeah that
drives me nuts if if developers can get
out of their own way and realize that if
it depends on the type of game that
you're making if a game is built to be
played for free you should make it free
to play without any all
and then just give those people who want
to customize their game or operate at
the option to do so with money but if
you're game like threes there's no
customization in threes the only way you
can make it free to play is if if you
install the timer like you're talking
about that it's necessary so I just hate
I just hate that drives me nuts it's
angry uh I I do not disagree with you uh
let me look here real quick we've got
bunch of questions we're not going to be
able to get to the mall and I apologize
for that but we do thank you all for
asking all of these mmm quick mobile
question with Mobile World Congress
winding down from Nicholas Carter what's
the difference between HTC One m8 and m9
a better processor different back camera
they got rid of the ultra pixel on the
back and moved it to the front and just
one with a standard 20 megapixel camera
on the back yeah HTC Sense 7 better
theming please go to our YouTube channel
and check out Todd's hands on it he
really covers everything that's
different about the the two devices and
it looks like a great phone to do oh
here's an interesting question from an
Ave 9900 do you think apple is good at
hiding all those secrets does it work
for you guys or you like everything told
before with some companies and I won't
say which ones because they may not want
this known we do get materials 24-48
hours before an event that's awesome
because it allows us to prepare we get
our post written we're able to go out
right when they say they can which is
called an embargo for those that aren't
familiar with that terminology and
that's great and it does create this
awkward 24 hours where we still have to
talk like we don't know but uh in
general we do prefer that Apple doesn't
provide us with the thing not a word now
it does that have a much in gaming is
there any company
like Apple and gaming where they don't
tell you anything um maybe valve would
be close but a lot of their releases
just seem to come up out of nowhere but
it's all in who you know I guess there's
no company quite like Apple with that
stuff but then again there's no company
that has leaks play like Ali there so
yeah I will say you get much more
amusing press releases embargo letters
than we do yes I do what was the saints
row 4 review letter I haven't done at us
laughing for like an hour yeah I don't
know that's that's the the PR team
behind that game is there they are
ridiculous I mean like there was a giant
ASCII middle finger at the bottom of the
letter I was just like I don't know it
is guys are crazy yeah oh it's more fun
than you know Mobile is very very dry
yes yeah no I unfortunately you know it
varies by company but apple doesn't
provide us with a word of what to expect
before an event hey for all we know
they're just going to come out on stage
and go hi we just haven't talked to you
all for a while how you doing everyone
love that I love that so much Tim Cook
just comes out stage hi I'm just real
only five hang out with some friends oh
lordy a quick question here from the
three two one show hi do you have any
tips for tech youtubers like moi
actually Jon did a series on advice for
tech youtubers like a year year and a
half ago you can find them on the
YouTube channel that is probably going
to teach you far more than Joey or I
could teach you on this show correct I'm
a writer so I don't have but but in
general just make sure you have a decent
camera good lighting work on your
presentation I I've not seen anything
you've done so I'm not saying that you
have bad presentation I'm just speaking
in general terms but just you know make
sure you speak clearly get your thoughts
together and go for it
I my urea step ahead of the game I would
never start a YouTube channel I couldn't
take the endless stream of hammering
that John takes I don't know how that
man has grown that thick of the skin but
uh good luck to you and be ready for the
comments and we'll wrap this up with one
more VR question from Sasha Baja Wendy
when do you think the consumer version
of the oculus rift will come out that is
a great question because they've given
us no indication fall or spring of next
year they think South excuse me I don't
know no I have no idea I'm just I'm just
throwing that out there because that's
when all the other competition is coming
out the thing about oculus that makes
that interesting now is that since
Facebook is tied to it we have no idea
no idea I wonder if they're waiting on
facebook to come up with some user and
software I have no idea you know before
I would have made a guess at at this
this year but now that Facebook's
involved it don't know uh here's my
answer is one last question from
Nicholas Carter intelr AMD um I'm
assuming he means when you're building a
computer hey I'm div of course well i
mean it's its price versus Power I guess
there's no doubt that Intel's processors
are better but I also think that they're
much more expensive if you're if you're
willing to pay that that difference you
will probably get a better processor
they just seem to run more efficiently
AMD offers similar solutions for a
cheaper price I think unless you're a
power user if you're looking to get the
most bang for your buck maybe AMD but
until if you have the money they make
really exceptional products I have an
AMD processor in my machine and I'm up
on four and a half years on this
computer now I mean it's only now
starting to slow down a little bit when
it comes to playing games whatever else
but that's also my graphics card
everything else so but yeah I don't know
it depends on how much money you have
and all that jazz both have their pluses
and minuses though so there you go well
that is going to do it for this week we
thank you all for joining us and we glad
Joey was able to finally join us on
