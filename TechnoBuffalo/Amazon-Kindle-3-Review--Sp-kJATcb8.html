TechnoBuffalo here with a full review of
the second follow-up to the e-reader
that started the e-reader craze this is
of course the Amazon Kindle 3 so the
first two Kindles while very useful and
quite revolutionary we're not what Utes
qualified as pretty in fact they were
ugly electronics they just didn't look
good they were cool to use sort of
having the e-reader thing was new but in
the world of nice looking electronic
slick design the Kindle was not keeping
pace the Kindle 3 really fixes that and
I'm proud to say it's actually a very
nice looking device let's take a look at
the aesthetics and then we'll run down
all the specs so this guy is quite thin
how thin you ask well let's turn it to
the side and bring in a mechanical
pencil you can see that this thing
really really really is quite thin from
a size standpoint it's 7.5 inches
diagonal by 4.8 inch diagonal by 0.33 5
inches and it weighs a minuscule 8.5
ounces so this one has a 6 inch diagonal
screen you can also get the Kindle DX to
the nine point seven inch screen this
version here is the Wi-Fi only a version
gonna say you back 140 dollars you can
kick in some 3G there as well and
everything will look exactly the same
but it's gonna add about an extra 50
bucks your purchase price bring you up
to a hundred and ninety dollars storage
wise it can store just about 3500 ebooks
battery life with the wireless off isn't
extremely impressive one month with the
wireless on it's going to be three weeks
can download books in the Kindle Store
which I'll show you guys in just about
60 seconds this now has native PDF
support which is really nice enough to
pay for it anymore you just email it to
your Kindle address of course says
tingle and Amazon's whisper sync which
sort of syncs up where you are on all of
your books so if you have a Kindle app
on your iPad or Kindle app on your
iPhone Android device I'll always know
right where you are
it's got text-to-speech will show you
speakers on the back in just a minute
and you can now look at content in
portrait and landscape view which is
quite nice of course really one of the
biggest sellers of the Kindle is its 6
inch e-ink display and he is what you're
looking at right here it's supposed to
look like well Inc but II one of the
downsides of reading a book on let's say
an iPad or another sort of LCD type
device is that they're usually Eastern
out of glare and it can have some
problems in direct sunlight I'm not so
with an e ink display it's also supposed
to reduce some of your eyestrain
alright so let's go ahead and run
through what the hardware looks like of
course you've got now a physical QWERTY
keyboard on the front because there on
the previous two versions but this time
it has been redesigned the keys are a
little bit raised they're still round
we've got a new navigation here on the
right it's a five way toggle so up down
left right and select now I have new
page forward and back buttons they're
sort of stuck into the side here and
they're not so large you're gonna
accidentally hit them while you're
holding it those are right on the border
and they have a nice clicky feel to it
the back is now made of a nice soft
touch almost a rubbery plastic feel it
really feels nice to hold in the hand
I've got two speakers up top and on the
bottom you've got your power and lock
switch you've got volume up and down
micro USB charging 3.5 millimeter
headset jack on the top you've got
nothing let's go ahead and kick the
device actually on here one of the other
downsides of the first two Kindle
devices when you wanted to turn a page
the page turn was extremely slow the
Kindle 3 has really fixed that as far as
page turned speed like go ahead open up
a book and show you I was reading let's
say freakanomics here take a second to
open up the book and I'll pull up right
where you work page turn is extremely
fast it's relatively close to almost
instantaneous soon as you push the
button content is almost already there
you don't have to wait now half a second
a second which doesn't seem like a lot
but when you're reading a lot of books
that certainly adds up especially if
you're looking at a couple hundred pages
so the speed increased
is really nice one of the other great
things about the kindle is of course the
kindle store which now has at last count
over five hundred and fifty thousand
books now you're probably saying why do
I need a Kindle when I can download the
Kindle app on a myriad of applications
and that's really what Amazon is
struggling with I picked up the Kindle
mostly because I was having some high
strain doing a lot of reading on the
iPad the devices I've been using for the
majority of my books also when I'm
outside in direct sunlight I was having
a lot of trouble reading it the Kindle
really uh alleviates that and for a
relatively inexpensive entry point one
hundred forty dollars serve a nice carry
on device the fact that it's so thin and
it's not gonna take up much space in my
bag so there are a few other new
features with the Kindle 3 as well let
me show you what those are it now has a
full webkit-based browser which you
might think is weird on an eating
display a web kit is just sort of an
open set of standards that the app will
use on the iPhone Google uses on Android
palm used on webOS so it makes it for a
very nice browser so I'm gonna go and
open up menu and it's still qualified as
experimental so we'll go and open up the
experimental section I'll zoom in sort
of off the keyboard a little bit more on
the screen you can see what some other
experimental sections are here you've
got the web browser play mp3s and
text-to-speech this actually read books
back to you in plain English let's go
ahead and launch the browser show you
what this looks like I don't know if you
really use this for much web browsing
you probably have a smartphone or
something in your pocket but it's kind
of cool that it does work I just wanted
to show you what it looked like let's go
ahead and launch a website so we'll open
up let's say it's go to enter URL let's
try TechnoBuffalo com it pulls up sort
of a web page looking top part there you
can see go to it back in front choose
your Wi-Fi strength and battery so I'll
type in TechnoBuffalo and the keyword is
really easy to type on now one of the
downsides of course of the Kindle and
the inks in general is that they are not
back button of course I type
TechnoBuffalo wrong on camera but I'm
gonna go and leave that in is that it's
not a backlit display so if you kind of
read this
in the dark you're gonna have a bit of
trouble let's try this one more time I
talked about how nice that keyboard is
get a little nervous sometimes on camera
good a TechnoBuffalo there we go dot-com
let's go ahead and check the low times
hit go to and see what this looks like
here if you saw the web browser on the
Kindle 2 you'll know it was a poor
excuse for a web browser pretty much
just pulled in text no support for
images or anything this actually looks
like a web site you can zoom in on text
and sort of read what you'd like you can
select your hyperlinks you can see that
box sort of shows up there with the
magnifying glass seen just zoom in on
the text that you're looking at really
works surprisingly well and see even has
a pop up there you might actually go to
use this as a web browser kinda neat
let's go ahead and jump back on home
primarily this is a ebook reader and
that's really where it succeeds my
biggest thing with the older Kindles was
you had to pay to get some PDF
functionality that wasn't even native I
really only had it on the larger Kindle
DX now that's fully supported here so I
was reading a JetBlue case and you go
ahead and open that up penny okay real
it opens up a PDF one of the things I
like to as well is that you can view
content now in landscape or portrait
I'll go ahead and hit the button right
down here that literally changed the
font size I'm gonna get the option to
rotate the screen you can see it right
there so I can view it the pictures on
top images down below left right
orientation fit screen or zoom any way I
want the Kindle now just has increased
functionality now it's certainly not
meant to replace an iPad the iPad does a
ton of different things one of the
things that does do is happen to have
ebook functionality this is a dedicated
device adjustment for ebook reading and
a lot of you guys might be struggling
with why again why would I need a Kindle
when I have another companion device and
again the I strained it visibility to
view this in direct sunlight and sort of
the the easier to read this if you will
of the ink really makes us a nice value
proposition cope with the fact that it's
so light that it can hold so many books
it's very simple to use it's easy to use
I could
this to my grandparents for example and
they wouldn't know how to use it
downloads books very quick you've got
access to the Amazon store which I will
go ahead and show you right now the
Kindle Store so go ahead and hit menu
and we'll jump on over the store you can
see what that looks like
let's go ahead and shop in the Kindle
Store and one of the great things as
well about this you can download a
previews of books you get the first
chapter and see if something that you
want to read
you've got the Kindle Store you can view
New York Times Kindle top sellers and a
ton of other ways to sort your text
knowing what you're getting into if
you're looking for an e-book reader
that's adjust an e-book reader that's
thin and light is gonna last you for
many plane flights there really isn't
much of another choice now of than the
Kindle 3 the Nook is out there but it's
still considered last generation
compared with this version of the Kindle
few Sony devices as well so the only way
of getting into looking for an e-book
reader this is definitely a 5 star
advise through aperture size and for
functionality and now for speed
truly address all the concerns I had
with the previous generation not to
mention price so that guys sort of a
overview and review of the Amazon Kindle
3 kind of curious what you guys have to
say are you interested in an e-reader do

iPad or another device you read books on
