little iphone OS bug and I'm wondering
if I'm the only one so let me give you a
little bit of a back story before I go
to bed and I like to watch some YouTube
videos on my phone helps me relax and
sort of get me ready for sleep so often
times when i go through youtube on the
phone and I go through and I watch them
the videos load and sometimes when i get
to the last one on the list the videos
don't load if that doesn't even work at
all and i've had this problem ever since
the three-point o update and every sort
of subsequent upgrade since then has not
fixed a problem so i'm wondering if you
guys have as well let me show you
exactly what I'm talking about so here
is the last video on the list and this
is for a most viewed for today and it's
1 by Shaytards my wife beats me let's
say hey I want to watch that helps me
relax learnt about the skies
wife-beating click the video don't play
quick the video doesn't play the last
video on this list never plays the one
above it which is appropriately named
sex and the STD test if it hurts when
you pee that's probably a good test um
you know everything else plays no
problem it's just that last video for
the most of you today does not play you
guys having that trouble as well just
thought i would see if i was the only
one here um I gotta serve a more
substantial video coming a little later
I just had a question that I want to ask
and figure the best way to do it was to
ask you guys so video or text response
see you guys the next video bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
