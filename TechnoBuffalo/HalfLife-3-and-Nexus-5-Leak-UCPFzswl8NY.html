to you by Gamefly hello everybody and
welcome back to another episode of rumor
roundup the show where we get you up to
speed on all the wacky exciting and
generally awesome tech rumors that
happen every single day online Jon's off
still busy taking care of his brand-new
son with his lovely wife right now so
I'm still on rumor watch this week this
week we're talking half-life 3 a
potential TV push for Apple the Xperia Z
1 F and more Nexus 5 leaks
this is rim roundup let's get started
the Sony Xperia z1 is a gorgeous
gorgeous phone and now it looks like
it's getting a little brother the Xperia
z1 F was leaked in a brochure from a
major Japanese carrier and it looks like
a scaled-down version of the sleek z1
it's very similar to the z1 in a lot of
ways including a Snapdragon 800 chipset
2 gigs ram a camera with 20.7 megapixels
but there are a couple of differences
the z1 f seems to substitute the z1 s 5
inch 1080p screen to a downgraded 4.3
inch 720p screen it has new colors and a
smaller 2300 milliamp hour battery we
generally enjoyed the z1 here at the
office but for anybody looking for a
powerful phone in a smaller than 5 inch
device the z1 F is already looking
pretty damn good gamers everywhere this
week were really freaking excited after
hearing valve filed to trademark
half-life 3 in Europe November of next
year marks an entire decade since the
release of half-life 2 and actually 16
years since the first half-life
introduced us to dr. Gordon Freeman so
what is this trademark filing mean is
half-life 3 official not quite let's
just all hold our horses there has been
no filing here in the US so we're not
really sure what's happening over at
valve could it be that they're simply
protecting their IP until they decided
to make the game well that's probably
unlikely - they're probably secretly
working on the game and have been for a
while now so it's really only a matter
of time before valve decides to make it
official I'm predicting mid November
2015 as a launch
with an official announcement at e3 of
next year so put my money in the
internet betting pool everyone it's
October now and we all know what fall
means no not pumpkin spice everything
even though that's also true
it actually means new Android updates
and a new Nexus phone fortunately though
we do live in a time where leaks are
king and this week was no different for
the newest Nexus phone so another photo
of the device seems to have popped up
online showing us a very clear Nexus 5
look at the back of the device it does
look gorgeous I'll admit that much I
fear not up to speed on your next-gen
Nexus rumors it's supposedly made by LG
has a 1080p display snapdragon 800 2
gigs ram and an 8 megapixel camera the
Nexus 5 leaks have been fast and furious
lately and to me that suggests we'll be
hearing an official announcement very
very soon
yay and last on the docket this week
keen eyes notice that cable TV executive
jean-fran√ßois Boulais changed his
LinkedIn account to reflect his newest
position engineering director at none
other than Apple oh that's pretty
interesting especially considering an
Apple television set has been part of
the tech rumor mill for a while now
Alou is hiring may mean he's been tapped
to help develop an ITV but it can also
mean he simply been tapped to help
develop software that unifies Apple TV
iCloud and iOS devices into a single
ecosystem it is still a little bit
annoying that I can't rent something on
my Apple TV and then pick up watching it
on my iPad in another room later so I'm
personally hoping moulay will help
smooth out the rental process across
devices I know you can use iTunes to use
to get stuff across all of your devices
but when do you do that when you open
your computer and say I want to rent
something no you do it right through
your Apple TV so I want it through my
Apple TV and right into my iPad guys we
are right in the middle of the best
gaming season fall is a time for new
