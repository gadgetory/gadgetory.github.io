TechnoBuffalo here and you are looking
at a very crude angle of a ipad 2 on the
verizon network or at least it should be
on the verizon network from day one with
my verizon ipad 2 i have had connection
issues i thought this was going to be
just unique to my particular ipad 2
there have been many reports coming out
this is a widespread problem with
verizon ipad to customers i'm gonna go
ahead and show you what happens this is
not the case if you have an AT&amp;amp;T or if
you're outside of the US the gsm version
the ipad 2 just the CDMA variety when
you turn on the cellular data it doesn't
connect actually have to reboot the
device a lot of times in order to get
that cellular data to hook up so i'm
going to go ahead and zoom in quite a
bit i'll show you the upper left hand
corner so you can see right now we're
connected to just Wi-Fi i'm going to go
ahead and turn on the cellular data
right now so go ahead and jump into
cellular data now oftentimes the fixed
please I thought the fix was going to be
we just turn on airplane mode on and off
but that did not work unfortunately so
go ahead and turn cellular data on and
we're nearly you'd see the verizon logo
pop-up right there or if this was 18
fevers you'd show it pop up but you'll
notice nothing is showing up at all and
this is all in real time and i'll show
once again that the cellular data is
turned on and it's not working boy
genius is said they've gotten their
hands on an early build of OS four point
three point two which opposes a fixes
this problem which as it stands right
now the only way to fix is to turn it
off so a lot of people have said or what
about airplane mode as i mentioned
doesn't work let me go ahead at least
just show you so airplane mode is now
turned on to go ahead and turn airplane
mode off and or near this is where you'd
see the verizon network hookup and
you're going to be left with this
searching for many many many minutes
I've left it for up to 20 25 minutes and
you still just keep getting that surging
searching searching unfortunately will
not
mine's a network here I can leave this
on let you guys see I can put the
footage at the end but this is going to
just keep on searching so if you want to
get this to work at least it the most
current version the software which is
four point three point two point one or
really any version of 4.3 that came with
the iPad to the only solution right now
you can see it's still searching it most
definitely should have found the network
by now is to turn off your iPad 2 and
I'll do all this for you in real time go
ahead and turn off all right so it is
powered off let's turn it back on and
now I'll be connected to the verizon
network I thought this is something that
was just unique to my iPad but evidently
there are many users out there I haven't
seen a video that's being demonstrating
I wanted to share it with you as you
guys were deciding which ipad might be
right for you Apple is claiming there's
a software fix coming I've been very
happy with the speeds on the verizon
iPad using the verizon network however
this has been a huge inconvenience
something you might want to consider or
at least wait to purchase until you know
that the software fix does address the
issue so it's booting up and there we
have it connected to the verizon network
kind of interesting anyway guys I am jon
rettinger from TechnoBuffalo and i'll
see you in the next video bye bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
