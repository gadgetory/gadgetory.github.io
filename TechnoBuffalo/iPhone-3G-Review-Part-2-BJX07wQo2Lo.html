lakers calm I wanted to give you guys my
new take on the iphone 3g it's been just
about a month and I feel like I've used
it enough to be able to give you guys
some second impressions and some things
that I've noticed first off one of the
things that caught me initially was with
the Bluetooth headset specifically the
apple bluetooth headset you can now
listen to voicemail via the headset
which is not a feature that was there on
the previous version i'm not sure if
that's unique to the 3 3g or something
that was added with the 2 point 0
software that's something that's
certainly very nice and a welcome
addition the phone with the initial 2
point 0 software was a little bit on the
buggy side when i hit my contacts menu
take a few seconds for contacts start to
load before i could flip through them
and when i tried to type on the keyboard
occasionally there'd be a significant
lag majority of my problems are all
fixed with the recent update to the 2
point 0 1 software so now when i type
it's quick when I flip through contact
that's quick even the yellowing screen
that they called a warmer screen seems
to be gone as well so the 2 point 0 1
software really is a welcome addition if
you haven't upgraded yet I certainly
recommend it if you have a jailbroken
phone d-don't may be worth going back to
apple's walled garden to get some of the
bug fixes so it's certainly something
that's recommended battery battery life
on the phone is certainly not a stellar
as the first generation but with proper
conditioning meaning using the phone on
a regular basis and riding the battery
down recharging back all the way up
again you can easily get through a full
day i'll give you guys the summation of
mine day and how my battery works i'm
usually up in the morning around 5am
take the phone off connected to Wi-Fi
here my apartment for about a 45 minutes
now every friday for work and i'm on 3g
as well it's constantly doing push email
throughout the day well i'm at my office
is connected to Wi-Fi and intermittent
3g data for about 9 to 10 hours when i
come home it's connected to Wi-Fi and 3g
and i have about an hour of talk time
per day and probably about an hour of
internet used a day even throughout the
course so this were pretty heavy use
on the phone and when i get home and
plugged in i generally have about twenty
to thirty percent left so it is strong
enough my first generation phone I'd
have about forty percent left when I got
home so it's good enough to get through
a day but for going on a road trip for a
weekend if they're going to want to
bring your charger with you to charge it
up but battery life has not been bad one
thing that is noticeable as well because
of the plastic back i believe is the
Bluetooth signal now on the iphone 3g
the Bluetooth signal is markedly
stronger than it was on the first
generation phone on the first generation
I couldn't walk more than three or four
feet away before we tried to get fuzzy
here I can walk in seven or eight feet
and still have a very strong signal so
that's a very welcome addition as I
mentioned before my previous reviews
Wi-Fi is much stronger now because of
plastic back and your cell reception is
much harm because the plastic back call
sound much clearer when you have a full
3g signal you know which is very nice I
live in a fringe 3g area so cagey look
at one bar 3g the unfortunate thing is
that it won't recognize a week 3g signal
and go back to edge only where i've got
five bars it stays on the one bar so
occasionally i'm getting dropped calls
because i'm in such a fringe area
sometimes I have to turn and you're off
or turn 3g off to get my full edge
service for for making calls speaker
volume as I mentioned earlier super loud
much louder than the previous versions
that's a welcome addition as well other
than that the phone has been performing
great it's been solid I haven't had any
scratches guys can see on it yet I don't
have a case on and just screen protector
on the front the phone has been great
it's been behaving as I would expect it
to those are really the big improvements
I've noticed over the first generation
I'm not discussing the app store
anything because it's now available on
any version of the iphone or ipod touch
the gps is a nice feature and i find
myself using it nearly as much as I
thought I would there was a turn by turn
application you probably use it on
regular basis the App Store has been
great download a ton of apps you guys
can see there sort of and you can see I
got neck chair as well I was able to
grab it
before I pulled it down and that's a
tethering program which lets you share
your phone internet connection with your
computer so i'll make a video about that
soon anyway guys just wanted to give you
some more impressions on the iphone 3g
and let you know that for thinking about
making the jump definitely worthwhile
the 3g alone i think makes it makes it a
beneficial purchase having that fast
data is so nice i'm on the internet a
lot and it's great to be able to log on
to gmail and check my mail very quickly
and respond to the message I get from
you guys so that's it guys just some
initial iPhone impressions or some
secondary iPhone impressions rather any
