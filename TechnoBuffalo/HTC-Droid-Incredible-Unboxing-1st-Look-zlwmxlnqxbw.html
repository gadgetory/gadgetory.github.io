from TechnoBuffalo here and I've got an
unboxing for you of the brand new HTC
Droid Incredible for Verizon Wireless
it's not every day we get to take a
first look at a flagship smartphone so
I'm really looking forward to this let's
go ahead and dig in use the obligatory
dual knife here to hack through this I
should mention that pre-orders are
available for this phone right now it
will be shipping out on April 29th for
$1.99 after rebate on a two-year
contract so very small box you've got
some PR information in there I'll push
it off to the side here is the HTC Droid
Incredible or HTC Incredible as it says
on the front let's go over some of the
specs on this device just sort of very
quickly it is running Android 2.1 with
HTC's own skin on top of it called sense
it's got an 8 megapixel camera with
autofocus and dual LED flash which is
pretty impressive I can capture video at
WVGA which means 800 by 480 and as a 3.7
inch o le D full-color capacitive
display which has a resolution of 480 by
800 pixels and of course has a 1
gigahertz Snapdragon processor in it and
this browser is multi-touch and can
support flash so enough about the
geekiness let's go ahead and dig into
the phone and check out what we got joy
incredible so there is the incredible
sitting right on top looks like this one
has been reviewed before push that off
to the side keep digging in you get your
tips and shortcuts no CDs just some
booklets and information keep peeling
back got a new looking HTC wall 2 USB
charger and USB two micro USB cable and
that is about the extent of it nothing
terribly exciting in there all right so
now we took a look at all the
accessories let's take a look at the
main attraction the Droid Incredible
itself
and as a slang device meaning it's what
you see is what you get and no slide-out
QWERTY keyboard all of your controls are
done on screen so the 3.7 inch
touchscreen really highlights the phone
missing down below here is the trackball
that we've seen on some previous HTC
built Android devices it's gonna replace
now with an optical trackpad which works
very much the same way you can roll any
direction you want and you can push in
for menu selection you've got four
capacitive buttons along the bottom here
you've got a home button a menu button a
back button a search button the Nexus
One has the same sort of capacitive
button array but they weren't the most
responsive some curious of HTC actually
fixed it or made it a bit more
responsive for this on the left side of
the phone got a volume rocker up and
down and your charging port on the right
side got a big whopping nothing on the
bottom you've got your microphone port
and the top 3.5 milimeter headset jack
and your power and lock if you're
looking around for a camera button
you're actually not going to have when
the camera controls must be on screen
and of course we are talking about the
eight megapixel sensor on the back with
dual LED flash supposedly this is going
to be very good for low-light situations
the camera is out of focus as well let's
go ahead and pry off the back and take a
look at it before we do that I notice
these weird designs here at first I
thought that was gonna add some heft and
bulk to the phone but actually it really
does not I spoke to the folks HTC and
they claimed that that was racecar
inspire it's just to look and remind you
of a race car I don't know it's gonna be
a surprise I love or hate thing it's
really not a deal-breaker but that race
car inspired theme extends actually to
the inside of the phone as well it's
completely red and all you have is a
1300 milliamp hour battery so go ahead
and pop that back in when you pull off
the back you also get access to the
micro SD card slot which will go up to
32 gigs push this back on so like I
mentioned these ridges don't really add
any extra weight or size heft but why
take my word for it let me show you and
do a quick size comparison to a few
other devices you may be familiar with
so here we have its distant cousin the
Nexus One they share a lot of the same
internals you can see that they tried
the bath they don't look very different
for stacked on top of each other
very similar footprint and if we do a
side side almost no difference in
thickness if we take the incredible next
to an iphone 3gs I apologize for the
busted up miss of mine the screen
protectors coming off down there stacked
on top of each other the iPhone is a
little bit bigger probably see it better
that way a little bit of sliver of room
on the side and I think in this test the
iPhone is definitely the thickest and if
we make a little droid incredible
sandwich here you can see the thickness
of all the devices so let's try and
power it on and see if it's has a charge
sometimes these come completely dead
hopefully we'll be able to get something
out of us go ahead and kick it on and so
it does have enough juice HTC Incredible
which a strange confer eysan is actually
calling it the Droid Incredible so I
think the official name is the HTC Droid
Incredible I assume that we'll see
probably the Verizon logo next what I do
want to see very quickly before I sort
of end this video is see if this
supports flash some of the other HTC
devices like the desire have come
supporting flash right out of the box
this one there's been some mixed reports
so I want to try and put that to bed as
to whether or not it does the browser
certainly multi-touch though so to go
over some of the specs it does have
Wi-Fi 802 and B and G it's got the GPS
of course it weighs four point six
ounces connect your charger looks like
it's almost dead go ahead and slide it
down so you can get just enough charge
to get on the Internet alright so let's
see if we can go to a bit of flash comm
and we'll see if we do indeed have slash
support on the incredible it looks like
it's thinking about loading it that's
where the Flash content is looks like
it's getting ready to play something so
we may be able to confirm that we do in
fact have flash on here let's see what's
what it's doing and it's playing
so there you have something to put this
thing back on the charger before it dies
on me but this does support flash so if
you were wondering I was looking for
device that does support flash the HTC
Droid Incredible is going to definitely
be for you it's sitting on top of
Android 2.1 with the newest version of
HTC Sense pure - stay tuned to the
channel for a ton of more incredible
videos we're gonna put it head-to-head
against the Nexus One we're gonna put a
head-to-head against the iPhone 3GS
we're going to see how it stacks up on
its own two legs this one is running on
t-mobile Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T so it should
be a very interesting comparison
comparing network speeds and reliability
and also be doing a ton more videos on
the incredible showing some of the
features and specs and are you guys from
John Rhett enger' from TechnoBuffalo
and I hope you enjoyed I'll see you the
next video buh-bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
