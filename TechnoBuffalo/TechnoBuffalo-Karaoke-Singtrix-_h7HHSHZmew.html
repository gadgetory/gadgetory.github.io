Sangin from TechnoBuffalo and today
we're going to be taking a look at the
same tricks karaoke machine that's right
welcome to TechnoBuffalo karaoke now I
don't know about you guys but us
Filipinos love to sing and apparently
karaokes aren't a completely new thing
to us look at Manny Pacquiao for example
he loves to sing but what I have in
front of me could potentially change the
way we do karaoke nights at a friend's
house or at my house the sink tricks
karaoke machine is actually from the
same creators as Guitar Hero and
appeared on the show shark tank if
you're in music and love to sing stick
around maybe you'll find this karaoke
machine pretty cool the sink tricks
karaoke is essentially a plug-and-play
vocal effects machine just play a song
from your iOS device or Android device
turn a few dials and start singing even
if you're not a great singer the
signature conveyance technology is
capable of making anyone sound like
t-pain
inside the box we get a good amount of
stuff from tripods to different mounts
cables and of course we have the mic the
studio console itself and a 40 watt 2.1
stereo speaker would subs so taking a
closer look at the console itself
there's five total buttons in the front
and a dial to control your different
effects in the back we have inputs for
two mics one lead which has all the cool
effects and one backup singer without
the effects there's a 3.5 millimeter
jack for you to plug in your device to
playback audio tracks there's two stereo
speaker outputs for headphones and the
PA system DC in a power button and a USB
port for updating firmware as in effects
so taking a quick look at the speaker
system it looks like a regular PA system
to me there's a power switch on the
front there's three knobs for the volume
treble and bass and that's about it so
the same tricks console itself has 25
reverb effects 350 professional vocal
presets each preset is a mix of vocal
effects that produce distinctive sounds
there are three types of presets here
Universal extreme and song there are
three different levels of voice
enhancements as well depending on your
skill level
there's enhance which offers a lot of
pitch correction semi pro which offers
some pitch correction and Pro which
offers no pitch correction but still has
the cool voice effects there's also a
cool hid effect which can transform your
voice into a four-part supergroup maybe
you can start singing voice to men to
your lady friend I don't know so one
cool thing about the sync tricks as well
is that there's this feature called song
voice which can then lower your song
vocals so you could sing on top of the
track which i think is pretty neat
unfortunately we can't play any
copyrighted materials to sing to you
guys but check this out screaming okay
let's go I can make the table this is a
song that I'm making
things like oh I don't wanna wait oh I
like to be over when I not be gonna be
laughs on my fidelity my crazy high
velocity uh even though I know you love
me can't help it mama just killed a man
I run I don't see mom very might a
guitar man from CL well it still beats
raising and there you guys have it sync
tricks is one heck of a machine that'll
take karaoke nights at your house to a
whole different level distinct tricks
karaoke bundle is going for around $350
and that comes with everything the mic
the speakers the console tripod stands
and all the cables that you need to get
this thing set up if you guys enjoyed
this video make sure to give it a thumbs
up and we will see you guys in the next
video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
