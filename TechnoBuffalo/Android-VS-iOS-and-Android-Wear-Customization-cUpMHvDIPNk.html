to you by linda what's up everyone i am
the TechnoBuffalo mascot shia labeouf
LuAnn I'm sick and tired of John every
single week stood in that chair saying
he's a buffalo does he have horns no
does he grazing the field no does he
have a cool shades backside we don't
know but I am finally taking my chair
back this is asked the beach so our
first question comes from Twitter user
at 172 756 who asks at John for lakers
what's an Android software hardware
feature you wish the iphone had this one
super easy for me widgets I wish they
had widgets I think what androids done
is absolutely awesome customizable
widgets you can change sizes apps have
done widgets you can pick what you want
and what it shows i love the OC
information really quickly I think I
always say got a little bit better with
that but sort of the pulldown
notification shade but I'd love to have
those right on a homescreen wish iOS
would gank that right from Android but
there's a ton of other features I think
both could sort influence them from
we'll talk about that though in an
upcoming question our next question
comes from Danny 3d who asks at John for
lakers do you feel like Android L
borrowed elements from iOS 7 this
question gets me enraged i was going to
do a whole freakin bring back retina
schrantz for this one they're like the
apple stove at Google stole that would
be creative Android had that for years
ago or Apple had that two years ago I
think that is a total bullet thing to
say there are only so many ways you can
do things and ifs one company did
something well why not use that as long
as you're not violating any patents
something works it should work as long
as the end user experience is good who
cares where it came from the dirty
secret here is everybody steals from
everybody else in the online software
space everybody does it you're gonna get
all up in your high horse if you're
operating systems better because they
took a feature from somewhere else and
you don't think your operation did that
you are so delusional you have no idea
use whatever you're using in your pocket
keep it in your pocket as long as it
works well for you who cares where it
came from or what it might have borrowed
influence from as long as it works well
and this goes for Apple it goes for iOS
it goes for Windows Phone everything
else as long as you get a good
experience why do you care next question
comes from a sub 0 5 who asks at John
for laker should GU prevent UI
customization of androids with the doing
with wear and auto so really cool I
think what they're doing with where no
matter what watch you get the android
wear experience is always going to be
the same answer a similar with an apple
product you know they don't let anyone
customize it so the same experience
across and ipod touch and iphone or an
ipad and i'm kind of split on it i
really like that they've done done that
so there's not too many fragmentation on
it you know there's not going to be any
sort of skinning so Samsung have
different than LG's everything's going
to work apps going to work across all
devices only thing you can choose from
is a style of the actual watch itself
and the spectre to pick which ones sort
of best for you so one hand I really
really like that update you're gonna be
fast I'll be quick they'll be the same
across all device on the other end
though you know you can always get the
experience you want I sort of harking
back to Android I like you customize and
tweak it but I hate that it's caused
fragmentation I Ted that's cause delays
for updates the features don't always
get moved over in the experience from
one android device the other is really
inconsistent so you've got apples
approach of controlling everything from
the opposite side you have android which
has been very very open i fall somewhere
in the middle I my ideal world I would
love there would be 12 unskinny version
of Android you're going to Google Play
Store you can download the skin of your
choice if you want HTC sense if adalah
HTC sense if you want TouchWiz or modern
UI you can download that answer you can
have it sitting on top and how it's sort
of influencing you know the operating
system below the surface that would be
my ideal world which where people can
pick what they want but that is never
ever going to happen I think for the
moral though if you want one that's can
be same experience probably want to look
at iOS you want to customize loose for
the mobile side you know Android is
probably the best way to go so but for
convoluted answer both Lee it helps
