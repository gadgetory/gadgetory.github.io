familiar doesn't it well you might not
recognize the name Verve motorola has a
smaller company right now a little
subsidiary called Verve and they're
making active stuff along the lines of
GoPros they've got a whole line of
really active devices the Verve Ryder
and the Verve loops are their headphones
one is a behind the ear and the other is
a little bit closer to something like
the Jaber x3 there's also the Verve
retrieve which is believe it or not a
collar for your dog that has a camera on
it so that you can have him or her shoot
for you and then last but not least the
ones that I think are probably the
coolest the Verve ones plus these things
are teeny tiny little wireless stereo
earbuds and they're completely wireless
nothing even connecting the two of them
they just pop right into your ears you
get twelve hours of battery life and
they are water and sweat proof the
carrying case isn't just the case that's
how you charge these things it looks a
lot like the Motorola hint and that's
probably where the verb once started
their life cycle they're pretty cool
looking not to mention black and orange
looking good we don't have pricing or
availability available just yet this is
a very very new line of products for the
company but you can bet that when we do
have that information we'll share it
with you thank you guys so much for
watching if you want to see more stuff
from CES make sure you keep it here on
TechnoBuffalo
lots more to come this week from the
show floor thank you guys again so much
for watching be kind of one or another
and I'll talk to you the next week</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
