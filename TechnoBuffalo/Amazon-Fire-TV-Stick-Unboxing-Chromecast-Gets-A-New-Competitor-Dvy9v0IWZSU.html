technobuffalo here's an unboxing of the
latest in the Amazon fire family this is
the fire TV stick let's go ahead and
take a look at so here's the box for the
fire TV stick let you know you've got
access to over 200,000 movies and TV
episode so you better just sit down on
your butt and start watching you've got
a lot to go through tennis specs out of
here but we're gonna run through that so
you'd even have to bother reading we'll
go ahead and open this up amazon says we
don't need to use our obligatory
unboxing I have to make things usually
pretty easy to open up go ahead and
slide that up alright so we've got the
fire TV stick and blazing on top go and
open the sucker up and boom there it is
not that much to look at which is kind
of the idea behind the same kid it's
super small we've got the fire TV stick
itself looking like like an old-school
thumb drive like it maybe 2006 era thumb
drive I'll push that off to the side
we've got a remote with voice control
we've seen this something similar to
this with the fire TV nonstick version
fire TV stick book for some like toilet
reading but you can see what's going to
come in there we've got a wall adapter
we should have a micro USB cord which we
do and we've got to triple-a batteries
powering the remote and that's aside
from a accenture cable for HDMI is going
to be it so let's take a look at all
this stuff and talk about what it can do
so this diminutive little streaming
stick does quite a bit obviously this
thing is aimed squarely at chromecast
and roku get a set you back 40 bucks for
this guide on case you're sort of
counter shopping with chromecast it's
got four times the storage in two times
in memory of chromecast plus a dual-core
processor and one gig of ram case you're
wondering what the processor is because
you know we nerds like that it's the
broadcom Capri 28 155 dual core arm it's
an a 9 chip so get your getting access
to over 200,000 TV episodes and movies
millions of songs hundreds of games so
it's kind of neat one of the things I
think Amazon does a really nice job with
is
voice search so with this here remote
you can just do voice search or for the
cage on I don't want to use that remote
you can just use the Android app iOS
support should be coming very soon if
you saw the pictures on the box you
probably notice the time difference
treatment services but not among them is
HBO that'll be coming next year we got
support for your favorites like Netflix
of course amazon stuff they're really
going to push down your throat no voodoo
on there but a ton of other source
streaming channel options I can do 720
and 1080p at 60 frames per second it's
going to be available in shipping
they're saying now sometime in early
January although we've ordered ours with
everybody else and were able to get it
so maybe you'll get it sooner could make
a nice stocking stuffer hey guys this
has been a quick unboxing and look at
the fire TV stick will do a full review
and test it and see how it works and put
it up against the chromecast and the
roku stick look to your thoughts leave
