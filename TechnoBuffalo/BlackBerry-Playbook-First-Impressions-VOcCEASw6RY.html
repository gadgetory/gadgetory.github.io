technobuffalo here with one key note in
one announcement the entire tablet world
was completely turned on its head let me
introduce you to rims new playbook so
today September 27 CEO Mike Lazaridis
took the stage at rims developer events
to introduce a new tablet and this is
not sort of a me to type tablet we've
seen from other manufacturers this
tablet is really at least what it looks
like going to redefine the tablet market
I'm not playing catch-up to any product
from Cupertino I'm really carving out
its own space let me go ahead and run
you through the spec can you see me look
down it's cuz what keeno is still going
on so I'm leaving some notes in front of
me so first it is a completely new
tablet running a cortex a9 one gigahertz
dual-core CPU dual-core thing is going
to be a screamer it's got a gigabyte of
RAM this thing is like a nicely spec
computer actually from just a few years
ago it's got a 7-inch display a sort of
webos type of app switching so it
certainly supports multitasking to the
full extent it's got ereader
functionality it's got full document
editing so Word PowerPoint Excel and
such full pairing with blackberry
devices 1080p output via one of its HDMI
ports it also has USB port as well which
is kind of neat it's got front and rear
cameras it's got a 3 megapixel camera on
the front which is extremely high
quality for a front-facing camera
actually the highest up you seen for
front-facing camera and a 5 megapixel
sensor on the back capable of shooting
full 1080p video not 720 this is people
of shooting full HD video on a 7-inch
tablet really very impressive it's only
nine point seven millimeters thick which
is pretty impressive full OpenGL
supports looks like they're really
trying to target some gamers with this
full support for flash 10.1 these will
not be a 3G and 4G version they first
come out although rim is planning a 3G
and 4G version presumably with sprint
and the other carriers when the LTE
networks go alive it weighs less than up
pounds which is again extremely
impressive it's got a full multi-touch
webkit browser looks like a really
impressive browsing experience we expect
from modern tablet of course Wi-Fi 802
11 B G and N and it's running with
blackberry is calling vote BlackBerry's
new tablet OS and this thing really does
look to be extremely impressive this
tablet with a dual-core CPU is going to
be extremely powerful and a very capable
device of multitask and really running
everything blackberry is also in remy
particular also announced a lot a new
developer support new API it's where to
have a fantastic new web store i think
is going to be really a key selling
point for this device the keynote is
still going on right now so if there
have been released information on sort
of put it up right here if not you know
state 2-inch an upcoming video
announcing when this product will be
released i am extremely excited about
the playbook it looks to be a tablet
that is not just trying to say me too
and catch up to the ipad but actually
excelling past the ipad i will just
fantastic for the competition so
literally my hats off to rim for it
looks to be a fantastic device although
certainly specs and always kind of user
experience so once this thing is
released i get my hands on one expect a
full review what do you guys think about
the PlayBook is you excited not excited
