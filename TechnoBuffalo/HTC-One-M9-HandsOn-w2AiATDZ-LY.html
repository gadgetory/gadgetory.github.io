Hazleton from TechnoBuffalo I'm here in
Barcelona Spain checking out the brand
new HTC One m9 was just announced by HTC
at Mobile World Congress here and if it
looks familiar that's because it sort of
is HTC told me this is a refinement of
the HTC One m8 but it does have some of
the sharper edges that we liked and saw
originally on the one m7 you can see
it's got the boomsound speakers on the
top and bottom and unfortunately that
HTC black bar is still there which
apparently needs to be in order to make
a room for those speakers in some
aspects you also have the front pacing
front facing rather ultrapixel camera
that's a 5 inch display with the 1080p
resolution on the left-hand side I
believe that's either similar expandable
storage I don't have a tool to open it
and have it had one yet so I'll to find
out but it does have expandable storage
up to 128 gigabytes and 32 gigabytes
onboard however on the back you can see
it looks familiar but you were missing
the duo camera setup that we saw in the
One m8 that's because that's a new 20
megapixel camera there with the dual LED
flash of different tones then you can
see the antenna bands coming across I
like we saw before and on the right hand
side the buttons have changed slightly
you don't have the rocker anymore you
have the two volume up and down buttons
separate of each other real nice a sort
of brushed aluminum look there and then
you have the power button and then I
believe either no simmer the micro SD
card slot I'm not quite sure again
because i don't have the tool to open it
so software here is changed we're
running lollipop with sense 7 and that
includes blinkfeed over on the left
which is getting more and more
contextual so you can see the top here
says thinking about coffee and showing
me coffee shops in Barcelona powered by
yelp but again you get your news stories
and Social Feeds really similar to
before quick and easy to use and that
also comes with what I should see oh we
have a system update already sometimes
then it'll use that contextual update
like thinking about coffee and put it
right on your lock screen which is kind
of neat if you're worried or if you're
interested in in areas around you and
then now we have this like sense now
sort of feed on the front here and you
can see it has out
home and work and now what that does is
it changes the icons available on this
launcher in the apps depending on where
you are so I said I was out but now when
I'm home it'll swap it around to themes
and calendar and music and YouTube and
stuff like that and then I could also
say I'm at work where it might say that
hey these are the apps that you care
about your mail app and google drive and
stuff like that now you'll notice also
in here are downloads this is where your
most recent downloaded apps would appear
and suggestions this is sort of kind of
feels like malware but not really it's
like advertisements it's just apps that
it thinks you should download like candy
crush which I'm not crazy about and
super bright light or something like
that and you'll have to pardon the
connection here it's not it's not great
where I am in Barcelona but it's
recommended apps now thankfully you can
turn those off I believe in the settings
of this let's see we can access it we
can't now however HTC did tell us that
you can turn those off so you can remove
the suggestions Boulder and downloads at
your leisure now we'll go through here
you can see there's a some preloaded
apps boomsound connect this lets you
connect to HTC sort of connected home
supported speakers and stuff like that
if they're nearby or Bluetooth if you
will and we'll go through there's also
HT seeds new doc view application if i
can find that floating around here
somewhere power to give oh there it is
this comes with a bunch of themes that
you can tweak my themes holiday themes
live themes and you can even change it
to have a special message that flashes
across the theme your display if you
want so there's lots of new stuff you
can do with a docu case that will be
available for this phone also notice
peel smart remotes included this time
around HTC uh no network connection HTC
decided to get rid of HTC's built in TV
software which was built on PL anyway
and just add peel Smart Remote so that
you got the frequent updates provided by
them and HTC wouldn't put their own
resources into it so not a bad choice
photo editors a new one here you can do
all kinds of stuff
with the pictures that you take so I had
a selfie I took earlier and you can do
let's see add various effects some of
them are a little weirder than others so
like you know like Picasso or something
I don't know and you can also blend two
faces so if you have a selfie of your
friend and your own selfie you can then
mix the faces together which is pretty
silly and need at the same time the
photos or the gallery app rather is
pretty sweet still to you get the
animated clips that you have if you know
shot videos with the camera will just
show you that's one of the effects you
can add you can do that on the m8 as
well so just neat little things like
that throughout the software inside of
sense 7 otherwise one of the other big
things that HTC's putting a focus on is
themes so you can change your out of
your theme that was the default one and
here's a bunch more but the idea is that
you're going to go through a store and
be able to download and I don't think
pay but maybe pay download themes and
let's see so I'll replace this one with
one called Cascadia and here you can see
the theme is applied it literally
changes everything you see at the bottom
like the app for switching tasks is now
some mountains and you have this home
button is now sort of a weather thing
but all the icons changed even the
messaging icon is different mail
calendar weather and then even the fonts
and stuff so you can go through and
tweak all of that so fonts and icons or
the entire team if you want which is
pretty neat and then of course HTC has
some new wallpapers here if you care
about those will go through and just
browse them a lot of these we published
on the site already they kind of spilled
out ahead of time I kind of like this
night one on the beach was just need so
a customization obviously in
personalization is going to be a big
part of this phone as well in any case
under the hood and you probably notice
it's everything is running really smooth
with lollipop and on the Snapdragon 810
processor here I know there were
concerns of overheating I've been using
this for a couple hours now and it
it feels totally fine you got three gigs
of ram on board again I said 32 gigs of
storage expandable with an additional
128 gigabytes HTC said that's it for now
that 32 gigabytes cues so not sure if
they're ever going to add more maybe
down the line but that's not the plan
right now then up top you've got the IR
blaster again for the TV support and on
the bottom 3.5 millimeter headphone jack
and microUSB charging in any case that's
a quick look here at the HTC One m9 one
of the newest hottest phones should be
launching sometime this spring no we're
getting on carriers and stuff but stay
tuned to the TechnoBuffalo homepage for
all the news on that this is Todd
