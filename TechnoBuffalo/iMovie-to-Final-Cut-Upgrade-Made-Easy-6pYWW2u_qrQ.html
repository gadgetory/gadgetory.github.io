TechnoBuffalo and what I've got for you
guys today is a tutorial on making the
switch from being an iMovie user to a
final cut user now all you pc guys out
there don't get mad I'm also planning on
doing one doing windows movie maker to
Sony Vegas or something along those
lines but for today it's going to be
iMovie to final cut let's go ahead get
started so one of the biggest hurdles
that I move a user's face when they're
switching the final cut is really just a
mental one when you first get it open
you see all these options and it's
somewhat overwhelming but the good news
is that for the vast majority of users
ninety percent of the stuff you are
never going to need as it really meant
more for the pro level users out there
the other good news is that the
interface your custom to an iMovie has
direct correlations with the interface
in final cut so what we're going to
learn is how you can translate the moves
you already know how to do an iMovie
into final cut so what's the first thing
you do in iMovie you import your footage
into an event right where similar thing
happens in final cut except it's just
named differently you have what's called
bins and the way to think of these is as
your events are in iMovie and it's just
a collection of raw video clips and what
you can do is you can make a new bin and
final cut and then just go ahead and
drag all your footage into it for easy
organization you'll notice it comes up
as a list view instead of as thumbnails
well it's easy to change that so you can
get to the clip that you want simply by
right clicking inside the bin and
selecting icons your next step is to
find the clip that you want and bring it
into what's called the viewer now the
way to think of the viewer is is a space
for you to edit the clip before bring it
into your final product which is shown
in the screen next to it the canvas now
in iMovie these are all combined into
one screen but final cut simply splits
them into to most people's next step in
iMovie is to select their in and out
points of their clips and then drag them
into their project window where they
want them well you do something similar
in final cut so here in the viewer I'm
going to scrub through and find where i
want my clip to begin and end in my
final product then I'm going to set the
in and out points either by selecting
the buttons here on the screen or using
the eye and okies now once that's done I
have a couple options I can drag it to
the canvas to insert it or drag it down
to my main timeline now once i have it
inserted you'll notice in the canvas
window what my clip is going to look
like in the final product then just like
an imovie i'm going to repeat those
steps until my video is sequenced how I
want it's easy to make changes as well
just go into the timeline and click and
drag or double click on the clip and
make the adjustments in the viewer one
of the things people really love about I
movie is the ease with which you can add
transitions and effects well you can do
the same thing in final cut it's just
laid out a little differently here in
the browser window if you look at the
top you see an effects tab and that's
when we'll see all the built-in filters
and transitions so for this I'm just
going to go ahead and pick the cross
dissolve transition and place that into
my timeline and now the clip is going to
have a nice fade to it in the finished
product you can fine-tune those filters
and effects by double clicking on a clip
to bring it into the viewer and clicking
on the filters are motion tab at the top
of the viewer window so this is a good
time to talk about something you will
not encounter an iMovie and that is
rendering for example let's take this
effect and drag it to the timeline now
you notice the top of the timeline
window there's a little red bar
appearing up there and that indicates
that this part of my sequence is not
rendered and you can see when I hit play
it actually comes up as unrendered in
the canvas so what you want to do is is
go ahead and go to the top of final cut
under sequence and then render that
selection now that's going to allow you
to see the video play in real time keep
in mind that you'll encounter unrented
selections not just for effects and
transitions but also for certain video
for
matts as well okay guys final step and
that is exporting an iMovie this is
pretty easy you go to the share menu and
final cut you get two different options
really you can go ahead and export to
quicktime and pick a format you want to
use and i would recommend this if you
don't really care about file size your
second option is to export using
quicktime conversion now what this is
going to do is give you some presets
specifically for certain situations then
you can of course go to the options for
all these different presets and then
tweak them to fit your specific needs
there you guys have it the basics of
switching from iMovie to final cut a
good question to ask yourself though is
do you actually need to make the switch
I movie is a very capable program on its
own and can do some really great things
well either way hopefully this was
helpful for you and I'll see you in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
