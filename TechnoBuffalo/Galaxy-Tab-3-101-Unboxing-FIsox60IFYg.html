technobuffalo here the galaxy tab 3
laughs much like my own family comes in
various shapes and sizes up today we are
unboxing me Big Daddy the 10.1 version
Ashley unsheath the 8-point Oh a few
days later to go ahead take a look at
this guy which coincidentally is the
first Intel Atom powered Android 4.2
point2 tablet let's get diggin it so
here we've got the galaxy tab 3 box
looking very similar to the galaxy s4
with that fake wood grain we got a
picture the tablet on the front and some
specs on the back the model we are in
boxing for keeping track at home is the
gtp 5 to 10 very sexy name on that guy
let's go ahead and use the ice it's new
again the obligatory unboxing knife and
we will cut that Samsung steel without
slicing my finger alright let's go ahead
and open this up and see what we are
going to have inside of this box have
you have a tablet inside um just
obviously we have a tableau inside so
here is the galaxy tab 3 point 0 looking
oddly similar in design language to the
galaxy s4 pushed off the side for just a
quick second and see what also going to
live inside of this box we've got
another box that lives inside of it
we've got some galaxy tab through point
O quick start guide stuff we've got a
charge and sync cable it's pretty
standard microUSB and then we've got a
wall wart same one that we saw with the
galaxy s4 stuff so I'll push all those
things off to the side and let's take a
look at this here tablet alright so you
are looking at android 4.2 point2 jelly
bean but interesting thing here is this
one point 60 Hertz dual-core processor
if you're like me you're saying 1.6
ticker it's dual core what is this 2010
this is actually the first android 4.2
point2 tablet to ship with an intel atom
processor so don't bite that much
attention to a dual core business here
so continue our tour of the tablet we
got one big home button we got a
capacitive back button and a menu button
I've got a front facing camera and a
sensor for sensing things on top of the
device we've got IR blaster was really
grohe SD card ports going to live volume
rocker up and down and power I've got a
camera that lives right there on the
back and it is a 3 megapixel camera that
can shoot 10 a tour 720p video rather
camera on the front in case you want to
know is 1.3 megapixels so let's go over
the dimensions here it is 9.5 7 inches
by six point three nine by a
surprisingly thin point three one that
Fitness also it doesn't weigh that much
a one point 12 pounds are looking at a
not for high resolution screen it is
1280 by 800 for 849 PPI this guy is
available now for about 400 ish bucks
it's got that same 1.6 cool dual-core
processor we just talked about 6,800
milliamp hour battery with a seems
rather anemic now one gigabyte of RAM so
16 gigs internal but of course you can
expand that with a microSD card up to 64
Wi-Fi 802 11 ABG and n bluetooth 4.0 and
it's available in two colors black or
white now you can guess what color we
have here so I'm go ahead and pull us
off can all of your already screaming
that they're stickers on there so let's
power it on and see what it looks like
the battery is non-removable as we're
seeing you know with pretty much every
tablet here galaxy tab pro know you can
see Ralph and the reflection say hi
Ralph I will let this guy boot up and
we'll come back here in just a minute
see if the UI looks like so we've got
this guy all booty booted up and we are
looking at essentially a giant version
of TouchWiz and right off the bat you
can see the screen resolution but you
know that going in and we were buying a
tablet like this so i'm not going to
knock it for at all if you don't mind a
shipping resolution it's probably going
to be a pretty solid choice appears to
be pretty zippy but again i'm doing is
really moving screens around let's see
what we've got in the apps apartment
click there are quite a few of them so
some Samsung add-on we got chat on we
got game hub some samsung apps as
planners away for calendar I really
actually like the way they do the
calendar here I've asked planner name I
could do without but really you can see
a lot of stuff i like how they've done
the tabs for year month week day task
and list it's a personal preference but
i really do enjoy it on samsung products
so dropbox is a samsung device when you
sign in you will get 50 gigs of storage
if you want
the S voice is here because I know you
guys love to use that voice search chat
on or watch on rather world clock and
YouTube I'll rest that stuff comes right
out of the box so it's been a quick
first look and unboxing at the samsung
galaxy tab 3 10.1 version in case you
guys want notes screen is it's a wxga
LCD so there's that resolution for you
alright so let's do a quick size
comparison of the galaxy tab 10.1 little
brother the Galaxy Tab 8.2 what these
suckers look like when they are stacked
and we made a sort of tablet sandwich
without the meat you can see the
thickness on that is pretty much
identical I like the way the I'm really
on a kick for smaller tablet so I kind
of dig away the 8 inch feels but I know
a lot of folks prefer the bigger size
screen through can have the option
obviously for both in the galaxy tab
