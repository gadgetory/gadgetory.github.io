technobuffalo here and if i look a
little paler than usual because i'm sick
like not in the headset well probably a
little bit of that but also like Oh sick
but while I'm sick I spend my time
reading tech news because nerd alert
what I like to do that's why ball is
sort of done and there's been some
humongous news this weekend that really
caught I think most analysts most
journalists most bloggers most customers
completely off guard AT&amp;amp;T acquisition of
t-mobile was completely surprising so I
wanted to run down the facts up getting
a lot of questions about what this is
going to mean for the consumer and I
wanted to sort of share my opinions and
thoughts about what it means for you if
you're a t-mobile customer you're an
AT&amp;amp;T customer or you're just follow the
cellular industry there's a lot to
absorb here so first the facts it is a
39 billion dollar acquisition that is a
lot of 0 you think about thirty nine
billion dollars is not a small chunk of
change now you could get it on the grand
scheme of money in the world it's a pity
but thirty nine billion is 39 million
holy smokes it's going to serve probably
close to a hundred and thirty million
customers now this combined powerhouse
of AT&amp;amp;T and t-mobile so how does this
deal breakdown chemo news reporting that
t-mobile's parent company a Deutsche
Telekom may have massacred that
pronunciation if I did tell me I found
to put off properly and I'll make sure I
correct in the next video is going to
get 25 billion in cash money for bats
t-mobile acquisition they're going to
get 14 billion in stock which is going
to make them an eight percent
stockholder in AT&amp;amp;T so just because this
purchase or intent to purchase was
announced first does not mean it's going
to go through the Department of Justice
has to do a very thorough due diligence
you may hear that term due diligence
he's quite a bit essentially what that
means just do a ton of research and make
sure that this is not going to create a
monopoly when you start thinking of
communications and telephone monopolies
AT&amp;amp;T tends to sort of always be involved
with them so the reasons is Mike create
monopolies we'll talk about the reasons
may be alone and then I'll talk again
the belt maybe why I think it's going to
happen or not happen so there are right
now to generally prevailing cellular
technologies in the u.s. there is one
which runs on a cdma network which just
doesn't use a sim card and 4G aside that
is how Verizon and Sprint do their
networks it's cdma no sim card you have
to dial in a number on the back and that
sort of activate your phone to
oversimplify explanation and there's
another standard called gsm which is sim
cards and that's what AT&amp;amp;T and t-mobile
use so there are different bands served
in that gsm range you may have heard
edge mentioned it's commonly now called
a 2g network AT&amp;amp;T and t-mobile
essentially share most of the same bands
forehead with a few exceptions in some
regions primarily if you've heard maybe
a quad band edge phone you wouldn't have
any problems using it on ATT or tmobile
and the majority of phones now swim
there are some exceptions I generally
are at least quad band edge so now let's
talk about three g one g more t-mobile
has a very strong 3g network with hspa+
which are now also sort of calling for d
which we're also going to talk about
keep saying we're going to talk about
going to talk about but we are going to
get to it so from the 3g world t-mobile
and AT&amp;amp;T use different spectrums the
spectrum is just the i guess the signal
that's being sent over the air how it
gets delivered to the devices again over
simplified explanation but there are
different spectrum so 850 900 1700 all
that it's just how it gets to your phone
and if your phone doesn't support
spectrum the job can get the service so
AT&amp;amp;T are both gsm
technology as I mentioned and both have
different 3g bands so what could happen
here is t-mobile or the new AT&amp;amp;T could
potentially open up their 3g spectrum to
make the phones or future phones
compatible with one set of standards for
3g communication that also translates to
4g AT&amp;amp;T is rolling out LTE which is
another gsm-based 4G technology
coincidentally one of the ones that
verizon is using to make that even more
complicated and t-mobile has sorta said
maybe we're going to look at LTE but we
haven't really given a plans for it but
look at our hspa+ network which is super
fast and probably could be considered 4G
and so I'm a their branding it as such
so now AT&amp;amp;T is going to have control of
this 4g spectrum you might hear called
AWS that t-mobile has so AT&amp;amp;T is now
going to have a complete control and if
this deal gets approved have complete
control over essentially all the gsm
phones in the US now there are some
smaller regional carriers and there are
some M envios ever call that resell
broadband spectrum resell wireless
spectrum but primarily AT&amp;amp;T would be the
purveyor of all this gsm business and
that's where we might see a potential
monopoly that leaves this AT&amp;amp;T t-mobile
behemoth competing against verizon and
sprint it was widely assumed that sprint
was going to be purchasing t-mobile and
that would have been less of a monopoly
she would have had two different
technologies now we've got gsm
essentially going to be the de facto
standard moving forward in the u.s.
because of install base there's so many
customers that are going to be on it
it's going to be tough for manufacturers
or sorry carriers rather like sprint and
probably verizon as well going to feel a
pressure as far as securing these mobile
devices if you are at cell phone
manufacturer let's say you were AT&amp;amp;T or
samsung and you were making a phone and
you wanted to maximize your profits up
for this phone you could make it a GSM
based phone which is a much more of a
global
and can be used by potentially al 130
million Americans as well as people all
over the world or you can make a cdma
version which could be used on one
carrier in the US and not that many
carriers abroad what would you choose
the answer is very very very simple it's
going to greatly reduce if this deal
goes through the handsets that are going
to be available to verizon and sprint
now variety less effect that they're
moving to a 4G standard similar to what
t-mobile has 118 T is doing moving
forward LTE but poor Sprint is stuck
with wimax which is another 4G standard
to confuse everything that's not really
had going to have the longevity of LTE
so it's going to force sprint
essentially to go LT it's going to force
rising to commit further to LTE and sort
of move away from that cdma back call
unfortunately so this is a very
complicated rambly type video I got a
lot of thoughts on this is this deal
good for the consumer nope this deal is
not good for the consumer at all you're
going to have a lot more phone choices
certainly on this new 18 t-mobile
network I like that ATT and tmobile
network certainly is going to be a lot
of phone options available but there's
going to be less incentive for this
behemoth to compete certainly we've seen
Verizon and Sprint when they have to
lower the data rates may have to offer
more minutes and such because the
competition there's going to be much
much much less competition however is
this a monopoly it is certainly not a
monopoly well it might not be best with
consumer in the long run AT&amp;amp;T and
t-mobile definitely have a right to this
merger and I do think the Department of
Justice is going to prove this although
probably it's going to take about 12 to
18 months so does this mean that
t-mobile something gonna get the iphone
no it's not just going to show up on
t-mobile least until this merger is
going to be done it's not going to
affect any current contracts at you're
into tmobile where it might affect you
is if your contract is going to be up in
a year or a year and a half once this
deal is consummated you know then you're
probably looking at new data plans
perhaps and you
on your phone and such but at least if
your current customer stock in effect
anything t-mobile has said many times
since it was announced that all contract
are going to be honored you are going to
probably have to hear your new pricing
scheme went to sign new contracts but
that's sort of the way it goes so what's
going to happen not sure I think it is
going to get approved I think it's going
to offer many many many more handsets to
gsm folks among us it's going to really
force verizon and sprint to compete
innovate I wouldn't be overly surprised
to start hearing rumors and grumblings
of a verizon takeover of Sprint or at
least potential buyout of spring so this
is a very long rambling I guess old
school John for lakers how video and I
just sort of stare at you and talk
curious you guys watch this one what you
think about this buyout do you think
it's a good thing do think it's a bad
thing are you outside the country
outside the US and you really don't care
you're sick of all the news i like to
hear what you guys have to say that I'm
asked her the pronunciation of deutsche
telekom telecom i think i pronounced
correctly but don't should part probably
not but just curious what you guys had
to hear say about all this I'm sort of
been following it very closely
TechnoBuffalo of course they tunes the
TechnoBuffalo for all of this merger
news i'm jon rettinger i'll see you next
video buh-bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
