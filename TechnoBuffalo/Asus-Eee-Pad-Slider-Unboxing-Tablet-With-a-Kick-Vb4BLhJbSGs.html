technobuffalo here is an unboxing I'm
really looking forward to this is the
asus eee pad slider this guy doesn't
transform but it does slide let's go
ahead open the box and see if it has all
the right moves took me about 30 minutes
to come up with that injure alright so
here we have the eee pad slider it's
brother the eee pad transformer still is
one of my favorite tablets out on the
market so I'm hoping this is going to
continue the trend it's very similar to
spec department but we'll talk about all
that goodness so here is the box is
going to come from asus eee pad slider
picture of it doing its sliding action
on the back unlike the transformer this
guy is permanently attached to its
keyboard so you always have that option
there and available so picture of the
picture of it you pet slider you kept
slider great alright let's go ahead and
take it off and it looks like this tip
has been cut already unfortunately not
by me so i might not be the first one to
unbox this up maybe i am not entirely
sure alright so we've got a little tab
will pull that out open it it looks like
ah looks like someone else might have
gotten their mitts in here before me but
here is the eee pad slider push off to
the side for just a quick moment see
what else we're going to get into you
cats latter box we're gonna have a knee
pad slider charger which is powered to
USB it's great to see the charges via
USB but it's a proprietary connection so
they're not gonna go to charge
unfortunate with micro USB i'm not going
to carry enough power to do so oh it
goes back box gets throw on the floor
and a loud crash crash and here is the
asus eee pad transformer our very own
mic Perlman who has on many occasions
ranted about how he doesn't see a need
for tablets isn't like any tablets
actually said that this is the one
tablet you actually could envision
himself using alright so let's go ahead
and run through the specs on this guy's
i go ahead and peel off its plastic you
can see some of them right here touch
slides pipe all over
rip off with plastic I don't like
feeling like someone else's touch this
before I should have prima nocta all
right out of the plastic chimeric we got
Jessamine you guys all right here we
have the slide I think it goes it this
way all right so now let's run through
the specs and you can stare into my fan
we've got a 10.1 inch IPS screen of the
resolution of 1280 by 800 and it
supposedly has 178 degree viewing angle
kind of cool take your tune here so
you're gonna call that dual core action
gig of ram ways to point 12 pounds
android 3.2 honeycomb comes pre-loaded
with Polaris Office on which is great
five megapixel camera on the back and
there's a front-facing camera on the
front pricing on this guy kind of varies
a newegg has listed for 479 whereas
Amazon's got it up on the 700 bucks so
definitely shop around if you want to
look at this guy to configuration 16 and
32 gigs this is the S 101 which is going
to come with 16 games listen I can
figure out the slightest guy open so
push it slide slide happiest boy come on
slut it for me I can see there's keyword
in there I can feel it yeah there you
boom to come in to figure out and it's
got that slider name because check that
out it's got a full keyword I'd actually
feels like a pretty decent keyboard now
the keys have real truly nice throw on
then there's that getting yo you're
talking about you've got a full number 0
across the top got your spacebar and
your android buttons here there's your
home button back button menu button
you've got four way arrows and all that
business but everybody saying John turn
it on so I'm gonna go ahead and turn it
on hey baby let's find a power bite on
this guy we're doing always live on
camera here we don't we don't mess
around so there's a power button will do
a quick tour of it hoping that there's
enough juice to boot up let's say
get a quick view that is putting up of
the side and how that slider mechanism
work so it's a single hinge go ahead and
push that back and see it slowly slide
its way down and now I think I'm better
equipped to slide it open again you can
see it's blue look I put it down and I
grab here and I do a little pushing
action I should get this app right open
and it does so it takes a little bit
again you stupid to not bad two three
four times you're gonna be all set so
you can use this for note-taking it's
going to be probably a great tool for
students or business folks you want to
do business business business business
and here we are I just started typing
stuff in android let's go back to the
home screen and go back the tablet mode
here and take a quick look around have a
mood alright thanks i'm in three months
but i can connect it to the internet
let's see what we've got on the sides
here so we got that button which looks
like it's turned off screen so that
happened we've got volume rocker up and
down there's your power button we've got
a micro SD card slot there for
expandable storage this is a brown sort
of soft touch feel to it continuing our
tour around speaker grill and i'll go
over all this stuff up in much more
detail in the review and hands-on i'm
going to do is just a very first
impression just seeing this as i figure
out the tablet I'm like a deer taking
its first steps with this thing there
you've got a USB port which should be
functional 3.5 millimeter headset jack
it's got some feats on it so it's not
going to slide around by its name that's
not why they call the slider I don't
want to pry them off go ahead and cancel
and I think we've got the same issues of
widgets on here that I really liked in
the transformer they're very subtle but
they work very well they don't take away
from the honeycomb experience things
appear to be pretty smooth so I'm going
to go ahead and set this guy up see how
it works and of course full hands-on
demonstration review coming up very soon
sandy in particular that you want to see
you're going to comments down below I
mentioned that
the asus transformer the cousin to the
slider here i was one of my favorite
tablets is actually one of my three
favorite tablets on the market the other
two let's do a real quick size
comparison here here's a galaxy tab 10.1
it shares a same screen size you can see
the thickness so you get a bit of a
difference obviously that keyboard adds
a bit of bulk it doesn't add that much
weight 2.12 pounds is not bad and here
is the ipad 2 so you can make a pretty
awesome tablet sandwich this guy would
not be bad to carry around at a backpack
and tell you doesn't feel all that heavy
it's really not a thin tablet you know
it's not going to win model of the year
anything but it's very very usable you
got that pretty awesome keyboard you
don't have to carry a completely
separate accessory with you if you type
you know quite a bit so on the iPad you
got to carry separate keyboard the eee
pad transformer you got to carry the
separate keyboard and you have to buy
those separate sesor ease this one comes
standard so if you want to use it you've
got that I've got a bit of a bezel on
the side so you can hold it and get your
tablet e fingers all over it so I'm
rambling this is jon rettinger blue
technobuffalo with an unboxing of the
asus eee tab from a pad slider asus eee
pad slider hope you guys enjoyed plenty
more coverage coming up soon see you
guys in the next video
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
