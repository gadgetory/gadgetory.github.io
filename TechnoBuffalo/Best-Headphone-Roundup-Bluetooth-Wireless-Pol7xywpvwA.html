to you by harry's oh man let's see the
music is easily one of my favorite
things to do whether I'm just laying out
in the grass
barbecuing whatever it is especially out
here in Southern California it's always
nice outside so whether you just want to
be convenient at your desk or you're
really into running or all kinds of
other outdoor activities wireless
headphones really kind of matter
especially with Bluetooth as low-energy
as it is today so I figured why not
share with you some of my favorite
wireless headsets that I've been using
as of late so I thought we would start
with these guys these are the mpow
Swift's they retail for about 20 22
bucks you can get them on Amazon in fact
you can even get them for significantly
less niven are in turn got these for 10
dollars on Amazon on a sale with these
you get a surprising bit you get
multiple silicon tips you get quite a
few fins to fit to your ear these
actually go up in the if you've never
seen this before in the groove of your
ear to keep them in they're intended for
some more active stuff they're 10 bucks
they sound better than they kind of have
any right to at that price point but
they're still not amazing you know that
you're getting what you pay for
they're not the most comfortable they
kind of hurt a little bit after you've
had them in for a while and like I said
those silicone tips they just don't
really do it I don't know about you guys
but I have some weirder ears so things
don't tend to fit particularly well all
the time so that's a big thing for me
but at 10 20 bucks
can you really complain probably not
let's go to something a little bit more
little beefier something a little bit
more for your entire head not just your
ears these are the editors keys
Bluetooth wireless headphones these are
anywhere between 40 or 50 bucks on the
higher end of MSRP is 50 bucks so you
can definitely find them all the way
down to 40 there they're surprisingly
surly built it's kind of a very
utilitarian feel they kind of swivel and
move in just the right places but and it
feels stiff enough but flexible enough
that you're kind of at the price point
you feel like you're getting something
for your buck and the sound is actually
really surprisingly full these also
charge via micro USB in fact all of the
charge me a microUSB sometime gonna
bring that up again but they sound good
better than they should for the price
point and considering the build quality
it left me wondering where they cut the
corners so if you're familiar with
wireless headphones I'm sure you know
when you connect to a device you get a
chime or or a woman telling you that
it's connected whatever sounds they
decided to go with for these they must
not have licensed an expensive set of
sounds because they're loud and they're
really low fidelity and they're really
annoying whether you're just turning up
the volume or reconnecting to your
computer after having rebooted it but
for the price it's hard to argue with
them they sound pretty darn good next up
we're gonna stay with the headphone
situation these big mamak Amma's are the
Sennheiser urbanite XL Wireless now
these suckers are incredibly comfortable
they sound fantastic
nice deep rich bass good mids clear
highs there are fantastic pair of
headphones and they're wireless
bluetooth really really good stuff
amazing amazing range you can I can walk
all the way from my desk which is on one
end of the office all the way into the
studio grab something and come all the
way back to my desk and still be
connected listening to my music or
whatever video I'm cutting for you guys
at the time major major quibble with
these major major global this these are
all the buttons it's a touchpad tap to
play pause swipe up and down for volume
side to side for forward and back that
seems really cool on paper and more than
one manufacturer is doing it it's not
just you Sennheiser but it's more
annoying than it is helpful just give me
some really nice physical buttons I
don't need a touchpad on my headset I
just really really don't because you
know what when you go to put your
headphones on what are you doing you're
touching them so your palm touches it
and it opens up iTunes by default and
you see I even just did something on
them it says she just yelled at me for
doing something it's not a fun
experience to constantly have to close
iTunes when I'm in the middle of editing
something so finally my favorite
headphones of all time usually the
jaybird X twos these are the successor
to their incredibly popular blue buds x
from a few years ago and there are
essentially the same therefore the
are pretty unchanged with a handful of
changes to the internals they do sound a
little bit richer the basses sound a
little bit richer to me and the highs
sound a lot clearer on these than they
used to but that might also be a factor
of the tips the old tips were silicone
not terribly comfortable I had to buy a
pair of comply foam tips to finally be
able to get them to stay in my ear
reliably
luckily the x2 is actually come bundled
with the comply foam tips which is a
really big deal considering the price
point has stayed at the standard 180 for
their wireless headphones from jaybird I
love these things not only have they
nailed it with comfort but they are
incredibly versatile as well so you get
multiple sizes of the tips you get
multiple sizes of the fins to keep them
in your ears you get a set of clips for
your wire to normally you can wear them
like this if that's what you want to do
but for me I much prefer to use the
clips to keep the wires nice and tidy go
around the back of your head put them in
and you're good to go and now all your
controls actually hang out right here
against your head with the buttons
facing outward - it's a fantastic
fantastically comfortable pair of
headphones to wear especially I wear
them when I'm working out there's sweat
resistant and the battery life is much
much better than they were on the
previous model I think you get about
four hours more of playtime out of these
so I get one charge I get a week's worth
of use out of them I charge about once a
week and these are just easily my
favorite pair of headphones that no they
did not pay me to say that anyway let me
know what you guys think about these if
you've used them before if you're in the
market right now if you have any more
questions about them let me know I'll
keep an eye on the comments as I do in
all of my videos make sure you could
also reach out to me on Twitter if
that's easier for you at mark and B
otherwise I'll catch you in the next
video be kind to one another and good
bye so I was finally able to actually
use some of Harry's products they were
kind enough to send us an entire kit
took him home last night recorded myself
doing it for you guys so you could see
me actually doing it and you know what I
actually really really enjoyed it it's a
great price for what you get in the box
you get a really really nice face wash
which is actually exfoliating which I
did quite enjoy you get some shaving
cream you get the nice razor with quite
a few blades in there and honestly a
phenomenal handle
and my favorite part of the entire thing
was that aftershave lotion it's really
nice and thick and it works really
really nice and I was I was really
really happy to see I got literally zero
razor burn so if that's something that
you're interested in you can head over
