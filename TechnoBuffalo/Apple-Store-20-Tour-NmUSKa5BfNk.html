technobuffalo here I had a chance to go
check out the apple store two point oh
and I thought I'd share some footage
with you so the employees the store told
me they now no longer have any more
paper certainly you can get a paper
receipt as far as displays goes it is
all ipad so you can see one here for the
mac pro they've got the displays all
around it 17-inch macbook pro go ahead
and see all the options that they've got
on the iPads where you get all the
information there you've got your
features your compare you're new to mac
support you can push the button the home
button although it doesn't do anything
and you can go ahead and paige a
specialist there too i did that and it
took a long time for somebody to come
over and they've got the same ipad
displays for every product in the store
from iPhones to ipad to MacBook Pros
MacBook Airs whatever it might be
everything now has an ipad kind of silly
though there's an ipad flanked by two
ipads maybe that there was a supply
shortage in some countries because they
were hoarding them for the Apple stores
so you've got the two on the middle that
are actually live iPads and that's one
is the kiosk kinda interesting you some
information on the iPads carriers you
can still page the specialists to come
right to you again they've got these for
really every single product so we take a
look at the new 27-inch imac the same
thing it is sort of embedded in the
plexiglass so you can't pull it out but
like i said you can push the home button
kind of neat thought you guys would
enjoy seeing a first look at apple store
two point oh
