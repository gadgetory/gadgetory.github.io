TechnoBuffalo show I'm lime your to host
for today Sean ani editor-in-chief of
the site and i'm joined by deputy
managing editor Todd Hazleton everybody
are you doing today Todd good all those
weren't everyone right now in case I
cough I'm sorry I'm still getting over a
sinus infection but uh oh it's calmed
way down thankfully so we are in the
holiday season and by the way that's why
we missed last week I was coughing way
too much and nobody wanted to hear that
so we are in the middle of the holiday
season which means it's our quiet time
of the year mm-hmm so we're going to
catch up a little bit on what's going on
in the world because there's actually
not a whole lot of news news because
we're in this holding pattern for CES
and a couple weeks which I can't believe
so yes is this close I am so not ready
for CES yeah I'm ready here the holidays
and then CES the worst time well you
know it wouldn't be CS wouldn't be so
bad if they would just I I know they
want to do you know the first week of
January and all that well that this year
that means we have to give up part of
our New Year's weekend to jet off to
Vegas you Jacob and I arrived on Sunday
yeah you know and first thing Monday
morning you get right to it yeah we get
right to it although it and have you
gotten any edge folks we're going to do
a little housekeeping walmart right here
on the show have you gotten any notices
for anything on Monday up yeah I have
some meetings pre reefs and stuff like
that but um yeah the big the big show
that everybody's sort of gonna want to
start to tune in for is on Tuesday
that's a nice day when all the press
conferences are and then throughout the
rest of the week we have meetings all
the way through Friday yeah remember the
other day when we said Oh Thursday looks
clear yeah and within two days i think
it just you know first is that like a
solid block of red on the google
calendar yeah which is crazy i remember
when i was a lot younger
doing this for my first CES isn't stuff
right out of school I would you know I
hadn't been and I I would book these
meetings like with companies i've never
heard of i didn't know how it worked and
i would book them like every 15 he like
back to back with no break so i was
running I mean I was in a lot better
shape back then but I was literally
running from place to place and then you
get there and of course there's always
you know stuff announced and I couldn't
even get to those things because I'd
already had all these meetings booked
for from before and so now it's funny I
mean thankfully you've learned and now
as the show approaches as we've seen the
last couple days all these new meetings
should start popping up and that's again
before we even get there so you have to
leave space on your calendar for things
you don't even know about it yeah I that
was a learning process for me when I was
doing Toy Fair back in the 90s you know
because you well the difference with
typhoid though was at least at that time
you did not get into a showroom if you
did not have an appointment mmm they
just they the very first year I did Toy
Fair I'd had my first toy right up for a
week and all but two companies let me in
why basically throwing myself on their
mercy and the by the second year ago I I
always had my schedule heck I still do
the schedules I print out and hand out
to everybody but by the second year yeah
and then by the third year I started
leaving gaps yo on this day for pick up
appointments and everything else yeah
it's always a fun process but anyway so
now under the actual topics we said we
were going to discuss so we're in
December and we're already hearing our
first iphone rumors yeah which is crazy
I keep thinking too and maybe it's
because it was a 6s year but I keep
feeling like the the you know next year
I should say I keep feeling like the
iphone 6s plus that I have is like much
older than it is i keep forgetting only
guy like two months ago at
september-october november some three
months ago well i feel ya this is a year
the first rumors now that's the right
though with which you know technology
changes also add in the fact the 6s plus
is exactly like the 6 plus i mean right
so mentally you're
I into still going this isn't this the
same phone yeah isn't this like an older
phone but I mean we have seen rumors now
that i think the latest was today it was
following up on the rumors of this
secret taiwan facility that Apple has
where they're working on new excuse me
screen technology and I think the idea
today was from digit times and you know
those reports sort of go back and forth
but the idea is that I guess apples
trying to work on this micro LED
technology it's called it supports it
supposed to compete with oled which is
their organic LED technology so you get
those really dark blacks and the pixels
that I guess don't necessarily have to
turn on they don't need to I don't
really understand how that's going to
differ because to me that they sound the
same maybe it's just you know not
organic its micro but I guess that can
help create a thinner iPhone or or maybe
just the dinner display because we have
to hope that Apple starts to focus on
larger batteries with with the space and
saving itself that ugly battery pack
that it released which is just crazy
years ago on my personal blog I wrote up
a story about right after the macbook
air had been announced you know
everything was getting thinner and
thinner I wrote up a joke post about the
new iPad our new Apple Mac paper or
something like that I called it the
 paper at all i did was take a
sheet of paper and i printed an apple
logo on it and took a picture of that
and i also talked about how i was going
to come with this exciting new accessory
called a pencil yeah so that's real yeah
i know i was ahead of the times but just
this obsession with getting thinner and
thinner and thinner there is a point
where you know everyone mocks me for
having such a large case on my phone I
need something to be able to grab ya
what I'm using it yeah and I feel like I
don't underst I'm not sure but I feel
like we've hit the point where it's thin
enough right like you like why go
thinner what's the point mean at what
point
does it matter how much more than it is
because I would say let's get phones
that have I mean if you can go thinner
go theater and just add the extra
battery so we have phones with two days
of battery life or three days or you
know I don't know but it just doesn't
make sense to me to uh and maybe that's
the point though and I think maybe some
of the the reports the news reports that
are sort of taking these rumors and
seeing thinner display and we also saw
them ditching the 3.5 millimeter
headphone jack for the iphone 7 rumor I
think people are maybe looking at that
and saying oh because they want to build
within her iPhone and maybe it doesn't
mean that maybe it just means that they
need to save space for other things like
the battery so or moral processors
bigger cameras well now here's a quote
you've used devices with USB type-c
already correct just two lumia 950 okay
is it is that connection I I've not had
a chance to use anything with it yet is
that connection any thinner then say
micro USB or lightning no no I see I
think that's where the girls started to
run almost back it looks like a
lightning connector actually and see
that's where they're going to run and
start running into a problem we already
know they're running into a problem with
a 3.5 millimeter headphone jack hmm yeah
because we've seen the patent for the
the new type of headphone connector that
is mind-boggling right but so they are
going to run into a point you know it's
kind of like they couldn't get laptops
any thinner when they still had optical
drives right though you know the optical
drives left well then they couldn't get
any thinner because of the Ethernet port
so they dumped the ethernet ports and
now make us buy that stupid dongle you
know at some point they're going to have
to go okay we really cannot go any
thinner because the device is going to
become inconvenient to the user yeah I
agree I mean I don't want to see them
ditch I guess they could if they have
like the Lightning port we actually see
those they have the headphones
everything throwing eight on our box of
lightning port headphones um so you
could like ditch that or just go
bluetooth which is fine I I still kind
of like having it but I know in a couple
years it won't matter but think about
the other things people are complaining
about like the
amra hump right like as it is just that
little ring but one of the things is
with these advanced cameras they're
pretty thick the modules so that's going
to be an inhibitor and like there's all
these other things so maybe you still
have that bumpin and at the end of the
day like I said like why can't why isn't
thin enough like like this is okay i
don't i don't need dinner I guess it's
my point I know it's almost like phones
are now being body shamed yeah you too
bad yes so we have a question here from
such a Mahal do you think I found seven
will have a USB type-c port I think that
is one of the big questions right now
because we know that Apple did you know
sign on with the type see movement hmm
but we have not seen them really embrace
it yet yeah just with the the macbook
exactly regular macbook yes plausible
and rumors have pointed to it but they
again like they sort of they want 30 pin
to lightning which was a pain in the
butt for everybody and now if they do
this i guess i guess it's a pain in the
butt but it's also sort of the first
time actually it is the first time ever
that Sam um Apple talk about a Freudian
slip that apple would have adopted a
standardized port in its phone right and
which is a good thing well it would
initially be a pain in the butt I think
in the long run it would actually be
beneficial to the consumer yeah because
we're going to have at some point you
know just like I have micro USB cables
everywhere right at some point I will
have USB type-c cables everywhere right
and yeah it's just standing you know you
have it you're backpacking off don't
worry about it everybody's got their
house and oh here we go I have a type-c
cable right on my desk it looks exactly
a hold it up it's exactly like a it
looks a lot like lightning yeah yeah
yeah you know uh speaking of chargers
and all that you've been to England so
you know what they're three prong yeah
yeah yeah electrical port looks like so
one day when I was over there in England
I was going out by train and I thought
oh yeah I'll take a charger with me you
know so i can charge on the train and
that has got to be the most inconvenient
plug type in existence
you know because you can't fold the the
teeth down at all and it's this gigantic
triangle and sure enough when I went to
get off the train I saw there was a
woman that got off and her bag her
shoulder bag was open I just glanced and
i could see yo she too was carrying
around a charger with this gigantic head
on it yes somebody come up with a better
charging system over there good grief
yeah or just put USB ports everywhere
fast ones yeah exactly oh that would be
way better yeah I want everyone to have
USB ports everywhere but so the other
thing we wanted to discuss today and
this is a little out of our yours in my
normal conversations but the yesterday
came out the news that Bungie was going
to add these transactions to destiny
that would allow you to just go ahead
and pay to have a new character
immediately put it level 25 all the
subclasses maxed out and all that stuff
as someone that's been playing destiny
for a year I'm done yeah we were talking
yesterday we both have different
viewpoints so we'll let you you go with
yours and all I agree with you by the
way but I also have my own right well I
the whole point is that getting up to
level 25 was never that big of a grind
but grinding up the subclasses took
4ever ok and so the idea now that
someone can come along and just buy it
for a what was it 40 45 i think and joey
said he found like the you could just
buy the upgrade for 35 technically yeah
because the game if you buy the taken
King it comes with it upgrade it was
cheaper to buy the whole game that it
wants to buy the upgrade which is pretty
funny which made me laugh um I that just
annoys me you know as somebody that has
put hours and hours and hours into this
game now someone can just come along
plunk down money and so basically Bungie
has just told me that months of my time
is worth forty five dollars
basically yeah so yes I I know you have
some other opinions yeah because um I
plead a world aboard the couple years
ago I played World of Warcraft and I
think I got to like level 42 stopped
playing and at the time i worked for
laptop magazine and we even use my world
of warcraft account to benchmark
computers okay and we would run a script
like a legal script it's fine it's just
like it would test the frame rates and
stuff but to do so we had to use the I
forget what they are but it was the
travel way points in the game and you
had to pay money for that so we would
buy gold to like continue which is
illegal but we at it was just for
testing these laptop so we would buy
gold in World of Warcraft unfortunately
on my account it ends up getting banned
right so I go on my honeymoon I meet
this guy and he's like super into World
of Warcraft right and we're like okay
you know like I'll play when I get back
but my accounts banned and he's like
well you can just buy a level 80
character for you know 40 bucks or
whatever it is and then we can play
together and I was like oh that's
awesome and he said yeah you kind of
have to do it because nobody plays at
those lower levels like the servers are
packed but everybody so at this point
the game is so old there's no like new
characters and so that to me made sense
I was like okay right you know if I
can't play with anybody then of course
I'm gonna pay the extra money so I can
at least play with people and then and
then that is the new starting level
because the game is soul but I see the
difference Destiny's not an old game and
I'm sure there's still players at those
level right and does he's not an old
game but also the way the destiny map
system works you know quite often I
would go off to do a daily Downey and a
level three would wander past my top
level character right because they have
a very different mapping system right
right yeah so go two totally different
mouse yeah exactly so I just I don't
know it just it annoys me on some level
because it really it put a dollar value
on all the days of my life I've put into
this game yeah ill and frustrate you and
I just I don't know it's just something
about rub me really wrong yeah and this
is also coming off the back of the fact
that bungee go for a long time said oh
we are going to charge you for anything
but cosmetic changes you know you'll
never feel an obligation to buy anything
and true you don't have to buy another
character right but this is definitely
not just a cosmetic purchase no yeah
it's just pizza or you guys saying paid
a winner yeah so some regards yeah so
what's next oh okay now you've got this
great character oh you know you all
didn't react so badly to that so maybe
we should start selling you guns yeah
that's when Stan that's the worst when
games start going down that road yeah
because then then it begins to feel too
much like free-to-play mobile games
mmhmm yeah so I don't know I just I i
found it a little irksome i am probably
within the last month or so i booted up
ultima online again just for fun to see
what it's like and that's a game for but
i think like 1995 for people of it it
was might one of my favorite mmorpgs and
the economy now in that game which is
talk about erson and sad all these
things um it's like millions of dollars
to buy like super simple things so like
as an old account holder i think my
accounts like 10 years old or something
i think i might have had at the time
like a million gold in my bank oh it's
like an advanced player super wealthy
and that now buys like nothing like
people are billionaires it is just so
funny to see like how a game changes and
if you step away I mean so yeah you
basically have to buy gold in that game
if you want to do anything now that's
how screwed up the economy is oh yeah
edge is super annoying Todd I'm going to
ask you a very odd question are you able
to select questions or only am I see a
question I'll tell you why I'm gonna
leave you with a question real quick
because I got ups walking in the door I
will be right back but real quick from
praising showing me a raison Franco Todd
why have you returned in the last three
weeks I haven't returned anything
I do have to return something I bought a
glass these are my actual glasses but I
bought a pair of glasses on amazon that
are supposed to help with the glare from
a computer because i was getting
headaches from sitting here all day and
I was like oh that's great then I
thought well if I'm getting headaches I
should probably actually go to a doctor
so I went to a lenscrafters and turns
out actually need glasses so I have to
return those but something else I bought
and I was really afraid that I was gonna
have to return to you I still kind of am
but is the the a6000 Sony's a mirrorless
camera and I was just down in Savannah
Georgia taking pictures with it and i
love it so far but i'm super afraid that
a new upgrade hey Sean spec that a new
upgrade is gonna come soon and I don't
want to return because I already like
this but if there's a new talking about
my asics 6000 camera I really like it
but it's long in the tooth and upgrades
probably coming soon and I'm only kind
of discovering that now after having
bought it so I don't want to return it
but I really like it no I said cycle on
camera what's up how long ago did you
buy the camera um like within the last
week two weeks todd todd no but I was
like I don't really care about the
upgrade to pro is on sale at bestbuy
with like lenses and everything okay all
the other that makes oh sweet bundle but
I'm kind of the same way because like I
had a Canon Rebel t3i and then when John
about all-new came our equipment he gave
me a good deal on a 60 B right and yes i
know there's newer ones out what what
are they really gonna do for me yeah i
still have a nikon d 3200 to my DSLR but
it she's bigger and I kind of I've been
looking at mirrorless cameras a lot this
is what we use not with this lens I
think we have much more expensive lenses
in the office but for shooting our
review photos and stuff like that and i
actually bought this um this is a sigma
lens 19 millimeter i bought in the
amazon i think it was like 200 bucks and
i used it for some review photos and
actually i thought that came out really
well and it's not Pinot a
thousand-dollar away yeah well you don't
always need thousand-dollar lenses thank
goodness
otherwise we'd all be broke yeah uh so
moving on to other questions and again
everyone my apologies for having to step
out like that i warn't odd before we
started recording the shows like I know
ups is going to show up during yes it
though I did return something I was
saying i had to get classes and I I
returned a parrot I had bought that is
just for like computer Claire and and
weary eyes they were like 13 bucks on
amazon but those are those they're going
back there still in a box oh good lord
uh from jeff k any opinions on the new
moto leaks i think it's crazy early yeah
that's another phone that's sort of
still knew it was in july but hey if
they're going metal that seems cool the
back reminds me to you there's like the
big camera thing and I mean it's not the
entire camera it's just the design but
though it reminds me of some of the
older Lumia phones so who knows maybe
it'll have a big camera module yeah the
pictures on the site if anybody wants to
this heater hasn't seen yeah that the
giant lens was a bit surprising yeah and
I don't know we don't know how
legitimate it is it's sort of one of
those leaks it could be could be nothing
yeah exactly uh let's see moving on from
braised and Franco is Apple losing their
design town looking at the magic mouse
Apple pencil macbook and battery case
you have to wonder yeah I saw those like
the combo shot was like the pencil
sticking out of the ipad pro and the
lightning cable going in a bottom of the
magic mouse to or whatever it is and
then the battery case and just like all
these things you're like uh it's it's
almost like a joke i did i really would
like to grab somebody from apple and go
in what reality did you all think it was
a great idea to put the charging port
for the mouse on the bottom um and I saw
though Mashable I think had an interview
with Tim Cook and they were saying I
think they said like it's really hard or
I forget the words they used to to take
a mophie case on and off
just not true it's super easy i mean i
think in the older models it might have
been you just like pop the phone now and
so apples like thing is they're
convenient rubber shield that that comes
over the phone and attaches the battery
case and like that's actually like a
cool design and yeah i guess so but it
looks more like a backpack or like a
pregnant iphone i don't know well i
still prefer carrying around yo portable
battery packs so do i all the time yeah
yeah then i can use them on anything
yeah you know instead of using a case I
just I don't know I you really do have
to wonder what's going on at apple and I
never want to get to the point where we
would be saying you know Steve Jobs
would have never approved this yeah I
think we're about there some of the
things he just gotta wonder i cannot see
Steve Jobs signing off on the battery
pack yeah I have a real hard time
picturing that but well to be fair we
can look at Samsung and their weird
keyboard accessory thing that I think it
launched I just haven't seen in person
yet well since the briefings remember
when they announced the galaxy s6 edge+
in the note 5 they had like that it's a
keyboard that slides onto the bottom it
kind of takes up half the screen that's
a weird invention to now I don't just
make fun of both of them evenly uh from
such a Mahal is this last show of the
year if so what do you expect to see at
CES 2016 first head of the days because
of the days the holidays fall on this
year this should not be the last show um
so more than likely we will be back here
for the next two weeks and then we'll
just skip see us week because ain't
nobody got time for a podcast at CES
yeah yeah this is I thought you were
saying the trade show and I was like oh
that's the first of the year no actually
when I first read the kabobs like now
it's not the last show the year uh yeah
but no actually there should still be
podcast for the next two weeks so we
will that that's why we did not choose
CES predictions as the topic for this
week yeah we'll have them leave
yep we will definitely have that for
sure because that's a staple of our our
podcasting year uh from brazen Franco
and this is one that is going to kill me
if it's true doesn't the Ruhr type ID I
iPad yeah yeah be the API I just isn't
the rumored ipad air three feel like a
pointless upgrade no 3d touch and or
pencil support yes all right so I'm
gonna be really really bummed if the
ipad air three shows up in March cuz i
just got ipad here too in october um
yeah if it doesn't have 3d touch that's
gonna be a big big bummer I mean that
seems kind of pointless however as we've
been saying her doing the show I've
started to wonder about something I
wonder if that could be where they
introduce type C and bio s family yeah
that would actually make sense I haven't
even thought of that I pretot you must
be expensive or something too I don't
know but I there has to be a reason it
wasn't included like the iPad pro right
like right it seems like a natural
product to do it on same with us bc
actually on the ipad pro s come over
here yeah but i mean the the ipad has
been the launch pad in the past for new
iphone features so i'm wondering if the
air three could be where type c makes
its first appearance yeah it seems
plausible but i don't appear thank you i
feel like i'm certainly not enough for
me to upgrade unless it's uh unless it's
charging because i gotta say that's the
most annoying thing with tablets these
days it's just it they take forever to
charge man i was i don't use them as
frequently as you do but i was just saw
a trip to savannah with my wife and
brought tablet along and I was like
charging my iPad Mini is just like oh
yeah like I'm just not used to waiting
that long for anything charge those days
I know I was so thankful on my flights
to and from England for my vacation that
I had charging ports
because uh those long flights with a
dead ipad is not fun moving on down the
line so we have a couple star wars
questions I wonder why uh from so
deshawne from Baja hey Shawn what is
your order of the star wars movies
original prequel and are you going to
watch the original trilogy before seeing
the force awakens okay my order is
controversial um I got a new hope fan
right or not that's usually people's
number one isn't it no actually usually
umpires people's number 10 toes new hope
so my order does go a new hope because
I'm sorry if we don't have a new hope we
don't have any of the rest of those so
my order goes a new hope Empire Strikes
Back and this is where it gets really
controversial episode 3 revenge of the
sith then return of the jedi attack of
the clones Phantom Menace Wow yeah so a
prequel makes it into the top three I
know I'm sure somebody's had just
exploded but I while I had a lot of
faults i'm sorry i still have a lot of
problems with he walks uh yeah he walks
annoying me so much but as for where I
think episode 7 will fall I won't know
until I see it hmm although I've read
every spoiler there is to be read oh I
read so many spoilers now let's see here
um well we're not going to read a
question with that word in it folks do
try to keep your questions clean please
this is a family show uh I know it's
it's yeah my puppies here yeah I'm just
thought you know I said family show it
also i just pictured come on kids the
new tech foot buffalo shows here oh yeah
buddy gather around the radio the big
old yo radios from the 40s speaking of
non family shows like
Howard Stern got a five year in a new
five-year contract with siriusxm today
yeah I well hey let's place it that he's
about the only thing keeping siriusxm
going that's what i said in my post I
was like most people I talked to you are
like i have sirius XM only for the
Howard Stern Show and I felt bad writing
that but it's true but now here's the
funny thing though we have sirius XM and
two of our cars I don't think any of us
have ever listened to Howard Stern this
is my favorite time of the year because
uh on Ford becomes all Christmas music
oh nice yeah so I listened to the
Christmas music there's a freeze on for
what is what is 40 s music it's all but
like you two bigs and swing yeah yo type
music yeah but during this time beat and
then there's 50s on 5 60s on six usually
at 90 s online but yep from such a Mahal
what do you guys think of season passes
for games I think they're silly the main
reason being that a lot of times you're
going to get the best deal if you buy it
before you even have the game so you're
buying a complete pig in a poke you have
no clue what you're getting and others
meets you if you end up buying the game
and you end up hating it for whatever
reason hey too bad you very given us
your money for the season pass that's
why I like I've been enjoying
battlefront star wars battlefront I
agree with everybody that says like you
know it's kind of a want to use the word
shallow but it's not like a hardcore
game right like it's pretty pretty basic
um and like I won't buy the season pass
because I I just can't I don't I have no
idea like what's coming that's just so
weird to me I'll buy it later maybe you
know yeah i know i'm not big pain from
brazen Franco fed up with destiny money
grab why not give warframe a shot I have
not heard of warframe I will look into
that was that the free game up guess
where I remember I thought say I have to
look into that thought I'd I'm obviously
going to be looking for a new game since
I'm not gonna play destiny anymore i am
really really annoyed play battlefront
from jeff k Howard Stern rules
been listening since high school Todd
you are amazing now because you weren't
amazing before time you were just
average why shower all the time on TV to
you you were just average Todd now
you're amazing right I want you to start
referring to yourself as Todd the
amazing Todd the amazing guy yeah and
especially at CES I want to hear you
introduce yourself as that at every
meeting you know my business cards yes
exactly well we'll get all new
TechnoBuffalo business cards printed up
for you but you know uh let's see here
from brazen Franco with no word fruit /
rumor on new mobile sock from Intel can
be expected as in phone from the sous
this year oh I think so but probably it
mobile Congress I don't know yeah yeah I
I think they're still good it's still
gonna happen I can't see a sous just
going oh well we're at that you know
we're out yeah yeah I just mmm there is
a rumor on a new system on chip from
Intel though and I think it was the one
that was uh pointing to the possibility
of an x86 processor for a future Lumia I
thought which I mean what would push a
sous into windows 10 mobile territory
which doesn't seem out of the question
but that's the only rumor I've heard in
regards to a new Intel chip her mobile
but that would be so cool because i
think i've talked about this in previous
shows but i always wanted windows on a
phone like an actual version of windows
yeah yeah that would be awesome from
Andre de Silva do you think there will
be a new Nexus 6p second gen at CES will
it be really soon I think it's way too
early first a second gen 6p and then
that's one thing for folks that aren't
that familiar with Cesc us is not
usually a phone heavy show because just
a month later is Mobile World Congress
in Spain yourselves to be a bigger for
the US but not anymore I mean it used to
be a show where
like sprint would say hey we're now
carrying this LG you know flip phone
with a keyboard and a speaker on the
back and that was new and free phones
like that and now as we sort of the
models changed right like we have a
galaxy s6 it launches on all four
carrier four major carriers stuff like
that and so that's why mobile world
congress is the bigger show yeah in fact
carriers don't even have press
conferences at CES anymore well t-mobile
had one last year but wasn't at CES was
it was ill it was offset overlapped with
ctia last year in any case t-mobile did
their first uncarrier actually was at
CES a couple years ago though t-mobile
your craziness from Dennis Langston if
HTC remade the original evo with today's
specs qhd screen 5.5 inch boomed
speakers etc would you buy it um maybe I
mean I like HTC devices I think they
have good workmanship yeah I only gonna
say no because I i'm not a huge sprint
Finn but I need those spring branding
but if it had a quarter in 5.5 inch
display I'd be on board yeah I forgot
evo is a sprint only nothing against
brain I just thought when I use the
service i'm not you know blown away by
but whatever yeah well probably i can't
have an opinion on hun carriers well i
can duck having just left spread after
12 years uh her I'm session Baja do you
think Star Wars The Force awakens will
beat out all the box office records
including Jurassic world ah boy um I'd
be surprised if you didn't but I don't
know anything about movies Jurassic
world did 207 million opening weekend
supposedly they vary pre-sold 100
million in tickets but that is not
necessarily just for the first three
days
my gut feeling is yes it will be that
but you never know I and now I've heard
people going is this going to be the
film that finally beats avatar I don't
know I mean for any movie to get that
high as insanity you know although I
would love to see James Cameron finally
knocked out of the number one spot after
two decades because remember everyone
Titanic was number one before avatar so
how she's gonna say wait a second no no
I I knew somebody was had that question
ready through their head yeah he took
number one with Titanic and then he
knocked himself out with avatar that's
pretty funny yeah so James Cameron
currently controls the top two spots and
it'd be nice if his movies were actually
good yes I said it folks um they used to
be there not anymore I thought avatar
was horrible um yeah I think you can
take the top spot you know number one
opening weekend can it beat number can
be the overall number one only times gon
tell on that one there there was a lot
of things working farm on that whole
Avatar debacle I really hated that movie
I watched it I didn't think much of it
it was Dances with Wolves with blue cat
people that's all it was anyway mmm from
brazen Franco do you think iOS is a
limiting factor on the iPad pearl I
think iOS is a limiting factor on
everything it runs on AA yeah I I do i
think so i think i mean coming from the
surface pro 3 that i have next to me i
think that's a much better by just in
regards to everything you can do with I
mean it's full computer and the ipad pro
is not as much as Apple wants to say it
is it's not I mean but OS 10 on it or
something but not with iOS not for my
money not for that price it's crazy I
think I pepper I I agree with you I
think ipad pro would been far more
interesting if I was tendin bit on it
yeah even as an option right like you
could have iOS I was 94 some things you
know when you don't need a computer
and then OS 10 is dual booting operating
system i mean i would buy that yeah but
I mean that's coming let's talk about we
could talk about the pixel CT which I
haven't played with I don't even know
did we buy one I don't know if we do not
I was tempted Babs like now that's the
thing but there are like these reports
that it was supposed to run like Chrome
OS her like this sort of i mean chrome
OS is not that powerful it's great but
it's not powerful um like this modified
Chrome Android but then they just went
with Android and that would have been
really exciting at least for me yeah
don't knock my chrome OS no i'm not at
all i think it's how you know it's cool
but I don't know I've been a huge fan a
good question here from a keyboard for
which one is that this is just the
surface pro 3 but I bought the new
keyboard the surface pro 4 keyboard
which is so much better I was good that
was gonna be my first question because
folks you haven't lived till you've
talked to Todd while he's tried to work
on the surface pro 3 key parts yeah that
one's in my desk now the old purple 10
drove drove me nuts this one's actually
I actually use it it's great that's
awesome that actually is awesome because
that is our keyboard review insane from
with good reason it sucked from brazen
Franco isn't the Apple smart battery
case of proof that even Apple believes
that the battery on their iPhones is too
small as a really interesting question
yeah absolutely i think that they even i
mean people were asking them that Tim
Cook said oh well it's great for things
like hiking the battery runs out right
because you know that's always where my
brain immediately goes oh my god is my
batter gonna last fall I hike yeah it
was a very California answer Riley yeah
yeah anyway I'm in New Jersey Zelinka
right yeah exactly um you can view it
that way or you can view it as Apple
said you know what while we don't think
it there are a lot of people that do and
they sell a lot of these cases and why
aren't we getting a piece of that pie
yeah that's the unfortunate thing yeah
so
that is a really tough question to
answer but I think you can definitely
view it both ways yeah i think it's an
admission you think it's why i'm sorry i
think it is an admission that they're
their batteries too small in the iphone
6 whether they want to say it or not but
it is and the other thing that's weird
about this is they didn't even take in
like all these design ideas that
companies like mophie have already done
where you have the pass-through charging
right where your phone charges first and
then or maybe this does do that but just
all these design changes like the the
charge indicator is on the inside the
case on the outside which makes no sense
to me and then wait what yeah it's like
it's inside it's in the computer it's
inside the case it's not on the back
like movies is you know that shows how
much are just look but it does have like
on the I can show it I don't know if it
is so you have to take the case off to
see how much charge it has yet will know
their software also okay if you have an
Apple watch you have it on the main
screen you can pull it down but then I
want to say it was something crazy like
that passed through charging where
mophie has it where you can charge your
phone first than that but it's like oh
no it's it's a you can't turn the charge
off right so you put your phone in this
case and your phone starts going down to
like ninety percent or whatever it's
still going to take battery from from
the case as opposed to just we're mophie
you can turn it on and off right like
you don't you let your phone die then
you charge you later in the day or
something which makes a lot more sense
so to me it's those kind of things are
just stupid to that Apple didn't include
maybe their patented I don't know but oh
but yeah so the answer is there are
better options out there too but you
know people are gonna go in the apple
store and just be like oh I should just
buy up okay so there you go oh that is
that thing launch lob is God's I didn't
follow it a hundred percent and so I
some of this I'd missed out on a lot of
this makes no sense it makes that case
make even lessons yeah Oh craziness well
we've got enough time for
one more question and we'll take that
from shipping so many do you think it's
worth buying the Xperia z5 which has a
4k display I think the experience z5 is
a great phone but do you really need a
4k display I there is a point where the
display is just more than your I can
consume yeah well we also we address
this in I think we have the review on
the site we do have the review on the
site but we adjusted the 4k display
doesn't display 4k all the time it it
turns itself on and off so um like in
movies you 4k content in a movie that
you can use it there's not a lot of that
content so it's kind of pointless right
now it's to me it's more just a proof of
concept of bragging rights get a 4k
display I would not buy that phone for
that reason yeah same here I'm not
saying I would not buy that phone
because it hasn't I just wouldn't buy it
solely for that yeah me either well
