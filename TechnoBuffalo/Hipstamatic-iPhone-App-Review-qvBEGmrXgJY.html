TechnoBuffalo yes I'm wearing a black
hats and today we're gonna be taking a
look at hip somatic for the iPhone
Hipstamatic I decided to pick up this
application because a friend of mine
demoed it for me on his iPhone on top of
that it was also Apple's choice for app
of the year in 2010 out of 4 out of 5
star rating 199 in price an app of the
year in 2010 it's hard to go wrong
Hipstamatic is basically a photography
application with a twist it color grades
and modifies your photos with filters
settings and so on but they've set it up
in a way where it looks like the grading
happens before you even snap your
picture which is neat very neat actually
they do this with all of their various
lenses you've got the john esta jim 8
the camel I'm not too sure if I'm saying
that right mark 2 and so on and because
I'm such a photography noob I thought
all of these were real vintage lenses
but two quick Google search kind of
confirmed that they were Hipstamatic
originals anyways you can also change
the film type for even more effects you
can find more lenses and film Baron's in
the shop but they cost real money 99
cents for Shibuya no thank you
I'll stick with the regular settings for
now something I don't like about the
application at all would be the delay
after you take the picture it takes
about and I'm not kidding about 5 to 10
seconds for your picture to quote
develop which is a clever way of
rephrasing rendering after it's done
rendering you can check out your picture
in all of its glory as well as what
settings you've used for that particular
picture not to mention that you can also
share it on Facebook Twitter and even
view it in your photo library
I feel like this part isn't as cool
because the image is a square so if you
want to use the image as a wallpaper or
something you'd have to zoom in I hate
that but the colors are nice so it's so
it's okay overall the application is
pretty neat and it's a unique way to
have fun with your iPhone's camera if
you're into graphics like myself I'd
recommend you save the $2 and buy
yourself something nice like a cup of
coffee some stickers or maybe two things
from the dollar store whatever you like
because you can always just take the
picture regularly import it into your
computer and edit it with Photoshop with
all them fancy filters and everything
anywho I hope you guys liked this
application review if you guys have any
iPhone apps you have in mind that you
would like me to review let me know in
the comments this was john q from tech
no Buffalo and I'll see you guys next
time finis Hipstamatic high five</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
