TechnoBuffalo here I've always been a
big fan of Android from the very first
software built on the g1 to the sense UI
on the hero I've always liked the
openness of a platform of customization
that it offered one application that's
on Android and on the android
marketplace and one that I've really
been admirer of and been relatively
jealous of is a free application called
shopsavvy essentially what it does is it
scans barcodes and gives you some
information on the products it sounds
simple but it's incredibly useful so I'm
playing around with it on this g one
here let me go ahead and show you what
it looks like go ahead and turn the
device back on so go ahead open up shop
savvy and we can search for a product
and it's going to open up essentially
what just looks like a camera
application you turn it in landscape you
pick it up and you see that red line
it's actually looking for barcodes so
I've got some products right here with
some bar codes and I'll show you what it
looks like so here's the box from chill
pill that i unbox a little bit earlier
so go ahead and put this right over it
it automatically recognize the bar code
tells me right there chill pill I can go
ahead and select it tells you a little
bit about the product now some of the
other cool thing that does it hit web
it'll show you where you can buy it and
different vendors that offer the product
which is kind of neat it's got reviews
if you want to go ahead and check
reviews on this particular product
doesn't have any you can save it to your
wish list or you can alert you when the
price is a certain number so let's say
you're looking at the teahupoo it's 38
bucks you don't want to buy it til 230
you put in 30 as soon as a vendor drops
it you get notification it's really
handy let me show you how this works on
a few other products so we'll search for
products I got some stuff here so here
is a moshi monster TKS so go ahead and
scan this one as well go ahead and get a
little better angle for you
recognize the barcode and pulls up the
same information so most you can see our
case 29 bucks pretty neat so let's try
it on a few others so here is the I
power battery backup they reviewed a
while ago it's a really handy product
let's go ahead and try this one will
search for product pulls up the little
camera look at thing see their red line
across it hold it over barcode
let's take it a little while scans it
and lets you know what you go let's try
a few more things I haven't found a
barcode that hasn't worked yet but let's
try a few more I haven't tried use so
here's the box from some old adidas
shoes let's go ahead and pulls back
areas and CMS that is not in a half and
let's see how this works I'll search for
product turn this around
you can see me in the camera product not
found so there is one that did not find
a pair of old adidas sneakers but really
almost everything that's out now in
stores it can find so if you're out say
you're out shopping at your local
electronics store you want to see if you
can get a better deal on a product just
scan the barcode you can see really
right where it's at and if there's a
better retailer right near you it's a
great application especially one that's
free so that's where your favorite
android applications if you're using an
Android device are you enjoying Android
