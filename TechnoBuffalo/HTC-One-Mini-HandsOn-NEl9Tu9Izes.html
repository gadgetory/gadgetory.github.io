TechnoBuffalo here at the unboxing and
first look at the little brother to this
guy it is the HTC One mini clearly we
don't have the retail packaging version
we do have a pre-release early model
that I want to share with you let's go
ahead and take a look and see what the
little brother looks like alright so
here is the box for the HTC One mini
clearly this is not the final retail
packaging but what's inside should be
exciting go ahead and pull it off here
is the device the HTC One mini I've not
yet seen one of these guys in person
inside again it might differ what you
guys get in your retail package we've
got the HTC Wallwork sim removal tool
we've got headphones I know a lot of
people always ask me to actually open
the bag for headphones so I will go
ahead and do that you got read through
beats looking headphones actually be
pretty nice headphones with noise
cancelling mic and some extra different
sized ear gels and then just a micro USB
cord for syncing so here is the HTC One
mini and I'll run you through the specs
so you're looking at a 4.3 inch screen
720p so it's 1280 by 720 giving it a 342
PPI go ahead and peel off all of the
plastic this it feels the same as the
HTC One which is really one my favorite
phones of the year feels very narrow I
kind of like the way it feels in the
hand but it definitely has that same
metal backing to it that unibody design
that it's big brother HTC One has so
I'll go ahead and power it up and while
it's booting up I'll run you through the
rest of the specs Android 4.2.2 jelly
bean and should have HTC's quick boot up
on it as well Qualcomm Snapdragon 400
chips are quickly that thing turned on
one Giga RAM 16 gigs of storage
no expandable slot here on this guy does
have a four ultrapixel camera same
sensor that we see in the HTC One takes
great shots a 1.6 megapixel shooter
lives up front Wi-Fi a tour to 11 a be
GNN Bluetooth 4.0 a non-removable
1800 milliamp hour battery lives inside
it's got NFC and the rest of that's
you'd expect some notes though it does
have a boom sound here which are pretty
kick-ass speakers we saw the HTC one
augmented with Beats Audio let's do a
quick tour of the device on the left
hand side that's where your SIM tray is
going to live it is a micro sim on the
right hand side we got a volume rocker
up and down we have two separate buttons
here we didn't have that on the HTC One
on the bottom that's where your charging
cable is noise cancelling microphone
there is your ultra pixel camera on the
back some other noise cancelling Mike's
going on I've got a back button as much
as you want to push it that HTC logo is
not a button and you've got your home
and multitasking button of course the
camera and some sensors and then the
boom sound speakers so I keep talking a
lot about the regular size of HTC One I
want to bring that in and show you what
it looks like for comparison will turn
the screens off here and you can see the
two guys and they look like just went on
a little bit of a diet I've got a 4.7
inch green here and 4.3 inch I kind of
liked this sort of narrow feel to it
that the phone has a NAT answer this
will come at a lower price point than
the HTC One you can see them on the side
look at the left-hand side the
right-hand side rather both devices you
see the difference of the volume rocker
so we've got one sort of multi button
and then two separate on the one mini on
the other side things you look pretty
similar and on the back all that's
changed is a beats logo is now grey
instead of red on certainly no carrier
branding here since is a unlock device
no word yet if it's going to come to the
US but would expect it to maybe make its
way to us Shores let's take a look at
some of the apps there you've got HTC
blinkfeed sitting on top of Sense 5 go
ahead and change the app weird here
always easier to see more apps you can
go ahead and change that to four by five
now you can see what we've got
I've got sort of the standard HTC stuff
and not much bloatware here at all in
fact I don't see really any bloatware
just usual things at 18 t ships of
devices the setup is great whether HTC
has an awesome backup wizard so if
you're coming from another HTC device
I'll make it really easy to move all of
your applications settings and contacts
over
Google stuff and that is really it
this shaping up to be a pretty nice
device I'm excited to put it through its
paces give it a for review anything you
