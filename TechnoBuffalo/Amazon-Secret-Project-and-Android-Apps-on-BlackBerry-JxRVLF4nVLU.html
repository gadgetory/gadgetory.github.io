to you by audible what's up everyone
walk back the episode of rumor roundup
i'm your host jon rettinger in the
show's title should probably give it
away but this is the show where we take
all the temp emerged from the week you
condense them down into one video so you
know everything that could be coming
might be coming as potential to happen
and might someday potentially definitely
might happen so up this week we're gonna
talk about Amazon's crazy super secret
project nokia might be releasing an
android phone and blackberries got a
couple tricks left up its sleeve this
rumor roundup i'm jon rettinger let's
start rounding things up
let's start with what I consider to be
probably one of the biggest stories of
the week Amazon's crazy secret project
an exclusive invitation obtained by the
Boston Globe a recruiting event this
month in Cambridge Massachusetts
supposedly reveals super secret plans
for a new project that will put the
retailer's line of kindle tablets and
e-readers to shame which is ironically
the same thing that competitions been
trying to do for years the invitation
though doesn't really reveal that much
Simmons usually don't but it does plenty
to fan the flame to the hype machine as
what the next product is going to be all
we know is it's gonna be used to deliver
digital media in a unique way
potentially disrupting the environment
and the whole industry together which
Amazon likes to do so according to
multiple reports the company's been
developing its own line of smartphones
other possibilities though include an
all-in-one smart cutie of some kind of
course sort of the tech news you're a
wearable device baby Amazon's got some
fancy coming soon so if you're one of
the people what's rockin a bb10 device
you already know you can run android
apps on it getting android apps on your
bb 10 isn't super new it's been it's
pretty straightforward sigh loading
process but it looks like android
athlete ready to come through the front
door so evidently BlackBerry's been
pretty quietly asking developers to
upload their android apps directly to
the new marketplace without any
alterations at all this is a freaking
brilliant move I would have loved to do
this happen from day one of bb10 you'd
have gotten through the best of both
worlds i suppose you get you know
BlackBerry's killer email service their
intuitive you know peak features but
also you get the incredible android apps
available there so you ask yourself by
looking at android device cuz i really
like the app selection when you might
get that same app selection on a
blackberry device only making blackberry
way way way more appealing maybe 10 is a
really solid OS but it's been hampered
by poor app selection so this is a
potentially a giant boon to the handset
manufacturer i'd love to see this happen
and happen very very very very very very
like should've happened yesterday soon
for years i've been hearing if only
nokia made android phones they'd be the
bestest phones in all the land well you
overly dramatic person edge reenacted
might actually get your wish so a new
picture of Nokia's android-powered
normally smartphone I was posted on
monday
to our friend a dev leaks Twitter
account showing off the company's array
of famous neon colors we also got a
pretty solid glimpse Nokia's Android UI
which has been forked to resemble
Microsoft's environment on a Windows
Phone it seems like when even Nokia
isn't using Windows Phone they still
want to keep that same unique look of
Windows Phone I would really put this as
a never going to happen type thing
Microsoft is buying Nokia Microsoft
wants to push Windows Phone this would
almost be like giving up a windows phone
if they were to do this junior things
have happened but I would say it is
probably like just a proof of concept
that actually serve leaked its way out
for a little while what you guys think
they looked at your comments leave it
