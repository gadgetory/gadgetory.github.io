TechnoBuffalo here at Mobile World
Congress Nokia just announced the nokia
X the X plus and the XL this is the X
plus and really you can't tell the
difference just wandering around the
show floor here but we had to dig in and
see product name nokia X bus with a dual
sim model so it has slightly more RAM I
believe instead of 512 7 56 and then
slightly more storage on board too but
otherwise software's the exact same it's
running Android Nokia's sort of 4th
version but it does have access to AOSP
so you can install Android apps by side
loading them as opposed directly from
the Google Play Store you can see we've
got the familiar tile interface very
similar to what we saw with Windows
Phone I think and for that matter Asha
as well I've got the Fastlane see what's
most recently opened over here and then
going back you have your own store from
Nokia it's not gonna work today but
that'll be populated by their own apps
and really the the game plan here is to
push Skype and and onedrive and
Microsoft saw their services to markets
where Android might be preferred to
Windows Phone other features makes Radio
you get that here
FM radio you get a month of Skype 10
gigs of onedrive free you can see all
these Android games here alright then
moving around the device just like we
saw on the X got the 3.5 millimeter
headphone jack on the top a little
simple camera on the back no flash micro
USB port on the bottom and then just
this one button here on the front that
switches between the fast drive and just
the home screen there so really
compelling device especially at a lower
price point and it's going to be
available immediately this is Todd
Hazleton checking out the nokia X bus at
