technobuffalo we're here at CES 2015
wear suits just announced a bunch of
transformer book cheap products this is
the really high end when it's at e 300 g
it's the one they're going after the
macbook air wick in terms of the
marketing and what they're saying here
you got the full size keyboard and like
the gene products that we saw today it
also pops off this place you can use it
as either a tablet or a full-size laptop
let's get this back on you can see here
you have the nice beveled edges very
similar to the other ones here but this
one has either it's a core intel core m
processor either one point two gigahertz
or another one that's a pocket 800
megahertz I'm gasps what the sheets
telling us about seems when I slow to us
I'm otherwise Windows 8.1 you have four
gigs or eight gigs of RAM that's just
4.5 inch display here wqhd on the high
end of 2560 x 1440 otherwise you can buy
it with a 1920 x 1080 p display which
will save you a couple bucks i think
it's about a Hyneman boxing Savior intel
HD graphics 5300 under the hood
everything seems to be running pretty
smoothly here for the touchscreen it
doesn't want to go to desktop that way
otherwise you have a 2-megapixel
front-facing camera and they're just not
a camera on the back as we saw in one of
the other models here today but moving
around you can see the Wi-Fi controls
here Bluetooth right up front on the top
of the device is your power button
volume controls are on the left and I
really like this windows bug that kind
of brings you to than either desktop or
back into the user interface or a modern
UI is Microsoft calls it the keyboard
can be charged separately here with a
micro USB port there's also a 3.5
millimeter headphone jack
and then moving on to the right side
looks like USB 3.1 I assume and then
hdmi out and then another 3.5 millimeter
headphone jack or I'm sorry so this is
the dcn on the left side with the 3.5
millimeter headphone jack on the right
so pretty neat both us use transformer
book gt300 just uses tackle on the
macbook here this is Todd Hazleton from
