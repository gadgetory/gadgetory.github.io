TechnoBuffalo here and today we're going
to unbox these guys these are the
earpods that are available now are going
to be included with the brand new iPhone
5 Apple so they are three years in
development to make music sound good
inside of your ears let's go ahead test
them out unbox them and see how they all
work so here is the box with the ear
pods on them it's going to set you back
twenty nine dollars but if you pick up
an iPhone you're going to get
essentially what's inside that travel
case in the box case you're wondering
the models the microphone here is going
to support remote mic supported by Kirk
generation iPod Nano iPod Classic iPod
Touch iPhone and I've had I don't have
one of those models or used one use a
different phone or video player I no
problem of course the audio part of
those will still work go and take this
out of the plastic I just fell right out
uses it in here like this so push up
side for just a minute see what else
we're going to get in the box your pods
with remote mic how much instruction do
you need for earphones put in ear listen
to music plug in to device and that's it
alright so here are the ear pods Apple
said these were about three years in the
making so for three years should be
pretty impressive a relatively light
kind of cheap feel on plastic case but
they do come with the case which is
better than we've seen with previous
stuff so pull it off and let's start the
unraveling doo doo do you know entertain
you with music the cord feels exactly
like the cord from previous generation
ear pods or your phones ever you want to
call them and here are the year parts
your pods themselves a bit of an odd
design you can see this is really where
Apple spent their time I'm not
necessarily what was inside of here with
just a paper cone with a little bit of a
magnet but how this actually sits inside
of the ear there's any sort of cushion
on top of these it's just plastic inside
of your ear
I'm going to put these guys in my head
and see how they feel alright so I've
got the ear pods plugged into an iPhone
we'll go and put them in very clear
which side goes in which you're not
gonna be able to reverse these so go
ahead pop them in
they stick kind of strange in there
since I mentioned there's no sort of
cushion inch of plastic in your ears
it's not uncomfortable at first but I
can imagine over long period of time
they might start to hurt your ears a
little bit let's go ahead and turn on
some music and I have already listened
to these but to give a bit of a
comparison and see how they look they're
not falling out of my head so we'll jump
around you know they're not going to
fall out so if you're walking you're in
conversation you're going to be
absolutely fine from an audio quality
standpoint they definitely sound better
than the earphones that were included
with previous generation iPhones or iPod
Touches but I don't sound incredibly
awesome the knocking sound better than
your beats or your over the ear
headphones they sound better than the
free ones so if you're looking for a
little bit of improved audio performance
it's probably be a good way to go a
little bit better bass but not a giant
amount you're not looking at huge huge
huge improvements well you are probably
an improvement in though is Comfort the
previous earphones really hurt my ears
almost from the first minute and a half
and these ones you know probably take a
little bit longer refrigerate getting
some hear discomfort they do sound good
they are okay in vegas pun intended
yeeaargh anomic for your four years so
the audio is actually going directly
into the ear canal as opposed to having
to bounce around before it went straight
on in so it was worth thirty bucks
yeah I don't know you might better
officing if you could spend $30 on
perhaps a pair of over the ear
headphones to get an improved audio
experience it's decent
but it's not absolutely outstanding but
if you want a free pair of headphones it
comes bundled with your iPhone or your
iPod touch
all these are gonna be a great option
and certainly will work for making phone
calls of course can use it to control
the volume as well so when you guys
think worth thirty bucks you rather just
have them bundled into something or you
have no desire to pick these guys up
whatsoever I'm John write in your for
TechnoBuffalo I'll see you the next
video
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
