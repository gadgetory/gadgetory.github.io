to you by domain.com hey what's going on
guys marklin sang in here from
TechnoBuffalo and in today's episode of
rumor roundup we'll be talking about the
iphone 6c the LG g4 and HTC's phablet
the HTC One m9 plus this is rumor
roundup so let's go ahead and get
started the HTC One m9 plus just became
a bit more real with a couple of new
images coming out of China the images
which followed earlier news of an HTC
press event that will be held in China
on april eight seemed to solidify some
of the specs that late this week that is
if the images are real and we can't say
for sure if they are or not looking at
the images you'll see a home button in
the front which could possibly double as
a fingerprint reader now if you remember
back in 2013 when the HTC One max came
out with its fingerprint scanner on the
back it just didn't work as well as
touch ID now let's hope HTC went back to
the drawing board and fix some of those
issues the One m9 plus is also supposed
to be packing a qHD display which is
something we were hoping for into one m9
other specs reportedly include a 20
megapixel camera a MediaTek processor
and 3 gigabytes of RAM unfortunately it
seems like the one m9 plus is only
destined for Asia at this point but well
of course let you know if HTC says
otherwise on april eighth last year's
iphone 5c may not have been the major
success apple is expected it to be but
Apple is not giving up on the colorful
plastic iPhones just yet a new report
claims in New four-inch iphone 6c will
launch alongside the iphone 6s and
iPhone 6s plus this fall digit times
report that all the new iPhones will
feature Gorilla Glass as expected and
will be powered by Apple's new a 9
processor they're also expected to
feature NFC just like the iphone 6 and 6
plus but it's unclear if that'll be used
for anything more than Apple pay while
digit times has a pretty spotty track
record when it comes to Apple
speculations and iphone 6c makes a lot
of sense it's unlikely Apple we want to
offer the iphone 5c or the iphone 5s for
another year so it may need a new 4-inch
replacements who cater to those who find
a 4.7 inch and 5.5 inch iphone 6s lineup
too big if Apple is not going to skimp
on internals for the iPhone see and
offer the same internals as the 6s I
think people are going to have a tough
time deciding which ones to buy

TechnoBuffalo it's all one word in caps
at domain.com checkout now we've already
seen a few leaked renders of the LG g4
but this morning the first allege real
photos of the device have surfaced
shared online through xda-developers
forum these images may be our best look
yet at the LG g4 now from looking at the
photos there's no g4 braining just yet
but LG's logo is clearly visible along
with the stern warning that the unit is
not for sale we're guessing this is a
mostly finished prototype as the device
seems to be packing full set of rear
buttons and flash modules we're
expecting the LG g4 to sport a powerful
20.7 megapixel camera I beat the 3k
display and a plastic design similar to
what we saw on the g3 now there's also
speculation that the specific device
that was leaked could be the g4 note
instead of the g4 due to that stylist
that was clearly taken out of the device
not to us it looks like a metal antenna
but we'll let you be the judge LG is
expected to unveil the g4 sometime this
spring with April just a few days away
it may not be much longer before we get
an official look at what's shaping up to
be one of the best new phones of 2015
