I just wanted to take over John's review
of the Oppo find five so I have it here
with me I've only had it for two days
because I've only been here for two days
so I'm gonna give you my first
impressions and then I promise I will
have a full review up as soon as I can
let's check it out okay so we have the
Oppo find five here we talked to already
in the unboxing about the lovely design
quality it's kind of reminiscent of the
older experience I've been hanging out
with it the last day or so since I got
here and I have a couple of thoughts on
it the first thing you'll notice about
the Oppo is obviously the the UI the
Android skin that they've chosen to put
on is it's a little reveal this calendar
widget is I just find the the widgets to
be just a little bit kind of amateur
compared to a TouchWiz or even
especially since obviously with the
widgets you can always install something
like beautiful widgets HD widgets any
any widget app of choice and and just
get rid of these which is really nice
and I'll talk a little bit about
CyanogenMod in a second the phone itself
though runs really responsively it's a
quad-core processor it's running on a
Qualcomm Snapdragon pro it's got 2 gigs
of RAM it's running Android 4.1.2 so
almost the most current version of
jellybean but not quite I know that Oppo
is promising rapid software updates that
kind of remains to be seen at this point
but yeah the screen is absolutely
gorgeous 1080p 441 PPI it's an IPS LCD
screen it doesn't get super bright but
it is visible in broad daylight which is
nice and the images are very clear I
love the almost edge to edge screen here
it's a 5-inch screen so you're
definitely carrying around quite a bit
of phone in your pocket if if that's
what you're into
let's take a look really quickly at the
the camera which I'm really interested
in
I love camera apps and I like how
different they are so you can see with
the shutter it's very quick and once you
go into your gallery
I'll show you some of the stuff that I
took at my desk earlier so I've got my
iCade my nyan cat and my robot so
there's it's very quick shutter quality
the one nice thing about oboes camera
software is they have this really sort
of lovely editing features where they
have things like fill light highlights
shadows and they're actually really nice
sliders that's the auto fix there but if
I wanted to emphasize the highlights I
could do that with a slider if I wanted
to add some more shadow I could also do
that so I like that they also have
different effects so very Instagram
--is-- you can do your vignettes all
those sorts of things and there's also
of course warmth saturation all those
great things that you see a little bit
more granular than Instagram but
generally speaking pretty robust I like
it I do miss photosphere I will admit
that but I guess that's on Google and
not on all of the other OEMs putting
Android on their phones now the the
phone itself is actually unlocked it's
available on AT&amp;amp;T and t-mobile it starts
at $4.99 there's a 16 gig and a 32 gig
option there is no expandable memory
though that is something that you might
have a problem with there's also no LTE
on this phone so you cannot actually
utilize LTE I do think upon first
impression putting CyanogenMod on this
phone would actually be really great and
it's something that you would probably
really enjoy
I'm sure the screen would look gorgeous
with some of the the different roms that
are out there I
I definitely don't see any feature yet
that I would really miss if I if I
routed it and put flash a different ROM
on it as opposed to say the HTC One
which I would definitely miss things
like video highlights so far the Oppo
find 5 it feels like a really solid
phone I think there's a lot of good
things about it
unfortunately it kind of feels like it
was built with an entirely different
market in mind which is probably the
case because this is a this phone is
going to be really popular in China I'm
not sure why it was brought over here to
the States but at the end of the day I'm
sure they're you know of course it'll
have its pros and cons
and I get to now review this phone so
I'm sorry it'll take me at just a little
bit longer I know that John was supposed
to review it but I took it over I took
the phone from him because I thought it
looked really cool so I will be bringing
you a review as soon as I can as soon as
I unlock all of the find five secrets
but for now that's my initial
impressions my my hands-on and if you
guys have any questions leave them in
the comments and I will try to answer
them in the review thanks
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
