Instagram invitations to an event Xbox
one's profanity problems are dead rising
3 review and house of cards season to
get to premiere date it's Buffalo
bulletin time hello internet and welcome
to the Buffalo bulletin where we recap
five major stories from our site
TechnoBuffalo calm every tuesday and
friday if you're interested in reading
more about any story i mentioned on the
show check the description for links or
click on the graphics for each story if
you have annotations available and
toggled on i'm ashley sceva here your
top stories good news for Nexus 5 fans
the KitKat 4.4 point one update went
live yesterday introducing some major
camera improvements that should make any
nexus 5 owner happier with the pictures
their phone have been taking the update
tout software tuning that includes more
natural colors faster white balancing
better low-light performance and quicker
focusing and shutter speed it's an
over-the-air update with roll outs
already in place and happening but if
you can't wait for the update you can
grab four point four point one directly
from Google Instagram in the news this
week after the facebook-owned company
sent out an invitation to an event next
week on December twelfth the invite came
via the postal service which was
delightfully retro of them and included
an Instagram shot printed on a 4 by 4
inch wooden square it seems to suggest
some kind of first-party printing
service is about to launch but I like to
think Instagram is going to go full
hipster and be in running completely
offline using reclaimed wood stone and
metals to chisel pictures into in gaming
there's been some heated discussions
happening regarding the Xbox one's
Kinect and how much it's actually
listening to you a couple days ago
reports started coming in that swearing
while playing a game in NBA 2k14
resulted in technical fouls being issued
people then reported they've been
suspended from xbox live for swearing
during private skype conversations which
what
okay I'm fine we're fine it's fine also
in gaming we just put our dead rising 3
review online written by the one and
only eric frederiksen what's the verdict
well according to Eric the writing is
pretty terrible but overall the game
stands out as one of the first truly
memorable titles on the Xbox one just
like the original dead rising stood out
shortly after the xbox 360 launched what
the zombie mayhem commenced lastly our
wildcard story today is a little bit of
entertainment news again but this time a
good release states story it looks like
Netflix is highly acclaimed series house
of cards will take its second season bow
on februari the 14th of next year of
course that's also Valentine's Day if
you celebrate it but honestly is there
any better way to spend time with your
significant other than watching Kevin
Spacey manipulate people like a puppet
master now I don't think so that's the
Buffalo bulletin for today if you
enjoyed the show give us a thumbs up it
would be super awesome of you and if you
