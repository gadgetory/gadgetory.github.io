here at they knew demonstration for you
of itunes eight-point oh as you can see
I've got itunes a point 0 here open up
on my desktop and the first thing you'll
notice is this new gridlayout that
allows you to view your albums by
artwork it's broken up here by albums
and sorted by artists genre or composer
now if you go to artists one thing I'll
show you is you only see one artist
problem which is very interesting if I
spits I scroll up here you can see all
my different albums let's say I go to
green day for example you notice that
the different albums show up as I move
the mouse so I've got multiple albums
there in one window so that's the first
you'll notice that's different the
second thing you'll notice is over here
on the right hand side this atom looking
logo which now signifies genius called
the genius sidebar and over here on the
left hand side under playlist you'll see
a genius playlist so I'll show you what
that does let's open up the green day
and you'll see now that it's all sorted
by by artists and albums so here out
different various albums let's scroll to
one song here off of let's say American
Idiot for example and I can click click
a song and I'll just pause act I don't
want getting any copyright issues but
once you play a song you'll notice that
it's medially populated on the sidebar
by recommendations and similar songs
that you can purchase on iTunes that's
the apple cloud recommends for similar
John Ryan song so you can go right here
and easily just by one of those songs if
you'd like the next thing you'll notice
down here this little genius icon if you
click it it'll pull up songs on your
playlist that are similar to the one you
just played and the more people that use
the genius playlist the more accurate it
will get so I'd played a green day song
and they pulled up other songs by
greenday some random other tracks that I
happen to have in my library so I expect
it to get better as time progresses
nothing else really major the big
changes in itunes 8-point oh is that
playlist and this new grid view which
again you can just scroll down and see
your different videos and music anyway
guys this just a real quick
demonstration here of itunes eight-point
oh do a further review on it as i use it
so far I seem to be stable and seems to
be a great way for Apple to make another
buck or two with this easy to buy genius
sidebar here all right guys jon
rettinger with john for lakers calm and
i will talk to you guys soon bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
