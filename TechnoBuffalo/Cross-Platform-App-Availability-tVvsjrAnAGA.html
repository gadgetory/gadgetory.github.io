to you by AMD what is up YouTube welcome
back to their pursuit of rettinger
trance I'm realest John Wren just a show
where I get super red-faced and I ranked
about something that's going on in the
world of technology up this week I want
to talk about app developers and making
apps cross-platform I'm looking at you
Instagram and I'm talking to you Windows
Phone users this is retinas rants let's
get our antes in a bunch before
everybody gets so mad and hurt and gets
all complainy that I'm talking about a
mobile platform because one's better
than the other just hear me out cuz it
affects every user of every platform app
cross development why aren't the major
apps available on every major platform
I'm speaking specifically about
Instagram and i'll talk more about app
development time the coding language and
all that kind of stuff I promise but the
Instagram one in particular I do not
understand right now there is not an
official Instagram client on Windows
Phone now you might say it takes a lot
of time and research develop a Windows
Phone app but I totally get that and I
agree with you but here's the catch
Microsoft actually owns one point six
percent of facebook which owns Instagram
they put in 240 million dollars back in
two thousand seven that would almost be
like the not being a skype app on
Windows Phone I just don't get it that
Instagram got all red mercury and
started crossing off from getting rid of
terms of service try and force some
unofficial third-party Instagram apps
out like instance for instance so really
just doesn't make any sense why would
Microsoft why would Facebook not
Instagram leave advertising dollars on
the table since you got finished of
Instagram yes now what about 6-8 months
ago there are ads all over Instagram and
mobile advertising is huge they're
leaving all that completely done now I
understand the time it takes to develop
an app let alone support a nap but at
least we're these one application then
leave it for six monthly it for 12
months you have to get every single
iteration that iOS and Android might but
at least develop an application that
people can use at least have some of the
features I just don't get it I'm talking
about the big at development houses to
clearly have the resources certainly
we've seen Facebook's ridiculous
valuation their share
is now back up to what their IPO level
was so they got cash in the bank now I
get small third-party turn on the
resource developed for iOS for android
windows phone a blackberry I understand
not putting out cross platform for those
you should always have the time to
develop the coding language is not
overly similar for all of them so you
have to really develop from code base 0
all the way up twin your completion for
each encyc an understand that now
there's one cat which is kind of fun
blackberry and bb10 it has a trick up
their sleeves while there isn't really
official Instagram clients for bb10 you
can do some pretty cool things like
sideloading Instagram right onto bb10
like I said you might not get the most
recent version applications because it's
not supported you can get a version that
works you can't do video on there and
that's all right at least you can do
pictures at least you can like photo as
long as you can find friends all that
other good Instagram miss but
unfortunately you just can't do that on
other operating systems you don't have
that sort of based on that linux kernel
let me take a minute to thank our
friends and sponsors at AMD i want to
thank our friends at AMD and show you
the latest this is the acer aspire touch
this bad boy combines performance and
mobility in a small screen touch
notebook it is extremely light and
really powerful the AMD elite mobility a
for APU helps deliver the touchscreen
convenience of a tablet with a true
notebook experience know when you just
need that clickety clack of a real
keyboard also it's lightweight and ultra
thin so easily slip in a bag you don't
forget it's even there so my favorite
feature by far is AMD steady video
technology it's actually really cool so
what it does it's a video playback
toilet actually designed to eliminate
shakes and jitters during the playback
of home video I got a baby coming and
I'm all excited gonna be video encoder
make that look like I got a nice steady
surgeons like hand thank you to our
friends at MD why can't we have
cross-platform applications for the
major applications would seem like
they're just leaving money on the table
maybe I don't understand the development
that goes behind these things and if I
don't leave them in a comment down below
I want to hear your thoughts about them
