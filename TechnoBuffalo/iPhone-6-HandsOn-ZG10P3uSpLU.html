TechnoBuffalo here we're taking a first
look at the just announced iPhone 6 the
little brother if you will to the iPhone
6 plus so a lot of new things here the
big difference of course is the design
you're gone up from a 4-inch screen to
now a 4.7 inch screen you've got now
glass it wraps around and that doesn't
sound like much or as you go and swipe
it feels really fluid you're not hitting
it's over a really rough corner as you
go through it go ahead and look at some
things are different here we've got a
new improved 8 megapixel camera it has
digital image stabilization built in
that band across the top is now NFC oh
you do still have all that FCC stuff
across the bottom this design does look
very familiar that's what we've seen
over the past few months on the left
hand side you see where your recessed
volume buttons are gonna live I've got
your serve now classic Apple profile
switch I've got the new and improved
touch ID on the right via power unlock
fun has been moved and that's where your
SIM slot is going to live call on the
bottom view clembot maloom your headset
jack microphone lightning port then of
course your speaker girls the phone
looks and feels really really nice in
the hand and insert that 4.7 inch screen
size to become more standard for phones
and apples kind of now join the fray
you've got improved resolution at the
same PPI that we've seen here with the
iPhone 5s Apple pay is here on board as
well it's gonna live inside a passbook
it's gonna encrypt all your payments and
that kind of stuff and create an own
private to create your own sort of
secret code to send to the merchants
they won't know any of your personal
information so no one's going to see it
to make your credit cards much much more
secure it's just been a first look at
the new iPhone 6 it's gonna be available
on the 19th for pre-order on the 12th
