and it's got my name on it it's been so
long since I've experiences and yet it
feels so familiar what's up everybody
I'm Noah see right there Noah Kravitz
from TechnoBuffalo we should write that
on there just so everybody knows Tech no
Buffalo believe it dad you say believe
it and this is the htc inspire 4G for
AT&amp;amp;T all right it's the inspire 4G it's
the first of this new wave of 4g phones
that were announced CES to actually be
in our hot little hands and it's the
first 4g mobile phone offered by AT&amp;amp;T
now AT&amp;amp;T is calling hspa+ 4g which
apparently it now is according to the
itu I'm doing an article on 4G and what
it means and everything I've had to
rewrite it like nine times so trying to
you know get around like what it really
means to consumers and they keep
changing it and everything but anyway
it's the first 4g phone from eighteen t
will be available februari 13th for 99
99 on two year contract so 100 bucks for
a pretty high-end 4g phone running
android 22 with HTC Sense on it I
believe it's the new version of sense
big screen everything you know not about
deal as far as these things go of course
you know it's your monthly fee that's
really going to get you not 100 bucks up
front anyway inside the box you get the
quick start manual you get the phone
texting and driving it can wait
seriously do if I ever see any you
texting while you're driving i will not
be happy i'm not going to you know do
anything because you could probably beat
me up but seriously just don't text and
drive it's not it's not worth it it's
dangerous to you it's dangerous to other
people on the road and it doesn't matter
if it's that important pull over to the
side of the road and then deal with it
anyway there's a sim card in here which
is good because i can power it up so we
will do that 4.3 inch screen 8 megapixel
camera with HD video dual LED flash on
the back it's got the Dolby mobile the
SRS wow sound system so let's open up
the battery cover those of you who have
followed my dubious career as a phone
reviewer know that this is often the
most entertaining part of the video
where Noah tries to figure out where the
battery cover is on the phone and how to
open it I may just give up on this one
and read the directions I think I'm
going to it's too it's probably very
easy to e to do which is why I want to
just read the directions instead of
flowing around with it insert your sim
card of micros they push the bottom
cover how to remove it see so easy just
push out
look at the head easy as pie all right
so sim card they wrote the number on the
sim card so Lola will hide that you've
also got your microSD card slot in here
what's inside there an 8 gigabyte
microSD card get that back on there see
I'm so why do I feel so hard with
battery covers all the time you would
think now that I've done there well
powered up power button on the top we
powered up is there any power in here or
no in the box you've got the AC adapter
with the u.s. plug is she sees a global
company I'll see the batteries not even
it that's why it's in power huh yeah
you've also got your micro USB cable and
the battery of course these are on the
HTC biodegradable corn starch based bags
I'm really psyched that they do that
that's pretty cool what's the power
rating on this battery 1230 milliamp
hour battery there you go so now I have
to figure out how do I get the battery
in
alright so powering up I don't know if
there's enough juice in the battery
right now to really do anything with us
when we have to plug it in the wall but
while it's firing up 4.3 inch Super LCD
display so super LCD is kind of
counterpart to Super AMOLED and you know
having to do with availability of
screens and all that stuff you know
whatever it's it's the new display tech
on the bottom you've got four capacitive
touch buttons your android buttons on
the back 8 megapixel camera with HD
video capture dual LED flash nothing on
the right spine on the left spine you've
got your volume rocker switch the evil
battery cover on the top your power lock
switch on the bottom micro USB port and
three and a millimeter headphone jack
the screen is locked you can see I'm in
h plus range for g h plus now my
powering down my ad better oh no we're
good okay so select the language using
on-screen keyboard transfer data so you
know HTC is always nice with the set up
the set up directions here you know
pretty good for you know folks who
either aren't used to setting up stuff
or just you know it's just nice its
consumer friendly internet connection

you an option if you don't have a data
plan that's cool automatically sync data
yes set up Wi-Fi network all right we're
connected Google location you know sure
location can send for HTC sense Oh for
Google's location to collect anonymous
data yeah it's fine HTC Sense do I need
to set up an HTC account I guess I do ah
alright i'm sewing up
so I've got to agree it determine my
location automatically I've got to agree
to the terms and conditions and I'll set
up an account Noah don't call me whoops
try that again so here's your on-screen
keyboard you can see it I've got a
haptic feedback going as i'm typing
feels pretty good email address i had to
create an account o wants me to a
security question i have to type one in
