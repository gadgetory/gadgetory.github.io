took the wraps off of Chrome OS I want
to explain to you a little bit about
what it is and put to fire some rumors I
may have been spreading about Chrome
operating system so first Chrome OS and
chrome the internet browser are two
distinct properties think of it like
Internet Explorer on your pc and using
microsoft windows as your operating
system two distinct form two distinct
products Chrome OS and Chrome browser
while they share the same chrome name
are two distinct products Chrome
browsers the fat Internet router that I
can use on PCs and soon to be released
publicly on Macs and chrome OS is a
complete operating system that's going
to be coming sometime early next year
google just unveiled bits and pieces of
it today not even a beta or an alpha
build just sort of peeled back the
curtain just a little bit let's talk
about Chrome OS and what's new and neat
about it some things that you might be
looking forward to so one of the things
about Chrome OS is that nothing is
stored on your computer it is a
completely cloud-based operating system
and with that term cloud-based means it
just means all your files are stored on
a network server think of it like if
you're using google documents for
example which is obviously going to be
very heavy into Chrome OS those
documents are actually stored on your
computer they're stored somewhere else
or abused gmail and you log into your
gmail all the time those aren't stored
on your computer those are stored on
google servers this is going to be in
much the same way so if you've got a
friend running Chrome OS and you're
running Chrome OS all you need to do is
just type in your username and pass for
not his or her computer and you're going
to see your full desktop with all of
your applications settings files and
folders so it's a very minimalistic
operating system it's not as full
featured as Linux windows or OS 10 it's
mostly for those people who use the
internet and use web-based applications
Chrome OS looks a lot like chrome it's
got the same sort of tabbed interface
across the top and i'll put links in the
sidebar to videos that Google is put out
about Chrome OS in case your interest I
can't put them in here but if you want
to check them out you can
do it there so you're going to have a
full menu array of I constant
application choices primarily Google
properties so things like Google Talk
google documents and things along those
lines google chat will all be played
very heavily you're going to have what's
equivalent of a start menu or your
Applications folder where you can drag
and open up these things called panels
panel's open up other windows they could
expect the pending operating system you
can minimize as I move them around but
essentially what you're working with is
in a browser with applications running
on top of it and they're all web based
applications running on top of it so
think about back when the iphone is
first released now hold relying heavily
on web apps this is sort of the same
thing there aren't any native
applications that are going to be
downloaded or installed on your computer
everything has got to be installed to
this cloud so but let's say you've got a
digital camera or something for example
when you want to pull some of your
pictures off it while you're using
Chrome OS an email not to a friend or
even make some edits on picasa or
facebook but you can still do that
because it is still an operating system
so all you'll do is you'll plug it into
your USB and you can navigate to it just
as you would anywhere else except
instead of dragging those files over to
your desktop they'll be dragging them
over to a cloud server it is the big
difference there's been a few cloud
offering systems that have come and gone
but nothing has really been a mainstay
or had the marketing dollars or pushing
power of google right now but will send
the arcanist support this is sort of a
get geeky on you the x86 and arm CPUs
they're also saying it's only going to
be able to be installed on a flash-based
hard drive so solid state hard drives so
no spinning platters although I'm sure
there'll be ways to get around then
Google is making this a completely open
operating system so a lot of access to
the source code people will be able to
change it any way they want I wanted to
give you just sort of an overview of
Chrome operating system so you can
understand what you're going to be
hearing a little bit it's a web browser
with applications built on top of it
when you're using it it looks just like
chrome with a little bit of tabs for the
upper left hand corner with some of your
applications so guys hope you found this
useful I'm really curious what you think
about Chrome operating system whether or
not you find it useful not useful
whether you want an OS in the cloud or
whether you don't
for us and always in the cloud leave
text or video responses i'm just very
curious what here you guys have to say
anyway i'm jon rettinger from
technobuffalo and i will see you in the
next video boy</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
