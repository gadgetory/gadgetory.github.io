to you by Harry's and mi beaver brush
what's going on everyone we're just
casually put a desk in the middle of our
office to talk talk about some new Nexus
phones that just that just came out so
I've been testing the 6p I've been
testing the the 5x and so we figured
instead of me making a video my
impressions and mark making a video we
just kind of do one together yeah
and share our thoughts and impressions
on both phones so far before our review
and then if you guys have questions
about things we don't cover then you can
ask us yes let us know we were gonna do
a full on livestream Q&amp;amp;A but it did not
quite work out no that way instead we
compensated with just a lot of cameras
yes yes lots and lots of cameras so so
6p 6p I got a ton of questions people
ask me about the weight because the
little tiny hum from the top didn't make
a difference it does not feel top-heavy
to me okay like moderately but no more
than really any other phone right this
one feels light the the 5x feels really
really really light and and that's
saying something because the old one was
to just do you want it you want to hold
these up together do you want to feel
though it feels it feels identical in
the hands to what the original five it
feels like the like younger better at
sports brother
but like it's those two years ago yeah
and so now it's almost so light it kind
of feels a little cheapish I don't know
that I would say cheap but I would
definitely say I'll say it fits right in
line with like the budget line of phones
that we've been looking at anything in
this price range I think people are
gonna be perfectly happy in fact this is
kind of like above average for billed
for that price right and the build on
this is awesome I've never really used
many Huawei phones in all candor yeah
but it feels awesome
it looks nice too Lucy thinks so too she
also thinks Lucy thinks it looks awesome
you had the black on that one looks nice
yeah I love to cover that Google sent us
okay so fingerprint sensor on the back
anchor print sensor you like or don't
like I I think I like it there I think
it does exactly what they said they
wanted it to do you pull it out of your
pocket by the time you're looking at it
it's unlocked it's almost like my lock
screen is obsolete I never saw my lock
screen I will say it took a while to get
used to be I like to put my phone down
on my dance move I'll put my thumb on
any one of those yeah and I'll look at
the screen right but now you got to sort
of pick it up and put your finger on the
back I missed because I was just using
the Moto X I miss
a lot of the X features like that would
be totally ambient sensor exactly so if
I could just wave over it I agree I will
say though I got used to the sensor on
the back yeah and it is really accurate
stupid it takes like eight seconds to
setup so I thought that maybe it was
gonna be not accurate yeah setup was so
simple but it's fast and a cool thing
too
I noticed any time I wash my hands if I
try and unlock a phone whether it's
touch ID or one the same thing devices
it has a fingerprint sensor whoever
worked for a couple minutes afterwards
this one worked I didn't have any
problems that was watch my hands
I was cooking a bunch of the weekend I
was I don't know doing other hand things
like video game yes yes she's gonna let
your imaginations run wild and it had I
didn't have any issues with it
whatsoever and you're absolutely right
the pairing process seriously takes like
five taps maybe yes super fast and and
and you're done you're good to go so on
I think the more I usually I get used to
on the back and not even really like
notice I'm totally fine with it how was
the display on yours uh maybe I
shouldn't I've seen so many qet displays
now it looks good yes it's a good
display nano 1.2 everything it was bad
except in direct sunlight
really I was outside at the park with my
son trying to take pictures and I
couldn't even see the screen to see if
he liked this in full in full focus I
had to pull it all the way up to full
brightness before I could okay see
anything okay but there's a phone at
full brightness then deposit take a
picture is let me launch a camera you
can do by just double tap on the home
button I did enjoy that
ordell tapping the lock button yeah but
then you got a pole brightness all the
way up the crane direct sunlight I will
say about bringing up the camera with
that button so so that's another thing
that I really missed cuz I was just on a
motor device so I miss being able to
flick and I missed the chop for the
flashlight but bringing up the camera is
that's a really nice helpful little
flare
the only thing is that or if you notice
it locks the device again so even if
it's unlocked yeah you can't swipe in to
see the rest of your photos anymore so
I'm not sure that was the best
implementation of a shortcut that I've
ever seen it's handy then you put it
back in your pocket I think was the idea
take your picture and actions done
we're finished here so um how is your
screen though so this is yeah my screen
is weird
it's okay I when I did the unboxing
looked at it thought this green looked
great it looks good for the device that
it's on
I just miss an a backhand it come I know
I get that you know it's you're handsome
for you
okay wouldn't you screen it looks nice
look it's a great display I don't mean
to say that it's a bad display it's just
obviously this is the lower end device
but you can't I mean it's not fair to do
it's not apples to apples everything
start screaming right right it sounded
same comparison in the context in the
context of what this device is I think
it's a good display I miss AMOLED though
that's fair yeah um I haven't not had a
chance to test the camera really out yet
aside from seeing how fast the autofocus
worked yeah and that was pretty fast so
before the review hits I'll test it more
did you get chance to my camera was okay
so the shortcut was again really really
helpful
I did find and this kind of leads into
the next thing I did find a little bit
of sluggishness here and there I want to
put this like and be totally fair with
it because I want to like this device I
really do but everyone's especially
after I got everything set up yeah super
stuttering that's easy laughter I can
808 and this is it right should be
plenty fast she'll be plenty fast like I
said I just came from the Moto X I
didn't have those issues on it there but
bringing up the camera I've missed quite
a few photos already from this weekend's
you I had no speed issues at all this
thing was fast and I know it's got the
810 so everybody's freaking out about
speed but it's the two-point one
iteration yet it never got his feet oh
yeah okay so I want to talk about
battery but also you know I feel like we
know each other pretty well
yeah my shave bro thank you actually
this morning smooth are you it against
the grain or never against the grain and
it doesn't really matter what I do
because this morning I got some razor
burn anyway because I wasn't using any

except for John but what if people want
to try your beaver brush so last point
how's your battery life battery life is
exceptional I've been going through a
full day and plugging it in for probably
half an hour 40 minutes and fully
charged again I mean getting about a day
and a half of usage I have a couple of
graphs and I'm sure we'd be happy to
throw up on the screen maybe I was using
mine I know yesterday I probably had
think about two and a half hours of
screen on time but time I plugged in at
the end of the day I had like 55% better
battery life has been really good 55 is
high doze all about that goes the doze I
think really seems to be making a
difference I'm ending days around 15% so
I'm definitely feeling a bit of a
difference there I think you've got more
capacity right yeah it's bigger pack
yeah so we'll wrap this up yeah we're
gonna talk a lot more about the phones
