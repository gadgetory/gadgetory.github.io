to you by domain.com PSA time guys we've
got a little bit to talk about so once
you go and have a seat there is a
problem right now in the USB situation
obviously lots of new devices are coming
out these days with USB type-c ports but
there's been a little bit of confusion
about this new kind of universal
standard over the weekend I spent a lot
of time on Reddit as I tend to and I
happen to see that an engineer from
Google Benson Leung I hope I'm saying
his name correctly was on a bit of a
crusade and he was running around Amazon
leaving reviews on cables specifically
USB type a 2 type C cables since we're
using a lot of those these days and
leaving positive or negative reviews on
them depending on whether or not they
meet USB type-c spec which if you know
anything about it you know that Google
is in charge of USB type-c spec means
that you need to be able to handle a
certain amount of output and input and
for the resistors in the cables to be
able to let the phone know exactly how
much power it should be able to pull
cables that don't meet spec don't
correctly use a 56 kilo ohm resistor to
let the phone know how much power it
should be pulling and what that means is
that you're going to wind up pulling
more power on your phone then your
charger can actually accommodate for
since the cable isn't telling your phone
how much power it can actually pull when
you plug a type-a to type C cable into
let's say a 2.0 amp charger and a Nexus
6 what's going to happen is the Nexus 6
since the cable is telling the Nexus 6
that it can pull power as if it were a
USB c2c cable that can handle all the
way up to 3 amps your phone is going to
say ok cool cable I trust you and it's
going to start pulling power at that
rate despite the fact that the charger
can't actually handle it what that's
going to mean is you risk doing
significant damage to your charger you
can actually blow out the USB port on
your charger entirely which means you're
going to have to buy another one of
those now Benson was kind enough to
leave good reviews on the good cables so
if you head to Amazon you're looking to
buy a USB type a to type C cable for
yourself for all your brand new type C
devices you can head to Amazon and do so
you can pick up a cable from
they do great stuff you can pick up a
cable from Belkin obviously very trusted
name in the industry and you can pick up
a cable from I or enjoys a handful of
other cable manufacturers as well but
you can go ahead and check all of that
information will be in the description
and probably hovering above me at some
point as well you might also be sad to
learn that basically my favorite cable
of all time the one plus cable that they
make uh from Taipei to type C is not us
types USB type-c compliant which I'm
really bummed about except really really
love these cables unfortunately the
other thing you're gonna have to keep an
eye out for is cables are not the only
thing you gotta pay attention to of
course
adapters are basically just short cables
so if your adapter doesn't support the
same spec then you're gonna be at risk
of the same problem now what if you're
asking yourself look man I already
bought some cables I don't know if these
are okay to use well you're in luck one
developer has been very smart and gotten
ahead of the game by making an app
called checker all you got to do is pull
up checker plug in a cable to your phone
and it'll tell you if it's good enough
to use it turns red and got an X then
don't don't do it don't plug it anymore
I don't know why you would think to do
it but if it's green and it's got a
check then you're good to go just a
heads up this is indeed the Nexus 6
cable that it came with and that isn't B
the Nexus 6 charger checker is not built
to check C 2 C cable so when you plug it
in still gonna give you an X don't be
alarmed totally ok use checker to check
any USB type a to type c cables in your
home and definitely check the reviews on
cables before you buy them in general
anything less than 10 bucks is probably
not going to be up to spec anyway that
is your quick PSA for this week in
November thank you guys so much for
watching and as always be kind of
another and I'll catch you in the next
video so while I was on the Internet is
weekend I found myself with a couple of
good ideas so of course everything
domain so I had to domain.com to
register them and I was looking at the
top-level domains and I saw Don
accountant and I thought to myself why
don't accountants have Heitmann you know
you're getting your taxes done there's
like a guy behind and really amped on
how much you're saving and how much your
tax refunds going to be he should have a
hype man
so whoever out there has the wherewithal
to go make a website so they
accounts can book their own Heitmann you
can go ahead a register height man dot
accountant on domain.com and you know
what you don't even have to do for all
that much money because if you use the
code TechnoBuffalo you can get 20% off
of that entire order go ahead use it for
one of the domains that you were gonna
register anyway still 20% off it's a
really great deal and like I said this
weekend I was thinking about domain so I
was thinking domain.com and that's what
you should be doing too</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
