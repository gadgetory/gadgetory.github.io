technobuffalo here's an unboxing for you
of the rover puck by clear water it's a
mobile hotspot that can be shared up to
eight different devices at once let's go
ahead and get started alright so let me
give you a bit of background on what
this is us Rover puck is the
pay-as-you-go option of clearwire the
folks that built and maintained the
wimax network used here in the US which
actually sprint uses for their 4g
services so as i mentioned this is
pay-as-you-go on the pricing scheme on
this is really very impressive so if you
want to have unlimited access for a day
it's going to cost you just five bucks
if you want a limited access for a week
it's going to cost you twenty dollars
and a limited access for a month is
going to give you fifty when i say i'm
limited there's no gigabyte or bang with
really restrictions here you can use as
much as you can a speed wise this is a
4G network you're going to get about
three to six megabits per second down
and about one megabit per second up you
can activate all this stuff online and
you can reup your account online as
we're telling you right there one thing
to know though this does not have a 3g
fallback so it won't fall back to a
video or hsdpa or anything like that
it's strictly a 4g two bytes you're
going to want to check with the folks at
rover and clearwire to make sure that
you have 4g in your area it's going to
set you back just about one hundred and
forty nine dollars for this device but
if you're the kind of person who travels
occasionally and you want to be able to
have internet wherever you go but you
don't want to be stuck paying a monthly
fee or be stuck in a contract this is
really going to be a decent option for
you alright so let's go ahead and dig in
the batteries posli is going to last 24
hours and can be charged while plugged
in so pull it off and there is the rover
puck which is not used for hockey go
ahead and pull this part back i have not
seen one of these yet in person some
very curious on how big or how small
it's going to be push that off to the
side it looks like there is nothing else
inside so here's a rover puck we finally
got a wimax 4g service here in Southern
California of them
excited to try this so quick start guide
there's a quick start guide probably LZ
how to register your stuff online there
is a sticker you're also going to get
like a car charger which is a standard
USB port got your wall charger outlet
and it charges via micro USB those are
your standard stuff you'd get in a cell
phone box here is the rover puck go
ahead and pull it off but that's all
it's not the smallest thing the words
let the size of let's say a coaster we
put your drink on certain you don't want
to put your drink on it but it gives you
some sense of comparison for size I here
is the nexus s for example oster do cell
phone comparison so you guys can sort of
get a sense of how big or small you
might think this is so I'm going to go
ahead and use it review it I'll do a
test on network speed and see how
everything works I'm going to go and
charge it up and let's go ahead and see
if 4G service pay-as-you-go is a just
what the doctor ordered there'll be a
link down below in case people want to
check out Rover service and see if
they're supported where you are and also
some purchasing information alright guys
i'm jon rettinger from TechnoBuffalo see
in the next video bye bye
