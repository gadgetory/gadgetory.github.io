mms is finally live on the iphone and
mms means ability to send pictures video
and audio just as you would a text
message or an SMS so if you're in the US
and you'll want to get mms working all I
get to do is plug in your iphone open up
itunes hit update and you get a teeny
tiny carrier update and that's it reboot
your phone and you are good to send an
mms let me show you the two ways that
you can send an mms and will show one
live there's been a lot of talk about
this but it's nice to finally have it
here so we've got a text message here to
to Brandon go ahead and add a picture
I've got that new little picture icon
that shows up my next to the text entry
field so go ahead and tap that and I
could take a photo or video or choose
existing I'll just choose an existing
one I'll pick one from my camera roll
and pick one of a monitor sup it choose
and it goes and puts it in the message
just as it would if it was text it's
kind of neat go ahead and hit send and
it's sending takes a little while longer
to send then just a standard text
because it's a little bit more data and
a little bit more information but it
will send you can see live here how long
it actually takes and it's gone there's
another way you can send mms as well and
you be able to flip through them just as
you would on standard text conversation
if you go into your photo library and if
you got photos or videos there and go
ahead and hit the image hit the bottom
the button in the bottom left hand
corner and now you can send as mms and
it'll put it right into a blank message
it send it to whomever you like quick
demonstration of mms am very happy at
ATT finally enabled us it's been a long
time coming so he says one thing we can
