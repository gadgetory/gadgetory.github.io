you of the Motorola backflip which is
the first Android phone available for 18
t Wireless this is going to set you back
just about $100 after two-year contract
and some mail-in rebates so let's go
ahead and get started it is an Android
phone sitting on top of Android 1.5 with
Motorola's own UI skin called motoblur
before we get into the nitty gritty and
as I do with all of my phone reviews
let's talk about call quality no matter
what these phones do or don't do if they
don't make good phone calls it's not
going to be useful to you
the radios in recent Motorola phones
have been very very strong and the
bakflip is no exception
signal strength was very good I was even
getting more bars with the bakflip than
I was with a comparable AT&amp;amp;T device like
the iPhone so it's quite strong and a
modern radio call quality was very good
no white noise no crackling callers even
thought that I was on a landline and I
experienced no dropped call issues with
the back flip so if you're looking for
something that's going to make good
phone calls the back flip is going to be
a very good device for you so let's dig
in as to what makes this thing unique
and let's talk about the form factor
since this is really one of the big
selling points or dislike points about
the back flip on the front of it it
looks like a typical Android device with
motoblur it's got your motoblur icons
your Foursquare your home and your back
it doesn't have the typical Android
buttons that you'd find on other Android
devices for example here's what you'll
see on all the Nexus One for example or
typical Android devices that's going to
be your button array Motorola has it a
bit more simplified with motoblur so if
you look at the phone on the right-hand
side it's a little bit on the thick side
if you flip it over there is a keyboard
which is a bit weird with it's sort of
inset 5 megapixel camera with LED flash
and it's a bit of a segue the camera
takes fantastic pictures 5 megapixels
really come across quite nice on the
phone here so that is this work well
when you're using your phone if you take
the
keyboard and you flip it out it actually
flips backwards
hence the bakflip name and you get a
full backlit QWERTY keyboard this
keyboard is actually very easy to use
the buttons are raised just a little bit
a few weird things and quirks about it
that do take some getting used to
they're all lined up one after another
there's no staggering on them as you
find on some other devices the stagger
makes it a bit easier to type on but
here it's sort of one after another so
it takes a bit of getting used to a
spacebar is a bit small but you do get a
very full size keyboard and generally
with phones that slide out you lose
finger access on this first row of keys
because the sliding mechanism comes over
but on the back flip that's not the case
you actually can get full view I found
myself actually using this quite a bit
in this mode where you can actually sit
and watch something you know I was
actually looking at web pages are
browsing you just scroll around it turns
into an alarm clock if you like to use
it that otherwise you can just get out
of that and go home but it actually was
nice and easy to browse in this moment
something that I really like so from a
design standpoint it's very quirky I
think it's gonna be either love or hate
it I kind of liked it I thought it was
sort of unique I've seen so many phones
they all have the same designs it's like
to see something try a little bit
different but that's not the only reason
the back flip is unique because it's
back flipping keyboard on the back it's
got a trackpad or a backtrack as
Motorola is calling in I can see that
right there it works just like a
touchpad on a laptop so the idea is that
using the phone you can take your finger
on the back and scroll along and scroll
through pages and sort of get to
different areas it's a great idea in
practice in theory it doesn't work so
well I can see I'm trying to scroll to
the right and I keep you jumping over
that one in the middle it's sort of
accurate needs a bit of calibration you
can double tap it open stuff up or tap
it to close it I'm never gonna use it
and I think it's sort of fragments the
Android Marketplace a little bit more
because developers have to actually
develop applications that can use it I
haven't seen that much utility for it
but you don't have to use it just
something that's there
if you like so it's not a negative it's
more of a positive if that's what you
enjoy
no one's certainly going to foresee when
the phone doesn't require you to use it
as well if you don't all your navigation
is going to be exclusively with your
finger or the d-pad down here on the
keyboard so let's talk a bit about the
operating system you may have seen
Android or very familiar with it this is
Android 1.5 which means this was the
first version of Android I believe that
had an onscreen keyboard as also is a
version of Android that is not capable
of running Google Maps Navigation the
free turn-by-turn options so there are a
few negatives to 1.5 you're not getting
a lot of the features that you're gonna
get on even a 1.6 or a 2.0 or 2.1 device
now AT&amp;amp;T has said that this will be
upgradable but as of right now the
upgrade plans have not been released so
you're going to be getting a 1.5 device
I am NOT the biggest fan of motoblur
it's a lot of social networking sort of
tools and features that puts widgets on
your home screen
I find them to take up a lot of room you
don't have a lot of screen real estate
here with this 3.1 inch screen the
resolution of 480 by 320 so I turned off
most of the motoblur features ended up
using just a stock Android build which
was okay I do like Android I think it
behaves very well I do wish this device
has some sort of multi-touch support I
know even one like the Droid hasn't
touched support but doesn't ship with it
you can download a third-party browser
like a Dolphin Browser and be able to
use pinch and zoom features you cannot
do that here with the backflip it's a
bit on the chunky side as well and
that's probably due to that difficulty
are also getting a very very nice
battery the battery is 1380 million of
hours and they claim we get six hours of
talktime or thirteen point five days of
standby time battery life was fantastic
I was actually able to go two plus days
on it the phone is a bit underpowered
and it's underpowered for a professional
power user I require a lot of utility
out of my phone I'm always
on the web sometimes text messaging
watching video I need a phone that can
really keep up with all of me and that's
not the back flip but I don't think
that's who the back flip is really
geared at I don't think it's meant for
the business power user this phone is
going to be a perfect fit for you if you
are a texture and you're looking for to
step up from a feature phone to get a
bit more features if you don't need all
the power and utility of something
running a much faster processor with
much more RAM a sort of slots
I guess below you know say something
like like an iPhone or a droid or a
Nexus One but above the the feature
phone set it does a lot does everything
in a standard Android build is gonna do
but just does it a little bit slower so
if you are looking for that middle
ground this may be a nice compromise for
you it's gonna give you a lot of things
that you wouldn't get you know with your
standard QWERTY feature phone so overall
if I have to rank this phone on a one to
ten scale which or one to five scale
rather which of course I have to do
things this is a review I'm going to
give it a solid three I like the form
factor it's gonna be a love or hate
thing but I think it's unique it's fun
it's a different sort of design that
I've seen that I haven't seen before and
I give Motorola credit for trying to
innovate it's an emic processor lack of
multi-touch bit smaller screen and use
of Motorola blur and 1.5 operating
system all took away from those points
so you're going to love this phone if
you are looking to upgrade from a
feature phone and you want a bit more
capabilities you're not gonna like this
one if you're expecting a full power
flow that can keep up with all of your
multitasking and your power using this
is not going to be the phone for you so
if you meet one of those categories you
can pick this phone up I think be
relatively happy and you will have a
Android device with a very interesting
layout in your pocket anyway guys I'm
