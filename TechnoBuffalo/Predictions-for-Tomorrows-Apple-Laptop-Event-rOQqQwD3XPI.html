lakers comp and i want to give you guys
my takes and thoughts on what to expect
at tomorrow's apple keynote address
entitled the spotlight turns two
notebooks first things you can
definitely count on and take to the bank
our redesign the macbook and macbook
pros the mac of books will go all
aluminum the inside certainly and the
outside has been some speculation that
they may have plastic but i'm going to
go out on a limb and say it's going to
be hundred percent aluminum and going to
incorporate a multi-touch trackpad
there's also been some speculation that
the macbook may lose its firewire 400
connectivity I don't think Apple would
completely eliminate this in the need
for saving space I've heard rumors of a
new fire water standard or possibly even
fire wire via ethernet that can be
accessed through an adapter so look for
that the macbook pro is certainly do for
redesign as well it's gonna lose its
latch and get the magnetic latch that's
currently found in the macbooks both are
going to be in slimmer profiles and the
macbook pro i believe will still come in
the 15 and 17 inch configurations
there's been some rumors of an 18 inch
or possibly a 16 inch in there but i
would have been on it also i know people
are hoping for a 12 inch or a 13-inch
macbook pro but i don't believe that
that is in the cards for this round the
macbook in addition will also get a
backlit LED screen similar to what's
found in the macbook air and the macbook
pro speaking of macbook air it certainly
do for a refresh since it hasn't been
updated since it was first released back
in january i would expect the macbook
air to adopt Intel's newest core 2 duo
chipset I also would bet on it receiving
a jump in hard drive space i would say
120 to 160 would be a standard
configuration as well as possibly 128
gigabyte solid-state option i would not
expect anything else to change on the
macbook air what i would expect to
change though across all three laptops
are civic and price drops i would expect
the macbook to start at nine hundred
dollars 50 macbook pro will start at 17
hundred dollars i think we'll see the
macbook air dropped to the static
creation to $1,500 this is just
speculation that's being backed up by
what I've read on some big apple rumor
sites another thing that people expect
to anything about as well our glass
trackpads well there's no doubt that the
macbook will adopt multi-touch trackpad
found in the current macbook pro macbook
airs well there's also some degree of
question about again whether they're
going to be these new glass trackpads um
I'm up in the air about whether or not I
think these are actually going to happen
the advantages certainly that you can
use the glass as a screen perhaps as a
sort of dock or a better way to train
you to use multi touch well I think that
would be a very cool feature and nice
addition to the lineup I would not bet
on them happening I would expect the new
macbook trackpad look identical to the
macbook airs although I would love love
to glass another speculation has been
going around is bluray Apple currently
sits on the blu-ray board but have yet
to implement support for blu-ray in OS
10 leopard as well as support for
blu-ray in their computers I don't
expect a macbook pro to differentiate
itself from the macbook by having
support from blue right in fact having
an internal blu-ray drive it'll be the
first of its kind as far as I know
that'll be a slot-loading blu-ray and
not the tray found in most laptops I
think OS 10 get an update tomorrow to a
version that will support obviously
blu-ray this may even be and a
build-to-order option on the current
macbooks one of the most rampant rumors
going around is that Apple is going to
ditch intel integrated graphics card
it's not the size are going to ditch the
Intel processor though still be the core
2 duo but those bad integrated graphics
cards the GMA 950 and then went to 1,300
so it's been ditching them for and video
which from what I understand is a much
more powerful chipset which will require
a smaller footprint a better graphical
output and better battery consumption so
we can certainly hope that we will see
that all across the line of laptops
macbook macbook pro and macbook air some
other rumors and speculation not laptop
specific that we
Maci ilife 09 be unveiled that would
certainly be a nice welcome addition I
they fo weight was released just about a
year ago I believe so oh and I would
certainly be an appropriate addition but
I'm not holding my breath for that so
guys are just my thoughts on what to
expect tomorrow and just reporting on
what I've read and what I've seen I
guess we'll see though in less than 24
hours I'm looking forward to it cuz I'm
in the market for a laptop myself that's
it guys I will keep you posted and stay
tuned to the website for more details
that's WWJ for lakers com alright guys
talk to you soon bye bye guys let me
know in the comments down below what you
think about my predictions whether you
think I'm right wrong what do you think
I'm correct about or wrong about and
what you guys would like to see in the
updates so leave them here let's start a
little discussion we used for the next
day or so and you're wondering what's
going on behind me with this white stuff
here I'm the process of building a
studio and this is the first part of it

I make my videos all right guys bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
