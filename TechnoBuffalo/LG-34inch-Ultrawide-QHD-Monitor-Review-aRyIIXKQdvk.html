brought to you by lynda.com what's up
everyone John written TechnoBuffalo here
today we're taking a look at the LG 34
um 95 - P a very unsexy name for a very
sexy ridiculously wide monitor let's go
take a look and see if it's worth the
thousand dollar investment so back in
January at CES one of my favorite things
that I saw and put that in perspective
there were just every piece of
technology in the world is that CES and
this one stuck out was one of the
coolest things of time LG didn't know if
they were gonna produce it and how much
it was gonna cost but they did and we
know 9999 it is available now so this
behemoth is 34 inches which is pretty
awesome 21 by 9 aspect ratio it is qHD
which means it's got 34 40 by 1440 for
just four words worth an Apple 27-inch
Thunderbolt Display is 2560 by that same
1440 so just crazy amount of pixels
slammed into this guy so from the design
perspective it's really good-looking
it's got very thin bezels it's got sort
of a glass plastic base it's nothing
that's gonna serve who you with tiny
nose non-existent bezels and curved
display but it's kind of nice looking in
a world of rather boring monitors this
thing is gonna be great for designers
it's got a matte anti-glare display so
if you're looking at a cinema display
something super glared and you can see
what that your colors gonna look like or
light reflecting at you you might want
to consider this guy this thing though
is more than good looks it's got inputs
luck crazy it's got two HDMI headphone
out got a DisplayPort it's got two
thunderbolt I mean it's gonna work great
with a new Mac Pro any of the new Mac
lines of course any PC as well it's
going to have one USB 3.0 and two USB
2.0 ports bit on the heavy side it's 17
pounds with the fan I saw that surf and
other reviews but honestly who's
deadlifting their monitor you put it
down as a matter how heavy this one is
your cable comes a 47 pounds you're
gonna be totally fine so 3/4 inches and
a lot of pixels seems really put into
perspective so it's pixel area is 1.8
times larger than ultra wide 21.9 inch
monitor and it's 24 times larger
then a full HD sixteen by nine monitor
if you look at a full excel document you
could have forty seven columns and
sixty-three rows which is insane because
there are just so many pixels here LG
did some kind of cool it get a screen
splitter essentially you can treat this
as four separate screens or two if you
want but you could have one in each
corner and you could have sort of a
multi tasker's dream right up there take

let's take no bubbles back to the review
so I really like this monitor but it's
not that it's false the navigation on it
is really really awful it's got this
little red underneath here it's got a
sort of a five-way joystick you push the
button and then you pops up you can
navigate it's really annoying but
fortune with monitors once you set it up
the way you want to want to but really
have to deal with that squirrely little
knob underneath so not that giant of a
con I've been looking for a really good
monitor that offers for that wide span
aspect ratio it's great for games it's
great for productivity it's being used
primarily by our video editor ROM frida
and fitting a lot of video editing you
can just see all the timeline he had had
some Premiere Pro and just a huge
difference versus a cinema display that
he was using so if you need something
like that you want a more immersive
environment in games it's a great deal
at the same price is 27-inch Apple
Simmons boy I think it's a way way
better dealer you're getting way more
for your buck I would very happily
recommend this in fact once this review
is done this monitor goes back to LG I'm
gonna buy one for the office anyway
which is really the best endorse but I
can give a product at spending my own
money for it
you've got a thousand bucks laying
around you
for a really good monitor look no
farther than the LG so one other small
con with the monitor occasionally I've
got hooked up to an older generation Mac
Pro this screen pops up right here and
it won't wake up when you hit the
buttons on the keyboard or at the mouse
you actually power the whole monitor on
and off there might be an issue with the
computer we couldn't replicate it and we
connect it to other devices but be aware
that it might happen to yours
