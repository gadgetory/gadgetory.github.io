John Rhett enger' from TechnoBuffalo
here and I want to give you an overview
and a short tour of the just announced
and just released Google Buzz service
some are calling it Twitter killer and
Facebook killer it is Google's entry
into social networking and they do a
pretty good job with it so let me show
you what this looks like when you log
into your Gmail if you're one of the few
that has access to the beta you're gonna
see a new icon rep your inbox called
buzz with the new buzz logo it's sort of
like a conversation cartoon thing with
Google's colors right in it so the
interface should be very familiar to
anybody who's ever used the Gmail
application standard wise and sort of
the standard rudimentary features you
can send updates just as you could on
Twitter or Facebook no real character
limits here I don't believe have been
imposed type whatever you want and send
it out anybody that you've emailed or
emailed you and who has access to the
buzz beta will be a follower or a friend
if you want to call it and as this site
rolls out and sort of becomes a release
candidates you'll be able to have much
more friends everybody's emailed and you
get access to the bus service will be
automatically integrated so you should
have access immediately to a ton of
friends so you can post to the world and
let everybody see it who has access to
Google Buzz or you can have the option
to keep it private and just set your
restrictions whomever you like to see it
just your friends or just one or two
people so this does do a couple of
things differently than maybe you've
seen on Twitter and Facebook let's say I
want to send a link out so I've got a
link right here from CNN East Coast
storms are getting crazy I'm gonna go
and copy the link go back to Google Buzz
I'm gonna insert link paste it right in
and it's automatically gonna pull in
photos from that article and if I were
to send this out the user who was
reading these could click the photo and
view it right away pretty a pretty cool
thing to save so let me give you guys
another demonstration of some of the
features if someone for example inserts
a picture say from Picasa or an image
from the web it shows up right here in
the buzz I don't know what you call you
know Twitter you call it a tweet
and maybe you just call this a buzz so
if you click on the picture it pulls up
a picture viewer which is quite nice and
view the pictures almost natively if
there were one or more images down below
they'd show up in a carousel right here
pretty handy way to view pictures now
Google of course owns YouTube so you'd
expect videos to have a pretty nice role
in here so let me show you what it looks
like when you insert a video I
personally send out videos all the time
to my followers on Twitter so this is a
feature that I really like
so here's round 8 of the console wars
Xbox 360 vs. ps3 when I copy that link
go back to Buzz and let me delete that
post that I was messing around with and
I'm gonna paste in that youtube link so
you see it right here looks just like an
image if I go ahead and post that you
get a play button you can play the video
right from Google Buzz which is I think
a pretty handy feature you don't have to
go somewhere else to look at your videos
I look at your pictures it keeps
everything right in line oh it's the
feature that I definitely like now
you've got the ability to to comment on
any post you like and sets up almost a
Gmail conversation thread you can like
it or you can email the person directly
now if you email a person or comment the
notification gets sent right to their
Gmail inbox they don't have to go in to
Google Buzz see if they have any
messages it's gonna show up right in
their inbox so if you want to email
somebody directly from this conversation
window it works almost as you'd expect
sort of from a Twitter standpoint give a
NAT reply then it'd be user at whatever
gmail.com then you can type your message
hey how are ya and you go ahead and post
that and that will get sent again right
to the inbox now this does have some
integration with with Flickr and Picasa
and even Twitter so I think that it's
going to be probably a pretty ubiquitous
feature as Google sort of fine-tunes it
and we move forward now I'm not so sure
this is gonna cheer the widespread
adoption right away that Google may be
looking for but I think in the short
term it's definitely going to drive the
industry forward sites like Twitter and
Facebook are really going out to be top
of their game and continue to innovate
if they want to maintain it's part of
their market leader share Google
certainly has the resources to put
together
a very very robust and feature filled
application like it looks like they're
doing here with Google Buzz they have a
few other options that I'll show you you
can pick your commenting options right
here and delete the post link to post
send it and you know there are a few
other sort of high tech features that
Google Buzz has but I want to give you
just sort of a ten thousand view
overview of Google Buzz or ten thousand
foot overview of Google Buzz so as you
can see what it does they start to hear
about it more and more certain is gonna
be picked up by the press you may hear
your friend start to get access to it
hope you guys enjoy it I'm John Rhett
enger' from TechnoBuffalo
and the big question is are you
interested in Google Buzz and it's
something that you think you might use
might not use you know leave a text or a
video comment I'm very interested to
hear what you guys have to say anyway I
will see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
