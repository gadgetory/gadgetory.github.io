to you by domain.com hey what's going on
guys I'm mark and Sangan from
TechnoBuffalo and today we'll be showing
you guys what's new in San Jin mod 12s
for the 1+1 now see Energon mod 12s is
based off of android 5.0.2 lollipop so
it brings over some of the cool material
design UI along with some extra features
specific to say antigen now before we
begin I just wanted to say that the
over-the-air update has been paused in
order to add the okay oneplus voice
feature which even works with a screen
off so the first obvious change here is
that it's running android 5.0.2 lollipop
so everything from the animations to the
new UI elements it's mostly all here
with a few customization options from
Santa j'en like the ability to change
from software buttons to Hardware
buttons the ability to launch the camera
by using gestures and the ability to
tweak the screens color to your liking
now of course rather than just mimicking
stock Android see anagen went ahead and
added some pretty awesome features
pulling down the notification tray will
show you the current weather and tapping
on it will show you the full week's
weather you'll also be able to add new
quick setting toggles for easy access
like LTE hotspot invert colors and more
you also be able to change the
lockscreen shortcuts to whatever you'd
like whether it's an app a direction to
a place or even a contact which is
awesome so a big focus of this update
was improvement to say antigens theming
engine choosing a theme looks so much
better now and fits well with Google's
material design language you can
customize almost everything on your
device from the status bar to the
navigation buttons to the control
buttons you can individually choose what
style or what theme you want to use
downloading new themes is easier - paid
and free themes are now split up so you
can choose whether you want to browse
into paid or free sections probably the
biggest additions to Santa jhin's
theming engine is a new app femur which
essentially allows you to theme certain
apps based on the themes you have
downloaded on your device so for example
if I head over to my settings app I can
tap on a paintbrush and it'll apply that
specific theme to that Settings app and
everything else in the OS will stay
exactly the same I think this is an
awesome feature for those who love to
tinker with their device but
unfortunately it doesn't apply to
third-party apps like Instagram Facebook
or say antigen zone email app just to
name a few
but nonetheless the ability to customize
mostly every part of the OS is amazing
there's
also a new app called Santa Jan email
which is powered by boxer it has
exchange support multiple account
integration and canned responses for
quick replies you can also set different
LED clothes for different accounts and
choose what actions to perform when you
swipe left or right on a message now as
much as I love using Gmail as my primary
email app the new Sandidge and email is
just pack with cool features that
integrates well with other email
accounts and it's free you don't have to
pay for the app or any premium service
it works as soon as you update to Santa
gin mod 12s there's also another app
called baton which works a bit like hand
off in iOS 8 the past feature allows
users to send any app in its current
state to another device giving folks
