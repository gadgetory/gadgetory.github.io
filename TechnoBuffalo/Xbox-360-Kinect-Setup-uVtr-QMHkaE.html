from TechnoBuffalo here since I first
started talking about the Kinect I
received a ton of questions that how
easy your heart is to set up what cables
you need for the new Xbox versus the old
xbox so I figured since I gotta set this
up anyway they can help answer a
question or two so I'm gonna show you
guys how easy or difficult it is to set
up your new Xbox Kinect
all right so we've got the Kinect right
here all the cables I'm not sure which
ones I'm going to need they're not me I
don't think an external power supply is
going to be necessary with the new Xbox
but we will see in a minute if you have
an over Xbox 360 the Kinect will
absolutely work it does come with some
extension cables and adapters so the
Kinect cord goes in here USB adapter and
then power so you can use this with any
Xbox 360 there was a bit of question
whether not only worked with a new one
and it'll work with any model all right
so here is the Kinect here is my Xbox go
ahead and take off a little twist tie
and connect this guy and see what the
setup process looks like and then of
course we'll do some hands-on time it
connect and the rest of that business so
put the Kinect here up on top I'm going
to go ahead and drop the cord down the
back of my console stand here and pull
out the Xbox 360 bit of a tight squeeze
here's a Kinect corn alright so we go
ahead and plug this in go ahead and plug
this guy in and see if all we need is
just the Kinect cable so here is a the
inch box I'm plugging my cables to get
all hype alright so here is the back of
the new Xbox 360 is sort of nicknamed
slim and there is that connect port
right there here's my orange cable
matches it let's go ahead and plug it in
so you can need anything else sort of
looks like a modified wispy cable go
ahead and plug that guy in let's see if
we need a power
to connect I don't see any lights on it
so we may actually need some sort of
power cord plug my HTMI cable back in go
ahead and see what happens all right so
the connect is set up let me see I think
it's up let's go ahead and turn on the
television and see what happens
all right we're going to figure it out
this works live on video together and it
looks like there's now a light blinking
on the Kinect so that answers that
question you do not next to a power
supply with the new Xbox 360 now up on
the TV I am getting a nice little
warning here asking if I want to update
my console because I've got a new
accessory so I'm going to go ahead and
do that update you're gonna have to do
the same thing as well this is not the
same as the fall update that just came
out this appears to be a separate update
just for the Kinect so I'll go ahead and
let it do its updated business and come
back in just a minute all right so we
are all set up then update download the
console rebooted and it's asking me if I
want to continue my setup so let's go
ahead and do that all right a little
lady jumped away
make sure your sensor is position 2 to 6
feet from the floor place on a stable
surface you have problems later
alright the sensor is placed looks like
a pretty good location I think let's go
ahead and hit select all right this
process will improve voice command and
the chart start by checking the
background noise when available test the
background noise alright so I'm going to
shut up and let it do its test you guys
can see all this happening
my background level is okay that's good
make sure your speakerphone you said at
the level you used to play games so
check your speaker volume by playing
some sounds I don't know if it said
internal volume whoops I guess I'm good
alright let's go ahead and see what this
does to be yells at me
a speaker volumes okay thank you for the
validation there Xbox all right this
will test sound you help you Ori enter
text your room your audio setup may
affect let's go ahead and calibrate
okay so I obviously had to be quiet
there I love when the Xbox barks out
orders microphone calibration calories
can complete you can turn up the volume
you can turn it back down
okey doke chat microphone kicked has a
built-in chat microphone for games Xbox
Live parties and I can hear myself get
yelled at by 13 year olds and stereo and
without the protection of a headset so
everybody can hear myself get beat you
want to use the Kinect for chat sure
turn it on for chat connect alright
all I want to do is connect it's a
pretty in-depth setup process alright
setting up Kinect there's a lot to do
with this one little guy first
stand up okie doke I am standing up put
down the controller wow I don't know how
they knew I had a controllers beyond me
make sure the area is clear in front of
the sensor alright I am now hitting the
camera and M in front of the sensor and
I'm at least freaking its business out
only one person's on out
think the camera is as messy guy I want
to move the camera to a bit of a
different angle perhaps out of the
sensors view and we'll see if we can get
this thing set up a little bit
differently all right so we'll go a
little bit farther away let's see if
that will make this ever alright and
that seemed to fix the problem who
deserve ok
I was in the server all right stay there
I'm not moving
connect wait a carrot I'm waiting
all right so now you select it off and
hold your hand over a panel to select it
so I am just moving my hand around right
now we're going to move it to continue
and you see a little circle fills up
choose an avatar let's go with who looks
most like me nah just kidding let's go
back alright so I'm just move my hands
around here I'm gonna go back let's pick
that is my avatar with that for yes
mustache that exists so myself
and done like a little dancer you did
alright I think that we are now set up
and connect um pretty elaborate process
to get this guy
how can going so that's going to be sort
of the standard Xbox welcome just like I
turn it on normally it's no longer
connected by I'll be doing some hands-on
stuff with the games tomorrow and show
you guys for what this thing looks like
so stay tuned to TechnoBuffalo for all
of your Kinect miss for right now I'm
John render and I'll see you in the next
video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
