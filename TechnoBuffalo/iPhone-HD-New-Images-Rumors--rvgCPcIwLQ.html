technobuffalo here iphone rumors are
starting to come fast and furious as
they tend to do this time of year late
last week I reported on some images that
came out allegedly showing the next
generation device from Apple those have
since been proven fake actually the
Creator came out and said that he made
him just to help promote his portfolio
however in the past day and new set of
images have been put out this time
buying gadget they feel pretty confident
are the next generation iphone or the
very least an early prototype of it it's
commonly being called the iphone 4g
however i do not believe that's going to
be the final name ford you can create a
bit of customer confusion it can also
mean well firstly the fourth generation
of the device would certainly is or can
also be confused with the wireless
technology so 3g the 3g network that ATT
had we need a third generation wireless
technology or 4G can be confused with
the fourth generation networks there
were LTE or wimax that AT&amp;amp;T Verizon
mobic coming out with or that spreads is
currently advertising a smart money I
believe would be on the iphone HD and
i'll talk to you about the why in just a
minute as i'm talking i'll show you
these new images that sort of have come
up recently so they give you a bit of
history on these images the day before
the ipad was released and gadget leaked
some images the first time we've
actually seen what was going to be the
ipad it looked like it was deep inside
the coffers of Apple headquarters I was
actually almost chained down to a table
but on top of what actually ended up
being coming the ipad was actually a
picture of an iphone which people i
think of much the time hell brought upon
further inspection actually looked to
the new hardware that we hadn't seen yet
you could look see a front-facing camera
and all you could see was a connect to
itunes logo on the screen well the
images that have come out tend to match
very closely to what that image we saw a
few months ago was so i go over some
specs at engadget claiming that we're
going to see from this
generation iphone higher resolutions
resolution screen that seems to be a
no-brainer screen on the resolution on
the iphone has been a bit disappointing
especially compared to newer devices
like the upcoming droid incredible or
the nexus one front facing camera is
really the big thing that and gadget is
claiming this device will have and if
you look for a closely the image that
came out david for the ipad launch you
can indeed see a front-facing camera at
least what looks to be a front-facing
camera recently presume will be for
ichat or for video conferencing
something that we have not yet seen sort
of penetrate the US market they have it
in other countries but in the u.s. we
just haven't seen it yet also we're
expecting a high resolution camera which
is something that's well most people
have been expecting as well as an LED
flash Apple has not yet put a flash on
their device so there would be something
that we could very much welcome and
gadget is also claiming this could
feature up to an 80 gigabytes
solid-state drive which seemed just
absolutely incredible to think of it
here and also allegedly it's going to
use the micro sim technology which we're
just going to see in the ipad 3g
essentially all that is a typical sim
card cut down to be a bit smaller the
interesting point of discussion the 3g
ipad is actually unlocked but does use
an ATM micro sim that makes you wonder
if the next generation iphone with that
my person is also going to be sold
unlocked but with an ATT micro sim
inside of it perhaps that could be the
first assuring of the iphone on multiple
carriers we're hearing verizon rumors
for quite some time so what do you guys
think about these new images they look
real or fake it's hard to tell doesn't
look like a finished Apple product if
they are indeed real perhaps an early
prototype to demonstrate sort of how the
hardware would function but what do you
guys think that love to hear from you
leave a text or video response I'm
getting very excited about the iphone 4g
or HD or ever they're going to call it
looks like it's going to take a next
step forward for apple and iphone fans
and right guys from jon rettinger from
technobuffalo and i'll see you in the
next video bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
