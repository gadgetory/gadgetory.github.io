seventy nine dollars so some real quick
specs that we'll get into the unboxing

it's going to set you back 139 dollars
all right
so without further ado let's go ahead
and dig in you've got the pull to open
Amazon always uses the eco-friendly
packaging go ahead and 10 is open no
knife required you should just open up
and here is the Amazon Kindle 3 so for
those of you Kindle fans out there what
the difference going to be between the
Kindle 3 and the Kindle 2 this one is
21% smaller still has the same six inch
reading area 17% lighter 15% improved
screen contrast crisper darker fonts
double as storage faster quieter page
turns well I didn't find the page turns
to be loud it's built in Wi-Fi of course
enhanced PDF reader soft touch textured
back a new webkit-based browser same
standards that the iPhone Android and
Palm webOS browser based on and voice
guide read to the menus alright so let's
go ahead and take a look at the Kindle 3
this
guy is tiny really small feels very thin
and good in the hands you know who's got
a nice looking field - it's got that new
keyboard as well push it off to the side
let's see what else we're going to get
in your Kindle box a little bit of
balance of the Kindle and some
minimalist stuff here we've got a power
cord and microUSB for charging and
that's all you are going to get in your
Kindle box let's take a look at the
devices itself and you can get a few
different coverage for this some right
Ramazan some aftermarket I did not get a
cover for it so here is the Kindle 3 go
ahead and pull off the plastic and this
feels noticeably thinner and noticeably
lighter than the outgoing Kindle 2 which
felt pretty light in its own right and
the kindle finally has attractive design
it's been a you know arguably one of the
best your readers on the market but from
design standpoint from first generation
on to now on the second generation it
did not look very good this one actually
looks like it was designed by someone
who had aesthetics in mind alright so
let's take a look at this keyboard I've
sort of got that nice round keyboard
style you're not gonna do that much
typing on and pull for it you do want to
type certainly going to be adequate it's
got a new 5-way navigation so up-down
left-right and you can select it in got
a back button your page buttons now are
a little bit flusher on the side you've
got a nice a quick feel to them and
you've got sort of both direction there
so you don't have to pick the side and
you can do it ever you want and that is
about it on the back you've got a
speaker grille a non removable battery
and was on Kindle branding and that's
sort of soft touch rubbery feel you've
seen on a lot of smartphones and this
guy is incredibly light and really does
again feel noticeably lighter and
smaller than the outgoing Kindle 2 so
I'll test this out use it for a week or
so and give you guys a for you on the
Amazon Kindle 3 hope you enjoy if you
have any questions let me know
I'm sure to stay tuned to TechnoBuffalo
