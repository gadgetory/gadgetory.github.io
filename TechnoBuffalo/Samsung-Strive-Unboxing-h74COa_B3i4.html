John Rhett enger' from TechnoBuffalo
here with an unboxing for you of the
Samsung Drive I've had a decent amount
of requests to cover some feature phones
on all major carriers this is the first
video that's going to help to sort of
serve that market this is a feature
phone for AT&amp;amp;T it's gonna set you back
just about $20 on a new two-year
contract let's go ahead and get to the
unboxing I'll go over some aspects as
we're doing it so as with any unboxing
with me would get to the awkward hacking
and slashing with the big ol knife let's
see if we can dig into this in here
alright excessively avoiding my fingers
which is always a pleasant feeling pull
off the FedEx wrap and here we have
these drive itself it is a slide-out
phone I'm not even sure if it's a
touchscreen or not but we'll go over the
specs and see what we have so it's a
picture of the box on the front it's got
obviously mail a GPS att's new social
cast and a two megapixel camera it does
have a 3 x digital zoom it does have an
HTML capable web browser I uses AT&amp;amp;T
video service which is called CV so you
can get news forward to weather sort of
like a mini TV it's got a music player
messaging threaded text messaging it
does have video share which is kind of
cool and of course a slide-out QWERTY
keyboard let's go ahead and take it out
and let's see what else we have on the
box here looks like it's just relaying
the same messages
and I don't believe that this is a
touchwiz phone that's sort of Samsung's
UI that we've seen on other feature
phones see if god your typical CD which
I don't know how many of you guys look
at a Quick Start Guide quite small here
is the device itself texting and driving
it can wait of course that is correct it
can wait it's a very thin phone for a
QWERTY that's got a relatively robust
keyboard there it's big enough to type
on a little test that in just a minute
we'll see what else we get in the box
we've got a very small battery let's see
what size this is it is 1000 milliamp
per watt hours so it's uh not the
biggest battery in the world and the
charging port with look at Samsung is
done with proprietary and we're now on
to microUSB which is quite nice let's go
ahead and pop in the battery and before
you actually take a look around the
device so you do have a full QWERTY
keyboard here let's see how that works
the type on but I like to take back what
I said previously the keyboard is
actually a bit cramped and feels that
hard to get used to there's a decent
amount of throws and the key and they
are a bit raised despite it being a
slider generally on slider phones the
keys are flat you can feel around them
you can feel the keys but if you've got
big thumbs like I do you may have a hard
time but I'll use this for a little
while and we'll see if maybe time will
make this a bit easier to type on as is
the case with most phones so you've got
a standard array of buttons on the front
here we've got the 2 megapixel camera on
the back with no flash or self-portrait
mirror I took there's a speaker grille
on the left hand side you've got your
volume rocker up and down camera button
and your USB charging port that
activates ett services I believe that's
what that does I maybe the video share
button send end back and two soft keys
so now let's pop in the battery and
let's see what we got going on ok so
you've got the battery and the device
gonna go ahead and slide the back on and
we will power it up and see what this
looks like this is
not a touchscreen by the way I mention
that I was unsure earlier so we'll go
ahead and turn this on and see if we can
get that satisfying whooshing sound from
the screen protector we do indeed see if
we can get some power right through here
it may be too dead to charge there we go
there is a bit of juice and while that
is booting up upsetting a bit more about
the phone does have a built-in FM radio
which is kind of cool it's capable of
streaming radio as well
subscription music services and a teen
teens mobile music again has a full
video and music player which supports
mp3 AAC AMR deck and the wave WMA eye
melody and a ton of other formats which
I don't know as far as multitasking goes
they say the simultaneous voice and data
as do all of 18 T's 3G phones please
insert the SIM card so it's not gonna
let me go through and check out the
operating system until I put in the SIM
card teve SOS so let me do anything nope
so we'll take a look at the device a bit
further in upcoming videos this has just
been a quick unboxing of the new
Samsung's Drive a feature phone for 18 t
Wireless if you're in the market for a
texting phone you may want to keep an
eye on this and keep an eye on the
channel I'll give you guys a full
write-up and review anyway John Rhett
enger' and I'll see you in the next
video buh-bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
