outlast and new game releases let's get
out of controller hello and welcome now
to controller the weekly TechnoBuffalo
show that covers all your gaming news
reviews demos and new releases and an
easy to digest capsule form I'm your
host Ashley sceva it's always a big week
in gaming so let's start out with the
news yet another Nintendo Direct was
held almost a week ago but we're still
pretty excited about all the goodies
nintendo president satoru iwata had in
store for us already announced games
featuring kirby yoshi chibi Robo Donkey
Kong Luigi and more all had new trailers
but we might be most excited about a new
Zelda spin-off with the working title
Hyrule warriors made by the team that
brought you the dynasty warriors
franchise Hyrule warriors takes that
same action brawler premise and sets it
in the world of Legend of Zelda owada
though also assured gamers this was not
nintendo's new first party Zelda game in
case you were worried and it would
arrive on Wii U sometime next year if
you want but having gotten your hands on
a Playstation for you you might have
noticed they're kind of tough to come by
this holiday season well that fact is
not lost on PlayStation us head honcho
Jack Tretton who joined PlayStation Blog
cast 101 to express his genuine sad at
the fact that some folks can't find a
ps4 to purchase he said quote it breaks
my heart but that was followed by if
somebody's got four hundred dollars in
their hand and they want one and we
can't sell them one so I guess he's not
exactly heartbroken for you exactly he's
more heartbroken Sony can't take your
money either way let's hope for more
widely available stock sooner rather
than later market analysis firm Cowan
and company is reporting sales of call
of duty ghosts down nineteen percent
compared to a similar time frame for
call of duty black ops 2 any other year
that might seem like a disastrous drop
especially considering we've seen
murmurs of gamers using terms like
recycled gameplay and
tred about call of duty but there are a
couple factors to consider before
predicting doom for the franchise first
it's a console generation shift and some
gamers might be waiting on picking up
another call of duty until it lands on
next gen consoles officially and second
Activision apparently pre-warn investors
call of duty ghosts might not live up to
previous sales numbers let's play as a
feature on our gaming channel where a
member of a writing staff plays game and
talks about it over the footage this
week our very own jon rettinger takes on
