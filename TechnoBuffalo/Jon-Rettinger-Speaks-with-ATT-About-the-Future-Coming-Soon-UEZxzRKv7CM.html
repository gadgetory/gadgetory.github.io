coverage i'm jon rettinger from
technobuffalo we are here with Jeff
Weber vice president of uverse thank you
for taking some time to talk he tell us
a little bit about what you announced
today yes so today we announced our new
TV applications platform that allows TV
are you ver service together with
wireless to give customers really great
integrated capability something that
they can't do anywhere else in the world
so what does that mean for the customer
the consumer for those u-verse customers
those looking to perhaps switch to
uverse so what it means is a universe
customer gets all the great service on
TV that they get today but in addition
to that with a wireless device a tablet
or a laptop they can now do even more
with our TV they can control it they can
send content from their tablet to the TV
or they can get content from the TV down
to a tablet it's just something that
isn't out there anywhere else today and
it will be any new hardware required
from the u-verse I'd to make this work
not at all it's one of the great things
about the universe platform customer
doesn't have to do anything they have a
smartphone or a tablet or whatever it'll
work with their wireless with their
receivers that they have today and when
customers expect to be able to take
advantage of these new features so some
of we're launching it and noun Singh it
today so those customers will start to
see those applications right away we are
here with president and CEO of AT&amp;amp;T
mobility Ralph de la Vega thank you for
taking the time to talk with us great to
be here so if you tell us a little bit
about what you announced today we have
some major new announcements today that
I think are going to really bring some
terrific new devices at some very
revolutionary price points to the
consumers in this country first we have
a very unique device called the samsung
note and it's a hybrid between a
smartphone and a tablet it has a screen
of 5.3 inches and you can actually take
notes with a what seems to be a stylist
but really it's a very high-tech pen and
so this device is new to the US it runs
on our fastest network which is 4G LTE
and so it's a terrific combination of
size of functionality and a terrific
powerhouse network to back it up so I'm
very very excited about that device so
we also try to get some devices that
would appeal to what we call
the masses LTE is a great technology
it's the best network we have and I want
to get it to us many customers as I can
and we need to bring down the price of
the tablets and the smartphones so we
have a very revolutionary price offer
with a new tablet from pantech and a new
smartphone from Pam tech it's the
element and the burst and the great
thing about this offer is when you buy
both them together you can get both of
them for $249 when you sign it to your
contract for both and so think about
this a great smartphone state-of-the-art
smartphone Android state-of-the-art
android tablet for $249 so we think
that's terrific but it gets better
because that's just the beginning we're
also going to make a major announcement
that talks about the introduction of the
first nokia LTE phones to the united
states and we're going to be the first
AT&amp;amp;T customers are going to be the first
to get the nokia devices which have the
latest microsoft OS and again run on our
great LTE network so we're very excited
about having partners like Samsung and
pantech and Microsoft and Nokia work
with us to bring just terrific devices
at very interesting points out to the
consumers in the u.s. so what are these
the new devices and services mean for
the customer in 2012 well it means that
they're going to have more choices if
you don't want the carry a tablet and a
smartphone we've got a device for you
that is perfect beautiful and unique in
the world if you really are very
cost-conscious and you know we're going
through a rough time in the economy and
you want to get the latest technology
but you want to spend less for two
hundred and forty nine dollars a tablet
that is state-of-the-art and a
smartphone that state of the art it's
absolutely break through and hopefully
you've got a chance to see that then
we'll maybe show the demo to some of the
people that watch your blogs and your
stuff so it's got some really unique
characteristics for people to use thank
you very much the time I appreciate it
thank you it's my pleasure
