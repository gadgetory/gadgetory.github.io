rettinger from technobuffalo here taking
a look at the samsung series 7 slate pc
that i wish i could take out of here
this is taking windows 7 and it is
tablet izing it so it's running intel
2nd gen core i3 or i5 processor it's
going to come in 32 64 or 128 gigabyte
SSD storage capacities to incredibly
thin at point five inches or a 12 point
nine millimeters it's gotten really
light as well at one point nine pounds
in six hours of battery life let's go
ahead and see how it worked with your
finger that's always been one of the
issues with taking a PC operating system
making the tablets how's it going to
respond let's go ahead and try so it is
a capacitive touchscreen going to cancel
out don't save out of this and you can't
actually go ahead and navigate it's
going to see what scrolling looks like
let's see if we can go to pictures and
see if we have pinch to zoom and
multi-touch here if you double tap this
is what I guess with a mouse what
jellyfish
alright so pitch to zoom does work on
here also if you scroll down below if
you don't want to use your finger you
got a more classic keyboard here and
then go ahead and plug in a mouse also
you've got a capacitive stylus years can
go ahead and do your drawings great for
digital designers that need sort of the
tablet to do their sketching but also
want a powerful computer let's go ahead
and close this out on the left hand side
you've got HDMI out volume up and down
3.5 millimeter headset jack and then
you've got one USB port lives there
under a door and then we've got your
power cord which is a proprietary power
cord up the top here you've got a micro
SD so if you want to get all your
storage done and go ahead and do that
you'll see the thickness of the tablet
coming down on the right hand side so
you're going to have your power on/off
button and if you want to switch
monitors you've got that option there as
well to go to an external display this
is the keyboard accessory very very thin
very light trip book style reminiscent
me else that we've seen you have one
home button there to go ahead and turn
it on some tablet optimizations have
been done here some widgets on the side
but mostly it's a pretty standard
windows 7 experience with some giant
icons so i'm jon rettinger technobuffalo
