TechnoBuffalo here there is just a cab
with clade of fitness bands out there
smart watches and other wearables are
claimed to do pretty close to the same
thing what I found though is you've got
to pick an allegiance to an operating
system if you want to use it if you want
to use Android wear obviously it's
Android if you want to buy an upcoming
Apple watch you got to pick an Apple
watch
pebble has kind of straddled that line
of cross-platform compatibility but not
many others do it the Microsoft band
surprisingly will work pretty close to
fully with iOS with Android and with
Windows Phone and it doesn't pretty well
let's go and take a look here is the
Microsoft band and it's a lot of things
it's a SmartWatch it's a fitness tracker
it's a UV sensor heartrate monitor one
of the things it's not those overly
good-looking is a bit on the clunky side
as you can see right here Microsoft does
have a variety of sizes and one thing I
like about it is that it is adjustable
like it's a regular watch man without
having to worry about sort of threading
through any sort of holes you just pop
it right in and you can slide to adjust
it to your wrist they also offer sizing
charts on lines to make sure when you
walk into a store or went online you're
gonna order the one that is right for
you
so a quick visual tour where we talk
about all the stuff this can do the band
it's got two little prongs that you push
in opens up and it's going to reveal on
the bottom that is a heart monitor which
will glow a super bright green when it
trying to get your heart rate and on the
bottom that is where the magnetic
charging port is going to levantar plugs
in via USB a battery life on this guy
I've been able to easily get two days I
pushed it to two and a half days at CES
so not something you have to worry about
charging every day despite having a full
color LCD display so you give that LCD
display it is going to scratch it is
going to show nicks and it's going to
show dirt so the first thing I recommend
you buy after you buy your smart band
it's also getting a screen protector for
it I did not put one on here I want to
see how the screen performed and worked
and you can probably see what happened
after about seven days of using that's
about six and a half I actual days of
usage time so I'll let aside let me show
you what it can do and show you how it's
gonna integrate with your phone so you I
controlled by two buttons you've got a
home and power button that's gonna wake
it up and hold it down
I'll turn it off and you have an action
button you can do a couple things with
the UI here if you just tap it you go
ahead and see what you've done for the
day so you can see your steps you can
see the amount of miles that you've
walked calories and it's all
customizable as well where'd you go and
that kind of stuff and there's a back
arrow that goes back and if you want to
swipe to the right you can see that it's
a blue - if there's your battery level
and let me know the heart rate sensor is
indeed working if you just want to swipe
the other direction you can get sort of
your SmartWatch type stuff you can see
your text from - your emails and even
your miss phone quality and customize
this quite a bit as we'll talk about it
also go through and see other actions
you want you got on here one things I
really like on it I think of nothing
I've seen on other smart bands before
and I think I've ever used these other
smart band is a UV sensor I'll tell you
what the UV levels are outside if it's
hazardous or not and then on the way
I've got mine set up is on settings so
it works pretty well let me go ahead and
bring in a phone and share with you I
would click the other story - the
Microsoft bands how it's been interact
with your device I'm gonna show you on
iOS Android experience is exactly the
same it's also the exact same on Windows
Phone but on Windows Phone you get the
gigantic added benefit of having Cortana
so you do anything you can do with your
virtual assistant that Cortana can do
right from your wrist so the app is
Microsoft health open that up it seems
to be a Bluetooth with your device to
pull up all the information so here's
what I've done today I've been kind of
active my goal is about five to seven
thousand steps per day so you know I'm
halfway there it's about two o'clock
here California time you can customize
tiles and add a lot more so the main app
is broken up into two sections you've
got your menu section up here and you've
got a full customization option here to
show you how to serve make this your own
go ahead and pull back and I'll show you
some of these things here so find a work
that was interesting and I'll sort of
help you with workouts that predetermine
workouts if you want to sort of pick
your favorites or browse workouts even
by brand you can see it's sort of
they've partnered with a few different
folks to sort of give you the best
workout experience in the band to
actually help you with that the profile
I mentioned it's a profile you set up
when you first get started connected
apps a few third-party apps here that'll
work sort of do other additional things
mostly Fitness things RunKeeper and My
Fitness Pal the more should certainly be
coming go ahead and go back and go it's
done about and thence
out when I first got this advice it was
all done up in purple screen was purple
everything was purple oh no I'm not a
not a purple guy so you can go ahead and
customize pretty much anything you want
there so personalize band you can pick
your color any color that you want here
I preferred discrete you pick wallpaper
different color wallpapers
I just wanted plain black they're gonna
be better for battery life they get a
preview of what it look like but more
addressing than that I think is the
tiles you can show so go ahead and go to
manage tiles this is where you can see
all the things that the band is capable
so again this is with iOS but Android is
gonna be the same Windows Phone is the
same you can pick what notifications are
going to show up a new certification is
gonna come with a little bit of haptic
feedback a vibration on your wrist so
for me I've got messaging mail called I
turn calendar off could have run can
turn off your exercise door sleep
counter it'll tell you when you want to
sleep and give you some information on
your rest an alarm guided workout
weather which I like would go and flip
weather on Finance UVs tell you what the
weather is outside if it's safe to be
out there with ultraviolet light a
Starbucks app which a lot of folks were
quite excited about to actually access
your Starbucks app break from your phone
Facebook facebook Messenger Twitter
anything that comes with Notification
Center you can show right from your
watch go ahead and hit save and now get
weather all throughout to show off right
on my watch it's syncing and next time I
go there it'll be there so let's go
ahead and take a look I'm sure that's
there now all my tiles and there's a
weather icon I can select that and it's
syncing trying to figure out where I am
using the GPS on my phone and it'll give
me the weather for or vine there you go
so what it is now today a little bit
about tomorrow and you can see it's a
full color display and I was really
surprised at how well battery life
lasted oh so one of the things I wanted
to try with this I was kind of
interested in you know I got a kid I'm
trying to be healthier ultimate rate was
sort of not very high I want to keep a
nice healthy arresting heart rate
between 65 to 75 s let me show you how
the heart rate monitor works on here
I'll go to put this guy back on my wrist
yeah the lens it goes high right away
and then drops back down so one four
99 to 76 which is about right maybe got
four if I've hired that usually is and
turn that back on and it's still locked
if I go ahead and kind of jump around a
little bit think about having to pay
taxes sue and other things that make me
nervous I should be able to see the
heart rate start to go up a little bit
so it's really cool to be able to track
this throughout the day and sort of see
when I got stressed out or when I didn't
and sort of helped engage to start
mitigate that unnecessary an additional
stress a couple thing that we should had
it wish I had a proximity sensor which
if I sort of did something to my wrist
it would light up before I brought it up
to my face it would light up
don't wait to turn on right now is just
to use that home button and then of
course the action button to do whatever
action that you want overall though I've
been really happy to Microsoft band I
kind of went in with little expectations
in a blew me away
I haven't worn a fitness band since the
Nike FuelBand about a year and a half
ago but this one's been really nice
actually I put my pebble steel aside
everything this is both a fitness band
and a SmartWatch and been really pleased
with it so if you're looking to pick one
up it's gonna cost you $200 from buy it
from Microsoft Store or online make sure
you print out the sizing chart first if
they're right one for you what do you
guys think is something you would use
not usual to your thoughts on it until
next time I'm John rende you're from
TechnoBuffalo see you guys next video we
stopped the video just real fast to
thank our friends and good peeps at
Lenovo no longer do you need a smelly
rubber mat to get your yoga on I want to
tell you about the Lenovo yoga 3 Pro
there's a laptop that just doesn't want
to be one type of laptop it wants to be
everything and it does so many cool
things got a ton of different modes
including laptop mode stand mode pet
mode and tablet mode and the thing could
launch off at this pace of probably
would two features a ridiculously
gorgeous 3200 by 1800 pixel 13.3 inch
