to you by domain.com all right have a
seat and listen up it is time for the
holiday gift guide for that gaming
person in your life even if that person
is you first up we're gonna talk about
one of my favorite things that I got
this year these are the control freak
little nubbins for whatever controller
it is that you play video games on these
things are fantastic you don't think
they're gonna make that big of a
difference it look kind of silly when
you get them but when you stick them
under your thumb sticks it forces you to
get better and having more range of
movement because it lifts up from the
top of the thumbstick really gives you a
lot more accuracy and precision once you
get used to them plus they have convex
and concave and they're super super
cheap great toppings stocking stuffers
stuffing stop stopping sift up stop you
all know you have that annoying friend
who still uses their crappy iPhone
headset to play with when you're playing
destiny or something online or it even
worse they're using the headset that
came with the ps4 or whatever it is that
they're using it's awful and it really
ruins the experience for everyone so
everyone's different on headsets but I
really like the ps4 Gold Wireless ones
like I said they're Wireless which means
I can run to the fridge grab something
to eat or drink and since they're made
by Sony they support the virtual
surround sound that's inside of them
which means it supports profiles for a
ton of the big flagship game including
destiny which is pretty important for me
the Logitech g600 MMO gaming mouse is
probably my favorite purchase of 2015 I
got it pretty cheap on sale from Amazon
but this thing is worth it even at full
price it's got probably I think I
counted approximately 726 buttons on it
and that's a total lie but there are a
lot of buttons and the programmable it's
got great colors it's a very comfortable
Mouse to use and I really like having
access to quite that many buttons
mice are a lot like headsets where you
want to get something that fits for that
correct person so you might want
something weighted you might not but
this is my pick for my favorite Mouse of
the year
and of course the kind of higher price
tag option of the five the Nintendo 3s
it has been around for a long time but
damn the titles on the 3ds are out of
control
great fire emblem lots of indie titles
with with shovel Knight
you've got Mario stuff Zelda stuff Yoshi
stuff Kirby stuff Donkey Kong stuff like
all that engine stuff that you can't get
anywhere else you can get on the 3ds so
this is great too because if you don't
want to rake the bank you can get a 2d S
which supports all the 3ds titles except
for the new 3ds titles so you can pick
up a new 3ds if you want to play some of
those newer titles but it's a great
option for those of you travel a lot
need something portable finally I would
be remiss to talk about my favorite
gaming stuff of the year without talking
about maybe my favorite game
yes destiny the taken king came out this
year as well but I gotta say fallout 4
has absolutely changed my video game
life if you've never played a fallout
before this is a great time to get into
it it's really accessible it's an
enormous amount of content great story
great characters great writing great
gunplay great gameplay great
customization for your character and
it's a sprawling sprawling map it's
enormous and you will get lost in it for
the majority of 2016 so it's absolutely
worth your buy those are my thoughts on
the best gaming gifts for 2015 let me
know what you have asked for from old
st. Nick or Krampus for the holidays or
whatever Festivus pole you are
worshiping this year and let me know
what you are getting for your friends
who are gaming focused in the comments
as well thank you guys so much for
watching I'll catch you in the next
video and be kind to one another and I
love you all in the spirit of the
holidays I just kind of want to make
sure that we take a little bit of a
second to stop and think about those
among us who are less fortunate so I
just registered this this domain it's
the elf dot rehab for for all elves who
maybe have had a little bit too much
eggnog over the holidays a little bit
too much mulled wine and they you know
they need somewhere to go to kind of get
their life together so I registered the
elf dot rehab over on domain.com which
was a great place to go do it really
quick and easy to do and I used the code
techno bubble oh and it got me 20
sent off so hopefully we'll have that
site up and running for any Elvis you
know and in need in this time of year
when you're thinking domains think
