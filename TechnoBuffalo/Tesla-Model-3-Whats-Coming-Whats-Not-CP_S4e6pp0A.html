model 3 is coming and it's coming faster
I think most people expect there's a lot
to know about the car and also a huge
amount we don't know in their last model
3 video so I want to share all the stuff
with you guys decide whether or not the
model 3 is the right car for you the
first thing we know you know the price
going to be starting at around $35,000
you can get that price down to as low as
about 2075 depending on what state you
live in so we've got an affordable
mass-market fully autonomous car like
the technology will be in it and that is
a first so every model here that's going
to shift going to ship with Tesla
autopilot 2.0 and that's going to enable
within two years must be saying full
autonomy like go to sleep in the back of
your car type of autonomy let's get
saying no towards even the end of this
year early next year they'd be able to
have level for autonomy which is
essentially the Carl's are all the work
for you but you forgot us in the driver
seat just to like check things out don't
expect that technology to be there at
the 35 thousand dollar price point gonna
have to pay for it whatever your car
will have it because get it later if you
want we still know the range good to
have a starting a range of 215 miles and
that is deceptive as a Tesla owner
myself put the love to claim range the
criminal Ange at a hundred percent
battery life and you should never charge
your card 100% that leads to huge
battery degradation down the line
so real-world are probably could have
about 190 ish on the range but there
will be options and there will be speed
options as well you want a muscle saying
there should be cars that can get from
zero to 60 in under 4 seconds it's not
faster so it should be a PE variant as
well we know it's going to have a crazy
glass roof option since we've got their
own Tesla glass similar what we think we
have in the Model X that sort of almost
a helicopter ish windshield LMS is also
hinted at a solar roof option that
hasn't been the biggest success thing in
the world we've seen try to do it with
the Prius in Japan we've seen Fisker
Automotive try to do it with the Karma
doesn't work out that well just can
create that much electricity but it
might be an option on the model 3 that's
the moral of what we know there's still
a lot we don't yet know about the car we
should see the production unit be
unveiled in July but things should
change versus what we saw and billed to
last year there'll be a wider trunk
opening and things are a little bit kind
of up in the air as far as what's
actually going to
according to the folks at electric
successful I saw the patents for
automated super charging it's you guys
remember four years ago
that's what shared the video with the
weird snake charger kind of winding its
way and plugging itself in a Tesla gears
up to full autonomy they want cars go to
charge themselves so allegedly you bill
to park your Model 3 into a supercharger
let park itself and it's going to charge
itself be a very like phallic looking
snake plugging itself in which is kind
of cool it's technology accessible as
shown does indeed exist speaking of
superchargers Tesla will also be
doubling the number of supercharger
stations in the u.s. when 3500 to 7,000
by the end of this year to gear up for
just a ton of model freeze on the road
they're still expected to hit the road
later this year but supercharging will
not be free to have to pay to enable it
and then you're going to have to sort of
pay for youth if you want to supercharge
your car which should which about 80%
battery life in like 16 20 minutes we
also don't know what's the center stack
is going to look like we heard rumors
for a while is going to have a heads up
display and that was a rumor that I was
sharing a few months back must catch
squash that syndrome we will not be a
heads up play instead of having sort of
the large portrait style screen that
you've got in the model last Model X
going to be a landscape oriented screen
so different UI here the big question is
is it the car you guys have been waiting
for $35,000 400-mile GV is pretty
awesome it's kind of that perfect
compromise between performance which
weren't having technology and also not
breaking of things to do it let me know
in the comments down below if you
ordered a Model 3 and let me know why
and if your pro model 3 exhibit do a
thumbs up let us know I'll do a ton more
Tesla coverage as the card is closer to
release so next time John Wright injured
from TechnoBuffalo
