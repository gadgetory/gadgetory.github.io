and welcome back for a very exciting
advanced overview of Windows 7 in the
first video we looked at the aesthetic
improvements and some of the more
prominent features of the OS in fact I
got a couple of pretty good emails in a
response for that video and one of the
emails meant like this you spent two and
a half minutes on wallpapers and themes
are you gay well I'm not gay but you're
in luck I won't be spending time looking
at themes in these videos so in the
upcoming Windows 7 videos we're going to
be going deeper into the new features
and improvements we no 7 in my opinion
is all about efficiency faster access to
different tasks and more efficient ways
of completing those tasks and speaking
of faster access let's start off with
some more keyboard shortcuts shortcuts
in my opinion are always good but don't
take too many shortcuts in life because
you might miss out on something anyway
when you're in a folder you can press
alt P to bring up a preview view of the
files or in this case pictures what
you're looking at
pretty exciting stuff
when you hold down Windows and the
spacebar you enable the arrow peak
function which gives you a view under
the screens you have opened on the
desktop
last time I showed you the Aero Snap
feature which attaches your Windows to
the edges of the screen to speed things
up you don't have to use your mouse to
do this
you can just easily press down the
Windows key and hit the arrow keys in
the direction of your choice pressing
the Windows key and the up arrow will
maximize the folder and pressing windows
down will minimize also a very
functional key command has been added
for zooming in just hit the windows + +
key to get it nice and close
not a bad feature win for example
reading small fonts and other stuff
that's under the limit of your vision
when you zoomed in the mouse will follow
your actions
pressing down the Windows key and the
minus key will get you back out okay
next up is the rehashed Windows Media
Center I'm just going to take a brief
look at Windows Media Center because
there's so many features that would take
an entire video to cover
Windows Media Center on Vista was a bit
clunky and a bit slow at times but the
media center has been tweaked for
Windows 7 it's faster it looks sleeker
and best of all it seems to work I had
some serious blue screen of death issues
with my DVD tutor Windows Vista which
was not cool at all the media center
interface seems to be quite fast and
definitely easy to use
it's very simple to set up your music
and video libraries but the single
coolest thing about the new Media Center
is that how easy it is to set up with an
extender device such as my trusty Xbox
360 all you need to do is have your Xbox
360 hook up to the same Rooter and from
your my xbox menu launch the media
center and you will be prompted with an
8 digit code enter the code on your PC
and press next and that's about it now
you have your Xbox 360 attached to your
PC and you can stream any media content
to your home theater on your xbox you
will be getting the exact same media
center interface which is also very cool
and you don't have to have media center
running on your PC to do this just make
sure the windows 7 is up and running and
you can access media center on your Xbox
at any time and after having streamed a
couple of movies to my xbox 360 I can
say that it seems to work great there's
not much reason to fill up your Xbox
hard drive with music and videos because
streaming is now so painless I can
definitely recommend using media center
on the Xbox also let's take a quick look
at the new Media Player 12 in Windows 7
as you can see there is now a streaming
option on the toolbar itself and
streaming is now possible over the local
network but also over the Internet and
the set of procedure is equally as
simple as the setup process we looked at
on the media center the setup requires
you to associate with a Windows Live ID
which then enables you to for example
set up an online media library at home
and access your files for example music
and videos at work some pretty cool
stuff
but I still feel that the media player
still lacks a bit in usability for
example compared to iTunes whole group
is also a new addition to Windows 7 it's
basically a simplified way of setting up
your home network I've personally never
had issues with sharing my files between
my home computers but if you found it
too tricky in the past homegroup dumbs
the process down to a few simple tasks
just choose the files and/or devices you
want to share and create the homegroup
the setup wizard will give you a
password and that's about it
you've created the homegroup now the
homegroup you have created will appear
on devices connected to your network so
you can just use the password you were
given and connect to the homegroup as
you probably noticed the homegroup is
now listed as an icon in the my computer
window sharing your files and your home
network is now so easy that if you
manage to fail setting up a homegroup
I'll personally come down and give you a
good slap in the face ok let's take a
look at some of the new features in the
control panel new to Windows 7 is the
Action Center sounds pretty cool right
well this time around I'm not talking
about the Chuck Norris type of action
but basically the type of action that
you don't want to see the Action Center
on the taskbar will pop up as a flag if
there's a severe issue that needs your
attention
for example issues relating to lack of
virus protection or having not backed up
your system which it seems I've yet not
done but in any case the Action Center
is basically a one-stop place where you
can find system maintenance information
and where you can try to address and
troubleshoot issues and problems that
Windows has detected also a very cool
new feature in the security setting is
the BitLocker BitLocker is a very easy
to use security software that makes it
possible for you to encrypt any of your
content for example external hard drives
or USB drives so that they're only
accessible using a password so if you're
like me and you do some moonlighting for
secret government agencies it's probably
a good idea to encrypt your files just
select the drive to be encrypted and
enter a desired access code
you
and you may want to save the recovery
key somewhere just in case you lose your
password so don't have to recruit the
friendly neighborhood hacker to recover
your files
the encryption takes a few minutes
depending on the device or encrypting
and there we go
encryption complete so when I take out
the USB drive and put it back in I'm
prompted with a window asking for my
password
I think BitLocker is a very cool
security feature to have just in case
another smart addition to Windows 7 is
the improved window search which is
starting to remind me of a certain Mac
OSX feature called finder searching
index files is super fast and the
control panel has been now added to the
indexing which is very convenient for
fast access to your device and hardware
settings
the next feature is something pretty
cool and it's called XP mode and it's
pretty much what it sounds like it's
basically a virtual machine that runs
Windows XP like any other application on
top of Windows 7 it was very easy to set
up and here it is running in a window
but you can also run it in full screen
if you want it has all the old
applications and most of the
functionality that Windows XP had but XP
Mode is mainly meant for backwards
compatibility for older programs and
devices that just aren't compatible with
Windows 7 and while we're here let's
take a quick comparison of the word pads
and check out how it's been redefined
for Windows 7 so on the right we have
the old word pad from windows XP and
Windows Vista and on the left we have
the new redefined Windows word pad with
the new ribbon interface Microsoft is
really trying to push the new ribbon
interface something already seen in
office 207 the ribbon interface is
basically meant to replace all these old
looking drop-down toolbars with an okay
looking tab based approach I'm not sure
if I liked how it was integrated into
office 207 in my books functionality
always comes first
aesthetics comes second and I'm not sure
if the ribbon interface improved
functionality in office 207 but I have
to admit it looks pretty smart here on
WordPad and also on paint so it could be
that it only takes a bit time to get
used to but in any case XP mode is a
great feature for backwards
compatibility and it also kind of works
like a time machine you can always turn
the XP mode on and imagine that you're
back in 2003 ah good times
so we're about to wrap up this video but
I should mention that there are a lot of
smaller improvements and new features to
Windows 7 for example the resource
monitor has now been upgraded with a new
graphical display of memory usage
also new to Windows 7 is the possibility
of installing virtual drives and a great
addition to this Windows Explorer
burning software is that it's now
possible to burn ISO images onto disk
using only the windows explorer burning
software which is very cool indeed last
but not least to the not so cool stuff
here are the prices for Windows 7 home
professional and ultimate well look on
the bright side it is cheaper than
Windows Vista when it came out but it's
definitely going to tear a hole in your
wallet the size of a decent 50 caliber
gun blast and after just paying only 30
bucks for macro 6 10 upgrade paying 200
bucks for an upgrade to get Windows 7
which I've been already using on the
beta for 8 months
feels like a punch in the face so what
do you think are the new features worth
an upgrade to Windows 7 or are you going
to be sticking with XP or Windows Vista
post your thoughts in the comments and
check out my next video where it put
Windows Vista XP and seven through some
demanding tests and benchmarks catch you
later
