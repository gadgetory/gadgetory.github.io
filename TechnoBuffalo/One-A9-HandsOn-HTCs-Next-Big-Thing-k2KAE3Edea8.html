here with technobuffalo with a hands-on
for you and we're going to be looking at
the brand new HTC One a 9 this sucker is
brand new it is a little bit of a
departure as you're going to be able to
tell from the changes in design that
might look a little bit familiar to you
I can think of at least one device in
particular that sports this kind of
metal back with antenna bands and a very
similar speaker grill down at the bottom
but we'll move on from that because this
thing's claim to fame is it is the first
non Nexus device running marshmallow and
it's not just running marshmallow this
is actually HTC Sense again so it is HTC
Sense but underneath the sense it's got
enough sense to be running marshmallow
in 2015 which is pretty cool which means
that this fingerprint scanner down here
on the bottom which does work indeed
when it is off which is nice watch ready
boom we're in that fingerprint scanner
does indeed work with the new AP eyes
that are available in marshmallow which
is great underneath the hood it's
running a snapdragon 617 that's an
octa-core processor clocked at 1.5
gigahertz that's one of snapdragons
newer processors and it does come with a
feature that we're gonna talk about just
a second terms of storage it's got 32
gigs on board and three gigs of RAM
under the hood now let's talk about that
617 really quick this is one of the new
chips that's from Qualcomm from I
believe it came out last month it not
only supports quick charge 2.0 it's also
forwards can paddle that's not something
that you hear very often it's forwards
compatible with quick charge three point
0 which is up to forty percent faster
than 2 point 0 so this should get you a
full battery in just about no time over
here on the side you'll see there's a
couple of sin doors and those aren't
both sim doors there's just one similar
they've gone so far even to make sure
that they're labeled for you so written
sim right there and SD right here so
you'll be happy to hear that it is
indeed expandable via SD all the way up
to 2 terabytes which is pretty cool it's
going to be coming to the US with all
the bands that you would need for all
your gsm carriers
that includes band 12 so that's exciting
to hear I can't wait to start using more
devices on band 12 I know John's crazy
about then 12 so I'm pretty stoked on
those high speeds on tmobile as well
that camera on the back again just a
smidge similar to maybe a little
familiar to something you might have
seen on the market with the round flash
in the round lens that is not an
ultrapixel camera does not have an ultra
pixel sensor but you do get an ultra
pixel sensor up here on the front facing
camera just not on the back the back is
a 13 megapixel camera with a 2 point 0
aperture nothing else in terms of bells
and whistles something crazy no oh I
asks or anything like that the device so
far feels pretty okay in the hand you
know that the device is that it's
emulating aren't exactly you know the
worst on the market my only lament is
that it is really kind of done already I
i miss HTC in its heyday you know we
were just having a conversation in the
office about the HTC hero and the nexus
one and all the great devices that we
look back on from HTC so nostalgic Lee
and I just don't feel that way about
them anymore not to mention i feel like
the bezels on both the top and the
bottom we're just way too big i'm not
sure why there's an entire HTC logo down
there when we've got one on the back i
realize that i might be confusing who
made this device but it is definitely an
HTC device so this is the HTC One a 9
let me know if there's anything that you
guys would like me to check a little bit
more thoroughly between now and the
full-on review but in the meantime just
want to make sure you guys had a quick
hands-on with the device let me know
what you think about it in the comments
again let me know what you want to see
in the full review as always thank you
guys for watching the kind of one
another and i'll catch you in the next
video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
