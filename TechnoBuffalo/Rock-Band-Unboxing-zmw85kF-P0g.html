unboxing video for you this time it's
nothing Apple but it is kind of
electronic I'm going to unbox you can
see it behind me or attempt to unbox
rock band for the Xbox 360 photos you
guys don't know it's kind of like Guitar
Hero which I recently got is a gift and
never thought I'd be into stuff like
that but I played it and I really liked
it so rock band it's more like Guitar
Hero it's got guitars drums I think you
can play bass and sing and stuff so it's
fun for half a lot of people where I
think you can play on your own I don't
really know yet anyway I'm gonna unbox
it haven't really seen a steady unboxing
some to go ahead and try and do that for
for you guys out there so if you're
interested enjoy if you're not
interested check back for another Apple
or other electronic video but let's go
ahead and try and do this so here it is
as you guys can see it's a big-ass box
it's freaking huge it says right here
for Xbox 360 which is what I have so
let's go ahead and open this thing up
all right
first thing there's a big sticker right
here says if you counter any problem
with the rock bin do not take it back to
the store it's not making me feel so
confident about it but we'll see all
right open it up or cheater paper again
okay cute paper rather please don't
return this to the store do they
probably send it to rock band there's a
60 day return policy all right so open
the box here you're outside for us you
can see here we've got the game rock
band all right
let's see I'll pull it out piece by
piece here Xbox 360 rock band wired
guitar so the guitar is wired
particularly good that in a minute just
unpack all the pieces there's that
there's this thing I'm gonna look this
is oh the microphone will impact that
for you a minute but there's a
microphone there and plug into USB port
there a microphone small box here for a
rock band only one piece for port USB
hub at a power that gives you a USB hub
the Xbox 360 only has two USB so now you
can plug all four things into it it's
cardboard I think the bulk of this is
the drum kit
we try and get this out of here for you
come out
all right Xbox 460 rock band drums so
let's take a look at what this stuff
looks like inside here awesome
hey guys alright so rock band wired
guitar this is not a wireless guitar
like in Guitar Hero 3 but I think you
can use the wireless guitar for the Xbox
but I don't know if they're just opening
this up here box
all right there there is the guitar and
it's top part right there is uh not
there so soon top part is what's gonna
be in this block strap top pilot guitar
looks like it just snaps right in here
I'll show you guys that looks like in
case you want to see the plastic up here
little twist off
all right so again guys here is the
guitar take it out Lambie bar and talk
part on says you can see it there Fender
Stratocaster this parts really probably
not necessary to it but put on anyway to
make it look a little better
it snaps right on yeah just push it in
alright so now it's on and there's a
guitar it's got the five buttons up top
and five down below if your uh it's got
smaller hands or something it's got a
back button a start button up and down
here and I love her I don't know what it
does and I guess the strap just hurts on
right there and right there
so that is the rock band guitar and
always we don't put the drum kit for you
guys so you can see what's in it
so I excuse the big kitchen knife
there's only thing I had that wasn't
dirty got it do dishes so I'm not gonna
build this for you on campus but I will
show you what see here
so if you guys can see that a lot of
metal pipes the drumsticks are in there
and the drum pads alright guys so this
is just a real quick unboxing of rock
bands I don't know if you guys are
interested in this or not but figure is
worth a whirl if you guys are interested
you want me to do a review of it after I
get it set up and have a chance to
player that I'd be happy to do that if
that's something you guys want to see
anyway Tad's be happy holidays
my Christmas coming up Happy Hanukkah
just passed whatever else you guys
celebrate I hope you have a good one and
thanks for watching and thanks for
subscribing guys talk to you soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
