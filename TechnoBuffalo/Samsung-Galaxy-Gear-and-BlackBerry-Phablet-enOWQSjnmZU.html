brought to you by Gamefly what's up
everyone welcome back their pursuit of a
rumor roundup the show title didn't give
it away this to show where we round up
rumors from the tech world of this week
Samsung Smart Watch Google glass
consumer edition might be cheaper than
you think Apple is gearing up to show us
what's next for the iPhone and a
blackberry phablet that maybe two of you
are excited about might be coming this
is rumor roundup I'm John rhett endure
let's get started we still don't know
much about Samsung's rumored SmartWatch
the Galaxy gear but according to a new
report the device may be ready for this
spotlight Oh Sam Mobile's got a pretty
reliable track record reports the
wearable device will be unveiled at the
unpacked event schedules for my birthday
September 4th in Berlin alongside the
galaxy note 3 based on recent Samsung
patents likely the company's new
SmartWatch would be called the Galaxy
gear the wearable tech will sync with
your Galaxy smartphone providing quick
access to music email text messages and
hopefully some other notifications also
though it will support other Android
devices to advise also expect to feature
a curved screen which may even
implements the company's flexible
display technology which would be pretty
badass
either way though TechnoBuffalo is going
to be in Berlin for the unpacked event
to bring you live coverage of everything
that's happening so that'll be awesome I
will not be there actually we'll be
covering the event it's too close to the
birth of my son coming sometime in the
month of September but we'll have all
that news for you so stay tuned we
really love Google glass but a 1500
bucks is way out of reach for most
casual techies thankfully though when
the device is mass-produced it may cost
as little as three Hyundai according to
topology Research Station sigh how will
Google splash it caused from 1515
dollars three hundred a big part of that
price drop though might be the company's
recent investments in hi max display
Taiwan based company that supplies the
heads-up display right to calm hood
components back in July the search giant
bought up 6.3% stake of the manufacturer
which should help speed up production of
the liquid crystal on silicon display
module and bring to
of each hood down to just 35 smackeroos
I think when we do see Google glass that
comes in maybe three to five hundred I
think we'll see a huge adoption rate
what do you think what price would
Google glass have to be for you to buy
it you dim in the comments and my pants
September tenth is coming soon Apple
might show us what's coming up they
expected to announce their next
generation iPhones according to report
from the pre reliable All Things D over
the past several months of speculation
for Apple's next mobile devices have
been at a fever pitch particularly
surrounding other companies to pose
budget iPhone hard to pin down though is
what we'll get with the next flagship
iPhone likely be called the iPhone 5s so
betas of Apple's upcoming iOS 7 upgrade
have been coming fast and furious we
imagine they're going to spend time
going over the OS biggest features and
maybe a few changes what we saw when I
first was teased back in June so
regardless coming soon September 10th is
not that far away we're gonna be getting
iPhone 5s probably an iPhone 5c and
maybe something fancy might be there as
well but we have yet to know
BlackBerry's long rumored phablet which
we expect to be called the Z 30 is
leaked again
this time in the video showing off a
fully operating version of the upcoming
handset the video was posted by s
channel a pretty new YouTube account
which claims a z30 will hit stores this
fall we also saw AT&amp;amp;T logo smack dab in
the back yo device a video also shows
BlackBerry's camera application and
highlights jetpack joyride on the large
screen is e30 initially rumored to be
