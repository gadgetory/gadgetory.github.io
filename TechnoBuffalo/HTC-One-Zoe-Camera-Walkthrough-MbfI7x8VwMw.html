TechnoBuffalo i wanted to show you what
these four ultrapixels means so i can
take a picture here right now BAM
and I'm not gonna be able to show you
whether it's better or not than another
camera because we're looking at it on a
1080p display but what I can show you is
notice when I hit this when I go to take
a picture it starts going red see that
red line that's what it's taking a Zoe
shot that's a three second camera you
can see that the Zoe mode is on it's a
three second clip which can then be put
in to highlight reels so you also get
the picture obviously the leader on you
can go down and create sort of an
experience okay so once you have a
collection of Zoe's and pictures and
Zoe's are those three second Clips you
just go into albums events and this took
me a little while to figure out how to
ask somebody and say we want to do a
great day in the park
now we click the top and it
automatically creates a highlight reel
of the day in the park - music she's got
pictures and Zoe's all in one
you see how that one was a quick two
seconds oh and there's one there but it
also mixes with just straight pictures
just like that and it's a full 29 second
clip it's complete highlight of your day
and I think this is one of the really
cool things about the camera experience
on the HTC One and this part of sense 5
greeny this is hot days elimi
TechnoBuffalo checking out this so</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
