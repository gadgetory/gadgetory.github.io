original Microsoft Surface was a giant
multi-touch table top computer then it
kind of turned into a tablet then turned
to a laptop and now it's back to kind of
a bigger all-in-one today Microsoft
unveiled the newest member of its
surface family meet the surface studio
this gorgeous looking all-in-one
touchscreen is only twelve point five
millimeters thick it's got a crazy
zero-gravity hinge and I'll let it go
almost flat and all the computer inner
deserves stored in the base so it looks
like the monitor just kind of floating
through our core gamer you might be
little disappointed I don't think this
is geared at that demographic it's
geared more either the casual gamer or
the creative professional so it's got a
28 inch pixel sense display which looks
absolutely gorgeous and the reason this
is probably not meant for a hardcore
gamer it's got the geforce 980
intel i7 processor and up to 32 gigs of
ram and up to two terabytes of SSD
storage is your gravity hinge though it
was really the highlight for me you can
tilt down at sharp angles can move into
a more distal computer design or make it
look like a drafting board it's really
cool to hold and feel and when you use
it it kind of becomes second-nature and
of course with Windows 10 it is
obviously a touchscreen pre-order you're
gonna start at two thousand nine hundred
ninety nine bucks so not cheap but just
quote limited quantities available for
the holiday season but one of the
must-have accessories to go at the
surface to do is a surface dial in
pre-order it'll come with it otherwise
you'll buy it later it's gonna be 99
bucks this is a brand input device for
Microsoft's latest surface products the
device is you have to feedback you plop
it on the screen it's not gonna stick
there if you have a curve up like a
normal monitor but you haven't fold it
down it'll stay there on its own as you
turn it you're gonna get feedback
depending on how far you're turning it
so for example if you want to integrate
it with Spotify it'll be able to show
you the songs if your drawing can change
the color like knots making it open to
developers customize how's it gonna work
and it looks really kind of cool there a
lot of potential uses I think for
something like this it's not a brand new
device we've seen something similar from
third parties but it's a first
manufacturer it's made it that's
integrated with its own hardware
when I think it's gonna be a must-have
feature for anybody's looking to pick up
a surface studio so what'd you guys
think are you into the latest addition
to the surface lineup were you more
disappointed that maybe the surface pro
4 didn't get any sort of upgrades I want
to know what you guys think you're the
comments down below I cannot wait to get
one of these mammoth jammas in the
office to test until next time I'm John
reading from TechnoBuffalo and sorry I
said man with JAMA I'll see you guys
