technobuffalo here and if you watches
this video chances are you saw the title
up above this is a giveaway video I
don't really have any particular reason
to do it I'm not celebrating anything I
just want to give back and say thank you
for your awesome awesome support I think
the fact that I get to review consumer
electronics for a living is such an
amazing blessing and something that I
never take for granted and helps you
wake up with a smile on my face every
day and this is just a small way for me
to say thank you so here it is xbox
360's commonly called slim it's connect
ready it is the four gigabyte model you
can have xbox obviously play games zoom
Facebook last thought FM all kinds of
other xbox II goodness what do you need
to do to win and is it open to everybody
in the world I am going to make both of
those things very very very easy first
if you want to win this is going to be
probably the simplest giveaway we've
ever done there will be a link down
below to an article on technobuffalo all
you gots to do is leave a comment super
simple super easy it's going to go until
january thirty first at eleven
fifty-nine p.m. pacific standard time
doesn't matter where in the world you
are I just matters that you get it in
violin 59 p.m. pacific standard time you
can leave up to 2 comments per day each
comment is going to count as one entry
so that's really you can have a
pituitary per day from now until the
31st other reason we're doing it on
technobuffalo is because it's much
easier to keep track of entries with our
Disqus comment system so no more than
two we can track that you just qualified
it was more than two but you know two
per day you can do them one after
another or one in the morning what a
night whatever is best for you you know
no big deal you can say why you want to
win
in or just say hi or leave a recipe for
your favorite chocolate chip cookies uh
you know whatever it is and we'll pick
the winner of course at random so you
know I'm nothing i can do i love to hear
you guys I talked about why you want to
win the console but it's not going to
affect the outcome got to keep it random
and the next question international
folks I love me some international peeps
so of course this is going to be open to
you as well but because you might live
in a different country where maybe the
plugs are different or maybe the
consoles region locked and all that kind
of stuff so what I've done in the past
international folks is given away the
cash equivalent of a brand-new 4
gigabyte xbox 360 so if you are outside
of the US and you win I will send you
the cash equivalents which is just about
two hundred dollars the only caveat is
that you need a paypal account or no
someone's got a paypal account or have
access to a paypal account that you can
use I will send you two hundred dollars
us now wherever you live in the world
that might not be enough to buy you an
xbox 360 but it's free money and better
than it was before so hopefully you guys
will be happy and the next question if
you're in the US and you win can you get
the cash I get that question quite a bit
generally I haven't done that but for
this one sure if in the u.s. me win and
you don't want the xbox and he sent to
you with a handwritten note if you've
got access to a paypal account I'll send
you two hundred bucks cash rather oh
this is just a fun giveaway and I want
to make it as easy for everybody as
possible so let me recap sort of quickly
open to anyone in the world if you're
outside the US and you win you can get
to the equivalent of this new Xbox to
just about two hundred dollars cash kind
of symbol I just need access to a paypal
account you from the US you can pick the
Xbox where the cash you can enter there
going to be a link down below to click
on the youtube comment thing you can
leave comments on this video if you want
but order to enter you have to leave the
comments on the TechnoBuffalo article
which the link is going to be down below
it makes it much easier for us to pick a
winner and check who is entering and not
entering so let me say that one more
time you have
leave your comment on the TechnoBuffalo
article on the link down below you can
leave up the two comments per day you
can leave more but it's going to
disqualify that if you win for that day
so you might not want to now it's going
to run from now until eleven fifty-nine
p.m. on january thirty first to go ahead
and comment away 2 comments per day i
hope you guys enjoy this is just to
thank you one of the many giveaways we
have coming up as a way to sort of give
back to the audience and you guys given
me so much I feel like if I can even
return the favor just a little bit that
is worthwhile so you guys i am jon
rettinger from technobuffalo happy
