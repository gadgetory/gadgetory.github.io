from TechnoBuffalo here and I've got a
very odd box about a year and a half ago
we got another super futuristic looking
portal thing from Intel that a ton of
their latest gen products coming out I'm
assuming something similar but I really
don't know
what is in this 70s looking box it says
Intel Box Master System that came with
this thing and also some computer
components I'm kind of excited about
we've got 16 gigs of course air
Vengeance Ram it's ddr4 we've got a
really awesome asus motherboard it's
z170 deluxe it's about a $350
motherboard so pretty excited to check
this guy out and build a beastly
computer to push that guy off so I'm
assuming this is gonna be something to
do with whatever Intel's got going on
I'm guessing skylark there's six gen AI
series of chips well let's take a look
at the box this this is what people look
like in the 70s so if you think that you
have an old soul in which you were born
in 70s this is what your hair would look
like it would look like that poor kid
this is what your dad would have looked
like this guy looks like a neighbor
should be saying telling the cops I
don't know he seems so normal and this
could be your sister who looks silly and
then your mom she looks like she's right
at scooby-doo but anyway let's take a
look at the box impress your friends
Intel box mattress two new hi-fi 8-bit
audio eight bits is not that many bits
it's a cartridge based system so it's
not gonna work you got to just get in
there just to to make it work like in
Kenner cartridges you got some games
they're showing here polar rescue sky
guardians star star the Intel box
mattress system puts the good in good
game let's go ahead open this thing up
and see what's actually inside I guess
it folks Intel credit they have fun with
unboxings as somebody who essentially
opens boxes for living which I admit
sounds even like a silly thing to say
that I do it takes a lot to get me
excited to open some up and this one
definitely is unique and did it so let's
go ahead and pull this thing out of here
and there's another box inside of a box
let's see well they did it very like old
Atari retro with the
the wood and stuff on the side pretty
cool alright so here is the Intel box
master system push all this stuff all
this stuff off here let's see what it is
it's gonna open it up experience what's
inside and now I've got this so there's
a power button dad I think I just broke
totally broke the power button but it
turns down so I think we broke it I
think it's broken
see if I can make it work I think I
think it's dead
one eternity later home so I seem to
have broken it I'm guessing I had to
push certain code to get things working
but I broke the little thing which is
bad you didn't go ahead and break things
but I'm guessing that I can still find a
way inside of this box that's maybe a
little less and conventional like maybe
involves a screwdriver and some brute
force so let's find a way to open this
thing up together because this way but
kudos for trying something new this is a
cool way to unbox something but if I
guys broke it so I think I can just do
this oh wait turn one did something now
I feel like I'm just super cheating it
didn't make a noise I'm gonna cotton oh
all right shh put it back okay that
didn't happen guys ah I got the code and
it made a noise I'll admit that maybe I
cheated a little bit okay let's get way
up inside the box listen I'm sorry
you've your moment in the Sun is over
until Master System box listen like we
just talked about this all right
Intel Inside unlocked performance
outside so it is the core i7 and here it
is the core i7 I think I should do like
a neat bit noise to come here this is
art oh this is harder than it looks open
alright so here in this lovely blue box
guessing we have a processor we do and
this is what a processor looks like it's
not like as glamorous as you'd expect
but like millions and millions of
dollars go into making that that thing
works push-ups eyes real quick sack and
then I will get nerdy and talk about it
gonna cover it up underneath we have
blue foam blue and foamy we also have a
solid-state drive it is the Intel 750
series that's an adding card so it's
straight into the motherboard
it's kind of cool let's see what we got
going on here 400 gigabytes of capacity
so there's a lot of capacity here at the
intel solid-state drive
but I feel like I just talked about the
processor first before we do that so so
this is the 6th generation processor so
if you're good at math you will know
that that there were this many
generations that that came before it
oh we have is the i7 6700 K processor so
supposedly this guy is also unlocked for
overclocking so you can just tweak it as
much as your eat sink will allow you
it's gonna retail also for around 30 or
50 bucks in case you guys are wondering
all right so now it's time just to get a
little bit nerdy so just bear with me
here this thing has a base CPU frequency
of 4 gigahertz and a turbo CPU frequency
of 4-point gigahertz which is a lot of
gigas that are hurting as with the
previous nomenclature the i7 model is
also a quad core CPU with
hyper-threading and eight megabytes of
l3 cache so that's a tiny little guy
which needs to find a home and a
computer which I need to build like just
right quick got to build this guy so I'm
gonna build a computer and I'm gonna
have fun doing it maybe I will get
Austin Evans to help me build a computer
he's good at Intel solid-state drive
this is 750 series a 400 gig it's a
heading card like I talked about it's
sealed up let's open it up though
because seals are meant to be broken
oh I hate opening Tabor which I hadn't a
necessarily large knife ah got one let's
slice open we're all about bad jokes you
couldn't tell here all right open let's
see what this looks like fan a nanny
boom that that's the solid state drive
card it's kind of sexy in its own right
I'd say but this is it this is the 750
series 400 gigs on this guy all jokes
aside we got some beastly components to
build I think a really awesome computer
it's actually paired with Windows 10 and
they're ridiculously awesome Corsair
Vengeance and the z71 70 deluxe mobo by
asus we have a pretty sweet computer so
I'm gonna I'll try and building it we'll
do a video with bug look together and we
can have some fun anyway thank you guys
for watching this unboxing of the Intel
Box so I don't learn more about
everything here
check out the unlock performance website
we'll put a link to it down below but
it's indeed ly flash on box but it'll
just doesn't hit the link in my pants
and learn more about the stuff alright
thank you guys for watching
I'm jad ready for Tecna buffalo and I
will see you in the next video Oh</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
