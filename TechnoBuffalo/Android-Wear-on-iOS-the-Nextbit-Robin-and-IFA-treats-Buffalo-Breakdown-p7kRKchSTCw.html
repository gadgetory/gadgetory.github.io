there's a bunch of brand-new stuff out
of IFA and brand new nests this week I'm
our % / technobuffalo and this is the
Buffalo breakdown Android wear support
has finally come to the iphone all
devices running where 1.3 should work
with iOS devices running the new Android
wear app while not everything works due
to some limitations in place on Apple
side it is nice to see broaden
compatibility hit my favorite wearable
software of choice you can check out our
hands-on in the description or you can
go ahead and just try for yourself HTC
is set to reveal their brand new device
on September sixth which is a sunday
oddly enough by the next time I see you
guys we should have a brand new HTC
device to pick apart and HTC really
needs a win here this is either going to
be the device that puts it out of its
nose dive or another nail in the coffin
but I am excited to see which it'll be I
am huge on the democratization of the
smartphone industry so it's no surprise
that I can't wait to check out the next
bit Robin the new android powered device
just hit kick-started this week but it's
not just any Android device the next bit
team modified android to support a
flexible storage space in the cloud need
to shoot some video and don't have quite
enough room on your device the Robin
will offload things that you haven't
used for a while to their servers and
it'll be up there when you need it at
the tap of a button not to mention the
device itself looks friggin gorgeous I
can't wait to put this thing through its
paces can't wait to get one here in the
office and play around with it you can
check out their Kickstarter video for
more information and we of course have a
bunch more stuff on the site pre-orders
for the Moto X pure edition are now live
on motorola's moto maker the $400 device
is sporting some sweet new color choices
we had a great time here in the office
deciding on a color scheme for our
review model which you guys are going to
get to see very very soon can't wait to
see how the pure edition stacks up
especially as this kind of price range
is getting kind of heated here next up
nests third generation of devices was
announced this week sporting a larger
screen smaller bezels faster processors
all kinds of really fun stuff I'm a huge
nest fan I have one at home
the entire line of products that they
put out is fantastic so I'm excited to
see the new nest hopefully we'll have
one here in the office to check out for
you guys and finally the week of IFA is
upon us IFA is the European kind of
equivalent to CES and boy does it show
we've got a ton of new wearables to talk
about in a ton of new devices sony
announced a full line of the
hotly-anticipated xperia z5 models
topped out all the way up with the z5
premium which is sporting the world's
first 4k display Huawei announced the
huawei mate s switch from the back looks
an awful lot like an HTC One m9 but the
exciting part is on the front the mate s
is rocking Huawei's own version of force
touch which means that it can tell how
hard you're pressing down on the devices
display so you can weigh as many fruits
in your kitchen as you want to that's
not all though IFA also spawned a ton of
new wearables the Samsung gear s2 is the
new Tizen powered SmartWatch well it
does look gorgeous and I'm really kind
of curious about that crown around the
display a kind of skeptical that will
still be talking about this thing in a
month Motorola also introduced new
models of the Moto 360 my much beloved
device the new flagship now comes in
three different models a large and small
size for men's and one small women size
there are also upgrades under the hood
but the most notable changes come in the
form of moto maker compatibility making
for a truly you device there's also the
new sport model for those of you looking
to be a little bit more active with a
little rubber strap they're not to be
left out a sous announced the Zen watch
too it's got quite a bit of bezel so I
can't quite imagine that it's going to
do terribly well but I told you that I
would keep you posted on what happened
throughout the weekend that happens so
there you have it of course you can
check out all the sweet IFA news on
TechnoBuffalo calm otherwise that's it
