from TechnoBuffalo and over the last
couple of weeks oneplus feels like they
shook up the world with a brand new 1+3
it is as they have done before a budget
phone with flagship specs designed to
shake up the smartphone world then break
up the hierarchy a little bit one of the
most important things we look at when
reviewing a smartphone is the camera so
before bringing you guys the full review
of the oneplus 3 we wanted to do a
little camera comparison not a direct
comparison but more so to see if the 1 +
3 which is a lower budget phone if it
can hang with the big boys such as the
Samsung Galaxy s7 and the iPhone 6s so
while I'm not at all a fan of specs
let's address what the one poster is
packing on the back you have a 16
megapixel camera whereas on the samsung
galaxy s7 and the iPhone 6s you're
looking at 12 megapixel shooters f 2.0
on the 1 + 3 f 2.2 on the iPhone and an
F 1.7 on the Samsung Galaxy a7 but specs
out of the way let's talk about picture
quality in the actual experience of
shooting now this is reliant on how I
like to take photos and one of my
favorite things to do is to shoot into
lights I love backlit photos I love
shooting directly in the lamps I love
flares so bear that in mind and in this
situation will blew me away was actually
the 1 + 3 looked better than the Samsung
Galaxy s7 and in a lot of cases look
better than the iPhone 6s if I had to
break up the 3 and describe each of them
this is the general explanation I would
give the iPhone 6s is not as sharp as
the Samsung is or the 1 plus 3 is but
the light rendition the skin tone
rendition is much better the highlight
roll-off is smoother the shadow roll off
is smoother and they even just come out
a little bit flatter looking the Samsung
Galaxy s7 which has been noted for a
while now has a lot of pop coming out of
its images it's the way Samsung likes to
process their images become a very
vibrant very saturated and very sharp
however the sharpness which normally
seems fine to me compared to the 1 + 3
almost looked artificial this is
obviously explainable by the higher
megapixel count on the oneplus three but
well one plus has done is find a happy
medium but
between both the 6s and the s7 it takes
the best parts of the 6s which is skin
tone and highlight roll off and then
take the best aspects of the s7 which
are true sharpness and just that
intangible pop and fuses it into an
amazing camera experience if you want a
visual example of what I love about the
1 plus 3 camera so much take a look at
this photo
this ceiling lamp has a bulb that bleeds
into pure white if you look on the
Samsung image and the iPhone image
there's a distinctive point where the
image goes from lighter lighter and then
snaps into white where you lose all the
detail if you look on the oneplus 3 that
roll-off is so smooth and so buttery
it's a lot easier on the eyes and
there's no distinctive moment where you
lose all the detail one of the most
common things people love talking about
in regards to cameras and I think it's a
little bit overrated
is depth of field and acquiring that
shallow depth of field now we are
talking about bones please bear that in
mind so the differences are really
marginal depth of field is relying on
two things number one being sensor size
the aesthetic of the depth of field and
the aesthetic of the blur and then you
have your aperture size so you have your
f-stop of 1.7 in the s7 you have 2.2 on
the other end with the iPhone and you
have the 1 plus 3 which falls in the
middle it really is a negligible
difference because the iPhone which has
an F 2.2 the slowest aperture has the
biggest sensor a 1/3 inch sensor in a
samsung galaxy s7 which has an F 1.7
lens has the smallest sensor which is a
1 by 2 point 6 inch sensor and the one
post we followed right in between the
two of these with an F 2.0 lens and a 1
by 2 point 8 inch sensor so
realistically you can get a shallow
depth of field with all three of these
phones to the same extent it just goes
to further show that the oneplus blue
really belongs in this category and so
that's pretty much it for this video
guys obviously we did not cover
everything we left out things like
low-light and shutter speed responses
video and front-facing camera all of
which we can cover in a part two if you
would like that video give us a thumbs
up to show your support and we will try
our best to bring it to you very soon
our review of the one plus three is
coming as well early next week so please
stay tuned for that thank you again so
