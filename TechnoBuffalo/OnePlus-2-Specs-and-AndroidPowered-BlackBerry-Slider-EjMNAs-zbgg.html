to you by domain.com what's up everyone
walk by the episode of ask the Buffalo
this is a show where I just answer your
questions from low technology and
oftentimes outside this week mostly
technology-based let's jump right into
the questions the first one comes from
the very healthily named super veggie 12
who asked at John for lakers what made
you want to start her career in the tech
world and how did you get started so
that's a very long answer but I will
give you the short answer I have always
loved technology as I was growing up and
I used to always go walk around best buy
or circuit city or any tech place I
could find when I had a really bad or
stressful day just relax and sort of be
surrounded by gadgets I've always always
loved technology back in there 2007 I
was looking to get a new computer and I
was switching from an older HP and I
wanted to use Mac or the shroud for the
first time and I know I had a new user
new OS so I started looking around for
videos that would teach me how to use
that no one was doing it so I figured
I'll do it and sort of making the videos
Lafourche me learn how to use made a
computer and that was sort of the Nexus
that started walking what would become
take the Buffalo the next one this is
going to take a while so sit back and
relax comes from a trick 1774 452 362 @
jump for lakers how do you feel about
hitting 1 million subs we did hit 1
million subscribers last week I've got a
whole new video coming up about my
feelings about that but it is it is
humbling and incredible and I cannot
believe that happened that we're able to
sort of join some really elite company
and some really talented colleagues in
the tech world that have hit that number
and many more to come guys like mkbhd
linus tech tips austin evans and many
more it's it's a club that I'm honored
to be a part of and I can't wait to
welcome more tech youtubers to that club
so another video coming about that but
it was a very humbling experience for me
and for everybody here TechnoBuffalo
next one comes from at the JT underscore
to Ron who asks at John for lakers how
many Blackberry Android sliders you be
picking up the answer that was very
simple all
of them i'll be picking up all the
android blackberry sliders i'll be just
like just just collecting them all like
the pokemon if those rumors are true if
we are going to see a top-tier spect
android running phone made by blackberry
blackberry security on top of it i'll be
very happy fellow give me down screen
keyboard option give me that slide
adoption on a physical keyboard give me
Google services and blackberry security
on top of it I'll be happy i will use
that phone i will crest that phone i'll
i'll tell stories at night and tuck it
in now just I'll just be happy we stop

domain.com next question comes from at
george pap3ro one who asks at john for
lakers what your thoughts in the oneplus
2 specs is going to be worth the
increased price hashtag ask the buffalo
what we know it's certainly going to be
under that five four dollar threshold we
know it's going to have just an insane
four gigs of ram you'll be running a
tweaked version the snapdragon 810
before everybody gets all hot and
bothered literally about the a-10 it's a
tweaked version of it but it's gotten a
dead as when your phone is going to
explode in your pocket I've used a 10
devices but the tablets and phones
they're fine it's in a way overblown I
think it's going to be worth it i'm
curious about the screen I think that's
going to be a terminus back nope how
people don't necessarily want or even
need to key screen but it is a spec that
all flagships have nowadays so it will
definitely be a notable omission as the
turf goes into as a life cycle but on
the other side you're going to get
better battery life you know it's can
have a bigger battery than the previous
one plus so yes I need to be worth it I
think when you compare apples to apples
so to speak price point 1 plus 2 versus
a competition I think the 1 plus 2 is
going to end up very favorite and I
think you guys watch it for soda best a
buffalo i love i love film in these
videos i keep the questions coming thank
you guys for watching thank you for your
support thank you for being awesome and
always keeping me and everybody here on
our collective toes till next time John
