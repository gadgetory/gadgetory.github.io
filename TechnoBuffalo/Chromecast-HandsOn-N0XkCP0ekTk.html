we've already done the unboxing it's now
it's time for a hands-on of the google
chromecast let's check it out okay so
here we are I have already plugged in
the chromecast it's really easy to use
it's just a dongle that you plug into an
HDMI port on the back your TV and it's
also powered by two different options so
you can either use the USB cable to plug
into your TV for to power itself or you
can use the wall wart which Google
actually recommends in the box but we
have it plugged in directly to our
television so if you're curious as to
whether there's any kind of difference
in power quality or anything like that
there isn't super easy as long as your
TV can power the chromecast you don't
have to worry about plugging it into a
wall board setup was really easy all we
had to do was go over to google.com /
chromecast / set up and I'll walk you
through everything it'll have you
connect the chromecast to your local
network so you pick your SSID you put in
your password and boom your chromecast
is connected and ready to stream on the
Nexus 10 we have installed the
chromecast app which you can get for
free in the Google Play Store there
isn't anything quite available yet for
iOS users so if you're on an iPad or an
iPhone you're a little bit out of luck
but you probably already have an Apple
TV anyway if you're using both of those
devices so let's stick with Android and
I will show you what chromecast is all
about so today we're going to use three
different apps we're going to use
netflix youtube and play movies and TV
from the google play store to check out
different ways of watching and streaming
all of our content to our television so
first up we'll start with Netflix so on
Netflix I'm already signed in and I love
Archer big fan of the show and so I'm
going to pull up an episode of archer
now the update to chromecast has added
these chromecast buttons to our device
so if I click on this season of archer
it'll say loading on chromecast once we
press the chromecast icon which is a
rectangle we sort of and sort of a Wi-Fi
signal emanating from one of the bottom
left corner so you can see we're loading
our netflix just so you guys know
sometimes when you first start streaming
something the quality is not
great I can look maybe like SD video but
then after it ends up buffering it's ok
so don't freak out if the first thing
you see on the screen is a terrible
picture quality because it will get
better I promise especially if you have
really good internet like we do here so
here's Archer it's playing there's good
old Barry and Lana but I'm going to
actually move over to something else so
I'm watching archer and this is actually
a really cool feature that surprised me
when I was using chromecast you can in
fact watch something else or do other
things on your tablet like watch a
YouTube video while this is streaming to
your television so we're still streaming
netflix but and here's the best part i
can pull up the TechnoBuffalo youtube
channel i can pull up our YouTube
channel and I can watch something like
our butterfly s unboxing so here is the
butterflies unboxing that is about to
start playing on our tablet which we can
watch while something is streaming in
another app so this is a really cool
feature that I don't know that they
necessarily really touted in the keynote
but it's something that I'm really
excited about because what if I want to
watch something on my tablet while we're
watching television in the family room
so it's really cool sort of little
feature that's interesting you can see
in the YouTube app there's also that
chromecast button of the icon the
rectangle with the Wi-Fi signal on it if
I tap on it I can now choose between
playing this video on my tablet or
chromecast when i pick chromecast of
course it's going to override this very
lovely episode of archer and it is going
to start playing our butterfly s
unboxing so this is real time how long
it takes to load a video from chromecast
from a tablet to your television so you
can see it's not terribly long but it
does take a second to load so there's
our video like I said it might not look
the greatest right up front but then
once it buffers it's much much better so
one of the last questions that a lot of
people had asked about the chromecast
when we unboxed it was well I have
problems streaming things from say their
HTC device or with with proprietary
software so one of the questions they
had was can i stream bought or rented
movies and television shows
from the google play movies and
television app to my television with
chromecast because if i can't then
really what's the point and i agree with
that i think that's true so when we go
into our very very lovely google play
movies and television app it immediately
knows that we have I we have chromecast
and it's like hey do you want to try it
you can cast right to your TV so that's
very cool and if you don't see this cast
your TV option that's okay because
there's also the chromecast icon in the
upper left or I'm sorry the upper right
corner of our screen so we're going to
pick chromecast and we're going to
stream this lovely despicable me
presents minion madness to our
television there's our google play
movies and television app icon letting
us know that that is what is going to be
playing so they're going to prepare the
playback and on your screen you're going
to get this sort of placeholder standby
screen where it's going to tell you
what's playing and also where it's
playing so here's what is playing and
then there's playing on chromecast so
there you go there's our minion madness
playing on our screen one of the other
nice things is there's also a very
lovely Notification Center but it's a
little bit more detailed which is very
very nice for anybody who is like hey
what are we watching or like I said if
you're watching something on YouTube
while something streaming and you want
to know what's streaming at that time
you can always pull down your
notification bar and I'll tell you
what's happening very easy to disconnect
from chromecast you just tap on the
disconnect X in the notification bar and
that's it we're done we can and it says
it's still ready to cast so if we want
to cast anything else you can do that
like I said I'm not quite ready for iOS
yet which is a little bit of a bummer
for anybody who is using the Google
ecosystem but has iOS products I know
that I still use a lot of Google stuff
even though I have some apple things
like an iPad so sorry guys it's not
quite ready for you yet but if you're in
the Android ecosystem this is a great
value at 35 bucks you might not get
those three months of netflix for free
which kind of sucks but other than that
I think it's a really really great
product we're not sure we haven't gotten
4.3 yet on the Nexus 10 that we have
here in the office so I'm not positive
if we can stream photos from our photo
galleries to chromecast
we tried it earlier with four point two
point two but it didn't so did not have
a chromecast icon or an option in the
share feature so that's something that
you might want to consider if you are
dying to show off your summer vacation
photos they don't quite have that
feature yet but if they do in 4.3 we
will let you know but that's a tour of
chromecast that's our hands on and
hopefully you guys enjoyed it if you
