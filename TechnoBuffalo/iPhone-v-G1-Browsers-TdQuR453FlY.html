lake is calm here with a browser speed
comparison for you of the iphone 3g and
the t-mobile g1 both are running 3g
networks the iphone here just has two
bars of 3g and the g one actually has
four bars of 3g but it should still be a
relatively fair comparison so i'm going
to go ahead and load up john for lakers
calm beer will check network speed and
rendering so without any further ado
let's go ahead and get the started I'll
start on both at the same time there's
John for lakers I'll release my finger
alright and we are off click the g1's
got it well iphone caught up g one's
loaded the header and the iphone has
loaded the context of the page looks to
be neck-and-neck actually still going
alright the g1 is done and now the
iphone is done so just a little bit
behind not far i did hit the g one just
a second before the iphone so there was
relatively close so let's check default
rendering here the iphones are very
familiar browser you're probably all
seen it renders it immediately in a
webview format so you can see all the
text right here and it looks just as it
would on a computer and your zoom is
done by a double tap to zoom in double
tap to zoom out and you also have the
pinch zoom and pinch zoom out and you
can pan around with your finger so here
on the g one it actually loaded the page
in a relatively zoomed format but it did
show it with just the text right here so
it actually zoomed in on just the text
and left the images and such to the side
and scrolling is done the same way on
the iphone nice and smooth no delay and
it's flick growing so it keeps going
after you lift up your finger and the
zoom is done with this plus and minus
arrows here so you can zoom in zoom out
you tap the screen the aerials will show
up and I can zoom out with those arrows
the zooming is not as fluid as the
iphone but it is definitely usable and
actually is very nice now the g one has
something cool that the iphone doesn't
have in the bottom right-hand corner
here you have these little arrows and if
you click those arrows you get a little
window sorry I'm looking at an angle
your I didn't quite click it there we go
you get a little window right here and
you can move that took a little
magnifying glass to move it anywhere you
want let's move it over those bars when
you let go it zooms in right on that
area it actually is very cool and it's
not so much for giving actually found
myself using it so very impressive nice
little feature that google has added
there also one cool feature that is on
the g1 let me go ahead and show you guys
actually has windows similar to what's
on chrome so you can have different
windows open at the same time and you
can go back and forth the iphone has a
tabbed interface or actually a multiple
window interface as well you can scroll
back and forth through new windows hit
new page hit the window button oops hit
the window button and you can go back
and forth kind of viewing one page at a
time here you get a layout where you can
view four at a time just different ways
do the same thing six half dozen have
another I'm actually very impressed with
the browser on the g one it actually is
the most full-featured user-friendly
browser I've seen on any non iphone or
not Apple made device certainly kudos to
google for putting out such a stellar
browsing center two concentric device I
use the browser a lot and I'm able to
use the g one just as I would my iphone
which is my primary daily driver
certainly give them a big credit anyway
guys it's a real short video comparing
browser speeds I hope you enjoyed and I
will see you guys in the next video bye
bye if you want some exclusive content
