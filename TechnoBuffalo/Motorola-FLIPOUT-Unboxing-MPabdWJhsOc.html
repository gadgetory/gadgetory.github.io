TechnoBuffalo here Motorola's been
kicking out some great Android devices
some with very unique designs we saw the
first one in this new design era with
the Motorola backflip well I've got
right here thanks to the folks at clove
code UK the new Motorola flip-out which
were to continues that different design
trend real excited take a look at this
guy let's go ahead and get started
alright so you're not looking at a bag
while I'm talking here I'll go ahead and
do the unboxing and I'll read through
the specs in just a moment again this
was sent by the folks at cloak coat UK
sell a ton of unlocked phones for both
European and US fans this guy will work
on u.s. 3G bands on AT&amp;amp;T it's going to
set you back about three hundred and
seventy dollars u.s. let's go ahead and
rip in we will use the big ol knife the
finger cutter to slice this guy up DHL
just drop this off alright so we've got
another bag within the bag its to
protect a little bit better go ahead and
your rip of this open it let's go ahead
and take a look at the Motorola flip-out
it's like there's shipping information
there we go
here it is something to flip over
alright let's go ahead and read some of
the specs on this guy so it is running
Android 2.1 with motoblur uh comes with
a micro SD card which is kind of nice to
say a small one in there two gig card
expandable up to 32 gigs it's a full
capacitive touchscreen it's two point
eight inches with the resolution of 320
by 240 us 3G bands like I mentioned
Android 2.1 and the rest of stuff you'd
expect from a Android phone you can get
GPS Wi-Fi and the rest let's go ahead
and see what else we got in the box this
is the unlocked version looks like you
can change the colors of the device
which is kind of neat and some sort of
IMEI information let's go ahead and pull
this out here is the back flip
I can go ahead and backflip it out of
here
go ahead and kick that over that's why
it's in I got to push it so here is the
back flip sort of a very unique looking
phone take a look at that in just a
moment
push it off the side and see what else
you're going to get in your back flip
box you are going to get a battery of
size we take gates guesses or wagers to
how big this battery is it is of size
3.7 volts I'm gonna probably put it at
so you can get a milliamp hour reading
on this thing I'll look it up and let
you guys know what the battery is going
to be for my camera wise it does have a
3.2 megapixel camera got pair of stereo
headphones you've got a black back cover
this one is the white back cover here
you can see the difference there you got
the racial harmony of phones and we have
a micro USB charging cable and there is
the exact theist of the European plug to
plug that charging cable into and then
you've got some documentation let's go
ahead and take a look at the flip out
and the battery is up size 1170 milliamp
hours so see how this keyboard slides
out like that it's kind of interesting
actually so it just put it to the side
spring-loaded and comes right out you've
got the typical motoblur button to menu
button home button and the back button
there is the camera that we discussed on
the back and it looks like there's a
self-portrait mirror no LED flash say
three points one megapixel camera so
let's take a look at this keyboard see
how it feels on first blush it feels
almost blackberry ish the keys have sort
of a very similar Ridge there's a
division down the middle take you've got
actually a physical four-way on
navigation only that clicks in the
middle a small spacebar pick enter and a
back key the keyboard looks a little bit
strange but doesn't feel bad to type on
it all I think you actually could get
used to it you've got a full row of
number keys and with most typical slider
phones the top row the keys are sort of
hard to push this one does not appeal
are very hard to push probably because
of that unique design go ahead and slide
that guy right out flip Spray a
comparison purposes to sort of see what
this screen is going to look like next
to a different phone let's go ahead and
bring in the iPhone for most people are
familiar with the size this does have
again a 2.8 inch capacitive touchscreen
and see that sort of fits right nicely
on the iPhone so the thickness
comparison here to see the difference
between the two you can see the flip-out
is not very thick for having a full
QWERTY keyboard go ahead and pull back
out and we'll zoom a little bit more in
on the device let's go ahead and see
what else we have on the phone here so
again it slides out just like so and
you've got your se speaker and
microphone there and a little space to
let you know where you got a push
there's your charging port on the bottom
on the left hand side you've got a lock
button 3.5 millimeter headset jack
volume up and down and that is about
it's a very minimalistic phoning looks
kind of cool actually I'm gonna go ahead
and pop the battery in and boot this guy
on let's take a real quick first look
and I'll be doing a ton more coverage on
this device as well showing you some
nuances of the OS and how it works with
this very unique form factor sort of one
bit of clarification as well this is
running a TI OMAP processor clocked in
at 600 megahertz and everybody's
concerned with speed nowadays so this is
a 600 megahertz processor and again
running Android 2.1 on top of motoblur
alright so the back of the phone pops
off pretty easily there's a little notch
at the bottom to stick your fingernail
in right there go ahead and pull it
right off very easy to switch to put in
the black cover or whatever other color
you'd like to get your backflip with go
ahead and just slide it all the way off
there we go and I should mention that
the microSD card is accessible without
removing the battery which is quite nice
SIM card goes right there let's go ahead
and actually pop a SIM card in and we
will give this guy a shot so here is a
AT&amp;amp;T SIM card go ahead and push it right
into the device there we go sim card
fits in there nice and snugly we'll take
the just under 12
under milliamp-hour battery pop it in
throw the back back on and power this
guy on see what it looks like and again
this is an Android 2.1 device with
motoblur there we go and it is powering
on letting us know that it's built by
Motorola and I'll sort of take a look at
the device again while that's turning on
a keyboard is very unique surprisingly
spacious for a device too small it looks
like it would not be that hard to type
on very unique design definitely get
some looks in the straight when you're
using this phone because no one's really
seen anything like this yet and if
you're interested in learning more about
the device I'll put a link down below to
the club coat UK website and you can go
ahead and take a look and they'll ship
anywhere that you are doesn't matter if
in the US and Europe or wherever you
might be welcome to motoblur English is
what we want and go ahead and start it's
going to check for data connectivity
which that SIM card should have and this
is just sort of a very quick look at
what the operating systems going to look
like on this and one more time we're
doing a full serve over view of
everything when I do the review all
right so setup blur will go ahead and
just kind of ignore this we can like
it's not going to let us do that so I'll
go ahead instead of Wi-Fi and I'll come
back here once this is all working all
right you got the device sort of set up
here and working in here is motoblur go
ahead and open up all the icons this
does have an accelerometer as well go
and scroll through things in a typical
eclair looking way which is Android 2.1
go ahead and hit home you've got your
dialer contacts and the rest see what
the dialer actually looks like on here
go ahead and open that up and a little
bit on the small side but probably not
too bad I'm sure you could use the
number pad dial here as well it does not
look like the dialer uses the
accelerometer go and slide this out and
see how things turn looks exactly the
same this has been a very quick unboxing
and first look at the new Motorola
flip-out pretty excited to put this guy
through its paces stay tuned to the
channel and TechnoBuffalo comm of course
for all the information
I am John Rhett injure and I'll see you
in the next video bye bye
