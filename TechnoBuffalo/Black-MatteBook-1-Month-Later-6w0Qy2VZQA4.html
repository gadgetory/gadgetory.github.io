this guy in custom matte black matte
book I bought it from the folks of color
wear because I wanted something looks a
bit different we had a lot of questions
and that initial hands-on how it was
going to hold up so I said I'd revisit
it in a month and sort of see how things
are looking so color does essentially
take the entire thing apart and paint it
so I had some concerns about the putting
it back together the first concern I had
was how the hinge was going to hold up
seems to hold up pretty well my wife has
the exact same active Pro non-custom the
hinge feels the same when they did the
paint and it's all matte black all
around they also did a matte black on
the trackpad I'm trying to notice some
where on the trackpad it looks similar
to what you get with a normal computer
but being the matte painting to look
especially glossy especially in the
middle areas where I tend to use my
finger the most there's been some light
chipping around the corners nothing
giant I'm expecting sort of more as I
continue use a computer I've traveled
with it a few times I think it gets a
little more bumped and bruised I'm
expecting some more chipping to happen
another area of concern is on the back
so obviously this whole back panel had
to come off I'm gonna go ahead and do a
little bit of depression up by the hinge
on the back there's a lot of you and
there's more give than you get on a non
custom MacBook this is what a creek that
goes with it as well
a little bit worried that over the next
year or even longer how that that's
going to give me some trouble I don't
think anything here would hold me back
from sort of buying this again but
certainly not wearing on par with a non
custom computer but I still do really
like the way it looks full matte black I
want something custom that was sort of
unique but not too flush and it
definitely seems to fit the bill the
last area of concern that I've got
served talking to that Creek issue is on
the front when it's closed up get a
little bit of press by the Apple logo
there's a bit of creaking noise as well
the depression is normal but the creaky
noise is not normal you
with a normal aluminum MacBook so we'll
see what happens as it continues to wear
if you guys are interested I'll do
updates every few months let you know
how this thing is holding up if it
totally falls apart after a year if it
sort of holds together
let me guys know what you think if you
guys want to see us cover anything else
wants to test anything else everything
else seems to be working I've had no
keyboard issues the speaker sound the
same again to some paint chippings and
creaking and some through wearing on the
trackpad like I do it again I probably
wouldn't have had them through the
trackpad I would just kind of left it as
is I thought it completed the look but I
think as the months go by it's gonna
probably end up looking worse because
it's just a giant shiny area and in the
middle I think Weig I just want to give
you an update until next time
John rende you're protecting a buffalo
