MacBook Pros they drop-kicked their
display business to the curb and with it
went the Thunderbolt Display instead
they partnered up with LG to release two
monitors a 4k and a 5k the smaller of
which 21.5 version we have here today
and it packs a lot of punch for a 524
dollar price tag the biggest I just
punch is in pixel apartment it's got
4096 by 2304 and if you can do quick
math it's got nine point four million
pixels which says Apple will tell you on
their website that is four point five
times more pixels than an average 1080p
display so a lot of pixels in that
package the nice thing about the
monitors also works like a USB see
Thunderbolt 3 hub connects with a single
cable which including the box it's gonna
provide up to 60 watts of charging power
to your macbook it's gonna have three
other ports on the back of it of course
compatible with Thunderbolt 3 it's gonna
provide data transfer speeds of up to
480 megabits per second it's got stereo
speakers built in they fired downwards I
tested them they sounded pretty good
actually so a few surprises with this
monitor first I was used to looking at a
27-inch iMac I looked at the 21.5 inches
playing games probably on me it looked
really really tiny like small like a
like a toy monitor turned it on though
the pictures did look absolutely
incredible videos look great again the
idea that coming out sounded pretty
crisp and you can certainly see all the
pixels of doing a really nice job was it
was choking my poor my poor Mac by
pushing out all those pixels but it
worked really well as much as I like the
way this looks think it's probably going
to be swamped out for the larger 5k 27
inch variant but if you want a 21.5 inch
monitor that looks really good and now
isn't obscenely expensive like
thunderbolt displays used to be some
pretty good option so today I think
about the LG ultra fine 4k does it look
all too fine to you something's going to
pick up is going to make a $524 dent in
your wallet let me know give video a
thumbs up if you like a lot of pixels
subscribe if you want to see more
monitor coverage or subscribe cuz you're
a nice person until next time i'm jenna
