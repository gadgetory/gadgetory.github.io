World Congress in Barcelona and issues a
good idea for me I'm going to organize
my life with the desire s one of five
six new devices at least half a dozen
new devices from A to Z a new device 66
in fact the gentleman who knows is
telling me sick so I'm gonna turn it
over to him so we have their desire s
continuation an upgrade of the desire so
we put up front facing camera on there
we've still got the 3.7 touchscreen we
still got android but it's Android
Gingerbread now we've gone with a
one-piece aluminum case so that it makes
it much much stronger and also like to
but you don't have to have a plastic
chassis in there so you get a smaller
phone that's stronger i SPECT we've got
the new call come chipset in there so it
runs about 30 km faster but whilst
than the old design peas in the same
electricity
and so there's a front facing camera and
a rear facing camera what's the mega
pixel panel know and I equal most 8 and
there's a flash as well sure absolutely
I would go do you know each other my way
in there just a hobby
any information on availability retire
ukiah in RQ 22 to you can't know
anything about it'll be a global phone
or not in the States everything's funny
through the carriers have special
medline all kinds of special stuff all
right speaking of special though another
nice looking for from HTC the it's nice
to see kind of a range of different
designs across the new lines we were
looking at the blacked-out incredible s
before and now the desire with the
one-piece aluminum and you know just the
little touches the finish on this I'm
going to have to touch it the finish
looks really looks very cool the big
screen good stuff I you know I've long
been a fan of a sh you see me and now
the thought you guys put into the actual
object as well as the software that runs
on it so excited to see this and you
know hopefully it will come to our
special networks in the US as well as
globally from Barcelona Spain speaking
of global is for me I'm Noah from
technobuffalo alive at the HTC stay
or they also announced a tablet called
the flyer i might have to go check that
out next much much more from the show on
technobuffalo duck</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
