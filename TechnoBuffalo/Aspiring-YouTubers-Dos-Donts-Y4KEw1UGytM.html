technobuffalo here in my two and a half
years on YouTube own able to learn some
tips and tricks have contributed to what
little sliver of success I may have had
and from time to time I like to share
those pearls of wisdom bits of wisdom
with you guys because the more success
you have the more credibility the online
tech reviewing industry has and that's
really the better it is for everybody so
this is probably part five or six in my
advice for aspiring tech reviewers
series so I'm gonna make a playlist if
you want to go back and check out the
other videos and maybe learn something
new go ahead and do that as well so the
first thing that I want to say something
not to do don't go into more popular
youtubers and say check out my videos be
sure to check out my channel look what I
have in either their videos or on their
homepage what that's going to do it's
going to get you marked as spam and you
get a few comments marked as spam and
your accounts guys are going to get put
a little bit on hold from YouTube so you
definitely want to avoid that I think it
takes away from the credibility
certainly I'm guilty of it I did it too
when I was first starting on YouTube
what you're essentially trying to do is
advertise your channel on some of the
bigger youtubers and it just doesn't
work cornea plan unfortunately so
definitely avoid that trap I know it's a
natural inclination to try and do it but
again you get marked as spam a few times
in your account is going to suffer I
think your credibility ultimately suffer
as well so the next thing that I want to
talk about this is something really
important is properly tagging your
videos people search youtube people
search google and you want them to
search for your videos so what you gotta
do is really make sure that you are
putting proper tags into your videos if
you don't know what tags are when you
upload a video onto youtube there's
actually little words that trigger
search engines for your videos sort of
topics about what your video is going to
cover so I'm going to talk about let's
say the iphone 3gs my tags might be
apple iphone 3g 3gs AT&amp;amp;T and cell phones
careful not to
we're tag your videos because you're
gonna lose credibility tag them just
right make sure you keep it in scope
with what you're talking about and if
you properly tagged your videos you'll
see that your view increase will slowly
uh well increase because people are
going to be searching and they're going
to search for something directed that
maybe you have done and they're going to
come and look at your videos assuming
that you're putting out sort of high
quality videos and we guys just sort of
two quick tips that I wanted to share
with you I'm gonna keep the series going
because I really like to like to try and
help the aspiring youtubers attacker
viewers out there and those just
starting out I remember what it was like
just starting out and the frustration
that you can feel when you're not
getting any view is not getting any
subscribers it's not that the view
number two subscriber number important
to you which is that it kind of makes
you feel a little bit validated look
what you're doing like I'm putting out
all this hard work on making all these
videos and people aren't watching I know
that can be really discouraging now
sometimes you get some hater comments
and that can really not get down so you
know I know what it's like and I really
am just trying to help so guys I hope
you enjoyed look for more future videos
