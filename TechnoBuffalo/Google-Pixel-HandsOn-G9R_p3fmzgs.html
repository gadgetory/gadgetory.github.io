TechnoBuffalo here at the real quick
first look at the just announced pixel
this is the 5 inch screen packin little
brother of the 5.5 inch pixel XL all
done up and some of the addition very
blue okay you're gonna have black and
silver variants as well it's going to
turn this thing on and show you a little
bit about what's new here so of course
Android 7.0 nougat is here on board as
well also the first one to launch with
the new Google assistant built on board
here a few other things to note the UI
has been redone at least the launcher
has got the new pixel launcher here all
these steps that we think Google is
going to be calling it so no more app
drawer just kind of swipe up and get
access to all your apps they will see as
5-inch screen looks gorgeous much better
than any other Nexus phone I've seen
they think on par with Samsung's AMOLED
screens as well
quick charge is going to be here it
gonna give about seven hours of Ireland
in about 15 minutes
thank you charging via USB C with dual
speakers on the bottom the point five
millimeter headset jack on top bill to
buy this guy unlocked but it's gonna
launch these carrier wise with Verizon
on left-hand side that's where your SIM
cards are going to live on the right
hand side you've got a power and lock
button and volume rocker and of course
that is where your fingerprint sites are
gonna live on the back a lot of talk
about that guy the camera say twelve
point three megapixel sensor of f 2.0
aperture with no camera hump which is
really nice to see me for a change
think of the weeks didn't necessarily do
this guy justice they look absolutely
beautiful
in the hand way better than what we've
seen
in the past so takeaway here these
phones are thin light powerful
Snapdragon 820 140 gigs of ram and the
screens now look really good and suppose
these cameras are absolute baller so I'm
excited to get this guy in the labs and
to check it out but you guys think are
you you jazzed up about the pixels it's
the phone you guys have wanted to see I
love to hear your thoughts on it leave
in the comments down below give the
video a thumbs up for new pixel phones
the next time I am John Rangers and
TechnoBuffalo breaking</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
