talk business what's up everybody
John rendering techno Balu here at the
for review for you of the largest tablet
I have ever used this is the Samsung
Galaxy Note 12.2 I put it through its
paces let's go ahead see if it deserves
a pretty big spot in your bag as I do
with all my devices I want to give a
disclaimer Before we jump in I use this
as my only tablet for 10 days in Brendan
Russell who did the written portion used
it for five I'm gonna go start a top
level in the review if you want to get
more granular hit that link down below
to go to Brandon's full review a lot
more pictures in detail there as well so
with the Samsung Galaxy Note pro 12.2
Samsung answers a lot of questions and
I'm not really sure who is asking so
what happens when you just super-sized
Android so described by Samsung is the
device that quote changes the rules the
Galaxy Note pro 12.2 features every last
mobile idea that company has ever had in
the last few years but super amplified
multi-view is also been enhanced s-pen
is more prominent than ever you get to
benefit a full-size on-screen keyboard
not you mean full size there are other
features too like Samsung if you move
PCE meetings in a ton of Cisco Suites
largely designed for a business
environment the Focus 2 is not unlike
Microsoft Surface RT and surface 2 kind
of a tablet laptop hybrid meant to do
more than just watching YouTube videos
so the version we had the pleasure of
reviewing was octa-core it's really just
two quad-core chips one at 1.9 gigahertz
and one at 1 point 3 gigahertz
it's got any make a pixel camera on the
back although just don't be this guy
taking just gigantic pictures it's got 3
gigs of RAM which is really important
for multitasking we'll talk about that a
bit later a beastly 95 hundred million
power battery it's got the s-pen Wi-Fi
and third queues of internal storage it
comes out of the box with Android 4.4.2
KitKat and also microSD support a single
USB 3.0 port and other ports that you
see often including micro USB port 3.5
millimeter headset jack and a few others
a Samsung also offers an LTE acquits
model which you can just you can make it
like in say it's like the Galaxy Note 12
and just make phone calls but that model
is only gonna support a
dragan 800 ship so bear that in mind if
you need more cores not gonna get LTE
all right so let's just jump right to
design because it seems mostly about the
design it's a it's big but you know all
that at eleven point six inches long and
eight inches tall that's a behemoth let
that to sink in for a minute
eleven point six inches long this thing
is absolutely huge with the screen of
12.2 inches however Samsung's behemoths
nope rotators on the edge of necessity
and the tablet Bermuda Triangle with
someone that already owns an 11 inch or
13-inch laptop really need a 12 point 2
inch prosumer tablet usually when I
review devices I try and figure who it's
gonna be for and put myself in that
mindset I had a really hard time
figuring out who this tablet was gonna
be for so even if the note pro promises
to be more a convenient and portable
option this isn't like a Kindle Fire HDX
just focus solely on providing consumers
with the platform to consume this is an
everything in the kitchen sink to device
stuff inside a really really large
tablet body supposedly putting your
business needs first and consuming needs
somewhere else in the periphery so if
you want to think of this think of it as
an adult tablet if there really was such
a thing just an adult tablet you need a
giant bag to carry around a tablet this
size it expect me a multitasking
powerhouse I think Samsung actually did
a really really nice job with this with
a few caveats a brand if you did the
written portion disagrees hit the link
down below if you want to see his
counter-argument so for me multitasking
was super easy you just dragging from
the right pick one and designated apps
drag it right in and you are just good
to go with support for up to four apps
so it really is true multitasking they
run like any other apps they're running
on their own you do however have to pick
from a limited supply of Samsung's
sanctioned apps though it worked well
for me and situations like these is
really worth three gigabytes of RAM came
in handy I wish that all apps could you
have do that multitasking but know it's
only the Samsung ones that get that
blessing so since it is a note model the
s-pen is here and handy but doesn't add
anything they haven't already seen on
the note 3 it works you can draw with it
and it works like any other stylus you'd
expect as expected though watching
movies is awesome on its twelve point
two inch display it's got a 2560 by 1600
screen both in speakers provide a nice
audio and a real enjoyable experience
actually really loved watching movies on
this propping it up on my pillow and
just sitting there and watching
for games though I think the tablet's a
bit too big get to hold the device with
two hands I mean you can only go back as
far as your arm so you can't really go
back that far assuming you aren't using
a Bluetooth controller actually made me
feel a bit dizzy playing games on it but
your experience might differ so with
this tablet Samsung you really didn't
change much they just made it bigger
bigger settings menus bigger pulldown
drawers I would have liked to seen
unique features men take advantage of
such a giant screen but things are just
made bigger
the no pro 2 does it better than most
Samsung tablets but really not by much
frankly though the cost of the Galaxy
Note pro 12.2 compared to other Samsung
slates isn't warranted I think you might
be better served to buy just a Nexus 7 a
Chromebook or just a cheap Windows
laptop the competition is cheaper in
some cases better and the functionality
of the note pro is sometimes more
trouble than it's worth
think of like remote PC in the magazine
UX neat additions kind of there might be
a small group consumers out there who
crave a 12 point to which tablet I try
to imagine who they were but I think
that probably people might be more
interested in smaller form factors
wouldn't it be really where the tablet
market is trending you know
Samsung has got a tablet that offers
sizes for every single market this is
certainly had one extreme end of that
market the note pros batteries pretty
great the build quality is pretty
top-notch too but taking consideration
everything this really were 750 or 850
bucks pending on which model you get not
many consumers I don't think are gonna
be convinced no matter how many
competition bashing commercial Samsung
releases but really get full usage out
of the note Pro you need to purchase the
external keyboard the on-screen keyboard
can be sometimes awkward or you can
download other options set you back
another 69 bucks and comfortably prop
the note Pro up you'll need Samsung's
book cover which also gonna set you back
in another 69 bucks combined you looking
to spend a minimum of 888 bucks before
tax and there's also the s mouse which
is another $40 and that's not much
cheaper than the surface pro 2 so if
you're watching this video online

four gigabits per second peak broadband
traffic crazy stuff to check them out go
to talk talk business co uk have links
down below if you want to learn more the
end of this unit though does suit the
needs of the business users there are
way too many compromises and the note
Pro can be frustratingly slow and really
pushes limits that's really
disappointing given the devices specs in
price however though if you feel like
you can deal with the note pros quirks
and can stomach the unwarranted price by
all means you jump right in still be
able to watch movies read books and send
out email without any issue at all there
just so many other cheaper and better
options out there whether you're simply
buy a nexus 7 and a laptop or just going
to the surface to the no pro 12.2 swings
for the fences but can only manage a
double at best this gets a seven on the
TechnoBuffalo scale it offers a lot of
features it comes down to price
and without that giant screens can be
usable for you I like phones to be
bigger haven't always like giant tablets
I prefer a smaller screen size it was
really harder for again for me to
imagine who this tablet is going to
before but if you're one of the people
that I might before I'd love to hear
your thoughts and why and why would you
get it to both point two over a 10 or an
eight or a seven or any of the other
varying Android sizes out there even
though other offerings and Samsung's own
line up I'd love to hear your thoughts
please leave that in the comments right
