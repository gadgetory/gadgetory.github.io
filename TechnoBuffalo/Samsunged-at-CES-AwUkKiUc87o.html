technobuffalo and we're here at the
Samsung Boost check out two new products
they just announced the notebook night
and the tabpro s super excited to see
what they're about let's go and get
started so if you just click to have an
apple macbook you might cringe after
hearing this Samsung just announced our
new notebook nine if 13.3 inch display
super thin laptop it comes in at one
point eight five pounds which is a tad
under where the macbook comes in at
which is two pounds it also comes in
better suspect with an intel core i7
processor not the intel core m which I
was not a fan of four or eight gigs of
ram and in 128 is d we don't know our
pricing is so we can't really say it's a
macbook competitor yet we're sure seems
like it's so far my only gripe with is
getting to see it in person was that it
is super super light which I know you're
thinking is a positive thing but it's
like to the point where the build
quality doesn't even feel that great I'm
told it's made of all magnesium but
again it feels a little plastic eat
samsung also announced a 15 inch version
of the notebook 9 which is pretty much
exactly the same but with the USBC port
and which enables fast charging it
allows you to get a full charge of only
90 minutes now moving on to the tap pro
s it's basically a surface pro
competitor it's a tablet with a keyboard
with full Windows 10 right off the bat
the display looks amazing and I do like
what they've done with a build quality
here as opposed to what I just said
about the notebook night I think they've
nailed the weight in quality build
quality ratio here it weighs about 1.5
pounds without the keyboard with the
keyboard it weighs 2 pounds so it's a
little bit more than notebook night
personally I think that trade-off is
worth it speaking of the keyboard the
keyboard is all kind of slammed together
it's like the original surface pro
keyboard not really a huge fan of it but
everything else about this seems to be
good so far that's it for this video
guys let me don't you think of the
notebook now in the tab pro s I think
they're kind of cool I think they have
some great features but I don't already
like some things about them already
don't like some things about them let me
know what you think in the comments
