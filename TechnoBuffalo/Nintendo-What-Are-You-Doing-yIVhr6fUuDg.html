to you by Gamefly what is up everyone
welcome back to the episode of rent
injures rants past few weeks I've giving
some advice I've done a little bit of
ranting but this week I am back
Nintendo I've got you square in my
crosshairs what are you doing dude this
is right Andrews rants let's get ready
before I get all red-faced and pissed
off I know that I'm gonna get a lot of
hate from this video it's okay I could
accept it
I've got my big-boy pants on and I want
to hear from you if you disagree bit of
a backstory first I love me some
Nintendo I have owned every single
Nintendo console from the NES that
current generation including things that
even predated the NES like Nintendo game
watches and Mario portable consoles
I love Nintendo Nintendo consoles were
always what I chose to buy up until the
Gamecube Nintendo had the market share
completely cornered for gaming Nintendo
was synonymous with gaming if you wanted
to game your mind went right to Mario
then Sega came around and maybe you
thought hey sonic doesn't look half bad
I'm gonna give that a shot I don't know
me turbo graphics 16 looks pretty
awesome that bonk guy looks like he
could wreak some stuff I want to play
that and slowly but surely Nintendo kept
losing market share and they've done
kind of the same thing on every single
console it released a few games that
people liked namely a Mario game maybe a
Zelda game gonna braaap some racing
Mario Kart s game or if you like
fighting Super Smash Brothers and then
just sort of a load of other forgettable
titles
I think if Nintendo is sort of the
BlackBerry of the gaming world they once
owned the marketplace they're just done
the same thing year-over-year and
they're slowly hemorrhaging units before
you say John that's not true but come
many units the DS the 3ds are selling I
say to you then attend oh we you only
sold 160,000 units worldwide last
quarter you're even losing market share
in Japan and then just when you thought
Nintendo might get their act together
they'd go and release the 2d s the
hideous looking 2d s
it took probably one of the coolest
features of the 3ds namely the clamshell
design and I guess the 3d and they
neutered it but they did lower the price
130 bucks now listen I get the financial
reason for releasing a 2d s especially
the same day that the Pokemon games come
out I understand it we're gonna buy them
in droves then impulse purchase no issue
there at all but Nintendo is not getting
back in either mind share with any other
consoles at all so imagine that you are
looking to get one game console that
you're gonna own you know throughout the
next five to six years it can only
afford one console you're looking at
okay Xbox one got a ton of exclusives I
really like Kinect and do a lot of cool
things and it's got the blu-ray built-in
now ps4 awesome free features built in
incredible gaming exclusives beautiful
interface awesome quality games are
gonna be able to do a ton of really neat
things the ps4 grows and moves forward
you got the Wii you got the same graphic
capability as the last generation
consoles it's a little bit cheaper and I
do have that cool Wii U remote which one
are you going to get and I would guess 9
out of 10 you will not even consider
that Wii U as your one console for the
next few years the graphics finally
caught up to what came out almost nine
years ago the exclusive titles are just
not there and intend those big release
is a rerelease of a game that came out
on the Gamecube Nintendo's released
another Mario game which I love I love
new Super Mario World Wii U it's an
incredible game part of my favorites
that is not a reason to buy a console
yeah there might be new Zelda coming out
but those two games alone are just not
gonna be enough he's not an awesome game
like zombie U is really well received
but people have just didn't buy it no
more sequel coming out for it people are
looking at these things saying if I only
get a code games for two consoles I
could spend the time on the Wii U
because it just doesn't have the
audience there's two Nintendo is relying
really heavily on first party games are
just not turning out first party games
I'm sorry I've had an interest in Kid
Icarus for the probably the past 12
years it's not gonna get me to buy a
console the Nintendo
all is not lost I have an answer for you
so just use this as your market planner
for the next five years all right so the
Wii U defined console it's a decent
console it's got pretty good graphics
got nice online capabilities we've got
that awesome controller which feels
really good
hands get exclusive games don't rely
just on first party mario loan clearly
can't sell your console
fight fight fight fresh glue soviet the
very least fight to get the same games
every other consoles getting the same
version of mad and the same version of
Call of Duty not a last year's version
on Wii U it up try it please try and get
the games every other console has to at
least have Mario be a nice add-on and
not the only reason to buy a console
when it comes to the two DS
I mean people are gonna buy it kids are
gonna parents gonna buy you four kids
and look at and be like I'll play
Pokemon on it that I'll put in a drawer
and forget about it but just try and
regain some of that lost luster I miss
Nintendo I'm sad for Nintendo I hope
Nintendo can make a comeback let me take
