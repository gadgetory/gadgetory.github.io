from technobuffalo here let's start this
video Allison simple math what do you
get when you add 1 to +1 the answer is 2
and that's what we have right here this
is the latest from 1 plus the
appropriately-named too there's a ton of
flagship specs crammed into a really
nice-looking package as the case is the
previous generation a lots been improved
on here so let's go ahead and take a
first look at the oneplus 2 so ladies
and gentlemen meets the 1+2 this phone
has been leaked rumored for many months
now we've got a chance to take a first
look at it let me jump right into the
specs and walk around what the phone has
there is a lot here so this is rockin
the 64-bit Qualcomm Snapdragon 810 two
clocked at one point gigahertz and that
is octa-core but they worked with
Qualcomm to make the shirt this is going
to run very cool I be the first time
I've ever said this to looking at a
phone with four gigs of RAM which is a
lot of gigs 64 gigs internal storage
here no additional storage but you're
gonna have can tell by that up there a
dual sim first time we've really seen
dual sim make its way to us at least on
a phone that's going to be easily
accessible that's going to be dual
standby so if not familiar with dual
sims you essentially can pop into Sims
receive phone calls from two separate
numbers even from two separate carriers
take a look at the rump of this guy
you're going to see one of the five
available back it's going to ship with
sandstone black and this is removable
you can pop it off and put on another
color of your choice but the highlight
is that guy right there it's a
13-megapixel rear-facing camera that has
six physical lenses and supposedly has a
relatively powerful dual LED flash the
cameras Wells gonna give you 0 is so all
of your shaky hand video should look
pretty nice so a few emissions people
might miss no NFC no wireless charging
your found on the 1+2 in addition to no
expandable storage framing the phone e
we got a very cool to the touch aluminum
and magnesium frame let's take a look at
the phone itself there's a lot of things
here so this while looking like a
physical humbug epatha to button also
going to serve as your fingerprint
sensors flanking it on both sides you've
got your multitasking button and your
back button just annotated by two
illuminated lines on what looks like a
profiles which is actually going to mute
all notifications if you're in a meeting
whether it needs to be quiet for a
minute
go ahead and slide that up or down and
you go ahead and mute a notification
they're really nice and welcome feature
I'm happy to see that here on the one
plus two on the left hand side you've
got a volume rocker up and down and your
power button on the top 3.5 millimeter
headset jack noise cancelling mic but a
big story is down here of course you've
got your rear firing speakers but that
my friends a reversible USBC port and 1
plus claims are going to be selling us
bc cable on their site for cost just
around five bucks if you want to get a
cheap USBC cable it's going to be a
great way to do it but of course one's
going to be included in the box the OS
are running here is a grown-up version
of one pluses own oxygen OS based on
Android 511 so go and take a look at
that of course original one plus launch
with cyanogen davison split and one plus
develop their own take on Android which
looks to pretty much let Android be
Android with a few additions we did hold
video walkthrough the changes on oxygen
OS one of the big ones here is one plus
is calling shelf if you swipe that over
this is where it sort of the phone is
going to live and get smarter all right
here you can see your most recently used
apps you can customize a background
image for you can contact you're going
to show up here and 1 plus told us this
is going to get a lot of updates as
people use a phone and learn what
features they want to have here so first
look at shelf I get a lot of questions
see the camera you want to go ahead and
see that here and they also told us that
the camera is one thing they're going to
be working on to make sure it's always
getting better I said it's going to be
great at launch but they want to make
sure they're always looking to improve
the camera so there's with you I look
like with face and decay abilities see
some of the settings right there as well
I can jump right into HDR of course
beauty mode will get rid of all your
blemishes and do some very nice almost
soft focusing for you one thing that
I've noticed about my initial use is
that capacitive home button is very fast
I've had some issues of previous phone
said capacitive home buttons there's bit
of delay no delay here at all you tap at
you go right back to where you want to
go so very quick I have not had a chance
to check the fingerprint sensor I need
to see how fast it goes but supposedly
faster than a touch ID
so as far as pricing and availability
the 64 gig one plus two is going to be
available within invites in the US and
EU starting august 11 for 389 there will
be a 16 gigabyte version 1 plus 2 with
three gigs of ram again available later
for 329 if any guys has been a first
look at the oneplus you up to your
thoughts on it what do you think that it
lived up to the hype everything you
expect I really want to hear what you
guys have to say till next time I'm
trying render from technobuffalo hey
guys next video bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
