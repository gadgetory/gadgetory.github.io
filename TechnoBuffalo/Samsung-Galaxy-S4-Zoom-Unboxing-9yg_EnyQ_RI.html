TechnoBuffalo here with an unboxing of
the latest of the ever-growing galaxy s4
line this is a galaxy s4 zoom cuz it's
got a big zoom on it let's go ahead dig
in and see how it looks and check out
how it performs and I've got the return
of an old friend let's get started
here we've got the box for the samsung
galaxy s4 active with its familiar fake
woodgrain it joins the s4 mini the
regular s4 and the s4 active and the
really ever-growing galaxy s4 line of
phones let me thank our friends at Negri
electronics working us up with this guy
check them out at Negri electronics comm
for all of your unlocked accessory and
phone needs so we've got the return of
an old friend for this unboxing we've
got the original obligatory big-ass
knife the o box senior stabby has made
his way back to the office I thought I
lost him but I found him at home for
those you guys that don't know him this
was the original knife I use for all my
unboxings I first started it is
unnecessarily large it's unsafe and I'm
excited to use it again hopefully not
slice off my finger so let's put him
back to work he was in retirement for a
while and let's open this sucker up and
see what we've got did not slice my
finger so that's nice to have that
happen um galaxy s4 zoom this guy brings
a obviously a larger zoom of addition to
that it's a 16 megapixel camera versus
the 13 that's found on the regular
galaxy s4 it also steps down on the
processor obviously was the Samsung
devices processors vary by region this
one's a 1.5 gigahertz dual-core variety
it's got 8 gigs of internal storage but
of course that can be upped with micro
sd and a little slower on the processor
here as I mentioned on the screen though
it's just a 4.3 inch 960 by 540 display
as I'd say pretty paltry 256 PPI but it
looks like a smaller galaxy s4 kind of
Galaxy s4 mini this Wi-Fi a total of an
ABG and n 2300 milliamp hour battery
onboard so let's pull off all the
sticker
and here is the s4 zoom not so sure you
want to keep this in your pocket it
could be a nice point-and-shoot option
with a a 10 x optical zoom there so put
that down for just a quick moment to
Dahl's is going to be in the box we've
got a book for all your warranty
information usual Samsung stuff that we
see in the past charging cable extra
earbuds same microphone and we're
started saying earbuds rather with a
noise cancelling microphone that we've
seen in the past these were obviously
the extra earbuds we've got a microfiber
cleaning cloth that's new and nice to
have we've got the battery that I
mentioned is 23 30 milliamp hours really
deep inside of that box then we've got a
wall wart as well so let's take a look
at the camera and then I will power this
sucker on we've got a very large and
pronounced shutter button then you've
got the standard sort of phone options
right there you've got your volume which
is now on the right side rocker up and
down then you're a power button on the
other side you've got this would be a
place for the I'm assuming that comes
out and that's where you can mount it to
a tripod then your microSD card slot is
on the outside sort of nice to see it's
they got more room in the body they
could do that
we've got some lanyard spots microphone
3.5 millimeter headset jack still has
the IR port that the Samsung Galaxy s4
head is running Android 4.2 it launched
I don't know if it's 4.2.2 I suppose is
a very easy way to figure that out let's
boot it up and we'll see let me figure
out where the battery this guy goes
hopefully shouldn't be too hard and
guess somewhere around here is where
that battery is going to live so looks
like you slide that open that pops out
and the battery drops right in so we'll
take this guy and again this is 20 330
million of hours and we'll see how the
phone when it looks come back into the
second so we've got this guy all bit up
but it looks like stock Android with
TouchWiz let's see what kind of app
we're gonna have on board here looks
like pretty standard stuff all the s
apps as translator s planner S Memo and
all the storyboard kind of stuff I'll
let's jump into settings
see what we are working with to go to my
advice someone here it should say my own
more about device there we go software
information status there we go
4.2.2 so it is running the latest
version of Android so that's quite nice
but the big story here is obviously the
camera let's go ahead and jump into that
so the camera interface looks pretty
similar to what we've seen on other
devices so despite having that zoom name
there first thing you can feel there
isn't really a very clear zooming button
here I'll you click you got to do that
you can zoom with the dial on the front
device you can zoom right on in pretty
close 10 times if you can tap the focus
they're kind of trying to focus do the
best they can definitely hear it doing
its focus e thang but then that does
pretty stand standard Samsung camera
fair I can go into expert mode and
control all of your stuff they are used
to I'm not really sure what big
differences are between this and the
Galaxy camera line on devices but this
is definitely a thing and it is
available for purchase so I'm gonna
check it out see if it's worthwhile as a
phone or as a camera or as a camera
phone or but combine those two of Famara
type device but there's a lot of
interesting things that this brings to
the table I just for comparison sake
here is the standard Samsung Galaxy s4
see the difference here from the
thickness standpoint and here is its
little brother I shouldn't say little
cuz almost identical in size display
wise here is the s4 mini as you can see
that's probably more accurate display
take the s4 mini and add a pretty giant
camera on it you've got the galaxy s4
zoom but it's a really nice thing to
have I will say having used a Galaxy
camera at events and a family gathering
it's really nice to be able to send
pictures take them and shoot them right
off to people's email or take a picture
of somebody's to have them email to you
right now there definitely is a use for
this but still not short differentiating
factor between this and
the galaxy camera line again but
certainly I'll use it and let you guys
know and I guys look to your thoughts in
this leave your comments down below
please give the video a thumbs up with
my stuff we appreciate it I am John
Rhett enger' and I'll see you in next
video bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
