TechnoBuffalo here's an unboxing of the
latest windows phone from the marriage
of HTC and sprint it is the 8xt let's go
ahead and unbox this purple beauty so
here is the box for the 8xt proudly
saying it's got an 8 megapixel camera
and a 1.4 Gertz dual-core processor I'm
just saying maybe you don't want this
really advertise a dual cornice but it
is the 8xt done in a recyclable box
nothing else terribly exciting it will
go ahead and open it up and there it is
the HTC 8x seat is the latest phone from
Sprint that also supports their new LTE
network push it off to the side for just
a quick second I assume it's gonna feel
very familiar to the 8x we saw launch
earlier in the year for AT&amp;amp;T so get
started for getting started if there's a
lot of stuff there including a little
bit of a sim card we've got some HTC
stickers I kind of like seeing those in
their wall warts sync cable that is just
micro USB and then I always get a lot of
flack for not showing what these look
like so i will show you what these look
like these are the headphones and that
is what they look like they're she
appear to be pretty nice i got the red
sort of beats looking thing going with
them and different sized ear buds
pending on what size your ears are so
here is the phone itself say 4.3 inch
taller than 800 x 480 pixel resolution
yeah with a pixel density of 217 EPP I
will say that it looks pretty awesome
scotum the glass extends all the way
down to over this capacitive buttons so
mix of screen feel much bigger feels
really nice in the hand actually so it
is Windows Phone 8 at launch ago and
powered on but figure out where the
power button is again being powered by
1.4 gigahertz dual-core processor it is
the Snapdragon 400 like it was already
on those either keeping track at home
it's got a gig of ram and eight gigs of
storage in here though it does have
external storage ova up to 64 gigs via
microsd on the back there's an 8
megapixel camera with LED flash we've
got on the front a 1.69 pixel camera 802
11 ABG and n8
100 millionth power non-removable
battery is in here and weighs 140 grams
or if you're on the other side of the
pond or north of us or everywhere else
in the world it's 4.94 ounces it's like
a quick look around the phone we've got
our three sort of Windows mandated
capacitive buttons we got back it's also
your multitasking button we've got your
windows home button and your Bing search
button go home we've got on the left
hand side nothing really on the right
volume rocker up and down and dedicated
camera button on the top power in lock
button 3.5 millimeter headset jack HTC
did a really awesome job with their 8 X
series advices whether it's a texted a
txt my making it feel really thin with
the taper on the side they did a pretty
impressive job with the design on it
it's probably one of my favorite feeling
windows phones I've got used to these
big bulky Windows Phone just from what
nokia has done with their Lumia line but
this really ruins back a thin pretty
elegant looking display so despite the
low resolution it's a pretty nice option
if you're looking to pick up phone from
sprint for the next two years their LTE
footprint is definitely expanding so if
you are in one of the areas I'll get
some pretty fast LTE speeds anything
