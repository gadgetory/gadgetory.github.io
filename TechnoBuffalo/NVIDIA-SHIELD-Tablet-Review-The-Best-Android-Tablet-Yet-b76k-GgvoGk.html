from TechnoBuffalo and we're here to
share our full review on the Nvidia
shield tablet and we've been using it
for about two weeks now so let's see
what this device is all about Nvidia
stepped it up last year would introduce
Nvidia shield now called shield portable
it was basically a 5 inch Android device
with a controller permanently attached
to it even though it was plenty powerful
it was a niche device that was only
really good for gamers Nvidia soon
followed that up with the reference
tablet known as the Tegra note 7 which
also introduced consumers it's direct
stylus technology invidious new shield
tablet on the other hand is the best of
both worlds appealing both gaming
enthusiasts and casual tablet users
alike its invidious first must-have
tablet and the first tablet to be driven
by the crazy powerful Tegra k1 processor
the shield tablet also features an 8
inch 1920 by 1200 IPS display it comes
with 2 gigabytes of RAM on board and 16
gigabytes or 32 gigabytes of internal
storage the latter which isn't available
just yet at the time of this review
though both are expandable to 128
gigabytes via microSD slot it also
sports a pure Android 4.4 KitKat which
is a great addition to the tablet and
most importantly and impressively it's a
console impersonator complete with an
optional Wi-Fi direct controller and
HDMI port for connecting to your TV and
you can pretty much say that it's the
most powerful Android tablet you can buy
the shield tablet is a little on the
chunky side though but it's still a
slick little 8 inch tablet it reminds us
a bit of the Nexus 7 morph with an HTC
One due to its dual front-facing
speakers and we don't mind that one bit
at 13.1 ounces the shield tablet is
about three ounces heavier than the
Nexus 7 but still a lot lighter than the
original one pound 4.7 ounces part of
the weight increase with the shield
tablet over the Nexus 7 is due to the
extra inch that you're getting from the
screen but also because the shield
tablet is passively cooled and has an
extra thermal shield built inside to
dissipate heat it's a little on the
heavier side but not ridiculously heavy
though it works just fine one-handed
operation and it feels a little husky in
comparison to something like the 8.4
inch Galaxy Tab s which weighs a whole
lot less than the shield tablet as an
Android gaming device the shield tablet
is the best thing out there between the
k1 processor the standard tablet form
factor and a really good controller
support it beats any of the other
competitors out in the market right now
you get three main flavors to choose
from when it comes to gaming on the
Nvidia shield you can choose from
standard
Android games that you can download from
the Google Play Store k1 optimized game
which are available via the shield hub
and game stream ready games that run on
your gaming PC and stream straight to
your shield for now the catalog of
android games optimized for the k1
processor is limited but you do get
titles like half-life 2 portal along
we're trying to we tried out all three
games and a graphics and performance of
each was impressive on the shield tablet
which was a noticeable step up from the
nvidia x' original shield device we
actually did a video about gaming on the
shield tablet showing off game stream
grid and portal and actions so you can
check that out in the link down below
now talking about the tablet itself the
8 inch screen looks gorgeous it's not
the best screen out in the market but
nonetheless it's a good enough screen
for casual gaming watching videos and
doing everyday tasks like browsing the
web and checking emails and there's also
two cameras on a shield tablet and
they're not all that bad either both
front and the back cameras are 5
megapixels the rear facing camera can
record up to 1080p videos while the
front-facing camera can record in 720p
battery life from the shield tablet is
okay too the 5300 milliamp battery is
plenty big but not the best one
comparing to something like the iPad
Mini with Retina or even the Galaxy Tab
s during our testing spent a lot of time
streaming games from Nvidia beta grid
service casually watching Netflix movies
and we still got about an average of 8
to 10 hours of usage and about a few
days of standby time when we use the
tablet over for a 2-week period but
considering that this tablet is running
in videos new k1 processor that makes a
lot of sense
Nvidia did however include a power
control option within the Settings app
so you can change how the processor
performs to save on battery life or to
maximize your performance on the shield
tablet and there's also my power mode
which you can customize things like
Mac's CPU cores Mac CPU frequency and
limit the framerate when gaming so these
little software teks are definitely
handy to have and I'm glad that they're
included in here now besides the k1
processor that's inside the shield
tablet the speakers on the tablet are
amazing the dual front-facing stereo
speakers in the 2 side based reflect
support makes watching movies and
playing games on a shield much much more
enjoyable the sound is clear and crisp
and there's just the right amount of
bass in them now by no means will these
built-in speakers replace your Bluetooth
speakers but just having the speakers on
the front makes a huge difference when
using the tablet now the last thing
we'll talk about is a stylus or what
Nvidia is calling it direct stylus to
think of it as an S Pen but with a much
better build quality it's made out of
plastic yet it doesn't feel anything
like plastic has a nice aluminum fin
to it and also has a pretty nifty weight
to it as well now I'm not much of an
artist but the dabbler app is pretty
impressive not only does it use the
stylus as paintbrush but it also models
the layering of oil paints and dripping
of watercolors on a simulated canvas in
real time using the Tegra k1 processor
it's definitely not something like
Photoshop but for those who think
visually the direct stylus to and a
dabbler app is a great combination and
videos latest device is definitely a
great buy for those who are in a market
for a tablet whether your gamer or not
just three hundred dollars for the 16
gigabyte Wi-Fi only model it's the best
bang for your buck you get the beefy
specs dual front-facing speakers and
access and videos gaming service along
with the usual Google services that
normally come pre-installed on other
Android tablets the optional $60
controller is great too and the majority
of the games that are available in the
shield hub have full controller support
and if you want to play something like
portal or half-life 2 however the
controller is necessary there's also the
$40 shield covered that acts as a stand
for your shield tablet I think it's a
great cover but the price tag is a bit
too high for our taste the shield tablet
is not just for gaming but also for
those who'd like to casually browse the
web writing emails or watching Netflix
it really just depends on whether you
need the extra power that the k1
processor offers so to wrap things up
for you guys I'm given Nvidia shield
tablet a TechnoBuffalo score of 9 out of
10 it's a great tablet with amazing
specs and features and it's a pretty
affordable tablet too anyways that's it
