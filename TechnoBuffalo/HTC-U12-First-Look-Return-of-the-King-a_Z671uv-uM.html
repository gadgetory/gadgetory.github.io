HTC really hasn't been killing it in the
smartphone game that's unfortunate
because back in the day they were the
goat two awesome android phones that I
would recommend to pretty much everyone
but maybe that'll change we're here in
San Francisco
HTC invited us out because they're
working on something new so let's go
check it out and hopefully that opinion
can change so here we have it it's the
HTC u12 plus this is the next iteration
and the you line and from the few
minutes we got to spend with it it seems
like a solid upgrade from last year it's
not any smaller in size but it's just
overall less chunky and less clunky it
looks much more like a phone from 2018
so for the build it's glass on the front
and back with aluminum around these
sides comes in three colors the ceramic
black super shiny a translucent blue and
the flame red will be coming later on he
turns loose and blue is one of the more
unique colors on the market because like
the name says it's translucent and you
can actually see the components inside
the phone it looks really cool now
around front is the 18 by 9 6 inch quad
HD plus Super LCD display it's not OLED
but it looked good from the time we
spent with it it has support for HDR 10
the colors did pop most importantly to
me though the bezels are not huge and
there isn't a knotch kind of the best of
both worlds here those small bezels
allow for a bigger screen without making
the actual phone bigger the screen
should be great for consuming content
and now there's dual boomsound speakers
one on the front and one on the bottom
nice to see that here around the edges
is the upgraded edge since - and now
lets you do even more so when using the
phone you can set certain gestures that
will do different customizable actions
based on taps and squeezes my favorite
that they showed off was being able to
shrink down the screen to one side
making everything much easier to reach
it's great that it's customizable and
you have more options now another
interesting note on the side is the
volume and power buttons they aren't
actually buttons when you press them
instead you get a haptic feedback HTC
says this is because the phone is ip68
water-resistant it's a little weird to
get used to but I definitely have to use
it more to see how I feel now cameras
are obviously important and the u12 plus
has
a lot of them run back you have a dual
camera system one camera is a 12
megapixel ultrapixel 4 camera with
optical image stabilization and the
other is a 16 megapixel telephoto camera
the big feature here is their bokeh mode
which blares the background like a
typical portrait mode nothing really new
here but around front there are now 2 8
megapixel front facing cameras and these
allow for portrait mode with the front
facing cameras in this short time we had
with this phone we didn't get to test
the cameras at all but you know
definitely interested to see how these
perform spec wise the u 12 has pretty
much everything you'd expect snapdragon
845 6 gigabytes of RAM 64 or 128
gigabytes of storage expandable storage
Android 8.0 3500 milliamp-hour battery
tons of specs the only thing it doesn't
seem to have is wireless charging but it
does support fast charging with Kuk
charge 4 so there's that as for
availability he could pre-order starting
today for $7.99 us for 64 gigabytes or
849 for 128 so that is the HTC u12 plus
from initial impressions it seems like a
solid foam that is feature heavy and I
think it's an intriguing design there's
obviously a lot more to unpack with this
phone so be sure to subscribe and hit
that notification bell to see when our
full review is out and be sure to let us
know your thoughts on the phone down
below thanks so much for watching and
mackins also TechnoBuffalo and i'll see
you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
