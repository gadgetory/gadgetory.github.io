type of Buffalo show often live your to
house for today Sean ani editor-in-chief
of the site and i'm joined by managing
deputy met Maggie epiny deputy man she
had her taut Hazleton everybody I'm not
sure the deputy's if you're you're
managing the other deputies I died the
Wild West exactly exactly get yourself
some sarsaparilla and how are you doing
this week god I'm good it's good yes it
it's always a good weekend TechnoBuffalo
yep I mean the folks in irvine aren't
rubbing in my face at all to all the
cool things are going to do this week
that i would love to go do hahaha like
the Avengers premiere the avengers the
avengers premier john went to on monday
night and then Roy on Tuesday went to
Disneyland for a press event 16
university right yeah for the 60th
anniversary there will be a post about
that going up in a little bit and then
this week at the end of the week they're
going to Star Wars Celebration sorry
this is still not enough to make me move
out to her in anaheim right yeah Eponine
high but yeah I'm sorry I'm uh not not
going to be moving to California anytime
soon but they've kind of the the need
for me to move there has been somewhat
eliminated this week at TechnoBuffalo
that's right you should talk about our
new friend in the office which we have
not named yet we need to give them a
name it doesn't need to have a name what
we're talking about is a robot and we
will fight over the term robot maybe a
little bit like we have a robot in the
office it's one of the what are they
cause it's like telecommute not telling
me you know tell me what size of those
odds where you you can dial in through
your web browser like we do and then all
of a sudden I'm walking around the
office on the robots ipad screen I can
control it with the the arrows on the
keyboard stuff it's really cool yeah we
we have learned though
lower the mast when you're going to move
because it gets wobbly tips over or you
could be like Joey and run into the
refrigerator okay well what I was doing
the other day is our managing editor Roy
is out there and I was just running into
his office window well I i got into
Roy's office the other day I was like
I'm here to have a meeting goes we can
have it once you close the door I'm like
that's hahaha but that's making fun of
my lack of robotic arms yeah but uh this
is there will be coverage of the robot
coming up and all that but it thusly I
was talking with Ralph our video
producer yesterday I was like you know
calling it a robot seems a little bit of
a stretch yeah it's more like a really
fancy remote-controlled car yeah with an
ipad it cruises on top of it yeah I mean
to me it okay let's put it this way to
me the definition of a robot is
something that works without assistance
or what you've programmed it can work
without assistance right instead this is
completely controlled by the user
exactly so like a Roomba to me is an
actual robot you know the little vacuums
that move around because all I do with
my Roomba is I push the start button and
I walk away right well except when I
have to come back in empty its then but
take it to the bathroom exactly but to
me that's a robot but something that I
have to sit here and it's not going to
move around the office without me
hitting the cursor keys is something
that's just remote-controlled right yeah
and it's cool that I can sit in Missouri
and control this thing you know halfway
across the country yeah and well you've
been out to the office but I haven't
been out to the new one yet so I got to
explore it and it's just amazing what we
can do now oh yeah no I don't get me
wrong I think this is an awesome idea I
I don't know how many use cases are
really are for this thing though I'm
I could see like it being used in
hospitals if you ever notice that
everything that I'm a little
questionable I'm like well there's
medical uses yeah my medical tech is so
huge I know I always have a medical use
for everything but in general I mean
technobuffalo is a unique situation that
we have so many remote workers say oh
there's you Joey me Eric Ron who's in
Japan Jacob who's with you in New York
yep you know so there's a lot of us that
are not in the irvine office that being
said i hope they never put a
telepresence robot here ah John's
walking around our apartment us John's
just like the right here behind me as i
right yo what you doing what you doing
are you sure about the headline
ah-ah-choo mahasti what uh what Bryn is
such a touching right um it's double
robotics I believe yeah it's double
robotics it's called the double which I
have to say it took me a two or three
minutes before ah it's like my doubles
they're okay right it's we at but uh
that's cool you know we could probe from
the web browser you can control from a
phone or a tablet but I I think that
would be a little bit more difficult
especially on club knowing when to
release the the cursor and all that but
that's it's fun but you know it just
made me really start to think about the
definition of robotics and all that and
I don't know if you've heard any of the
there's been a lot of talk lately about
people are getting honestly afraid of
the concept of robots and artificial
intelligence yeah perfect BBC news the
other day was running a special where
there had been some summer symposium
where people were talking about how
we're letting this get too far
hmm interesting I mean yeah you do have
to worry about all that kind of stuff
well I think these are people that have
watched terminator a few too many times
yeah but Google's got those killer wore
robots right yeah that's honorary I I
think there's a lot of potential unless
of course you watch bastard Galactica
where they were helpful robots before
they became the murderous robots but I
think there's a lot of uses for robots I
think there's a lot of jobs they can do
that are too dangerous for humans or
pose a significant risk to humans but I
don't know I i I'm not the doomsayer
that a lot of people are when it comes
to robotics and artificial intelligence
yeah well I'm not either when they're
trained for you know regular things but
when they're trained through military
use that's kind of scary right right in
such a Bohol's also asking what are you
guys going to use the double robot for
their there's actually a personal reason
that the double robot is in the office I
I won't go into it's not anything
horrible it's just not my not my story
to tell but we'll also be doing coverage
on it and you know it just it will be an
ability for those of us that are okay as
odd as it is it did feel I mean even
though we know we have skype and all
that you know we do video calls with
each other all the time if felt slightly
more natural it did it's weird because
you can you're like interacting with
their environment sort of yeah it it
shocked me how much more natural because
I was like oh this is so silly and then
once I started controlling it was kind
of cool because like when I logged in
yesterday just to play around you know
John's wife and son were visiting and I
was able to interact with Nathan oh cool
you know which inhibit it was funny they
kept telling Nathan ill and remember
everyone Nathan is under two years old
he's going to be two in September I
believe
and they're kept going well Nathan look
at Shawn its Sean and he finally he
walked over to my office I use when I'm
out there and pointed that the Fathead
how's that don't know there's a giant
foam cutout of my head that hangs on the
wall but so he knew who shot was he just
thought it was the fat but no it was
cool that you know if you know John
walked to another part of the office i
can turn and i can follow john and you
know John wanted to show me something in
the studio and I was able to roll into
the studio although it took a while to
get there but I was proud of myself I
got through the door on the first try
hmm yeah it's hard to know when you're
controlling the robot like depth is like
I was pulling up to a desk and I didn't
know if I was going to hit it or how far
away I am because you're looking like
straight you know it's sort of like a
true a window you can't look down upper
deck though you can adjust the hot did
you know there actually is a way to look
down the wheels yeah yeah yeah but it's
just like a camera switch right it's not
yeah it's a camera Swift you can't wait
yeah yeah but no I ran into Ron's
trashcan the other days and then I ran
into the corner of somebody's desk at
one point but now it's cool and I I look
I for one welcome our robot overlords
yeah but the big topic we wanted to
tackle the day and like I said last week
folks you know we're going to try some
different topics here simply because you
know coming out what's week it's not as
quickly as phone news comes out
sometimes or no new major phone releases
but this week otay and I every Tuesday
were like what we want to talk about the
show this week and we were I'm not even
sure at what made us think of it but
what mobile games we play yeah i was
like maybe we can talk about Oh is
hearthstone hearse don't come again
maybe yeah that's right cuz that
launched yesterday for iOS and Android
phones it's already been on tablets then
and I've played that I've been playing a
bunch of other games I thought you know
maybe that's a given topic and we and
hopefully people can make some
recommendations for us here too
I enjoy her style aid on the desktop I
played on the iPad not that often but I
do play I was a big big time Magic the
Gathering players I I like being able to
play customizable card games on the go
Joey was fighting her stone on his phone
today and said it was like you could
watch the battery meter going down like
that yeah that there's not a light game
right with all the graphics and all that
so I'm not surprised that it's going to
drain phones rapidly but no I do enjoy
her stone what are some of the games
that you played the mom well I I
recently just started getting back into
because I played it when it was first
released but vainglory on my iPad and on
my iPhone and that's one of the the
games that Apple sorted they brought the
developers up on stage during i think is
last year's WWDC and to show off metal
their new sort of graphics thing and and
it's it the graphics are impressive but
I love the game it's sort of like a
league of legends style game and you you
know you have your hero and then these
minions sort of going at it and then
your goal is to you know eventually you
break down their guns and their turrets
rather and then you sort of conquer
their pace but it's like for people i
guess or up to six I think multiplayer
and again I'm just like getting back
into it but you know and so everybody's
characters sort of have a specialty and
you do different things on the map and
you try to conquer other people but Ivan
have a lot of fun with it and it kind of
reminds me of a game that John quach
used to work here would be really good
at you know like lots of tapping I mean
something somebody was good at Starcraft
or something would probably have a
pretty good skills in this type of game
but a lot of fun yeah I tried playing
league of legends yeah I tried that's
here I was like nope not happening same
idea just cynical but like you know is
it's it's one of those games and maybe
this is something we can talk about to
that you kind of need to be like sitting
down the couch or you can even have a
better experience just like putting it
down on the counter and sort of tapping
down on it it's not one that I would
really play on the subway a you need a
connection
but be like you get really into it and
so like there's these two types of games
right like my subway games I'll call
them am I like at home on the couch or
you know when I'm really gonna focus
games now that you bring up a great
point about need a connection because
that is something that drives me bonkers
like you know say I I fly a lot and you
know I I play I've been planning
simpsons tapped out for like two years i
cannot play simpsons tapped out if i
don't have internet right and that
drives me nuts you know i'm on a tablet
fine i'm on a plane you know like flying
to England or whatever you know for six
seven hours and i can't play my game yo
so I've had to add games that I know for
sure like you know I love playing risk
so I've got risk on my iPad you know
luckily that woman I can play without an
internet connection right but any of any
of my main games I play nope have to
have an internet connection at yeah I
understand the need for cloud saves and
verification and all that but give it
give you like a 12-hour window where you
don't have to log in or something yeah I
agree and that's the worst part I've had
about travel is especially the games
were like internet connection is not
required to actually play the game you
know it's just like the verification
stuff that drives me bonkers I'll
download a game you know get on the
plane launch the game excited to get
into it and then it's like you know it
needs connection or something I'm like
great you know like I just now what am I
going to do the rest of the plane the
flight because I was planning on playing
all these new games yeah that's
frustrating yeah I don't like i said i
mean i understand you okay needs to save
to the cloud and all that but do some
sort of local management for like a
window of time yeah like once a day or
something you know yeah exactly you know
I'd it's annoying especially when you
okay and this leads us to another topic
we wanted to touch on you know freemium
games you know free-to-play homes you
know yeah some of these games
you have download for free and you may
have never paid a dime into I have paid
money into playing simpsons tapped out
yeah but you know okay so fine I've paid
for this I should be able to access it
when I want to access it right you know
that's what drives me bonkers now if
I've never paid a dime into a game you
know like I sometimes play frozen
freefall aeo fine don't don't give me an
extra feature right only understand not
a problem but if I'm pumping money into
a game let me do let me play without it
yo internet for two minutes oh no it's
true yeah I want to get my characters
off tasks yeah and I'm halfway over the
Atlantic Ocean one game that's free and
I actually haven't bought but you can
you can buy to sort of help you along
the way if you if you can't beat the
puzzles but it's called two dots it's on
Android and iOS my only complaint is
that it syncs perfectly across all
Android devices and across off all iOS
devices but not across the two so if I'm
playing it on an Android phone and then
I want to pick it up on my iPhone I'm
like you know five levels backer I've
I'm progressing on both of them together
which is kind of frustrating i kind of
wish there was a cross-platform sort of
sync but that's a good game people
should check out if you haven't already
two dots we've got a good question here
from such a bahal for mobile games would
you prefer a game like candy crusher
trivia crack that was free but in-app
purchase or a game like GTA san andreas
that you pay a certain price and has no
in-app purchases whatsoever I'm more of
I would prefer just pay a one-time fee
and be done yeah i'm the same way
definitely although i liked candy crush
and trivia cracks a fun game but yeah
i'm the same way i don't want to have to
pay for things am I didn't know you play
trivia crack we may have to have to
friend each other on there yeah but like
I totally understand games that you know
you you play it and then maybe you want
extra levels or something like that then
that's fine I just think you know the
freemium and then it's like
you can't when you can't get any further
or like it's painstaking Lee difficult
unless you pay money that's frustrated
right well I I frozen freefall which for
those that aren't familiar with it's
just your standard connect 3 game with a
Disney frozen yo skin over it but you
know there was one stage I got stuck on
for like two weeks I was like nope not
bad yeah that's right not gonna happen
which is kind of the joy in that too
like when I'm at a level on two dots now
and I get on the subway and I know it's
going to be hard to beat and it really
takes up my time and I like that so yeah
I I do know people that pay Yoda for
like I said yes I do pay in simpsons
tapped out i I what I'm doing is I'm
buying the premium you know buildings
really over but the you know in a puzzle
type game I just cannot bring myself to
pay for that stuff right you know
because at that point becomes like a i'm
going to show you this game is not going
to get the better of me yeah yeah and
you can see where it becomes like a
requirement you like oh every time I get
stuck i'm just gonna pay for it then
like it almost takes the fun out of it
like I said I kind of look forward to
getting on the subway and playing that
difficult level I just can't be right
exactly you know but i don't know uh
from frozen Franco what do you think of
the new humble origin bundle and the
humble mobile bundle I have never kept
in here you know I check those out but I
will definitely check those out this
just made me laugh when it came in a
human with anxiety from Sean the man 34
is it true that Todd and John are going
to the Star Wars premiere in December
he's not to her about that for those
that don't know when John got invited to
the Avengers premier ice I was was not
able to go out there because we just it
didn't make financial sense I said but
you know if you get invited to the star
wars force awakens premiere I'm I'm
going with you I will find some way to
be there and jon was like sure no
problem
now mind you folks we have not been
invited to the premiere as of yet I
highly doubt we're going to get invited
to the premiere this was just wishful
discussion going on between John and me
and so then yesterday a conversation
started up on Twitter suggesting that I
wasn't going that Todd was going to take
my place and Todd was even suggesting
that they go to dinner beforehand and
they might get to the movie a little
late Oh in late yeah yeah really not
that big of a deal and I'm I'm saying
they're going I will cut a person haha i
will cut somebody mark my words yeah I
may not look like it but I will cut it I
will cook we're not really doing we were
just messing with John hell maybe we'll
go it just wanted me jump ahead from
some of the other questions more of a
comment from such a mahal hey Jean Todd
I really enjoyed last week's episode
about movies and TV it was a nice breath
of fresh air from the regular mole news
and stuff so thanks for that well thank
you and as they we probably do a little
bit more of in the future especially
with the summer blockbuster season
coming up right I I will ask you right
now have you started watching daredevil
yep no i didn't but i want see I was
actually talking about watching last
night than I fell asleep so I I'm only
seven episodes in I am enjoying the heck
out of it I don't feel you have to be
knowledgeable the daredevil character to
get it yeah okay good yeah it's real
some of the Scimitar summits imitates
Emmett agra feet that's the word I was
going for na na nóg reputedly shot well
acted well written it's really enjoyable
so far cool actually one of my friends
did start watching he said it seemed
like a lot of the events were like fast
forward in action is that true do you
see any of that you think I don't know
if it's like so there's one fight scene
in the second episode that won't give
you too many details on that you will
notice as it goes on that you're like
they're not cutting away they shot this
in real time okay so
it's over three minutes long Wow yeah
you're like I wonder how many rehearsals
they went through to get this because
it's kind of nuts uh from Enrique erro
big question here I want to get a
SmartWatch I was looking at the Moto 360
and the LG G watch our but that's how
the Moto 360 second gen is coming so I'd
like to know one thing should i get the
Moto the LG G watch our or wait for Moto
360 second gen um it's tough because i
really liked moto 360 the prices dropped
motorola or no google selling it for
like 1 69 now i think amazon best buy
haven't for 10 bucks more which is a
really good price for that that
smartwatches great the only thing is i
hate to say like oh go buy it and then
the Moto 360 2 comes out you know in the
coming months because I expect it to
especially with WWDC and tuned I'm sorry
google i/o coming up where last year
they sort of talked about Android wear
and moto 360 was there and all these
other new ones so I kind of want to
advise you to wait that long um because
once that comes out I i think the Moto
360 derision Allah probably drop too but
you know I wouldn't be afraid if you buy
the Moto 360 it's still a great
SmartWatch so I wouldn't be upset with
that purchase it's just barely up to you
well here we go with a from social bahal
hey guys just a mobile game suggestion
you guys should check out 80 days it's
five dollars with no in-app purchases
but you get the game and you get that
game and a few games for less than five
dollars in the humble bundle awesome
like check that out there now in another
moto 360 question actually from Benjamin
McDonald I got my moto 360 my batteries
actually very good i came i come home
from a school day 5 plus hours and come
home with about fifty percent by have
ambient screen mode is the this only me
or do you also get that this result yeah
i get through a like a full workday with
ambien screen on which I prefer because
I like having the you know the clock
showing this little point of a lot
to me so yeah that's about on a par with
what I've gotten and when I turn off
ambien sometimes I can get through the
night into the next day a little bit too
so I I have not used the Moto 360 so
i'll say yeah it's good hey uh from
funny i still wear just a classic watch
Muslims from coot con 123 what do you
think about the LG g4 leaks yeah well
we'll be at the event I think it's next
week right coming up mm-hmm I don't know
I'm not crazy about the leatherback
maybe I'm the only one I saw a lot of
people online like like that and I think
the one on the Moto X is a little
different it's smoother this I don't
like the stitching and some people
actually really did I'm not know we'll
see what actually comes and you know
maybe it's not all leather maybe there's
other stuff but I'm excited to see what
it offers you know quad HD another quad
HD phone that's that's always good
faster build on the g3 which is still a
fantastic smartphone I mean it still
competes with everything else out there
I didn't use the g3 except for you know
for like a minute here or there I use
droid did I carried the g2 for a while
yeah I really liked the g2i how the g2
is a great phone I have to agree here
though Todd I'm not a fan of this
leather trend or from you know faux
leather back so nothing no thanks ya SiC
the metal I don't know I'd rather see LG
do follow you know samsung and apple and
HTC and then just you know try to do
something with metal so the g3 was great
but it was kind of fingerprint II and it
was metallic which just means looks like
metal it's plastic and I'm also I gotta
be honest I'm not crazy about Snapdragon
810 these days I mean I have it in the
m9 here and I just can't tell you know
like that it's much better like I feel
like last year with new flag chips and
stuff you like really felt like it was
just a big bump and I just don't really
see that with Snapdragon 80 and I can't
like get my mind around it but actually
notice has been it seems pretty pretty
quick on the galaxy s6 and s6 edge so no
see I honestly I
I never really think about processors in
that fashion I'm just like this phones
yeah me neither i'm more like yeah I'm
more like you know can handle what I'm
thrown at and most of phones these days
can you know at least for a couple
months since I start seeing a slow down
or whatever but yet camera is important
to me in those extras like I really like
a wireless charging in the galaxy s6 and
I'd like to see all of those features
make their way then become a standard
from Sean the man 34 will we see mobile
gaming come to the Apple watch yes yeah
actually where you gain right we covered
that yeah well we have a story coming up
later about a game called watch quest
coming from I cannot remember from way
forward and it works in conjunction with
the iPhone the iPhone will act like base
of operations and but you will do the
majority of the game on the Apple watch
oh that's neat yeah so there there is
actually already a movement to bring
gaming to the Apple watch yeah I've
never like I know there's games for
pebble and some never really happened
desire to playing him on my watch forget
me either from marc eric lane what
smartwatches if any will be ms the
google i/o we usually have a general
idea at least speculation about
smartphones but what about watches yeah
i don't know i think probably the new
Moto 360 um I don't know LG just you
know announced some back at Eva but end
of februari early March so I don't know
that they're going to be ready for new
one samsung seems to be doing its own
thing with Tizen you know maybe we'll
see something from a sous but they just
announced their own bebo watch earlier
this week that doesn't run Android wear
but they could follow up with something
new I don't know it'll be really
interesting to see what Google is doing
with that on that front should be
interesting iphone i want to see like
android wear you know like to point 0
because i think it's time for that next
uh also from mark eric lane hey Todd I
spy your Jersey Shore stuff back there
dress on represent yeah you're supposed
to be the train stations on the way down
like that all the shore towns but some
of them aren't or they're out of order
instead I think I got it like
I hear something from Benjamin McDonald
do you think that moto and maybe three
years will be the new apple and if so do
you think that they will buy themselves
out of lenovo now no no it don't get us
wrong we love company we love motorola
around here they big big love for
motorola but i just i don't see that
happening unfortunately yeah i think
motorola mobility is now part of lenovo
and I think that's where it'll stay
unless one of us sales yeah they're not
gonna buy themselves at lenovo uh from
such a mahal have you checked out the
Apple watch yet i know i have not had a
nap opportunity to introduce know yet i
was in the apple store so I saw them but
I didn't put it on my wrist I was there
to check out the new macbook and I
ultimately went with the macbook pro
with retina the macbook Lee I was with
my wife too and we were both looking at
it again it really feels and looks kind
of like a netbook and I just can't
swallow that price for that and quorum
for me hasn't been powerful enough and I
was reading the reviews you know that
other people have we had one out in
irvine now i just couldn't do it i don't
know i think i needed a little more
power and you know in general what we do
is just browse the web and right and
even still i was later I can't you know
if I wanted something like it I already
have a netbook and even the apple store
guy was like it's more of a secondary
computer to be honest so yeah I guys
must be saying that hey I've got a
Chromebook for that so yeah yeah like
right now I have this hooked up to i
mean i have microphone plugged in i have
a7 port USB hub I have a 32 inch screen
right here another screen over to my
left like you I don't think I could do
that without you know jumping through
hoops on the right I mean I think it got
or No I've got two USB hubs connected to
this imac I've got a USB keyboard a USB
mouse two monitors this Mike you know
now I just won't work for people like us
unfortunately but speaking to brazen
Franco's question
first 24 hours oppression on the macbook
neither totter i have spent any time
with the macbook other than Todd in this
store right now looking at it I like the
keyword that was kind of neat I mean the
keys are really shallow it's different
yeah I need to try that out and see yeah
well and I plan to write an article
about this and also the ion we were
talking about the glass on the on the
Apple watch work but force touch to me I
was talking to one of our staffers
Brandon yesterday so it's on this new
Pro and if you didn't tell me this thing
hadn't changed i would had changed i
wouldn't have noticed like I it just
feels I don't know the same to me maybe
I'm crazy I'm probably the only one that
says that but like people have said that
the trackpad doesn't actually move and
it does i could be like when i push it i
can watch it move it's just that it has
like a balanced click throughout the
whole thing and then the feedback is
caused by like whatever the force touch
thingy-majingy is underneath but it's
not like like a physical click i guess
but it does bend it should have a laptop
talking solid I don't know I don't know
I especially with key action I i want to
i want to feel what's going on so i will
have to try that new keyboard oh and the
force touch to like it you can hold you
know long on a word in safari but i
don't use safari seven sling yeah i
wouldn't go out of my way to get a force
touch track that is what I'm saying it's
not David I see your question about Ram
if you could be more specific which of
our computers are talking about from
Shaun the man 34 do you think 1 million
Apple watch is sold in the US on the
first day is low or do you think they
sold more than expected I think they
probably met expectations I don't know
it's definitely not load android wear
took what 700 700 20,000 units in six
months so considering Apple did that 24
hours navy is up so why it's not
official yet and then pebble took what a
year to get to a million a little over
here I guess so I think it's pretty
crazy but they slowed that many if it's
true the
I I don't know but to me the first
weekend of sales with any Apple product
is you have to while they're huge you
also have to somewhat remove the
fanaticism out of those numbers to me
the more telling thing is how the watch
does from like here on out right you
know which doing Apple they won't tell
us because people want the you know the
latest and greatest from apple and so
there you know ordering it and not
lining up in stores this apple doesn't
want people to do not that you can even
buy them in stores which I think it's
weird and like like what and even on the
twenty-fourth when it launches its not
going to be in stores and like a macbook
they don't even have a date when I was
in there were like oh we should have it
on the twenty-fourth the same day is the
Apple watch we're not sure if you
ordered it'll come in a couple days and
also court is going oh this is weird
it's a very odd set up very odd well
yeah that's a good point i'd say like
and how many does it sell in the first
year let's do this yeah from Benjamin
McDonald right now i have a macbook pro
13-inch 2010 and sweden we go free one
from school well i need to move to
sweden go to sorry i've been thinking
about buying a surface 3 as a secondary
computer do you think i should buy one i
also have a gaming pc so i don't really
need a gaming machine honestly if you're
looking for just base operations i would
say a Chromebook it totally depends on
what you want to do with that secondary
machine you know to me when someone's
the secondary machine I'm thinking just
like web browsing email light video
viewing you're not doing any sort of
heavy lifting with it yeah while the
surface is more versatile the surface is
also considerably more expensive yeah it
starts at what 499 now and then you have
to buy the keyboard right so having
processor which you can find in other
notebooks yeah so I I would say if
you're just looking for something to do
very light competing with I would look
at a chromebook before i would look at a
surface yeah um from from Roy lambright
if microsoft released a zune phone years
ago would they be doing any better or
they'd still be behind everyone in terms
of market share no it would not be doing
better it would have flopped like the
kin one in the King to Microsoft I don't
get it I i I've said this before in this
show I actually like Microsoft
peripherals i'm using a microsoft
keyboard and a microsoft mouse with a
mac you know i like herself not Steve I
yeah I really enjoy their computer
peripherals anytime they go beyond that
and hardware things go wonky yeah it's
it's very bizarre and like todsah I mean
the kid one in the kin two were
spectacular disasters yeah the zune
brand name we could just start we could
do a whole show just on what was running
the zoo see I liked the zune but I was
like the only one one of my first
reviews I was in college well Todd were
you part of the social no but I actually
wrote about this social and how it was
like this you know they wanted like this
counterculture this cool thing and then
Wow our first device is going to be ups
Brown yeah like what and the zune name
never made sense not not that's not to
say that ipod made a ton of sense when
it first arrived right but my Microsoft
did so much wrong with both the zune and
the kins and other pride no I don't
think they would be doing any better
unfortunately yeah and remember they
were still making phones at that time
they were just windows mobile then they
switched to Windows Phone ah well Jame
selling software her phone Benjamin
McDonald clears up on the second
computer i was thinking more
like watching movies on airplanes and
trains then a tablet a pure tablet
although you could pick up a surface
without the keyboard and still 499 at
that point i would say it depends on
what ecosystem you're in you know if
you've been buying your your movies on
say Google Play or on iTunes or if
you've been torrenting them we're not
not saying nasty things towards you but
you know just in case you've been
torrenting them get one with the micro
SD card slot yeah i would say then maybe
I would go surface from mark Erica Lane
what's on your wish list for the new
android where i have NFC and biometrics
a fingerprint sensor for payments on the
watch but what else would you like to
see um i would say NFC would be great I
I fully agree with you on that one
biometrics I'm still not sold on their
usefulness yeah I don't know that we
need that I mean it's the same like the
Apple watch doesn't have a fingerprint
sensor on it it just connects to your
phone NFC for payments i guess would we
need for for sharing or something like
that i don't know i i'm still trying to
figure out i think the whole industry is
like what are these good for be like and
for me it seems to be mostly
notifications but so long as I can
manage those notifications because i
don't want everything just wants some
things something matters and I can I
don't know that I really care to use my
watch to make a payment but in wearables
in general I i 100% agree with you Todd
it feels like we're and we're part of a
giant beta test still yeah so one of
these things do yeah it's all not even
so much a beta test it's more like
market research yeah seriously you know
what what are these let's let's sit at
the corner and watch what they try to do
with them yeah yeah it's like a
sociologist watching monkeys you know
slow hell yeah today's the big one used
his one
hahaha okay it's it's very odd and you
know a lot of people are like you I I
didn't order an Apple watch I just was
not that interested you know i'm still
using the pebble and to me I was having
a long talk with Joey our gaming editor
the other day he he does not see the
appeal of the SmartWatch up and I you
know I he and i ended up in a very long
discussion about why i like using the
SmartWatch and I told him he owed to me
if freed me from my phone to an extent
he was viewing it as tying him yourself
down to the phone more but no it has
freed me from the phone somewhat because
you know most people when you pull out
your phone you're like oh I don't need
to respond to that well as long as I've
got my phone out let me look this up
right right then let me look that up
with the with the pebble I just you know
I ok I don't need to deal with that and
I'm that's the end of my interaction
with my phone and so to me the simpler
the SmartWatch the more useful it is yep
and you know what I I know I get a nap
I'm sorry go ahead well one thing I'd
say is that I could use more
location-based information too because
that's one of the things where you
always have to pull out your phone like
it should I'd like it if it knew that I
was next to the subway and that it just
brought up the next train times and
stuff like that or you know in the
future brought up my payment card then
we could use NFC and then I could just
hit the turnstile and go through like
that would be neat and doing it
automatically I don't want to have to
pull it up well I don't you know can it
no you know through using sensors that
I'm have to gate for checking into my
flight and just pull up my boarding pass
like that kind of stuff that would be
useful to me that would be great I mean
well I mean there's a reason Google's
paper boarding passes there's a google
app called field guide which it it makes
a sound when i'm near like historical
locations yeah that's cool yeah it's a
great app so use something like that
you know it can be set up through a
beacon system okay I now know you are
okay my phone picks up the signal I am
near gate a 7 that means i'm near my
flight that means it's time to populate
the watch with my boarding pass right
and it seems like we're getting there
like that's what I beacons are foreign
beacons in general you know or getting
around a stadium like where's my seat
and stuff like that it's just that I
feel like the watch needs to be smarter
instead of just this thing yeah I don't
know with notifications I don't care
about yeah Benjamin seen your response
about you burn your own blu-rays yeah go
go Windows then and in case you haven't
noticed Mark Eric lane is talking to you
in the comments 0 which we welcome guys
have a discussion let's see here we've
got time for one more question so let me
just scroll through these as always we
have more questions than we have time
and we greatly appreciate of you guys we
like to see so much interaction with you
um but I'll take this one since a little
different from kuta con 123 Shawn
favorite headphones I'm not a fancy
headphones guy when i fly i use bose
quietcomfort 15 s4 sound canceling these
are i can never remember their name
there you go tactica yeah audio-technica
i don't know why like away it's printed
right there for me John quach also loved
in this ya know these are great
headphones these are called studio
headphones are built for this type of
work although there have been people
that have commented that i should just
wear earbuds and not where the giant
headset but I like my giant headset so
yeah I'm not real big Todd do you have
any favorite headphones I don't um you
know the problem is I end up breaking
them all or something like that so I
typically stay cheap I just have these
you know the apple ones here I have a
desk full of like you know what are they
skull candies and stuff you buy at
radioshack like 10 bucks and you can pay
like two dollars to get them replaced
once a year so my god i found the other
day i got so tired of these just
on my desk I was like there's gotta be
some sort of headphone gadget and I'm
for you I can't take it up over here now
on my desk I found there's a hook that
was made my audio technica that was
built for these and she's gonna
mannequin head that's on top of my desk
him this name is key this hangs under my
desk and the bottom hook swivels so I
can like hide them under my desk oh when
I use and then when I want him I just
swivel it out and I know this is way
more complicated than it needed to be
anyway I'd like mannequin head would be
creepier oh yeah which and honestly I
have I have a garbage bag full of
mannequin heads because you really yes
oh man the styrofoam mannequin heads for
those that don't know my mother used to
own a costume shop and she kept Oliver
man I can have when she closed we're all
behind that sheet yeah that's exactly we
also have a full-size mannequin we have
a torso mannequin we have a animatronic
Santa Claus which is creepy and I East a
blur I hate that thing things like six
feet tall we have some very odd things
we also have coffins oh man they're
cardboard so ke dohe tray it was a
costume shop focus we expect ya anyway
