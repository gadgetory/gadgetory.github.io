without Android in it but it wasn't that
long ago that Android didn't exist let's
go back in time and revisit the very
first Android device the t-mobile g1
were also known as the HTC dream Android
story started in July 2005 when they
made it the time would seem like a very
benign acquisition of Android ink
company led by Andy Rubin was working
out an unspecified sock or mobile
devices that was all anybody knew at
this point in the story I'm going to
stop talking about Google and talked
about Apple for a minute I know it's
gonna ruffle some feathers but the
January 2007 unveiling of the iPhone
caught Rubin completely off-guard and
force him to totally change its course
what he was designing in fact we see
what he was designing it's leaked out
sense as a sooner prototype and more
black by looking smartphone in the
modern touchscreen we eventually got
with the HTC One the operating systems
design was completely redone reworked
and retooled and attention was shifted
to a brand new prototype codenamed dream
is I had to include a physical keyboard
his Android developers the time didn't
like the idea of a virtual keyboard
thought it lacked a physical feedback
I mean hardware keyboards way more
useful and Android as we know it was
officially born in November 2007 along
with the founding of the Open Handset
Alliance we didn't see the very first
handset until September 23rd 2008 when
HTC officially announced they would be
the maker of the t-mobile g1 or the HTC
dream I remember getting the g1 it was
one of the very first devices I reviewed
back in the day now and here is the box
itself t-mobile g1 and I loved the way
the phone loved it was different it was
quirky it was unique it represented
Android as a whole
Google's original philosophy for the g1
is kind of similar to what it is now
it's centered on a one-click search in
rich web experience large and t-mobile's
3G network at the time which Google said
was essential to its success and people
flocked the g1 in droves whether not
they loved the phone or represented the
anti I phone after just six months on
the market they're in a 5th place spot
among the top-selling smartphones in the
u.s. now spec wise looking back it seems
meager but by 2008 standards it was
pretty good had a 3.2 inch 320 by 480
screen which was 180 PPI had a random
megapixel edge of 3.15 for the rear
facing camera did not have a friend
camera we'd see that come later it
featured a pretty long lasting battery
leased for 2008 at 1,150 milliamp hours
256 megabytes of internal storage but it
did feature expandable storage totally
the androids really embrace I go up to
16 gigabytes via micro sd and a 192
megabytes of RAM was design wise the G
one's a bit odd-looking
quirky let's say I love the slide-out
mechanism it still works the one we have
in the office today
it was very well engineered if I roll
design really indicative I think of
HTC's design language the button layout
was bit weird they were small and round
and there was a physical send button a
physical end and power button physical
home button a back button and the menu
button and in the middle of it was a
scroll wheel something we saw make its
way to Nexus One it's a very odd way to
navigate but it was very common in
phones at the time it also had a bit of
an angle to it it's supposedly curved
the microphones to your face as you were
talking also of note there was no
multi-touch on here all the build stuff
aside the main attraction and still is
the main attraction of Android was open
environment they're hoping that app
developers are going to be like heck
yeah open development and launching with
the g1 google also unveils the Android
Market now of course known as Google
Play offered around 50 apps the time
while Google was forced to change
direction after the iPhones launch the
g1 featured a ton of features that Apple
did not have at the time things like
multitasking copy-and-paste pulled on
notifications and of course home screen
widget were all marquee features of the
original Android 1.0 and obviously it
came really integrated Google services
too like Gmail and maps part of the
appeal to g1 was that it was unfinished
it wasn't yet fully formed and as Google
likes to do it got better over time and
early iOS updates fixed glaring over
sites like the missing virtual keyboard
lack of video recording for example and
as important as the g1 was was also
important the g1 set the stage for a
year after the G ones launched Verizon
released the massively popular Droid
line of phones we started to see the
current iteration of Android start to
take shape the g1 holds a really
important place not only my heart and I
think probably yours as well but also in
the company's history the g1 is a really
important phone in the pantheon of our
the openness of Android led to really
fast adoption by a variety of
manufacturers that wanted to take on
Apple success it also helped that it was
totally free to license looking back
that you want it's like looking at baby
pictures like wow look what you used to
look like look what you used to be and
it's cool to see how the g1 evolved how
Android evolved to get us where we are
now
flagship devices where the Nexus line is
gone where the pixel line is going to go
did you want pave the way for that I
think it's important to pay respect to
devices it helped pave the way and
certainly the road of Android is paved
with HTC g1</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
