technobuffalo here when i did an
unboxing of the dell inspiron 14z as i
was reading through the comments one of
the things that shocked me most was the
frequency of comments about this new
dock up at the top and I thought that I
walk you guys through and show you what
it does and sort of what it's supposed
to do so it's done by a company called
rocket dock and it's an ad in the Dell
puts on their computers you can turn it
off or turn it on depending on whether
or not you like it but it's very similar
to the doc found in OS 10 and it's very
similar now to the new taskbar in
Windows 7 so you can customize any
applications that show up here by
default you're going to get a male and
chat you can see those little arrow
right there letting you know there's a
drop down menu to pull up some more
information internet photos music videos
office security help and support and
there's your recycle bin so let's say
that helping support is something that I
don't want on here I can go ahead and
very easily just delete it just by
clicking it and dragging it off and
gives me the options now do I want to
delete this category now shortcuts we'll
go ahead and hit yes now let's say I
want to add something there and say I
want to put firefox in the dock and go
ahead and drag it right up and I can put
it in its own or I can drag it into the
internet slow but it's gets already
there but let's put it right next to it
so I hit internet you know how much
different options my blog parental
controls and there is mozilla firefox i
added earlier on email and chat you go
right to msn you could set that up for a
more whatever else you want photos view
and publish photos you can set that to
your my photos or set up a desktop
flickr account whatever you choose
music's going to take you right to
listen to music and windows media player
videos much the same thing burn your cds
and dvds take you right to the videos or
right to Windows Media Center which is
actually pretty cool in windows 7 and
lastly you've got one here for office
which actually comes bundled with a
trial of microsoft office 2007 60 day
trial so it'll open these things up
right here and sort of simplify the 40
word create documents Excel
make spreadsheets sir makes a very
self-explanatory I'm it also of course
has your recycle bin right up there so
I've got a desktop shortcut to Firefox
install file go and delete it and it
works just like the recycle bin would if
it was on your desktop I find it to be
relatively handy LOL a when I'm working
with other programs let's say I open up
Firefox for example and I don't have it
set for full screen if it's more to say
move down oftentimes I find myself going
up here and selecting something by
accent sort of puts itself right there
you can change the sensitivity and what
it's going to do but at least for me I
found it to be a little bit cumbersome
when windows aren't maximized however
when I'm using it just straight up on
the desktop it is quite nice you can
move it around and sort of dock it
anywhere you'd like anyway guys hope you
enjoyed this sort of very short overview
of one of the new features of the dell
inspiron 14z and really on most all dell
laptops and get into something if you
don't like you can just turn off hope
you guys enjoyed stay tuned for a ton of
more dell 14z coverage coming up i'm jon
rettinger and i'll see you guys in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
