simple choice an apple event invite a
wii u sales boost pokemon sales numbers
and surviving a zombie apocalypse it's
Buffalo bulletin time hello internet and
welcome to the Buffalo bulletin where we
recap five major stories from our site
TechnoBuffalo calm every tuesday and
friday if you're interested in reading
more about any story i talked about on
the show check the description for links
or click on the graphics for each story
if you have annotations available and
toggled on i'm ashley sceva here your
top stories it looks like t-mobile still
making changes to their service but this
week it's a change not everyone might
like it seems they're eliminating all
older contracts and moving every
subscriber to their simple choice plans
starting next month t-mobile says it's
to keep rate plans simple and reports
suggest any user unhappy with the
changes will be able to opt out of their
contract without penalty it's official
Apple has issued press invites for an
event on october twenty seconds saying
we still have a lot to cover on the
invitation what's a lot well we'll
likely see new ipads retina macbook pro
updates with Haswell chips and if we're
very very lucky that new Mac Pro will
finally get a release date and a price
well no it's official in exactly one
week's time but until then let the last
minute speculation commence in gaming
pokemon X&amp;amp;Y came barreling out of the
gate or I guess came charging out of the
pokeball with some pretty massive sales
in just two days on retail shelves
pokemon X&amp;amp;Y sold a whopping four million
copies too eager gamers everywhere even
more amazing Nintendo indicated x and y
are on track to be the fastest selling
nintendo 3ds games of all time with
those sales figures it's a nice job
nintendo another interesting Nintendo
statistic for today's show it seems wii
u sales increased by a ridiculous six
hundred and eighty-five percent in the
UK after the Wind Waker HD wii u console
bundle hit shelves that's really good
for nintendo as the UK is the lowest
performing region in the world for the
wii u hopefully as the wii u starts
getting more desirable games especially
those first party ones
the console will continue to increase
lastly our wild card story for the week
zombie preparedness our very own Roy
Choi found himself inspired by the
return of The Walking Dead to our
television sets this week and put
together a list of must have items for
any undead disasters that might be
headed our way also it's just a really
cool layout on the sites you should
totally go see it even if you have
everything you need for an impending
zombie apocalypse that's the Buffalo
bulletin for today if you enjoyed the
