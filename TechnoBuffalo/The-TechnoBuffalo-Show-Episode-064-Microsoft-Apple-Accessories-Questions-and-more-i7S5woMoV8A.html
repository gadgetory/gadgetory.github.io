TechnoBuffalo show I'm on your to host
for today Sean ani editor-in-chief of
the site i'm joined by deputy managing
editor Todd Hazleton hey everybody how
are you doing today Todd I'm good
apologies to everyone we tried doing
episode 64 once before and things went
horribly wrong that was two weeks ago
and then I was in irvine last week so
now we're back with the Real 64 we're
back we're back but lots happened since
we are last year and specifically I
would like to discuss Microsoft who for
once i SAT there during a presentation
going wait what's going on here I'm
actually interested in what they're
talking about I know that was a really
interesting press conference um I was
there with Jacob in New York City Jacobs
one of our writers on the site we were
uh you know we went to the event
expecting surface pro 4 and that was
unveiled and I'm excited for her because
it has a new keyboard and you know me
I've used the surface pro 3 and I want
to throw that thing out the window
because I can't stand the keyboard it's
not the tablet itself right it's just a
keyboard yeah the keyboard has been
killing he's like I can't use this thing
so anyway I haven't used it that much
yet but i was able to poke around on at
the event i liked it i thought it was
good but anyway I'm getting ahead of
myself so we thought we were just going
to see that and the Lumia 950 950 XL
which were introduced but then Microsoft
surprised us with this surface book its
first laptop and built from the ground
up it said it wants us to be like you
know the laptop of all laptops it's
going specifically after apple metal
body screen pops off it's really cool
you hold like a one of the buttons on
the keyboards an electronic and it just
sort of unlocks itself really nice
really premium and of course comes with
the premium price of 1,500 bucks but
that was the big surprise we were like
whoa what is this thing I didn't see
this coming so now I had one big
question just since I was only watching
on the live feed so when they showed it
closed it looked like at the hinge there
was a gap yeah there is that concerns me
that
oh yeah because I mean imagine that's in
your bag and like you've got loose pins
or something yeah and a pin could slip
in there and potentially scratch the
screen or do some other damage I that
overall I was very very impressed with
it but that gap does concern me I'm
wondering about that too I wish I'd
asked about that and I didn't but it
does look weird and I think one of the
things we're all used to with laptops
you know as you get especially when
they're getting smaller and more
powerful it's like a super compact
package and you're like wow that's
awesome looking because it kind of comes
into this lab and then this is sort of
like a slump sort of slightly open so I
don't know something about like an OCD
thing and meet it's like Oh closed all
the way you know yeah it's a nice
computer especially for people who I
mean there are great Windows 10 laptops
out there obviously already but a lot of
them were sort of Windows 8.1 upgrade to
Windows 10 and now we're getting even
just since Microsoft's event lenovo acer
sues dell HP have all announced their
new laptops and i haven't seen them yet
but I'm sure there's going to be some
you know right up that alley of the of
the surface book but Microsoft's goal
and it sounded like I think they a sous
was a little upset with them or maybe it
was easier but I think was a sous that
you know Microsoft sort of went on its
own didn't even tell its partners its
hardware partners it's building this
like laptop tablet hybrid which is Sue's
has been known for you know and yeah I
know but you can see where manufacturers
would be a little upset and I think it's
the same thing that happened with
microsoft and windows phone when they
bought nokia and sort and even before
they bought no key and they sort of just
gave you know they seem to have
supported nokia far beyond other other
OEMs and now it's what's happened most
people aren't making windows yeah this
is so but i will say the the continuum
feature on the Windows Phone was
fascinating to watch I'll be interested
to see how it does in a real world
environment of course right but you know
the idea of just connecting it to that
little hub and then having a full-size
keyboard in full size malice in full
size monitor all running from your phone
is truly fascinate
yeah that was awesome um the only thing
that bothers me about the phones and her
and everything going forward right now
is the microsoft hasn't provided release
date information hasn't said you know
where we're going to be able to buy
these things it's just like it's very
weird and we know Windows 10 for phones
isn't really quite finished because it's
still what beta on to have a phone
around here running it but it's still in
beta so it's just kind of weird it
didn't feel like they were ready to go
with that and obviously the app
situation is the biggest problem facing
them and will continue to be whether
there's continuum or not but Microsoft I
think we've talked about this before the
past their goal here is okay design an
app for Windows 10 you know it scales
down it can easily be rewritten for
Windows 10 for mobile using that
continuum feature even and that's how
their photos app for example runs that's
how their their office apps run it's the
same app running on the phone and all of
a sudden ones full screen it looks like
a full windows happen so that's that's
both the compelling instance of Windows
10 is this continuum feature we get the
pc and the mobile but it's also one of
the things that's been hurting windows
forever is that there's not enough apps
and let alone absent do that but just
you know apps in general and on stage
microsoft said what facebook's coming
like okay so that means probably
instagram to which has been in baner
forever but there's a lot more than
needs to be delivered right right now I
overall and I don't mean this as a slam
on Microsoft I definitely under the
bomber administration there there wasn't
a whole lot of innovation going on there
wasn't a whole lot of excitement going
on that was the most excited I've been
by a microsoft event in ages yeah they
had my attention I was very interested
in continuing I was very interested in
the laptop despite its funky hinge it
the surface pro 4 looked fantastic you
know overall it was a very it was very
not Microsoft yeah I think I was
disappointed though in hololens which
has excited us before Microsoft and I
think
and then they were like oh $3,000 like
did anybody see that Christ Ellen I
doubt that's intolerable that is the
developer kit which I'm sure includes
extra hardware it's all so early I don't
think that's what consumer pricing will
be you know I I hope not otherwise the
hololens will exist as a lovely dream
for many people yeah but uh I honestly
with hot I mean at least we finally got
a step in the right direction with
hololens and that it is going out to
developers so perhaps we're finally
moving towards the release I I don't
want to watch vaporware for another
couple years right yo not not that
Microsoft has ever done that to us
before yes they have hey but now overall
it was a very very interesting event I'm
excited for the future windows I still
say you know of course the biggest thing
is the app store they but they do seem
to be working on that and trying to move
forward but did they say what the price
was going to be for that little
additional hub for the phone think it's
a hundred bucks which I think that
should be bundled in I mean come on yeah
it's like one of the highlight features
and people need to pay an additional
hundred dollars on top like just get it
out there get people in press with your
phones and then sell it yeah there
should at least be a bundle option for
like the first two months or something
yeah because I that that is a a flagship
feature yeah certainly know the idea
being able to take my because a lot of
the guys have at the office they put
their macbooks and you know holders and
not right run you know everything off of
that you know the idea of being able to
slip my computer in my pocket yeah to
take it from home to work as an amazing
concept yeah that would be amazing I
mean you say out in irvine or whatever
you just keep the hub in your backpack
noun irvine or you know your office
wherever that is for other people you
know you have your keyboard mouse and a
monitor and that's all you need right
you could just travel everywhere with
your phone that to me is super
compelling and I hope that this is where
ever you want is going i hope it's where
android goes I mean it can't be that
hard at this point for for Google to
throw a version of Chrome OS on to some
partition on Android device right yeah I
mean it's the same processors and so I
mean it's not the same but you're
looking at similar processors unless you
looking at the core i5 or core i3
Chromebooks but those are sort of a
different league but I mean it's
possible and I think we could see it
with intel processors to with with the
windows machines so I don't know and I
think Apple has has so far given no
indication of going in that direction
aside from multi-view windows but it's
it's it's where we should be going I
think that's the future of personal
computing and I think it's where other
technologies I mean you move on to was
trying it to ya know I definitely agree
Thea I I think this is something
everyone's gonna have to start to look
at because you know a lot of people are
like oh well I don't want to carry you
know devices that only has one use you
look at a laptop yeah and it does
primarily have one use yes you can watch
netflix on it or you can do work or you
can surf the web or whatever all things
you can also do from your phone right
you know so the idea of being able to do
that you know plug every phone should be
looking at this I completely agree with
you this is definitely something that
needs to be looked at the other topic we
wanted to jump to it and of course will
take Microsoft questions during the Q&amp;amp;A
session was the new apple accessories
you know for a company that prides
himself on design why are they still
holding on to the magic mouse yeah I I'm
like you we talked about this the other
day I've never liked the magic mouse I
never liked I have never met anyone that
likes the magic mouse and here's a new
one
that looks exactly the same but it has
forged average rate is forced touching
the magic mouse or just a new trackpad
hey here I i'm using a mac yeah you can
see microsoft mouse is steelseries mouse
over here yeah and i'm using a microsoft
keyboard see i have a part of this
keyboard I'll give them that and I don't
even know why I bought it right actually
i'll tell you i bought it everybody up
on the TechnoBuffalo staff when we have
skype calls and stuff for other meetings
i used to use mechanical keyboards which
I love but they're so darn loud that i
swished something quieter and i figured
you know what i'm used to typing on the
macbook all the time this is as close as
I'm gonna get besides you know learning
another quiet keyword stuff that's right
right now I will say I when the original
magic trackpad was first announced I
thought oh my god yeah who's gonna buy
this then I walked into an app store and
tried one and i love it i think it's a
great device it actually does have a lot
of uses cap1 why i actually really like
it but that being said 129 dollars is a
ridiculous price yeah all these i don't
feel it needed to be bigger i'm sorry i
don't care what they say because I mean
I only have so much real estate on my
desk yeah you know and I actually wear
it since i have no more room period so i
just now i will say this if you buy a
new mac you can throw it on for fifty
dollars that's not horrible that I could
live with but going out and buying one
outright for 129 dollars is insane right
now since you do use the wireless
keyboard way you think about the new
wireless keyboard with rechargeable yeah
that's nice because this one actually
has two through batteries so far and the
design well it looks nice and i feel
like i'm really bored right now but a
you know you unscrew the side here you
pop in the batteries and i feel like it
could have been done better it's really
clunky this
mechanism I like the lightning charging
that seems pretty cool month of battery
life I if I didn't already own this I'd
probably buy that but at this point you
know yeah of course yeah next time
you're in the market for a keyboard
right Mike yeah I I do like the fact
that it's finally rechargeable it'd be
nice if the magic trackpad was also
rechargeable because I i do use apple
rechargeable batteries in it but still
it's it'd be nice if it itself was
rechargeable is it not the new ones not
I don't think so I mean I'm not going to
swear to that though I thought they were
all lightning supported with lightning I
don't know I also think it looks like it
had better spacing and better keys and
they did say that they worked on the key
design so it looks a bit more like what
we've seen on macbooks and as for the
magic trackpad with force touch it's a
feature I haven't used on my back for
anything actually so it's cool it works
you know I don't use safari use Chrome
and Safari sort of the highlight feature
for that I use Apple maps and that's
another place where I could use force
touch so I wouldn't upgrade to that for
that reason either like that the two you
know main reasons it seems like is the
thirty percent increase surface area and
force touch right yeah like okay yeah
but I guess at some point you have to
sort of revision your products and get
new ones out there so maybe that's all
this reason Franco just made an
interesting comment about still no
backlight on the keyboard yeah honestly
it's just thinking about that I always
turn the backlight off on my macbook
because I'm like I nope don't need to
use that much battery and yeah I if I'm
plugged in i might turn the backlight
back on but i really don't find it that
you so I'm not often in a dark room
typing you on the other hand you are
you're at events yeah I guess I always
have minor yeah but see I don't because
I live in the middle of nowhere I don't
go to a lot of it so I don't have a
whole lot of need for the backlight
right but would that be a feature you
would want on the keyboard I think so
yeah I was actually just thinking about
that when I picked it up if I could have
it on my dad
on this keyboard I probably were going
back late too and I don't know what it
is maybe it's just aesthetics like I
don't look down while I'm typing or
anything but yeah I on having more like
typing I I don't think any of us looked
at when we wrapping okay I we just had
keys and then we hold up like words
that's right so we've got like questions
coming in so we're going to jump into
some of those of course the most
important question let me find it here
it's scrolled away from here Sean the
man 34 I'm back got to ask the question
what have you returned Todd oh man
nothing yet I think I'd bought something
I have the Amazon echo we've talked
about that I actually know what I
probably would have returned the 6s plus
if I had any gumption to do so agent you
can read my review but I don't feel I
bought it your full price and I feel
like it wasn't worth that much money for
an upgrade over my 6 plus but I ended up
giving a 6 plus to my wife so it worked
out so yeah just like I i ended up fine
I what we won't go into why it happened
I ended up buying an ipad air 2 but yeah
so my mother is getting my ipad air you
know so that I was like okay she was
still using ipad 3 I was like okay we
can finally get rid of all the 30 pin
connectors except for charging my ipod
classic right but but otherwise the 30
pins are out of her lives and her ipad 3
was definitely slowing down so I was
like I'm fine and I'm I'm my battery
life on the air was starting to get a
little wonky and so this time yeah it
was time John convince me I'm gonna sell
my Nexus 5 and my one plus one just
through amazon yeah sitting in my desk
yeah and we okay so funny story about
Amazon trade-in so I'm going to trade in
my one plus one as well we're getting
really good price for it yeah so 130
bucks while I was out there I got
opportunity by a nexus 6 off Nibin our
intern he only used it for a few months
it's in great shape you know I was
thrilled and I I wanted a new phone for
when I traveled to the to England so I
was like okay yo let's see can I how
much can I get from a mega 6.3 I was
like I'll get nothing for it boom and so
I go on amazigh get all excited at first
because it looks like I'm going to get
over two hundred dollars I'm like hold
the phone okay this is fantastic then
when I got home I was like okay I went
found the box I was already I went back
I was like oh wait a minute that's two
hundred dollars for the white version
okay so I found the black version twelve
dollars and sixty-three cents what what
wait what they will give you over two
hundred dollars for the lite version
paint it you must have talked to my
mother because she said the same thing
but yeah they will they'll only give me
twelve dollars and sixty-three cents for
the black version that's obscene that is
crazy yeah I for twelve dollars and
sixty-three cents I'll just hold on to
it as a backup phone right exactly are
you two hundred dollars I this thing
would have already been out the door but
they'll almost have a limited run or
something I've it maybe I don't know
gazelle will give me 90 wait which I'm a
little I'm of that that's a little
tempting and actually folks we plan on
doing towards the holidays because
that's always a good time to trade in
your stuff we're actually going to do a
whole episode about cycling your
electronics and training them in and all
that so look forward to that see they're
going to be really interesting or really
boring it just depends but so we got a
lot of other questions coming here from
such in Baja are any of you using Apple
music or do you guys use a different
streaming service for music well
personally I did sign up for Apple music
and turned off the automatic billing too
late so I paid for a month but
generally i use pandora i like the music
discovery on it a lot and so it's just
always been my streaming service of
choice Todd I believe your Spotify I
have spotify I use Apple music i use
google play music and i pay for all of
them I don't know why and well it's
really a comes down to different devices
i'm on I'd say Spotify because you know
it's across Android stuff and then Apple
music I've actually grown to like a bit
for discovery google play already Google
play's my android and I like Google Play
on android TV and then I've just started
using Amazon Prime music because I have
the Alexa here and she just plays it you
know if I say like play this well we can
give you that one because it's included
in posits included but those are the
ones like I know I gotta cancel i'll
probably cancel google play music it's
kind of just I mean Spotify I think does
a better job don't eat that and it gets
cross platform and then I really do like
Apple music though for some things
that's so that's a lot of music
subscriptions yeah don't tell my wife
yeah that was my next step I was going
to call her later yeah what you mean she
doesn't listen to check my Buffalo show
yeah no she does not oh god no but now
that she has this 6 plus here's where
things get interesting Apple's family
plans 1499 as cheaper and Spotify family
playing some maybe I switch just to that
that's true the thing that I I on the
site when Apple music came out I still
stand by this Spotify was great for
sharing music with friends my friends
you know we'll send me a song and I'll
come in my inbox and I get to play it
that's brilliant and shared playlists
and stuff like that and that's not an
apple music so be hard to give that up
that I don't know I I don't listen to me
I listen to a lot more podcasts and
listen to music anymore so I'm like yeah
it's all free
uh let's see from Sean the man 34 with
Microsoft making a SmartWatch tablet
laptop and virtual reality do you think
we will see a Microsoft TV box product I
assume he means streaming set-top box
honestly I think Microsoft looks at the
xbox one is that I think so too that's
all I was going to say I don't see a
standalone box now I don't either I just
I I can't see them why you doing is it's
a couple hundred bucks I mean what is it
four hundred bucks now but you know they
come out with a box maybe that's like
150 they're probably going to say like
look you know why make all these
sacrifices to get down 150 bucks and you
can have sort of what they envisioned as
the the center of your home I think then
rather used by the xbox one yeah exactly
so i I just I can't see them doing a
set-top box it would be interesting but
I just I I think they're just guys I
want to keep you on the xbox one for as
long as possible ah let's see here from
such an bahal is the chromecast Audio
with the Nexus Q is supposed to be well
if anyone actually understood what the
Nexus Q was supposed to be then we can
give you a final answer then we could
give you a final answer as you all can
see in the techni Buffalo videos that
are shot out in irvine at least when
John's on the couch set you can see the
Nexus Q up on the shelf we keep it as
like a mo a memento of we really still
don't understand this thing what was
that babe honestly I believe it was
developed by Google's track and field
team because have you ever picked it up
yeah yeah i mean i remember when it was
announced and everything it's just sort
of funny that thing is freakin heavy
yeah it's huge yeah I I don't know I
honestly I don't think anyone fully
understands what the Nexus Q was
supposed to be so who knows if the
chromecast Audio is actually a
replacement Fort ya know that was one of
the oddest things ever released I like
that the chromecast Audio is so
affordable though I don't the Nexus Q is
expensive
I remember correctly yeah who knows
chromecast Audio is like 35 bucks I need
a from brazen Franco is trackpad the
trackpad is amazing especially in multi
monitor configurations but why the
increase in price of the return of the
white color the aluminum brush finish
was so much better looking I agree i
love the the brush aluminum look it
looks like the majority of their other
products why they decide what flight i
have no idea i will say that's a lot of
the reason i use the trackpad is i'm
running three monitors yeah what does it
have like a really good DP i guess or
high that's why i use a gaming mouse
yeah oh did i tell you about my third
monitor when i was out in irvine LA so I
told the guys before I went out there
that I needed you know extra meters
which they they we always have spare
monitors laying around right and so one
of the monitors I used to use we ended
up having to return to the manufacturer
because our review period was over so
they had a little tiny HP for me and
when i get there i go into yo on the
weekend get my stuff that i leave there
in the office when i'm not in town and
there is a 42 inch curved LG television
so my desk at alike ok i'm assuming this
is my second monitor you know one of my
two monitors it sure enough that was all
they had so so to my right I had a 42
inch curved LG television as a monitor
which actually I was like oh this is so
stupid that was that's always the morrow
driver and tweet that Colin going on 42
inches but then I discovered the wonders
of it when I had to edit a photo shop
photo oh that would be frustrating
though you can't see all the
imperfections it was so much easier oh I
loved it I was like I'm going to have to
fight the urge by a pretty 2 inch
television for my death
well you can see right behind me I have
a 32-inch right here and I've used it as
a monitor I did for a while as my
primary and now i just have it hooked up
to nothing it's sort of like i'll put a
chromecast and every now and then
because it was just getting too big yeah
like well when we have big event days I
do i do have a 42 inch Roku television
near my office and so all Apple all
screencast over to that for to the apple
TV and so then that way i can run chart
beat or whatever over on that monitor
right so i go to four monitors on a
first world problems folks first yeah
oops i can say actually I saw the the
question from Sean the man 34 do we play
the battles on beta I did right here I
did not get a chance comes out in irvine
ah it was awesome i loved it yeah i did
i ever did that day too yeah I uh I know
the guys in the office that had time to
play it enjoyed it I unfortunately I was
traveling so I really didn't get a
chance to play it what I saw of it is I
walked by the game room look great but
uh no Joey was talking to me about this
morning and he was saying that actually
a lot of people seem mixed on it that
there's a lot of disappointment out
there Oh interesting I hadn't read up on
other people's opinions I just sort of
playing it and was a home I like it well
apparently a lot of people had problems
with the Hoff battle yeah that would I
mean I was assuming they're gonna fix
that but it was so unbalanced yeah and
they're sailing are going to to balance
it more oh wow yeah it was hilariously
not yeah if you run the Ripper those
that don't know if you play it on the
side of the rebels although I mean I
have to say if you all seen the movie
right yeah yeah this should not exactly
be an easy fight right out for the
rebels but uh okay let's see here from
such and bahal hey Sean I know that Todd
would rather buy the nexus 5x over the
Nexus 6p funny you should bring that up
but which would you choose and why I
have the page open i was just talking
shut up buying it before the show right
before the show Todd was say her go Oh
should I get if I pakshe get 6p yeah
well I'm still I'm still bullish on the
five accidents I mean for pricing and
then the camera is still great and all
that that's why I think the 5x is better
by bit yeah I mean if I had just bought
the Nexus 6 off of NIV and I I might be
tempted by the 6p but I still either way
the whole thing for me is a lot of times
my now that I'm a t-mobile customer i
want the Wi-Fi calling because I get no
signal in my house so I have to buy
t-mobile branded phones because for
whatever reason they can't add Wi-Fi
calling to a phone that you didn't buy
from them as you can see I really
believe this so unfortunately I'm kind
of stuck yeah but I never gave me a
great price on this nexus 6 so I'm like
whoo hoo I can use it with my three
account which by the way i had my first
experience with cutting down a sim card
yes slightly nerve-racking I imagine I
wouldn't have never gone that way I
think he went from you go from
microcenter nano SIM from micro dinnae
know I've only gone up with adapters or
and a lot of phones um well not to leave
the same so I feel like if you if I had
the I think the g4 might still be micro
sim in any case you could put the Nano
in and as long as you kind of finagle it
right and get it just right it takes
like five tries dollars yeah well the
the mega 6.3 was micro and that's why i
picked up a micro sim from three when i
bought it and so we I cut down I got
adapters and all that stuff now I'm just
like a butt yo your eye like checked it
three times two HR okay it's perfectly
lined up here goes nothing here goes
nothing because it will be nothing if it
doesn't work oh good goodness gracious
from Shaun the man 34 any word on the
new Apple TV pre-ordered date not yet no
I saw what was it a rumor I think
recently was first week in november if
i'm not mistaken i don't have enough in
front of me but I wrote the article i
think it was first week
they were saying and an ipad pro 2
because both are expected in November so
maybe or it could have been last week of
October for the Apple TV in any case i'm
waiting just as much as everybody else
for that thing i'm excited for it cause
really excited for it I don't want to
get ahead of myself because then i might
just return it as we all know there's
one reason why I'm sorry the apple TV
horrible hate that thing but it's like
for those listening at home I held up
the current Apple TV remote from brazen
Franco what's up with ms now forcing
everyone on 7 8 and 8.1 to upgrade to 10
with no opt-out option how is this not
violation of the Computer Fraud and
Abuse Act I have not heard about this uh
yeah we wrote it up earlier today
Killian did so ok I haven't had a chance
to go back and read his post they're not
forcing it yeah that's the story they're
forcing up to Windows 10 and my guess
and I have no idea how they could you
know tell people what to do with their
systems especially I mean this is
assuming that this system supports it
too because they can't just you know
force everybody right I have a computer
that I try putting windows sent on now
it's that one hundred and forty dollar
net book I bought last unit kept talking
about the show now it's just rock but
anyway my guess is that they're going to
run into issues with that you know
supported hardware and to the way I'm
guessing we can get around something
like a violation of a law is to say that
this is safer than the other software so
like if they're patching something that
would be open but I don't know how else
they'd get around it
that see here's the thing so you're
going to tell enterprises oh I don't
think they can do this enterprise
there's no way they can do this
enterprise but now I know my parents
desktop I know I'm going to get a phone
call at any moment Sean John John and I
turned on the desktop could test stop I
I don't shun it won't it's telling me I
have to upgrade shawn says 10 let me
read you the whole pop-up window no I
don't need you know I let me ring the
whole ha 2000 man sounds like my parents
yeah anytime anything happens on the
computer that they don't have a hundred
percent understanding of it Oh comes
right here oh yeah it's it's a great
time oh good good grief from such a
Mahal which OS do you guys use the most
and why and what do you use each for
great question because I'm solo OS at
this point and you're still dual OS yeah
I i use mac only that came and I know
I've told the story before so I'll be
quick I I was windows only for 20-some
years and after I even with running
antivirus having all sorts of safeguards
on it I was getting tired of every two
weeks having to spend a Saturday night
cleaning my system of viruses and
malware and adware and everything else
and I came into an opportunity at
through a situation that I had some
extra cash and I was like that's it i'm
buying an imac let's see what happens i
bought an imac and I've not looked back
I have not spent one Saturday night
cleaning this thing and you know also
the fact that my imac is a 2011 and i
can't remem to somebody to take my
buffalo about this the other day i think
it was you if i had a windows machine on
my desk you know that purchase in 2011
it would be a rock by now good luck yeah
true you know
so why always stayed away from Max
because of the the high initial price
I'm starting to because believe me I was
a Mac cater for a lot of years I'll
minute and I still I I do see the uses
of Windows my parents still use windows
so I do still dive into the OS every so
often but in general i'm just a lot
happier Mac it's made my life a lot
simpler now you I know still use both I
do I have my windows computer right next
nice desktop box that I built in 2012 so
that just goes to show it's not plugged
in i mean it needs upgrades throughout
so i'll be back on that otherwise i've
been using surface pro 3 but that's only
when I'm sort of out working and I need
something really light to carry because
i have this macbook hook up to all the
monitors and everything like that so i
got it's kind of like docked in a way
it's all hooked up so i don't unplug it
that often and then i also have like i
was saying windows 10 notebook that i've
been using for a while it was 8.1 but
now it's 10 and now it's just kind of
dead so i'm actually on the lookout for
either a chrome OS device though or a
another affordable Windows 10 Prague and
I know a lot of these manufacturers came
out with them recently so i'll probably
check on Emma I think ideally and I've
talked about the show the smallest thing
I can get that functions is probably the
one off by like with a good keyboard
good trackpad and I can do work from so
whether it's a tablet with a keyboard
and it's chrome or something similar
with Windows that's that's my next
purchase yeah well but I know you'd say
I'm on Mac I guess now because my
desktop needs to be upgraded Godwin yeah
no I know that feeling oh let's see what
else do we got here we got a little
stuff from Eddie Raymond I believe I'm
sorry if I mispronounced that what do
you expect from the new 1 plus X I think
it'll make phone call yeah it sounds
like kind of a relatively mid-range
device and lower costs and one close to
you I guess my problem going into this
is I wasn't that impressed with 1 plus 2
so I
have huge high hopes for 1 plus X I know
it's going to be you know not as
colorful wasn't one plus two but I guess
rumor has it maybe NFC and stuff like
that which is going to say left out of
their flagship for whatever reason but I
don't know it's not gonna it's not
really high on my radar oh that's gonna
be so bizarre that thing as NFC yeah
we'll see I I'm gonna be like if it was
the biggest complaint we all had about
the oneplus 2 and then they go put it in
a mid-range phone maybe we don't need
you who knows maybe that's a really do
not know just it's like I it's my
modeling like okay maybe your consumers
didn't want it but you know that Android
pay was on the radar like what like
that's a highlight feature now that
Google is touted like why wouldn't you
add that so now your consumers can't use
android pay like what I don't get it I
don't know uh from shauna man 34 is
techno Buffalo going to the Star Wars
premiere ok I'll quickly explain how
much work okay so yes we know the date
of the the premier now is Monday
December 14th now typically when we have
been invited to premieres we don't get
the invites till seven to ten days
beforehand so we will not know until
like december for that the earliest that
being said John and I are hopeful but we
are not holding our breaths for this one
this is going to be the hottest ticket
in Hollywood in years so oh the the
chances of technobuffalo getting in
while we would love it we would be
honored we would be thrilled we're not
holding our breath that being said also
there is some debate about who will be
plus one some people in the irvine
office think it will be them i think i
have explained to them I'll tell you who
later I have explained to them that
there will they will be turned into a
grease spot yeah they obviously don't
listen to techno Buffalo show that they
will they will suffer severe bodily harm
and all John would say is I'm not
involved you all figure it out I was
like you are or was he uh uh yeah
there's been some debate but so we'd
love to go we just don't know yet and
again we're we're not holding our
breaths hey we would love it but we're
not holding our breath oh let's see here
from such an Mahal do you think Google
would ever release a more expensive
chromecast that would be like forty nine
dollars or so and run android TV
essentially making a direct competitor
Amazons fire TV stick I don't see why
not I like to see it I think if they
were going to do what they would have
done it that that's the thing I I think
it would have already happened right
because and then they're also
undercutting the nexus player which to
me is sort of just like a proof of
concept so manufacturers like Nvidia and
others to make shield TV and stuff but I
don't know like why would the nexus
player exist if they have a $49 Android
TV but at the same time Amazon's done
the same with the fire TV in the fire TV
stick Roku's done the same for Roku's
roku TV stick oh I know I just yeah well
I know add sliced yeah i agree i think
if they were going to do it they would
have already done it yeah yeah they
could leave it open I don't know it's
gonna be interest it would be interested
but we'll see yeah the difference I'd
say is that Roku and Amazon those guys
don't already have I mean you know
google has the chromecast and then they
have their so like the chromecast is
there stick so why create this third
middle product I don't know yeah uh from
could con I believe do you think one
plus our reduction in the demand of one
plus two and they changed the buying
procedure so early probably probably I
mean we we have zero info on that but um
hey you could say either that or you
could say that they've learned their
lessons about production I don't think
they might there
since I i I'm trying to give them the
benefit of the doubt and be nice I you
play devil's head good at all potential
yeah because I look so much like an
angel you know I I would say that's
probably a sound theory but again we
have no information whatsoever we don't
we know that they did run into
manufacturing trouble and I think you
know maybe they change things because
look you have motorola with new phones
out you have a lot of other
manufacturers releasing low-cost phones
new Nexus is are out now they don't want
consumers going elsewhere they want
consumer still buying those one pluses
so I think that's why they're your
tuning with them I see a lot of people
uploading a question about what
keyboards and mice we use if you go if
what what's the show's over go back
folks we talked about that before that
question came in it's a decent question
but we actually just answered in normal
chit chat so we're going to end with a
couple off topic questions real quick
and just let's see here from Sean the
man 34 I have a feeling this is based on
the fact that every time i go to irvine
i tweet about being at disneyland
favorite right at disneyland hands down
no questions whatsoever haunted mansion
yeah I if they were so busy it when I
went in July there was like no lines I
was like got off and on six times in a
row no wait I waited 55 minutes for the
Haunted Mansion yeah yeah so I only got
one right in uh let's see wait we just
had a question come from a distant I was
excited for the windows phone but now to
find out that it's only going to be on
eighteen t if it doesn't sell well do
you think they will release it for other
carriers I'm on t-mobile now it's
usually the other way around yeah it is
another case yeah wait was it was it the
windows phones that we have that mass
confusion that first day
because a unnamed Microsoft executive
yes it's not an AT&amp;amp;T exclusive with AT&amp;amp;T
is the only carrier so far to say that
they'll carry the phone in other words
AT&amp;amp;T other carriers keep carried if they
want to and so far there hasn't been
announcements from other carriers and I
think that's the point of this the
answer here if it sells well I think
other carriers might pick it up if it
doesn't sell well I don't think you'll
see it picked up on other carriers and I
think the plan now and remember that's
only in a Lumia 950 the XL is still up
in the air 9 50 s at AT&amp;amp;T so you'd have
to buy it unlocks from Microsoft yeah I
I'm gonna guys if it really paints
itself it's going to be eighteen t and
that's it unfortunately i really wonder
who that microsoft executive wasn't if
anyone ever figured it out because he
caused mass chaos that day i did hear
who said it but yeah it was misquoted
okay cool uh we're gonna end on it for
such an has asked this question for a
couple weeks writing I've never gotten
to it so let me pull it up here off
topic what new and returning shows are
you guys watching this TV season also
have a view guys watched mr. robot it's
almost like watch dogs the game turned
into a TV show I've heard nothing but
glowing praise for mr. robot but I've
not had a chance to check it out yet I
haven't seen it either um new and
returning shows I don't know we don't
have long enough to list some of the
shows i watch and the shows i watch your
really boring I i watch arrow flash
agents of shield let's see what else do
i watch I'm a long time survivor and
amazing race fan I really got into I
zombie last season that was I've never

a comic book background I just thought
