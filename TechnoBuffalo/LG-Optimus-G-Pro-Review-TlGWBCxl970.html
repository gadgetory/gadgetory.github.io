TechnoBuffalo here and I've got a full
review for you of the Big Daddy on the
block this is LG's latest the optimus G
pro brings a 5.5 inch green a pretty
baller processor in specs to the board
let's go ahead put it through its paces
and see if this is the right giant phone
for your hopefully big pocket let's get
started let me start off this review as
I do all reviews now with a disclaimer I
use this phone as my daily driver for
nine days and used it on and off in
between for about five days in between
so I got a chance to know the phone
pretty well so before I get the specs
and screen all ours the goodness let's
just start with call quality doesn't
make good phone calls it's just not
gonna be good for you I am testing the
18 T unit there's an unlocked version
available as well it's got a crazy
antenna for TV stuff we've got the AT&amp;amp;T
version on I know the AT&amp;amp;T network
around here pretty well and it was as
good as any other AT&amp;amp;T phone I didn't
have any drop calls throughout my nine
days testing actually which is getting
to be more and more commonplace the 4G
to HSPA+ and dropped down to education
was very smooth that's usually where I
have to drop calls didn't have anything
here as well my antenna was pretty
strong it was bad on part every other
phone one thing that wasn't overly
awesome was a speakerphone to rely a lot
on speakerphone for conference calls or
if you're hard of hearing I guess
they're gonna want to bring an external
speaker or just plugging something into
the 3.5 millimeter headset jack alright
so let me remind you of the specs that
are in the optimus G pro and it's got um
in spades just a weird expression don't
know why it happened in spades but it
does and it's got a lot of them so let's
go ahead and start with this here screen
it is a 5.5 inch screen putting it on
par same screen size at least with the
Galaxy Note 2 and it is a full 1080p
screen Ventura separates itself from the
Galaxy Note 2 so it's 1920 by 1080 it's
nineteen twenties a long way by 1080 the
short way which gives it a PP of 401 Oh
make that PPI of 401 so it's got 401 PPI
s it's a lot of bps operating systems
being powered by Android 4.1 but we
should see a 4.2 upgrade maybe a 4.3
sometime soon but at least no you got
4.1 right out of the box from AT&amp;amp;T
so powering this guy is a pretty
Beasley Snapdragon 600 chip which gives
it 1.7 gigahertz on quad core so plenty
fast we'll talk a lot about speed as we
go through the phone but you can
probably guess this is not a slow device
so it's got to be to ram on board 32
gigs of storage it's got plenty of space
for you
external storage space as well with
microSD card so you can up that sucker
right on up on the back we've got a 13
megapixel camera which is pretty nice on
the front we have a 2.1 megapixel
shooter for taking all your photos a
Wi-Fi a total of an ABG nn if you're one
of the few that's got something that
uses AC you are out of luck you are
stuck with n but most things read
nowadays so keep that in mind though if
you want something that's going to be
fastest Wi-Fi protocol the next two
years as guy does not have AC built in a
battery you'd expect to phone this Vic
they have a pretty beastly battery and
you'd be correct it's got a 30 140
milliamp hour battery and we'll talk
plenty about battery as we move forward
it's got NFC Bluetooth 4.0 and the rest
that good stuff you'd expect IR remote
built-in as well for you controlling
your TV there's some software it does
that I'm not gonna run through that in
the review but if want to control your
TV with your phone you can alright so
you know what's packed into the guy
let's go talk about all the hardware
stuff and run through it so this phone
really to me feels very Galaxy Note 2's
or very samsung asked which means it's
got a plastic removable back it does
feel pretty high-quality though it
doesn't feel cheap by any stretch of the
imagination
if you've used a samsung device and you
like that build quality it's gonna feel
almost identical for what LG has done
here on the Optimus G pro one issue I
had at the phone the home button is
crazy narrow not to say I couldn't push
it every time and I was able to do that
but just bothered me how narrow it was
it's probably a personal issue you
compare it to the home button on the
Galaxy Note 2 you can definitely see a
difference in the size I preferred the
larger home button the note 2 as opposed
to the super narrow one on the optimus G
pro but the G pro does have a little bit
of a secret
it's got glowy LED lights around the
home button which I kind of like so
different things will glow different
color so you can know what's coming it's
kind of any trick I should even notice
it so I had the phone in the dark oh
look at that it's doing a disco also
when icings has is a memo button on the
side I thought it might be a dedicated
camera button when you hit that memo
button you get access to all kinds of
memo features and I'll talk about that
and we get to software but I do like
hard buttons for stuff and this one
definitely had them so hardware was
actually relatively impressive and of
course removable battery
to pop at an extra one if you like and
if you decide to buy the korean models
actually gonna come with two batteries
u.s. one is only gonna come with one so
did that for what it's worth
alright next let's talk about screen and
the phone like this it's pretty much all
about the screen
sweet sweet 1080p action on a 5.5 inch
screen something I hadn't seen before
I really enjoyed it I absolutely loved
the screen on this phone it was hard to
see in direct sunlight though as often
times it is this one was especially
washed out even with brightness kicked
all the way up it became difficult to
see when I was outside on the super
bright Southern California day I kind of
had to do do a little bit of this action
but it wasn't the worst I've seen just
be aware of it when you go outside so
this is as I mentioned a 1080p screen
didn't look as sharp as other new 1080p
phones the HTC One Galaxy S well it's
probably due to the larger size same
added pixel as those phones but just
spread out by no means does it look bad
it just wasn't as sharp and crisp
I don't really impressive as those other
screens but it still looked really good
and definitely better than say they're
720p screen on the Galaxy Note 2 and as
it expects games text pictures video all
look awesome on a screen size like this
especially that resolution LG has done a
really nice job with their screens it's
kind of a culmination of it getting one
this high resolution this big can be
difficult they really did a nice job
everything is crystal clear there's no
pixelation on pictures or tasks with
text videos games all just look
beautiful on the screen so hey thumbs up
the LG alright next let's talk about
speed and I'm not gonna talk that much
about speed as you could expect with the
1.7 gigahertz quad-core processor 2 gigs
ram this is by no means a slow phone I'm
not gonna show you how quickly it opens
up apps because it opens up apps fast it
doesn't really qualify as tests anymore
at least for modern smartphones I'll
open up fast multitasking was very quick
I didn't have to close any applications
everything just roared and roared along
quite nice but because I know you guys
want to know the quadrant score of this
phone was eleven thousand eight hundred
and fifty eight I know what quadrants
not the most thorough test but is the
same benchmark that I used in all the
videos you can keep an apples-to-apples
type comparison pun intended
alright let's go from speed talk about
software LG's done a lot here so again
Android 4.1 out of the box with LG's
software skin on top of it I think they
did a really nice job with the skin one
of the things that surprised me I liked
and I
we have this when I install third-party
launchers please rotate it when you
rotate screen the rotate with you which
is really nice to have a totally
landscape version the operating system
it's a little thing one thing I really
appreciated so when the other things
LG's done really nice the qslide app so
you pull down the slider you have
several applications you can launch on
top of each other I found the calculator
when actually to be really helpful in
calendar and you can go ahead and launch
another application you could have one
behind it and you can go ahead and move
to Windows about each other just made
life really easy even to have more than
two going at the same time it just was a
great way to multitask my didn't he does
about you can make one transparent or
one not it was just a great way to see a
lot of information so hats off to LG for
that they really did a nice job with
implementation and it was very smooth
and didn't affect performance at all
which again it was also quite nice I
will say though with the qslide apps
hopefully we'll get third-party support
there isn't any out there right now and
aren't that many qslide apps that work
but certainly if gets third-party
support and more come certainly the
benefit behind them can totally increase
but did like you know they used multiple
apps the same time that was quite nice
another feature that I really like a
quick memo you can access that if you
want also by the drop-down or it just
hit the quick memo button what the lets
you do is actually draw on the screen
with whatever you're doing you don't
have a built-in stylus here I'll let you
do with the galaxy note lines of phone
so you gotta use your finger or he can
pick up a capacitive stylus but it
worked well it's a cool way just to
doodle on the screens all kinds of other
things you can do with it make it look
like a pen or a pencil or thickness of
it change the color or erase it you can
send stuff off to friends actually found
it useful when doing maps I was able to
circle locations and send it out to
myself but now I want to see I only used
it that one time just to try it I don't
know how useful would actually be in
daily application it was more of like -
hey cool look at my phone can do kind of
thing when you're showing friends I also
really like how many apps you're able to
squeeze inside of the apt or when you
show them all I mean you could just see
it on apps usually you have to do a
launcher and do kind of custom stuff for
that but right out of box I was able to
see just a ton of applications which
reduce my scrolling which I was always
very happy about
and speaking of launchers I really liked
what LG did with theirs I didn't
download a third-party launcher usually
I'm a pretty big fan of Apex Launcher
but I kept it stock which kind of made
me feel a little weird but again I think
LD did in this job so I gave it a fair
shot the built-in keyboard that LG
equipped with this was a big quirky it
didn't always respawn Barbeau I didn't
like to lay on but the nice thing your
Android if you don't like a keyboard you
can download a myriad of other options
including now the default Google keep
so a ton of keyboard options that one's
not really a gripe since it can be super
easily fixed emotes you download your
own keyboards anyway but if you don't
download drunk you but needs to be aware
you might have some quirks on yours as
well all right now let's move on to
camera we got a 13 megapixel shooter on
the back they did a really nice job with
a combination of camera on the camera
software the software is really
intuitive the buttons are big on screen
this big it expect easy to find be able
to control pretty much everything on
there I will say the images were a bit
warmer than I expected otherwise they
are really great it's what you'd expect
my 13 megapixel camera that wasn't
admittedly I'm not the biggest camera
guy Brandon covered our cameras you know
at length pictures look great to me but
there's on the phone or on a computer
they just looked good I didn't think
anything about it I didn't think well I
was like all for those look absolutely
exceptional it's certainly not DSLR
quality but it's a great camera phone
picture so take that forever it's worth
alright so now let's talk about battery
it's got a 3,140 milliamp hour battery
on a screen this big yeah you might not
think the best battery life and you
might be right so let me talk you
through my daily usage did you
understand how I use a phone please put
my battery score into context take it
off the charger usually around 7:00 7:30
a.m. I've got about an hour and a half
to two hours of phone calls for most of
the day it's connected to Wi-Fi either
at home or at the office a lot of
texting a lot of social media stuff goes
on here I've got it pulling down to mess
to inbox is syncing about every 5
minutes doing some games on here I'm
watching certainly a lot of YouTube
video on here as well by the end of the
day when I plug it in around 11:00 11:30
I'm down to about 20 to 30% which puts
it about 5 to 10 percent off of where I
am for most other phones I've tested so
I'm able to get through a whole day
without any issue which is really my
goal I plugged my phone in at night but
for the kind of person wants to go 2
days you're not gonna be able to do that
here unless you get a second battery but
if you plug it in every day you're gonna
be fine I don't turn my brightness on
auto brightness either I keep it at
about 80% the way I like it
so if I change that I'm sure I could get
more about your life out of it but
adjust your uses accordingly you'll be
able to get a whole day but just be
aware that's not gonna have through
blazing 3 4 or 5 or day or week long
battery life it's really no fun at this
point offers so what's the final verdict
on the lg optimus G pro it gets a very
solid eight point five to me it felt a
lot like a Galaxy Note 2 point 5
I'd offer it a little bit more than the
note
you had a really the screen is the big
deal here oh she's had the stylus
built-in like a note to does about it's
a really solid performer I love big
screen phones aren't that many options
out there if I was to walk her to an
AT&amp;amp;T store today to look at a 5.5 inch
phone I would hands down to pick the lg
optimus G pro over the notes too but the
big thing here is the note 2 might be
old news in a few months the note 3 is
supposedly just around the corner in the
October time frame so if you think you
might want to wait a few months to see
what comes out you might be better off
surd but if you want to get the best a
big screen phone today the lg optimus G
pro is gonna be a great choice thank you
