TechnoBuffalo here with an unboxing of
the Palm Pre - this is a sequel many
years in the making but perhaps not the
sequel people were looking for this is
the GSM unlocked version let's go ahead
and break the seal so the Palm Pre 2 is
gonna come in two flavors right now it
has an unlocked version which will work
when the ATT's 3G network or t-mobile's
edge network in the US only available
unlocked and it's gonna cost you just
about $500 there hasn't been a US
carrier release on the GSM size however
it's widely assuming that Verizon
Wireless is going to carry the pre 2 on
the CDMA side go ahead and use the big
ol knife to break this seal here go
ahead and hack on into that comes in a
very big box what I assume they're going
to be a small phone it will run through
all the specs here once I can dig it out
there we go so that's not the most
eco-friendly packaging here is the palm
free to box go ahead and push that off
to the side let's go ahead and run
through what to expect on this guy
so it's got very similar form factor to
the Palm Pre in the Palm Pre Plus 3.1
inch touchscreen the resolution of 320
by 480 this guy does have webOS 2.0 it's
got a upgraded and one gigahertz
processor five megapixel camera with LED
flash and it's got Wi-Fi B&amp;amp;G no in here
is anywhere to be found unfortunately
you know palm made a fantastic offering
system with webOS I think it's one of
the best operating systems around those
are gonna come to multitasking but it's
hard to experience the goodness if you
will of the OS when its hampered by
really really crappy hardware like we
saw I believe on the pre and the pre
plus it was really last generation stuff
that was released in a present
generation market so we'll see if the
pre two sort of fixes that and makes it
a very enjoyable experience using an
excellent operating system then pull off
the
little plastic sleeve here see we can do
that it's always harder than it looks if
I can push this guy out there we go
so Palm Pre - there's a little bit of
plastic here to break and there is
indeed it'll bust out the knife again
and cut this open hopefully this is
gonna work yep all right let's go ahead
and dig into this guy I have not seen
one of these yet in person I will say
just right now the first bat looks very
similar to the original Palm Pre so a
lot of people thought the Palm Pre - is
what the pre plus should have been see
what else we're going to get in the box
I do like Palms packaging that's where
that hard plastic shell lift it up and
you've got all of your documentation
pull that back I guess lift that thing
up and there should be some there's
another tab to pull there should be some
sort of accessories in there which there
are indeed we've got pull it out stereo
headphones with mic we've got a very
small wall to USB cable in there which
not want to come out I'll fight for it
there we go and we've got your micro USB
charging cable and that's about it
inside the box all right so enough of
the accessories let's take a look at the
phone itself here is the Palm Pre - and
on first blush it feels very similar cut
to the pretty plus it's got the
touchstone inductive charging back let's
go ahead and slide this up and see if
the keyboard looks like looks almost
identical here to the older version
let's see if it feels any different the
keys do have a bit more feel and throw
to them it's got sort of now the soft
touch of rubber sides this would be a
bit harder to feel on the screen well
I've definitely very dusty is now a made
of Gorilla Glass couldn't push that off
let's bring in the Palm Pre Plus and see
if you guys can tell a difference if I
pull off this plastic here very very
very hard to tell which ones which
especially if I take them off camera mix
them up and put
back on first blush you're gonna have a
hard time telling other than maybe from
a dust factor here that this is a pre to
really the way to tell is by that rubber
lip around it so I'm gonna use this guy
for for a little while what you guys
know what I think you know we'll power
it on and do the whole Web OS boot up
and see what this thing looks like and
sort of see me right there hello
it's got the mirror on the back there's
the camera and you know what you guys
know if this is gonna be a worthwhile
investment it's certainly not a cheap
phone I have to get since it is only
available unlocked but it doesn't tie
you into a contract so I know there are
a lot of palm fans out there I'm John
Breton German TechnoBuffalo and I'll
just give you guys a tour of webOS 2.0
in an upcoming video bye bye
one thing I didn't want to show is this
guy's booting up we've gone through a
handycam gorilla salad here I wanted to
give you guys a quick tour of the device
which are emitted in that first unboxing
so on the left hand side you got volume
up and down and the phone does feel very
nice in the hand and sort of round a
pebble s feel like it's prompting me to
put in a SIM card on the right hand side
there's the micro USB charging port a
bottom we've got microphone on the top
you've got the profile switcher to make
go from vibrate to ring and a 3.5
millimeter headset jack guys now I
really will see you the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
