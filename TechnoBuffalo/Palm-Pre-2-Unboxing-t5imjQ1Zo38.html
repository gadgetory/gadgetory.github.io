technobuffalo here with an unboxing of
the palm pre 2 this is a sequel many
years in the making but perhaps not the
sequel people were looking for this is a
gsm unlocked version let's go ahead and
break the seal so the palm pre 2 is
going to come in two flavors right now
it has an unlocked version which will
work on the eighties 3g network or
t-mobile's edge network in the u.s. only
available unlocked and it's going to
cross you just about five hundred
dollars there hasn't been a US carrier
release on the gsm size however it's
widely assumed that Verizon Wireless is
going to carry the pre to on the CDMA
side go ahead and use the big ol knife
to break the seal here go ahead and hack
on into that comes in a very big box
what I assume they're going to be a
small phone it will run through all the
specs here once I can dig it out there
we go so that's not the most
eco-friendly packaging here is the palm
pre to box go ahead and push that off to
the side let's go ahead and run through
what to expect on this guy so it's gone
very similar form factor to the palm pre
in the palm pre plus three point one
inch touchscreen the resolution of
320x480 this guy does have webos 2.0
it's got a upgraded 1 gigahertz
processor 5 megapixel camera with LED
flash and it's got Wi-Fi BMG no in here
is anywhere to be found unfortunately
you know palm made a fantastic operating
system with webos I think it's one of
the best operating systems around those
are going to come to multitasking but
it's hard to experience the goodness if
you will of the US and its hampered by
really really crappy hardware like we
saw I believe on the pre and the pre
plus and there's really last generation
stuff that was released in a present
generation market so we'll see if the
pre to sort of fixes that it makes it a
very enjoyable experience using an
excellent operating system then pull off
the
a little plastic sleeve here see we can
do that it's always harder than it looks
like and push this guy out there we go
so palm pre 2 there's a little bit of
plastic here to break and there is
indeed so bust out the knife again and
cut this open hopefully this is going to
work there we go alright let's go ahead
and dig into this guy I have not seen
one of these yet in person I will say
just right now the first bat looks very
similar to the original palm pre so a
lot of people thought the palm pre 2 is
what the pre plus should have been see
what else were going to get in the Box I
do like palms packaging guts or that
hard plastic shell lift it up and you've
got all of your documentation pull that
back I guess lift that thing up and
there should be some was another tab to
pull there should be some sort of
accessories in there which there are
indeed we've got pull it out stereo
headphones with mic we've got a very
small wall to USB cable in there which
not want to come out I'll fight for it
there we go and we've got your micro USB
charging cable that's about it inside
the box all right so enough of the
accessories let's take a look at the
phone itself here is the palm pre 2 and
on first blush it feels very similar to
the pre plus it's got the touchstone
inductive charging back let's go ahead
and slide this up and see if the
keyboard looks like looks almost
identical here to the older version see
if it feels any different the keys do
have a bit more fuel and throw to them
it's got sort of now the soft touch
rubber site this would be a bit harder
to feel on the screen well evidently
very dusty is now made of Gorilla Glass
going to push that off let's bring in
the palm pre plus and see if you guys
can tell a difference if I pull off this
plastic here very very very hard to tell
which ones which especially if I take
them off camera mix them up
and put them back on first blush you're
going to have a hard time telling other
maybe from a dust factor here that this
is a pre to really the way to tell is by
that rubber lip around it so I'm going
to use this guy for for a little while
once you guys know what I think you know
will power it on and do the whole web OS
boot up and see what this thing looks
like sort of see me right there hello
it's got the mirror on the back there's
the camera and you know what you guys
know if this is going to be a worthwhile
investment it's certainly not a cheap
phone I have to get since it is only
available unlocked but it doesn't tie
you into a contract so I know there are
a lot of palm fans out there i'm jon
rettinger and technobuffalo and i'll
give you guys a tour of webos to point
out in an upcoming video bye bye one
thing I didn't want to show is this guy
is booting up we've gone through a
handycam gorilla salad here I want to
give you guys a quick tour of the device
which I a mitad in that first unboxing
so on the left hand side got volume up
and down and the phone does feel very
nice in the hand and sort of round a
pebble esque feel as quest like it's
prompted me to put in the sim card on
the right hand side there's the micro
USB charging port a bottom we've got
microphone on the top you've got the
profile switcher to make go from
vibrator ring and a 3.5 millimeter
headset jack and our guys now I really
will see you the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
