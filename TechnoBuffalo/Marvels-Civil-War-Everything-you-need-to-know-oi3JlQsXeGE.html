to you by the LG OLED TV not a new TV a
new category television with Marvel
Cinematic Universe in full swing you
might be feeling a little bit
overwhelmed and I understand if we're
gonna take care of that for you I'm mark
Pearson over TechnoBuffalo and in case
you missed it this is Marvel Civil War
fair warning there are mondo spoilers
ahead so just so you know if you haven't
read if you haven't seen any of you
vendors movies I'm just going to assume
that if you're watching this you're
watching this because you're trying to
get this information so let's start in
the beginning after a giant breakout at
Rikers Island prison the new warriors
they're a ragtag group of kind of
greener heroes they decided to take on
one of the most lethal villains that had
escaped from Rikers nitro the human
explosion was hiding out in Stamford
Connecticut with some other c-list
villains the New Warriors decided it was
their time shine so they set out to take
down nitro and his sort of ad-hoc crew
oh and did I mention the New Warriors
were the subject of their own reality
series at the time and that the entire
raid was being televised to the entire
country in an effort to boost their
ratings when challenged by the New
Warriors in Stamford Connecticut named
Morita of the New Warriors taunted nitro
relentlessly which caused him to
detonate himself killing most of the New
Warriors and hundreds of civilians in
the process including a nearby
elementary school the nation erupted
much like nitro into a crusade to urge
superheroes to take responsibility by
forcing them to publicly unmask
themselves the superhero Registration
Act quickly became law and spurred even
more outcry against heroes in fact not
only was the Human Torch assaulted but
he was the night of bank loan can you
even believe that shield then went after
Steve Rogers Captain America to enlist
his help in urging heroes to unmask but
cap wanted nothing to do with it on the
other hand Tony Stark was already in the
limelight more often than not as Iron
Man so he had no issue stepping up and
working with the government the first
heroes to be captured and prosecuted
were the Young Avengers they were
eventually rescued by an undercover cap
and Falcon and they were recruited into
the fold of the resistance these kinds
of interactions continued to ripple
throughout the Marvel Universe hanging
in the balance
right now is old Peter Parker before all
this happened Spiderman was actually
just in the middle of recovering
from one of the worst arcs in comic book
history the other he needed a new suit
before Civil War began Peter Parker was
approached by Tony Stark and offered one
of the coolest spider suits of all time
the iron spider the iron spider is
exactly what it sounds like a spider-man
suit made by Tony Stark it was awesome
Peter now had a heads up display three
mechanical spider arms and just a
plethora of new abilities thanks to his
new suit this is how tony was able to
convince Peter to be the next hero to
publicly unmasked which he did in an
effort to earn back some of the public
interest after that catastrophe in
Connecticut as you might have guessed
not every hero group was interested in
cooperating though after Tony Stark met
with the x-men Emma Frost explained that
unmasking and hunting heroes was just
something that totally went against
everything they stood for and politely
declined this spurred a few new
offshoots of groups that could operate
in a covert fashion keeping them from
being discovered tracked or associated
with their true identities the most
notable of these is the Secret Avengers
which cap then went on to start and this
would be the group that would eventually
morph into the sort of black ops
offshoot of the true vendors that we
know today the Secret Avengers continued
operations until they were alerted to a
chemical plant fire that had many
innocents inside this turned out to be a
plan by Iron Man though to lure the
secret Avengers together into a trap
Iron Man offered Captain America one
last chance to register camp responded
by disabling Iron Man's armor and thus
began the melee this battle is one of
the most brutal that we've seen in the
Marvel Universe in a long time as Iron
Man beat the hell out of Captain America
Thor who had been notably absent ass of
late reappeared magically on the Perot
registration side and went to town on
the Secret Avengers ultimately murdering
a hero by the name of Goliath
the former Giant Man Thor turned out to
be a clone though with a mechanical
hammer that happened to go haywire with
the actual Thor's whereabouts still
unknown even though it caused many
anti-registration here us to reconsider
Goliath's murder caused the pro
registration group to hemorrhage
supporters this fired up Iron Man even
more so he put together a new team of
Thunderbolts consisting of some of
Marvel's most ruthless villains
eventually the fighting between heroes
took to Times Square where the damage
was unprecedented not unlike the attacks
on New York by the Chitauri want to take
a quick break here to talk about our
sponsor LG we have been using the LG
OLED TV here in the office for a little
while now and actually didn't hands-on
with it it is one of the best TVs I have
seen to my eyes it's an OLED TV which
means the blacks are really nice and
deep and dark and rich that means those
pixels aren't getting lit up so you're
seeing actual true blacks which is a
really big deal the picture quality is
fantastic it's a 4k display so watching
4k stuff from YouTube from Netflix you
name it it's all really really sharp and
nice big crisp clean colors not to
mention the viewing angles are just
fantastic it's a nice big curved display
so it doesn't really matter where you're
standing in the room it's gonna look
awesome these guys have been great and
this TV is fantastic you can go and
check out all the information on the
site and definitely make sure you check
out that hands-on and just remember it's
not just a regular old new TV it's a new
category of television think about that
in the first Avengers movie in terms of
severity as cap was about to finish off
Iron Man he was tackled to the ground
and gave him enough repose to reconsider
his position he stood up unmasked and
surrendered
unfortunately on his way to his
arraignment he was shot dead on the
steps of the courthouse this sets up the
following arc which would focus on who
would take up the mantle of Captain
America which is another great art to
read by Ed Brubaker the nice thing about
the Marvel Cinematic Universe is that
the first Avengers already laid the
groundwork for a civil war the world
hasn't been quite the same since then
and I'm really excited to see how they
sparked the flames that ignite one of
the biggest writs in the history of the
Marvel Universe now this is not entirely
comprehensive this is intended for you
to help you understand what happened and
maybe give you enough of a taste to go
and check it out for yourself it really
is worth a read and some of the side
books are pretty good too but certainly
not all of them don't read every single
thing that says Civil War on it I'm
already planning on taking a look at the
Winter Soldier in this series and the
infinity war so those will definitely be
happening a lot more often there's also
a ton of great stuff on the way from the
MCU so be sure to let us know
which arts you'd like to see on in case
you missed it and as always</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
