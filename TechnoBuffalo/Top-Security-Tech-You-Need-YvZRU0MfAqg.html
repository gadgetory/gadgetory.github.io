a scary place we've got smart TV spying
on you home assistance recording your
phone calls got the NSA the FBI NHL and
NBA interests in your personal
information I want to give you guys the
top security tech you can use so I'll
protect yourself your information and
your family's information let's start
with Q key this is a personal security
device you carry with you on your
keychain so as your passwords credit
cards address books and personal
information securely on your keys you
just pop the Q key into computer's USB
port gives you access to your secure
vault all your information is going to
be stored and completely password
protected it's 99 bucks right now
indiegogo for one's going to be shipping
around June 2017 if you don't want to
have your information stored in the
cloud carry it with you the passwords
for me or something I used to always
forget so I rely really heavily on a
password manager and there are two
incredible ones out right now one
password and LastPass I'm personally a
one password user by know a lot you guys
really like LastPass this is like you
keep it one password in LastPass
securely store your password the payment
information in an encrypted vault
LastPass is a free paid option like one
buck per month and one password starts
at $2.99 per month I think either of
those options are incredibly worth the
price if you're a frequent traveler like
I am you're constantly struggling with
locks and TSA getting to your stuff the
folks at dog and bone have the lock
smart travel the $60 smart lock is just
a lock simplified there's no keys no
combination the smart lock can be
unlocked controlled directly from your
office it can also track where it is via
the app in Bluetooth if email scares you
like I know a lot of you guys are
worried about someone reading your email
protonmail has you covered it's a secure
email service based out of Switzerland
it's protected by strict Swiss privacy
laws it's got full intent encryption all
emails are secured automatically
synonymous no personal information is
required to create an account either so
a VPN something guys are probably
familiar with we have P IA v pn it
stands for private Internet access this
VPN service allows you to browse the web
anonymously with a hidden IP API you can
also bypass censorship filters if you
live in an area or your business as some
sort of filters you're worried about
hypothetically you go ahead
and use this and what about all your SMS
and text you want to make sure that
those are secure as well maybe you're
sending out first information or
pictures signal privacy injure has you
covered uses antenna encryption that
keeps your messages super private you
avoid SMS view couch anyone in the world
totally free available on iOS or Android
