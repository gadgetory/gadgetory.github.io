to you by domain.com what's going on
everyone
John Rhett enger' from TechnoBuffalo
usually when I do in boxing's I have a
general idea what to expect this one I
have no idea what this is going to be so
in this nexus 9 looking box I have the
Welcome kit for Google's project Phi and
here I've got a SIM card for project Phi
and this is the Nexus 6 currently the
only device a project is going to work
with your PI saying to yourself self
what is project Phi and the answer is
it's Google's take on the cell carrier
what they did was took kind of a novel
approach they partnered with Sprint and
t-mobile and when you pop your project
via SIM card into your Nexus 6 as you
move around your Drive it's going to
pull down the signal which network is
better at that time so you're driving in
Sprint's got a stronger signal you'll be
pulling down Sprint's Drive a little
farther t-mobile's bet you'll be pulling
down a t-mobile signal it's going to
combine all that with open hot spots to
be able to give you supposedly the best
cellular signal called fidelity and data
speeds that are available so using open
Wi-Fi does sound a bit of lis sketchy
Google is saying that everything on your
phone is going to be totally encrypted
so take that for what it's worth so this
boils down to you're really getting the
best of what Wi-Fi calling can do for
you
what sprit networks can do for you and
what t-mobile's network can do for you
all without you having to do anything
just pop in a SIM card and go on your
way let's go ahead and take a look at
what's in the Welcome kit look at the
SIM card with your pricing because
Google is really trying to simplify
things what they're trying to do is not
become the biggest cell carrier in the
world are trying to change way people
think about cell carriers think about
what Google did with project fiber they
launched really high speed data in very
select markets certainly not everybody
had access to it but what it did do was
a push competitors like 18 team verizon
softer offer faster and faster data
speeds so what they're hoping this is
going to do is push t-mobile Sprint
Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T to offer more
streamlined pricing and better services
hopefully that trickles down we'll see
if this has any effect on a big industry
at all but without further ado let's
this is all about alright so here is the
box for the project 5 welcome kit they
must have just reused old Nexus 9 boxes
and I'm trying really hard to not say
project fee you can make a drink game
out of this how many times John says
project fee you can go ahead and take a
take a shot alright so it's sort of
embossed on the top project
by and this is what you're going to have
inside of a welcome kit I should say we
didn't pay anything for this just kind
of just showed up when we signed up so
turn air drum solos we got a nice really
nice-looking pair of headphones with an
extra 3.5 port so you can share with
your friends so we got that here and
we've got 100% all-natural juice for
your phone to external battery case you
can take some extra juice and even
phones need hugs I don't this must be a
case for it you can keep your phone nice
and save Google's trying to be all cute
so that's just going to come in there
nothing overly exciting we'll take a
look at all that stuff though I will
show you what's in there a little bit
later here is the very fancy SIM card
that Google has designed this where a
lot of Technology is and it's going to
look I'm guessing just like regular SIM
card so there's a they really give you a
paper clip who bought the SIM card not
even messing around anything else which
is a straight up paper clip who was
really trying to again redefine the
mobile industry and they tried to do it
very simple pricing that's what this is
going to be $20 for unlimited calling
and texting and then it's $10 per
gigabyte after that but you're going to
get refunded what you don't use even if
you only use 400 megabytes you know
you'll get the extra 600 put back and it
would be a credit on your account of
about six dollars so you're only paying
for what you're using at a base point of
ten dollars per gig you can use
international data as well there's no
charge you go to 120 pre-approved
countries for international texting if
you want to make calls internationally
it's going to be 20 cents per minute so
we'll go ahead and pop out the SIM card
really just a straight-up paper clip
will pop this in and see what happens
with the setup process is like and
hopefully can demonstrate project fie
not see now you guys wanted to have a
sip you got an idea for next great
website domain comm has you covered they
want hook you up with a great offer save
20% on domain names and web hosting when
you use coupon code TechnoBuffalo that's
all capital letters one word at domain
coms check out I think domain names
think domain.com
I just coincides with a project by app
so I'll go and open on sucker up right
now nothing showing as for our signal
strength activating project Phi we'll go
ahead and select the account
all right so we're all set up it took us
about two minutes to get all paired up
and working and now we are showing the
fine network right there let's go ahead
and just check from actually keep Wi-Fi
connected make a phone call and see how
it works we'll just dial a random wait
on the number so it's totes now it's via
Wi-Fi calling that's now we're just
using either sprint to t-mobile we have
no idea which one I did go through it
didn't dial it right number at least you
can see that it works so this is project
fine as it stands you're not really
going to notice much of a difference you
able to make phone calls as you would
it'll get data like you would assume but
you'll get even faster speeds and you
would getting if you were just on Sprint
or just on t-mobile how to compared 18
T's and variety standalone networks can
depend on where you live but as it is
right now to get the best of serve all
three worlds those two carriers and
Wi-Fi some pretty cures to try it put it
through its paces CL performs and use it
like I would any other phone again it's
currently only available for a nexus 6
if you have one you already step in the
right direction if you don't have one
you pick one up you can pick one up on
Craigslist or Ebay or just buy one new
I'm bill to get your hands on project
five and any questions or things you
guys want to know about project 5 let us
know until next time John render from
TechnoBuffalo talk to you guys next
