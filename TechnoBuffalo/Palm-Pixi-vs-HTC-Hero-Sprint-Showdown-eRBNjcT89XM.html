technobuffalo here smartphones are all
the rage this holiday season and
Sprint's has two of the arguably hottest
ones available right now the palm pixi
and the HTC hero so that'll do a little
head-to-head action and go through a few
categories that i think are the most
important you can see which one is going
to be best for you so there are a ton of
categories that we can cover obviously
but I picked the ones that I felt were
most important so we're going to cover
price we're going to cover internet on
some off brake system overviews the
camera youtube and keyboard and a few
other sort of random specs along the way
so let's start with the devices
themselves the pixi comes in at 3.51
ounces and the hero comes in at 4.5 so
there's a difference there weight-wise
but not much both are extremely small
and pocketable devices screen resolution
on the pixi you're going to get 320 x
480 so you're going to get 80 extra
pixels on the hero camera wise the
picture is going to give you a 2
megapixel resolution whereas the hero is
going to give you five seriously are
getting better picture quality and
that's all that in all my tests as well
from price standpoint though the pixie
is definitely a little bit less money
it's coming in at 99 bucks on a two-year
contract and the hero is going to run
you eighty dollars more at just about
179 99 just something to keep in mind
they all have bluetooth where the big
different specs wise common is in Wi-Fi
expandable media the pixi does not have
Wi-Fi and does not have an expandable
memory card slot you're limited to just
the internal storage but i believe is 4
gigs the hero on the other hand does
have Wi-Fi and also has a micro SD card
slot so you can go all the way up to 32
gigs both are course evdo rev a phones
which means full 3g let's get into the
actual phone itself and stop talking
about spec to show you some things that
you can see so what I use most on a
phone is the Internet I do a lot of
razzing and do a lot of my work from my
mobile device so having a good internet
browser is very important to me both
phones have capacitive touchscreens and
support multitouch so i want to show you
how this looks
the pixie is running palms web OS
whereas a hero is running a custom skin
to version of Android 1.5 which is
called sin see why I did a full overview
of sense UI in a previous video so let's
unlock both devices you can see the
unlocks prints here here it is on the
pic Singh to unlock you just slide it up
it gets you had notifications down there
for an email and you can just slide that
off to the side let's unlock the hero
and you just slide the screen down to
unlock and right here you can definitely
see the size of the screen there clearly
is a difference the pixie has a full
physical QWERTY keyboard we'll talk
about it in a minute and the hero relies
on an on-screen keyboard so I've turned
Wi-Fi off on the hero to make this a
fair comparison I'll do another test to
show you with Wi-Fi on Casey really
curious to what the difference is going
to be so we will load up technobuffalo
calm on each of these open up the
browser I'll type it in the
accelerometer kicked in right then okay
this website has been loaded on both of
these that will simulate a test of a
site that you visit on a regular basis I
will do the same thing here on the hero
okay so I've got them queued up here and
ready to go we're going to load them on
each and again this is just a test of
the same evdo rev a networking exactly
the same location with exactly the same
amount of bars of service which is five
bars so I'll see how both of these
phones fair go ahead and launch about
the same time all right and they are
both off and I'll show you after these
load how the multi-touch gestures work
and how the browser looks overall on how
it renders looks like the pixi jumped
out to a bit of an early lead the hero
cut up gets you the progress bar right
there is a blue circle and the green
progress bar right there along the
bottom so both are almost done and
promised every processor was these two
are very close so it looks like the hero
just finished and the pixie is still
going like everything sort of popping up
there
it takes you still going so while the
pixie is still loading all you can still
read now to get the page just finished
I'll show you what the browser looks
like on the hero first so scrolling is
very smooth and both these are based on
webkit you may have heard that
essentially it's just a foundation an
open source foundation for building a
mobile browser and lets you view pages
in full HTML Lori so you can navigate
very smoothly a finger scrolling if you
want to zoom in so I want to read this
text for example I can just double tap
and I'll zoom and it wont sort of scale
the text so well but it will sort of
bring it into the window and I was like
I mentioned before this both support
multitouch I can take two fingers and I
can zoom in and out see it doesn't it's
not so smooth on the hero it works and
use it in pictures as well but it's not
as smooth as you'd see on the iphone for
example can zoom out it's definitely
functioning and it's usable but it's not
the most smooth thing one of the things
that I always check when I view mobile
browsers is how the processor handles
quick page loads so if you're trying to
flick through a page very quickly
sometimes you can get a checkerboard
pattern at the bottom so let's see if
the hero does that stuff in the hero
brought the page back up to the top and
bottom as quickly as I could scroll and
you can see that technobuffalo here does
look like just as it would look on your
desktop browser oh this is a very very
capable browser you can see that flash
is not supported right there you can
clearly see the big f with the ! through
it so if you're looking for a good
browser the hero is probably one of the
best of course an accelerometer and you
can navigate the page in landscape as
well it looks great it's very easily
navigate and the multi-touch is
definitely a nice add-on and eyewitness
here to rely on it see right there it's
not even I've been working so let's take
a look at the pic so you can see how
their browser looks something that's
definitely a smaller screen but
certainly a very usable browsing
experience so it's a little bit on the
small side let's take a look at
multi-touch that was what we took a look
at first on the hero
buttery smooth you can deftly the
difference in how much quickly
multi-touch works for this and I may
have something to do with palms
operating system and particularly palms
browser natively being built to support
multitouch Android right out of the box
does not support it something HTC added
so that may be a reason why just work so
well works just as well it does on the
iPhone or really any other multi-touch
before device it's really really smooth
I want to zoom in like I said I can
quartz multi-touch or I can double tap
on some text and that does bring it
right up into view and this does have an
accelerometer as well so you can view
this in portrait and rotation speed is
very quick let's check out the scrolling
and see if it's quick enough to keep up
with what we want that get that
checkerboard pattern and there is a
checkerboard pattern but it goes away
pretty quickly certainly one of the
knocks on the pixie has been it's a bit
of an anemic processor that certainly
been something that's hindering the hero
as well and you can sort of see that in
effect here in little things like the
browser it's a very capable browser I
think that palms browser is absolutely
rivals the best browser on the market
which in my opinion is definitely the
iphones mobile safari palms browser is
just as good just as full-featured and
more importantly flash support will be
coming swiftly another 2010 so from a
browser standpoint it's going to really
come down to size of the screen and
personal preference or the multi-touch
is important to you or not or whether
you want a bigger screen both are
extremely capable and really useful
browsing and i was able to do everything
i would normally do on a typical browser
on both devices hope you guys found that
helpful now before i mention this in
previous videos may sound a little bit
weird before i go to bed and i like to
watch some youtube videos generally I'll
watch you know what's most popular for
the day and sort to see what was going
on both of these have native YouTube
support and also give you a chance to
see how them both of them handle video
so let me go ahead and open up the
YouTube browsers on each but before I do
that I want to give you a demonstration
also of the Wi-Fi difference on the
browser between both operates
since the hero has Wi-Fi the pixie
doesn't and for looking to compare both
devices sort of apples to apples
definitely something to know that there
is Wi-Fi support it so I'm going to do
just a very quick load speed test with
Wi-Fi turned on on the hero alright so
Wi-Fi has been kicked on on the hero we
got technobuffalo queued up to reload
and let's see how quickly both of these
handle them so the hero was noticeably
faster you went out Wi-Fi so I assume
this is going to be a blowout with Wi-Fi
but we'll see you never know how how
things are going to load the green bar
the hero is almost already done and the
pixie looks to be about three quarters
of the way done and I'm running on any
relatively quick Wi-Fi network and the
hero supports if you're wondering a B&amp;amp;G
Wi-Fi it's all done on the hero and
still loading on the pixi so not
surprising anyone it's a much faster
experience over Wi-Fi so like I
mentioned let's take a look at YouTube
very quickly I don't want this to get to
be a 30-minute video but you can see the
pixies still loading the site and the
hero was done quite a bit ago one of the
cool things about the pre I should
mention on webos is the deck of cards
features how you can handle multi
applications and the way you handle
multitasking to get rivet application I
just throw it off the screen and it's
gone let's take a look at youtube here
this you can see very quickly what the
load times are going to be over a pretty
strong 3g signal so pick the the first
video here just you can see what the
player natively looks like and it does
play in landscape as do all videos on
the pre and since again is this 3g
there's a little bit of buffer time the
quality is not as crisp and clear as you
would expect but the speaker is pretty
loud on the prey which is a nice
addition it's a very simplistic design
some sort of a causal um it doesn't load
that slowly it's much faster than i
would have expected it to be quality is
pretty clear even over 3g let's take a
look at
experience on the hero and again I know
I'm running through these a little bit
quickly there's just so much to show in
someone should prepare I just want to
give you a general overview as to how
things look so open that up you can get
a glimpse of the operating systems on
each of these as well and I've done
overviews on all operating systems you
can see the bevy of server admins at
sprint does sprint TVs for navigation
then all sort of come free with your
everything planned will open up YouTube
you get a few more options here on
androids and what you get with the pre
you can view by most popular those of
you top-rated let's take a look at any
video and see how it looks will take the
first one there you can see what the
video quality is so you can see right
there you get a few more button options
you get to her that cool green looking
bar across the bottom for speed it
definitely is a little more feature
YouTube experience and you'd expect that
it's actually because well Google made
the operating system and google owns
youtube so you would think they'd have a
pretty good built in YouTube viewing
experience and they certainly don't
disappoint let's go ahead and move on to
the last test we're going to do and
that's the keyboards really inputting
text is very important in both these do
it in very different ways the pixi as
you can tell has a full physical QWERTY
keyboard after the look of it looks very
small and you figure it's going to be
quite cramped but actually is a pretty
good experience for typing i did a video
demonstrating the keyboard quality but
i'll show you what this looks like as
well going to throw that off the screen
go and open this up and we'll go to the
notes application just need to find the
memos there we go and we'll go ahead and
open up a new memo and i'll show you
just a quick test how the keyboard works
on this
those are the tests very accurate and
surprisingly afternoon if keyboard is
shockingly easy to type on which it
considering how small it is it's got
those sort of ridges and buttons and a
little bit a tacky feel make the
keyboard nice easy to use what this
doesn't have in a big knock I think on
webos the whole is auto correct if I
type of word or letter wrong it's not
going to correct me with a small
keyboard it certainly prone to do that
that is definitely something to keep in
mind but the keyboard on the pixie is
one of the better small candy bar qwerty
keyboards that I've ever used so if
that's important to you and you're
worried about the keyboard on the pixi
try something you don't need to concern
yourself with let's take a look at the
keyboard here on the hero okay so we've
got a text application open here and you
see you've got a on-screen keyboard some
haptic feedback meaning when you touch
it you get a little bit of vibration
feeling and this does have autocorrect
so I'll take the same thing this is a
test see that I spelt it wrong actually
but it does tell me that that is a test
my go and hit space automatic erects it
they also have a landscape keyboard as
well if you want a little bits of a
bigger typing experience i'll try this
again so it typed it wrong but it
corrected it for me so typing is going
to come down to which one you prefer
whether you like a physical keyboard or
an on-screen keyboard i dint to prefer a
physical keyboard but the entre
experience on the hero is really good
and the autocorrect is probably second
to none tend to make a lot of mistakes
with an on-screen keyboard so you need a
good autocorrect system and I think the
hero does a fantastic job with it again
the day which one do you choose it's
gonna be personal preference whether you
don't mind the smaller screen the pic
saying you like them may be more
full-featured browsing experience that
you get with it and you can enjoy a full
keyboard or whether you want the more
open environment of the hero and the
android marketplace as opposed to the
smaller more limited palms app catalog
you're getting both very full-featured
media phones although with the hero you
are getting Wi-Fi and
access to more storage via its micro SD
card both are really good options that
were something a little bit different
than marketplace and I take my hat off
to sprint for offering very different
but really full feature phones a lot of
very good choices now on sprint's
network and we guys hope you enjoyed for
