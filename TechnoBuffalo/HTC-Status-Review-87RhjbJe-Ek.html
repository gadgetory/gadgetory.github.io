from TechnoBuffalo here at the full
review for you of the HTC status or the
Facebook phone also called the HTC
ChaCha abroad let's go ahead and see
what this QWERTY pack and little guy can
dance its way into your hearts and yes
it took me a while to come up with that
intro
all right so let me remind you of the
specs of this guy here it's got a 2.6
inch diagonal capacitive touchscreen the
resolution of 480 by 800 it's being
powered by 800 megahertz Qualcomm built
processor it's got 512 megabytes of RAM
and ROM on the back it's got a 5
megapixel camera with autofocus and LED
flash it's running Android 2.3 and has a
12 hundred and 50 million power battery
which we'll talk about quite a bit all
right so when I do my phone reviews the
first thing that I talk about is called
quality they actually been using this as
my dedicated only phone for the past two
and a half weeks so I've made many more
phone calls and usually my 20 call tests
has actually been pretty solid I've only
had into two weeks to dropped calls now
as well I was driving through a known 80
MT dead area other than that call
quality has been outstanding sneaker
phone volume was a little bit tinny but
quite loud HTC included one of their
neat features then if you take your
phone you flip it over while you're on a
call it's got an automatic convert over
speakerphone kind of neat speakerphone
is pretty decent on here so if you rely
heavily on a speakerphone this is going
to be a pretty good choice for you I
didn't have any white noise in my and
the color to report any white noise on
their end so thumbs up for call equality
alright let's go ahead and talk let's
just get it out in the open
the big white elephant in the room is
this guy right here the Facebook button
if you probably asked what does that do
does it just take you to Facebook well
it does a couple things let me show you
I'm gonna go and push it right now just
while I'm on the home screen and it's
going to launch my well pretty much
launch my wall
let me update my status quickly and
easily hence the name HTC status this is
probably the most appropriately named
phone out there and go ahead and select
the camera if you want to take a picture
or if you want to take photos let me go
ahead and show you some interests in
here I'm signed in on facebook let me go
ahead and try and type a status update
so I'll go ahead and type hi so there it
is typed hi I'm gonna go ahead post and
it's going to go ahead and do its posing
thing so now when I go to Facebook I
should see that post right on my wall
shouldn't i well you think so but here's
my facebook and it is not there that
Facebook button doesn't work for me and
I am signing my facebook all the steps
and procedures were done
followed perhaps you'll have better luck
maybe just a Pollack my review unit that
guy doesn't work if I go to the Facebook
app and I update my wall have to upload
a picture works no problem but this
button however does not work if you want
to take a picture or you are taking a
picture or if you have anything on the
screen here that is uploaded to Facebook
that button is going to glow as you can
see it there it is see it was glowing so
you take a picture to let you know that
it can be uploaded and in theory when
you hit that button it'll take that
picture you just took and it will
automatically upload it to Facebook at
least that's the theory doesn't work and
even here when I go in upload a picture
so we'll go ahead done
I want upload that to my photos it's not
going to work so this button here it's
really just for decoration it's not
really decorating much something to keep
in mind
certainly it's probably unique to this
device but yeah thumbs down on that guy
not working alright so we've gotten past
that Facebook button let's talk about
this keyboard I'm on a bit of a physical
keyboard fix over the past couple months
amazing blackberries and now the HTC
status and I've tested a lot of phones
over the past probably about two and a
half three years fed my hands on pretty
much every phone that's come out whether
it has a physical keyboard or doesn't
have a physical keyboard I have tested
it and of all the phones I've tested
over that period of time to phone stand
out to me is having the best most usable
physical QWERTY keyboards one is the
sidekick 4G for t-mobile and number two
is HTC status this keyboard is amazing
and an absolute pleasure to use the keys
have a little bit of rays to them
they're oval design a really nice
tactile feedback if you ever felt the
need to have a physical QWERTY keyboard
you're going to be hard-pressed to find
one better and that's out of all the
phones I've ever tested an HTC status it
is absolutely unbelievable so it sort of
begs the question okay the Facebook
button doesn't work
who's this phone gonna be good for this
one has been wonderful for me and I do a
lot of emails if you need to peck out a
ton of emails and blackberry is not your
thing you want the flexibility of
Android this is surprisingly a very
subtly a business-friendly tool works
extremely well you might want to cover
up that Facebook button piece of tape
they're not embarrassed in meetings
about the keyboard here is really
outstanding
something sort of to keep in mind I've
loved using this I've been a pleasure
using it and I plan to continue to use
this for a little while and I'll talk
about why it's not gonna be my daily
phone in just a little bit let's go and
talk about navigation here so it is a
touchscreen so all your navigation is
done with a touchscreen however there
are four buttons here for navigation
it's become a bit cumbersome to use
these buttons however are extremely
small and not the most user-friendly so
I wasn't doing any navigation here with
those four-way buttons on a phone that
has a screen this small flicking and
scrolling can be a little bit difficult
but get something here like a black
beret certainly would be a competitor
that's optical trackpad and some Android
phones have had this I would have loved
to have had another way to navigate this
phone oftentimes a wish that I had that
trackpad in the middle it's certainly
usable and it's not unusable but on a
film in this small pinching and zooming
sometimes your thumb hits the edge here
it's just capacitive buttons and doesn't
always register something to keep in
mind if you've got big fingers you might
want to try this phone before you buy it
so there's a lot of custom stuff that go
into making HTC Sense work on a screen
this small so this isn't the newest
version of HTC Sense it's not 3.0 but it
has some 3.0 ish stuff take a look this
lockscreen
looks very familiar right and go ahead
and say whatever icons you want you can
drag it right in and launch the
applications I'll go ahead and just
unlock it here so you have sort of that
subtle tweaks applications are redone
and you've got these menus here that
show up on the right-hand side and
that's true throughout all the
applications your menus or mail you get
sort of the three wave buttons there
across the side it's very nicely done
with this take away from the screen real
estate and looking at it horizontally
this is being powered by 800 megahertz
Qualcomm processor and I would have
loved to have shown you what the
quadrant score was but unfortunately
quadric kept crashing whenever I tried
to use it so I don't know what the score
is gonna be but I will say the phone
felt very quickly I was using it
pinching - zooming was very smooth and
really no issues with opening
applications let me go ahead and open
one for example so ty very nicely into
what I want to say next let's go and
open up something like speed tests which
is going to test my internet speed look
how it opens up in a weird orientation
clearly not meant for phones
like this you got to turn it to the side
often time that's what I found with a
lot of applications is it's not meant
for this portrait orientation so you're
gonna have to hold your phone like this
which is a bit awkward especially if
you're playing a game or something that
needs this screen so bear that in mind
as well
all right so let me go and open a few
applications here I'll show you what the
speed looks like let's go ahead and try
something like where's I got Angry Birds
on here somewhere so it's a good test
subjects go ahead see if I can find it
Angry Birds Angry Birds if you were an
angry bird where would you be you guys
probably screaming at me there it is
Angry Birds let's go and open it up so
look not a speed demon certainly not a
dual-core or even quad-core coming out
soon or not even a ho gigahertz power
processor but it's pretty quick and if
you're just sort of doing everyday
things I really had no slowdown I
haven't had to do any program management
I have no task killer on here other than
what's others go ahead and shut that
down here a lot of speakers are other
than what was installed come standard
with Gingerbread it's worked actually
very nicely let me go ahead and pull us
aside for just a second we're going to
open up a web browser and let me show
you what a website looks like so I'll go
ahead and launch TechnoBuffalo let me
show you what the pinch-to-zoom looks
like pretty fluid as you'd expect from a
modern Android device but again the
small screen some you're gonna have to
experience for yourself you can't do at
the text though on the 42 800 screen
it's pretty sharp you can definitely
read websites on here and they wouldn't
read an e-book but you could so
scrolling is pretty smooth still loading
even I'm not having any bit of that
checkerboarding pattern
I have flash turned off I've got it set
to turn on if I want to go ahead and
pinch to zoom it's pretty smooth this is
actually nice very nice implementation
here of the Android browser so if you
can deal with that small screen if
you're used to maybe a blackberry that's
going to be a very welcome addition so
I'll go ahead and close that the weird
orientation thing is something to keep
in mind if you are gonna use this phone
for email if you're gonna play some
games on it maybe make some phone calls
you're going to want to bring another
battery this guy is 1215 milliamp hour
battery is abysmal
it barely barely gets me through
three-quarters of a day take the phone
off the charge around 8 o'clock
two email accounts pulling an email
about every 15 or 30 minutes depending
on the account probably about two to
three hours of phone calls and some
light web browsing and I am dead dead as
a doornail down to zero percent by about
five o'clock you can see it right now
it's one forty four and I've already
gone through about 40% of my battery
certainly some of that has been for
testing but you can see how quickly this
thing is going to go this is a phone
that surprisingly I really wanted to
like I wanted have a full chorded
keyboard I liked it I had Android on
here and I liked that I sort of had that
Blackberry feel but the functionality of
Android and certainly the app choice
that Android provides if this thing had
a better battery or had better battery
management or add a bigger battery in
there I could wholeheartedly recommend
this phone it's thin it's got a sort of
unique form factor its arched it feels
nicely in the hand that's great in the
pocket it's got decent call quality and
all-around very well rounded phone but I
just can't use it every day without
having to plug it in when I'm sitting at
my desk I have to plug it in because of
that I just can't hold hardly recommend
it to the business user or the heavy
texture or internet browsing folks
unless you have a charger with you you
may want to pick up another battery or
look at some sort of external option
here or some sort of external battery
charger if you're willing to deal with
the bad battery life this phone
definitely gets a huge thumbs up but if
you're on the road you don't have access
to a charger you're going to want to
look elsewhere hopefully guys this
answered some your questions about the
HTC status not sure what's going on with
that Facebook button I'm John Retton
jerk and TechnoBuffalo and I'll see you
in the next</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
