the show check the description for links
or you can click on the graphics for
every story if you have annotations
toggled on I'm Ashley sceva here your
top stories icloud is in the news again
but not for a good reason it seems once
again Apple's cloud service has been
played with issues for about 3 million
people it might seem like a huge number
but it's actually about 1% of iCloud
users and those 1% are experiencing
issues photostream I message iTunes and
documents guys when will Apple get its
iCloud
super weird anyway our next story is via
Bloomberg who claims Chinese smartphone
maker ZTE Lenovo and Huawei maybe
looking into an acquisition of Android
OEM HTC while HTC has cranked out
gorgeous phones like the HTC One this
year they've still hit and 8 you're low
on their stock prices and may post their
first net loss since 2008 next fiscal
quarter so a sale could very possibly be
in their future we'll definitely keep
you posted on this report if it develops
further in gaming sony announced
PlayStation 4 owners would get free
access to PlayStation Plus for two weeks
allowing gamers to check out the surface
and all the cool goodies it provides
when they hook up their new console
later this fall oh don't forget
PlayStation Plus will be mandatory for
anyone looking to play online
multiplayer and it'll run you 50 bucks a
year it also includes free game
downloads and discounts in the
PlayStation Store so if you've
pre-ordered a ps4 you'll be checking it
out this fall Microsoft's to do bungee
unleashed a mini video documentary about
the making of their highly anticipated
game destiny this week the documentary
covers clips from in game developer
interviews and all the other great stuff
you'd want to see in a preview video
even better you won't need a new console
for destiny because it's coming in 2014
to xbox one playstation 4 xbox 360 and
playstation 3 if you like shooters
social interaction and space this video
is a must see lastly our grab bag story

from our very own Todd Hazleton who
spoke to AT&amp;amp;T Labs vice president of
intelligence systems dr. Mazon Gilbert

smart technologies applied to our homes
