from technobuffalo and in this video I'm
gonna cover some very basic video
letting tips now you might be wondering
what does this have to do with
technology absolutely nothing however if
you're plenty of making technology
related videos for the YouTube then you
should pay attention because guess what
video lighting is just as important if
not more so than the camera you used to
film that's right right now I'm using a
Canon t2i to broadcast my awesome self
just kidding about the awesome part not
kidding about the camera which is
usually a step up compared to the camera
used by the average youtuber but if my
lighting setup were to suck then my
video quality would suck watch thanks
see everything's all dark and
underexposed it's terrible actually it's
not that bad that's better lighting it's
like sunshine i can feel the sunshine in
my face now i'm pretty sure some of you
guys have already searched up some sort
of lighting tutorial and trust me i do
the exact same thing in fact i do it all
the time because i feel like i always
want to improve and if you guys are
serious about your video quality you
would have the same drive and on top of
that people like other people who are
motivated and have a can-do attitude and
it also helps to give a thumbs up every
now and then and random times yeah so in
this video I'm gonna show you my basic
lighting setup what I've tried what
works what doesn't want to recommend for
you and yes oh yes how you can save the
most amount of money to get the best
value for your lighting are you ready
okay the standard style of lighting is
called three-point lighting which uses
three main sources of light obviously if
you can get three point lighting to work
for you then great I recommend that
however if you're like me and you're
stuck in a really small room getting
three point lighting to work is quite
tricky and trust me I've tried oh how
I've tried and failed which is why don't
use three point lighting ultimately in
the end if the video footage and the
lighting looks good to you that's all
that matters so here is my basic
lighting setup I had two main sources of
light while technically three I have my
overhead light which most household room
should have this guy up there access my
back lighting which brings me away from
the background and puts more focus and
tension on me in the foreground look at
it working isn't it nice look at my
shoulder it's all shiny and everything
the other source of light comes from a
really basic floor lamp what
you can pick up for twenty dollars at a
Walmart or any hardware store make sure
it has a gooseneck attachment if it
doesn't you can always buy a gooseneck
lamp with a clamp on it like what I have
right here from my floor lamp i have
right behind my camera and the gooseneck
lamp pointing right on my face if at any
point you feel like the lights are too
bright try bouncing it off the wall this
is called diffusing and it softens up
the light quite a bit so if you're ever
in this scenario if this was sunlight
I'm definitely feeling the happy it's
best if you try to diffuse the light
yeah if you ever think you need another
light source or if you want to try three
point lighting you can try picking up
one of these desk lamps right here it
costs about ten bucks so you can't
really go wrong with that well what
about natural sunlight you might be
asking it's all bright happy and full of
vitamin D I film in a basement with no
windows therefore there is no sunlight
however for the purpose of control I
recommend you not use sunlight as your
main source of light feel free to have
it as background lighting though it's
great gives you hints of happy and
vitamin D let's move on to light bulbs
I've experimented with a lot a lot of
light bulbs standard household light
bulbs have three basic color
temperatures soft White's bright or cool
white and daylight or sunlight soft
white is what most people will use in
their homes in living rooms bedrooms and
so on it's the one with the orange II
hint to it bright or cold white is what
you might find in an office space or in
a garage it doesn't really have a color
hint but it makes things look rather
dull and sunlight or daylight bulbs I
don't know where you'd find this in an
average home but it has a really really
strong hint of blue to it and avoid
these unless you're planning on shooting
with sunlight the color temperature of
lighting is measured in kelvins the
standard color temperature for lighting
in professional film and video is 3,200
Calvin soft white is around 2,700 cool
white is 4,200 and sunlight is 5500
unless you plan on picking up special
video light bulbs or if your department
store somehow carries 3200 Calvin light
bulbs I'd recommend you stick with the
soft white ones as for whether or not to
get the old-school incandescent light
bulbs or the new eco-friendly light
bulbs I go on a spiral it all depends on
how much you love the environment and
the earth if you're not sure which color
temperature light bulb you like the best
I recommend you get the incandescent
ones first just to try it out because
it's one tenth of the price of the eco
friendly ones something I have to stress
out is try not to mix color temperature
light bulbs and if you can make sure all
your light bulbs are from the same
company that's because it makes
balancing very tricky on the camera and
it makes things very tricky to color
correct in post-production the last
thing I want to talk about is money
because we work hard for our ching ching
so we want to spend it on some
bling-bling not on light bulbs who
spends money on light bulbs anyways I
did lots of them let's just say a Wendy
I want to save money approach but ended
up spending a lot of money doing so do
you need professional lighting equipment
that might cost at least a hundred
dollars unless you want to do freelance
shooting where you have to appear
professional or unless you like to
impress your friends and family probably
not if you simply want or need more
lighting I'd recommend you get one of
these yeah so powerful in Manly for
forty dollars you get 1000 watts of
power that's bang for your buck right
there and believe it or not this
lighting kit is very very common with
students and low-budget filmmakers let's
see it in action shall we have a setup
pointed at the wall bang nice even
letting right here because of how bright
it is i definitely don't recommend you
have it close to your face good as you
can see these guys are very bright and
they work extremely well a downside
would be that they get very hot and they
use a lot of power every time one of
these lights is left on for too long a
part of the planet dives you ever wonder
what pandas are endangered now you know
so to recap for good video lighting all
you need are a couple light bulbs a
house lamp or two and you're set of
course you have to fine-tune your setup
as in where to put the lambs how many
light bulbs you need and so on if you
guys want me to cover anything else that
has to do with video production just let
me know by commenting below who knows
this can become a john for lakers /
TechnoBuffalo video series just like
what LP did with the console wars LP
what a legend well that's it for now
I'll see you guys in the next video
