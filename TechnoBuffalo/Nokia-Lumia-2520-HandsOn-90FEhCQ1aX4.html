TechnoBuffalo we're here looking at the
Nokia Lumia 2520 alright so we have the
nokia lumia 2520 here this is a Nokia's
newest tablet it's running Windows 8.1
and it's priced at 499 US dollars pretty
pretty competitive comparing it to other
tablet devices this one is LTE
compatible in this sim tray here you can
put in your sim card micro sim as well
as expandable storage space the tray is
built in to hold both this device here
runs Snapdragon 800 the 2.2 gigahertz
processor so the same as the 1520
and it's got two gigs of ram 32 gigs of
storage with the microSD
that you can expand upon this has a
gorilla glass as its display
super-bright 10.1 inch IPS full HD
that's 9 20 x 1080 so you'll find that
to be similar to the surface to
and the surface tooth profile so NFC
micro USB ports
micro HDMI there's that as this is
available on verizon 4g LTE on this
device here again this is a prototype so
we'll see when it gets to that point it
actually has a keyboard that you can
plug into and that's the pork for that
for the proprietary keyboard the 3.5
inch jack in here and the prior terry
power cord got speakers on the front the
