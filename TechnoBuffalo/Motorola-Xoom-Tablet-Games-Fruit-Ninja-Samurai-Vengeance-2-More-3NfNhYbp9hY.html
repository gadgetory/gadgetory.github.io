from technobuffalo i'm at the nvidia
booth here at Mobile World Congress
checking out some of the demos running
on the Tegra 2 2 port tablets being shut
off the show the android honeycomb
tablet take a look at some of the gaming
demos on the motorola xoom which is
going to hit verizon in the u.s. in just
about a week or so let's check it out by
the way this blows you should know that
I obviously recovered the show for
technobuffalo I'm also doing a little
bit of work for in the video on their
blog and they sponsored my trick over to
Spain so you know I promise to be
effective in my coverage but full
disclosure thanks nvidia for the trip
over here to Barcelona alright so we're
going to take a look at some special
games and I mean headed on sincerity
these are really cool games that nvidia
has been working on their titles you
probably recognize but in video has been
working with the game developers to come
up with some Tegra optimized versions of
these games and there's some really
impressive stuff we're going to start
out with fruit ninja Tegra HD version
and that you may be familiar with fruit
ninja incredibly popular game on some
other platforms and you can see the
detail in the fruit with the 3d effects
and the shadowing the scratch marks left
on the wall just I mean but just you
know concentrate on the fruit for a
second as it's flying up and downs that
the roundness of the shapes and the
shadowing and texture very very cool
stuff
all right next up is Riptide and after
seeing this demo maybe want to blow off
the rest of work and just play this game
this looks like fun so again you can see
it's a Tegra Tegra optimized version and
you know just check everything out the
3d realism the water which is actually a
physics engine that's rendering the
water in real time you can see the game
being played with the accelerometer
sensors the gyroscope in the xoom tablet
I'm the owner now at imagining I'm
riding a jet ski but you know just very
very cool stuff the gameplay is smooth
it's fluid and you know just so much to
look at the trees the buildings and the
really really cool water effects there
all right next up galaxy on fire too
and again these are all Tegra optimized
versions they're running on the motorola
xoom which is a 10 inch screen if you're
not familiar running Google's new
Android 30 operating system known as
honeycomb so I mean this one you know
they all really could but this one
speaks for itself when you when you just
look at all the detail we're going to
look at something gold action freeze you
can rotate your spaceship in 3d you can
zoom in and out to get close in the
detail and then there's this little
trick here where we've switched into the
way this game looks on a competitive
platform you might have heard of it's
called the ipad so if you check out the
well just check out the level of detail
or lack thereof on the spaceship and now
we can go back and this is how it looks
in the Tegra optimized version and again
you know rotating in 3d all the detail
the texture of the i miss i want to say
metal but i don't know at galaxy on fire
that might be some kind of carbon
nanotube composite body or something i
don't know but if you look at the
texture that flames everything on the
ship just incredible and will flip back
real quick to the ipad mode again and
you know yeah you're missing something I
think you can figure it out
all right next up we've got samurai two
vengeance
and again you know everything from the
lanterns glowing to you know an
increased number of objects flying
around and then when you watch the
actual fighting action with the effects
of the glow and sort sword swings and
the detail when you kill an opponent
just absolutely unreal okay now see it's
good i'm not done waiting because if you
wouldn't gotten to see any of this stuff
because nice courtesy i would not have
had anybody in half so it's good we got
a professional doing the actual games
later but again you know just that
everything from you know the smoothness
of the gameplay to the little subtle
things that make these games so popular
just it's all enhanced on the Tegra
platform alright and last but certainly
not least Zen Pinball this is one that I
could maybe demo although I couldn't
hold the camera and I certainly couldn't
talk wise demographic but pinballs a
little more a little more within my
skill set
and again that you know the detail on
the table the graphics on the table the
wheel turning there when the ball was
launched the 3d effect of the side walls
at the table and the flippers the motion
of the ball I mean just everything I can
just be quiet so you can look at it but
just just I keep saying unreal but it
really is it's just that it's it's
fantastic and it's smooth you know it's
not just this level of detail and all
the shadowing or anything going on but
the gameplay itself you know is actually
smooth which eyes is all the more
impressive very very cool stuff I cannot
wait for the zoom to hit the market just
just amazing stuff and again it's
powered by the Tegra 2 dual core
processor inside and honeycomb 30 is
optimized for dual core architecture as
well as GPU hardware acceleration for
the 3d graphics which is really where
you're getting all this great stuff from
Mobile World Congress 2011 and Barcelona
Spain I'm Noah Kravitz for the nvidia
blog with the motorola xoom tegra 2
