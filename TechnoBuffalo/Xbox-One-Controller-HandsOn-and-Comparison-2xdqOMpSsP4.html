TechnoBuffalo here doing a control or
comparison for the Xbox one controller
we just got our Xbox one in the office
we're really excited about it it's a
little bit different than what we've
seen before there's a couple of extra
features available a couple of extra
buttons on here so let's check it out
all right everybody so we're here with
the Xbox one trailer we just got the
Xbox one in office and I figured I would
give you guys a little tour of what's
new on the Xbox one controller obviously
you don't see a back or Start button
that's missing oh no but that's ok cuz
Microsoft's added a couple extra things
so let's check out what's going on with
the Xbox one controller obviously a
really similar shape to what we saw on
the Xbox 360 and we'll get into that in
a second I have a xbox 360 controller
over here to my left
definitely a slimmer profile a no big
giant battery pack poking out of the
back of this this is now just two
double-a batteries if you have
rechargeable batteries you can recharge
it with the micro USB right there
very handy and let's talk about these
two buttons right here
so this one is actually a really
interesting contextual button so let's
say you are using Internet Explorer on
your Xbox one and you want to bring up
the navigation menu so you would
actually hit this and it would bring up
a series of like either a menu or a
different view in Forza Motorsport 5
though instead of bringing up some sort
of menu it actually changes your camera
view so you can go from first person to
third and so on and so far it's like all
your different camera views rear view
you'll be able to change that with this
button right here so it does change
based on the app or game that you're
using which is kind of nice and then
this one right here is a menu button
that is going to allow you to do things
like switch profiles so if you want to
do a quick change you're playing a game
and then you decide oh my friend came
over I'm gonna let you play on your xbox
a live profile they can go ahead and
sign in with this pretty quickly which
is super nice
so thanks Microsoft no options our share
button on here
but I would say the closest you'd get to
options would maybe be this menu button
like the PlayStation 4 has on there
controller this is now your home button
which is quite a bit more subtle it's
definitely flatter than the one that we
saw on the Xbox 360 which I actually
think is a really nice change I always
found it very odd that they really put
it front and center here I think it
should be a little more subtle because a
that's what controllers are all about
right being subtle that you they should
be like ninjas you should never know
they're there it's just work fluidly
with your hands and be an extension of
them so a couple of other different
things one of the things that they're
doing here is Harrier bumpers your
triggers are actually a little different
they're a little wider and the triggers
now are they're calling them impulse
triggers and what's happening here is
there's haptic feedback inside these
triggers so let's say you are playing
Halo and you are shooting at people are
shooting at aliens and you're using your
needler and you are you know you get
haptic feedback in here or you get shot
back or the flood comes and and just
destroys all of your happiness
you can't you can feel that right here
inside the impulse triggers let's
compare with the Xbox 360 controller so
here it is here's both of them I'll
stack them on top of each other if you
guys want to see so a little bit smaller
but not too much smaller obviously the
back and start buttons have been removed
issued for the new contextual and menu
options available on the new controller
the same sort of setup of the
thumbsticks are are here present they've
actually lowered the analog down into
its own sort of pit instead of having it
sort of raised up which I find really
interesting I'm actually curious to see
if I like that better than the 360
because the 360 was a really good
controller and it still is it's still a
great great controller they've made the
buttons here a lot more visible they
don't fade away into the same color
background which is definitely a bonus
for anybody who might have a little
trouble seeing somebody colorblind
definitely good options happen
there so let's check out what they look
like from the top obviously a new a new
setup up here you've got your microSD
and then definitely different than this
one right here which is a lot different
obviously slimmer you don't have these
big huge battery packs in the back which
is always nice they've brought the
triggers closer and made them wider so
this is actually I think a really good
design decision especially with
first-person shooters I have a feeling
you're gonna find that these triggers
the way these are designed to sort of
wrap around as opposed to having to do
this like make sure you're on these
really skinny little triggers is gonna
come in really really handy as you play
games so that's the comparison of the
Xbox one to Xbox 360 controller
now let's take a look and see next-gen
console wise what it looks like next to
the ps4 controller so here's the ps4
controller and we went through a little
controller comparison last week when we
got our ps4 but we didn't have an xbox
one controller to compare it against so
you can see obviously both of them still
kind of keeping in the design language
of their previous console generation but
not quite that so definitely a little
bit different I do like both of them
equally this one's a little bit lighter
but is definitely sturdier than the
DualShock 3 that we saw at the
PlayStation 3 it does have a little more
heft to it which actually feels a lot
better in the hand the this one the Xbox
one controller actually is a little
feels a little lighter than the previous
gen so while PlayStation 4 and Dualshock
4 went a little bit heavier it looks
like the Xbox one controller went a
little bit lighter than the Xbox 360
let's check out the DualShock 3 just for
kicks because we have it here in the
office man this thing looks archaic now
now that we've seen what what the Dual
Shock 4 looks like a sixaxis controller
really just doesn't do doesn't really do
much for me it also feels super
lightweight so that is that is the
sixaxis controller I just wanted to give
you guys a little visual comparison here
and then of course we'll break out big
big bertha was like to call her
that's the Wii U gamepad so here's the
Wii U gamepad obviously I'll almost fit
the entire Xbox one controller inside
the Wii U gamepad's screen which is
really fun but it's definitely very very
different than what you would you know
use on your other two consoles your
next-gen consoles but I just figured for
fun we would show you guys what they
look like together all at once and that
is our controller comparison we're
actually going to be playing quite a bit
of PlayStation 4 and Xbox one games over
the next few weeks and we're gonna give
you a full comparison and opinion on
which controller we think is the best if
you guys have any questions about you
know the controllers that you want us to
maybe answer while we're checking them
out we would love to hear them
