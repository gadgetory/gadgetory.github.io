from technobuffalo here Samsung's
flagship Galaxy s7 is poised to make its
debut at Mobile World Congress at the
end of februari as we get closer to the
event we're starting to get a better
sense with the phone's going to look
like and what it's going to be so if you
decide without you should wait in or
pick up a phone now I've got to better
than a top five here the top seven
things you can expect from the Galaxy s7
coming in at number seven Samsung's
going to take and if it ain't broke
don't fix their approach toward the
design the phone is going to look nearly
identical to the galaxy s6 so love it or
hate it that designs here to stay coming
at number six not one but two galaxy s7
devices similar to the galaxy s6 and the
galaxy s6 edge going to the folks at etn
news two devices codenamed tier 1 and 0
to hero one's got a flat 5.2 inch screen
that should go to the Galaxy s7 and a
row to as a curved 5.5 inch screen that
should go to the Galaxy s7 edge there
was for a while a crazy rumor floating
around about four curves on the phone so
not just the left on the right for the
top and bottom but I wouldn't put much
stock in static but the typical curves
that we've known loved on the Galaxy s6
edge to filter over to the Galaxy s7
edge or hero to number five it's getting
time to throw away all those micro USB
cords you can hoarding all these years
Samsung is going to move to us bc as a
new charging standard across all of
their devices with that quick charge you
know and love not going away it'll still
be there with the galaxy s7 butts going
to use a brand-new cord that's that's
not reversible number four you
complained and Samsung evidently
listened welcome back micro SD card
support according to a pretty reliable
source that was posted on the Chinese
forum Weibo microSD card supports
getting making a return to the galaxy s7
if you were holding out hope so that
movable battery would also be there
that's that's not going to happen but at
least you can pop it in SD card and you
get to go and coming in at number three
improved camera or cameras I know this
seems obvious the new phone it should
have a new and improved camera but
supposedly something cool could happen
with the galaxy s7 according to Sam
mobile samsung is testing two different
camera options for the s7 the first one
is going to include two different lenses
on the back kidlington 20
idea of colonists technology do a pixel
for a while some reason that technology
is not ready in time they've got a
20-megapixel iso cell sensor ready to go
and there's a long shot third option out
there as well SlashGear is claiming this
duo pixel technology could potentially
be for a modular camera option on the
back of the galaxy s7 think of Google's
project ara so you can actually pop out
the sensor and put in the new one
depending on what you want to do cool
but far-fetched maybe the galaxy SI
could have it though number two is the
processor what's going to make this
galaxy s7 hum the same song does not
like to be out spect and the galaxy s7
is not going to be any exception
supposedly we're going to see two
separate processors powering the phones
depending on trajan you are in one will
get the latest sexy notes the 88 90 and
the other get the latest from Qualcomm
the Snapdragon 820 system-on-a-chip both
should be very powerful out expect four
gigs of ram to be found in each and the
number one thing you could expect from
your Galaxy s7 clear force technology
which is another version of 3d touch or
force touch should make its debut on the
Galaxy s7 as substantiated by none other
than the wall street journal not sure
what samsung implantation is going to be
Zuma bleah though it'll be baked into
TouchWiz to be sitting on top of Android
marshmallow that's going to be in the
galaxy s7 so any guys think are all
these things coming together make an
awesome phone you can't wait to buy you
get us at this generation out one of
your thoughts on it till next time I'm
John render for technobuffalo I'll talk
to you in the next video bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
