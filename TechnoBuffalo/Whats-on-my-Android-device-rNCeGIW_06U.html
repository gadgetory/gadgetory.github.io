here with TechnoBuffalo and i thought it
might be a fun thing to do for you guys
to get to know me a little bit better to
do a fun old fashioned what's on my
phone
the very first thing you're gonna notice
is that I forgot to start recording on
the on the phone so that you guys can
actually see my screen so I'm gonna
start doing that right now and you'll
see how I'm using that I'm using an app
called record I believe it's just called
it's a really really nice app it's
really powerful you can record your
entire screen for up to five minutes and
you can even record audio off of the mic
so now that you can see my phone this is
my home screen be kind about you know
seeing my have my personal stuff but
that's you know that's okay you might be
able to tell I'm kind of like a an
efficient efficiency kind of guy I
really like to be able to use my phone
as as efficiently as possible so when I
set up a home screen I want things to
look and behave as efficiently as I can
so what I like to do is put things
together into folders which you can see
here and so that first of all you tape
at the top is food to order things think
seamless was recently updated so fell
outta there this is my daily folder this
is what I'm looking at on the daily
basis I'm a big destiny player so
destinies in there obviously I have a
nest at home I use Foursquare to find
you know great places to eat to hang out
I have a smartthings hub at home which
takes care of all my lights and hooks up
to the nest and does all that stuff I'm
big on vine I like watching vine embed
stuff like that and I've been using
Falcon pro as my primary Twitter account
or excuse me Twitter app for quite some
time but I don't know if you guys might
notice in some of my reviews I've been
toying with Phoenix as well which I
really really like and that's been fun
the next one down is I'm gonna skip the
game son for just a second because
that'll be its own category in and of
itself the next one down is the
utilities folder you've got like all
that stuff in there that it's not stuff
I'd use every day but it's definitely
stuff that I use regularly enough you've
got Trello in here which I use a lot for
organization with my wife
you've got Yelp in here which I use less
than Foursquare these days simple I love
simple I've been a simple member for
years now Amazon obviously for those fun
impulse buys things of that nature and
then you've got a media folder down here
for Netflix HBO GO Plex
and YouTube big on chromecast big on
watching YouTube videos down here you
can see I use pocket casts for my
podcasts of course and that is easily
the best podcast app I've used on
Android or on iOS either way it's just
it's beautiful its material its
responsive and it syncs if you pay for
an account you can go to beta dot
podcast pocket cast calm and it'll sync
your place and all your podcast it's
just easily the best the best podcast
app I've ever used up here you see a
feedly widget and that's kind of how I
get most of my news these days I don't
really sit and read RSS feeds anymore I
just kind of cycle through whatever is
up here and then of course my hangouts
widget which is my primary mode of
communication whether it's SMS or
actually on hangouts don't worry we'll
come back to the games folder don't
worry don't worry up here we've got
audio which I use for my music we've got
I use this sweet app weather timeline
for my weather and I use this partially
because it's gorgeous and partially
because it works really well with
Android wear
it's got great really rich cards for
your watch which are way way richer than
anything Google now offers you which i
think is fantastic and then of course
you've got Evernote here which I kind of
live and die by anything I write down I
put it down into Evernote I've got a
ridiculous amount of stuff in there so
you see I pack all my stuff into just
two pages and that everything else that
I don't use I just throw into the app
drawer been playing around the slide for
reddit it's not quite ready for
primetime but it's gorgeous I you Strava
to track my bike rides to and from work
what else is on here man there's so much
fun here lakitu for watching twitch
streams of course stop using the
Facebook app I started using metal which
is basically a material skin on a
browser I use Musee for my backgrounds
which I have cycling through the three
Destiny subclasses the new destiny
subclasses that are coming out very soon
and then of course I think we would be
remiss not to talk a little bit about
that doctor at the bottom Sonos is one
of my favorite products on the
I adore Sonos I have two of them at home
we live and die by that when it comes to
music as well
inbox for email we've got a handful of
things in there should probably blur out
reddit's ink which is easily my favorite
android app for reddit it's just far and
away the most feature packed the Nexus 6
obviously has an AMOLED screen so it's
got an AMOLED mode which I adore which
is great for when I'm in bed the lights
are off and I try and stay on the chrome
beta sometimes some things break but I
run the Chrome Beta basically full-time
what else do we need to get into here
huh let's see what else is on my phone
Google opinion rewards if you haven't
used them I've got to 36 and play credit
but I've gotten a crazy amount of money
from answering these surveys that I
spend you know in the Play Store if
there's anything that I want to want to
purchase all right so I guess it's
probably time to take a look at that
gigantic games folder shall we so in
here we've got let me just rattle off a
bunch of the games in here because I
play a lot of them two dots which is
excellent for puzzle type games I played
that one with my wife a lot there's a
section which is a deck building game so
if you're into Dominion ascention is a
great digital choice Dominion doesn't
have a great Android option at the
moment hearthstone which I'm sure you're
very familiar with play a lot of that on
mobile their players have actually
gotten out of control on mobile they're
even more there than anywhere else got a
handful of multiplayer games here to
space team which is super fun you can
connect to other players right in your
vicinity and you're just constantly
yelling at one another what else we've
got in terms of multiplayer bounden
which is a game I like playing with my
wife a lot it basically forces you to
dance so you hold this end of the phone
I hold the other and we have to use the
accelerometer to get things to the right
place so much fun but playing a lot of
adventure capitalists which is a stupid
terrible game can't encourage you to get
it but I've been playing in a bunch I've
been playing a lot of alpha bear which
is a lot of fun it's a game from spry
Fox those guys are really really cool
this is kind of one of the games that
I've been it has become a kind of a
go-to when I have a free minute it's a
it's basically like a word game you've
got to figure out you know what words
you can make from what's actually on the
bored you can see here so like here you
can type you can write bait right but
then all the rest of the blocks are
gonna count down and the ones that hit
zero are gonna turn into rocks and
that's no good what else do we got
let's see fallout shelter obviously
fallout shelter if you're excited about
fallout 4 coming out soon
we've got agario which is a lot of fun
as well wave wave which if you're into
super hexagon is a great choice also
star realms which is another deck
building game I'm huge into deck
building games and of course I keep my
Humble Bundle app here as well because
there's just an incredible amount of
games that I've purchased over over the
years the Humble Bundle
and they're all great and all of them
but most of them are great inside the
app drawer I've got a handful of other
things but you'll see I try and keep
things for example like this destiny I
don't need this here I have it on my
home screen I like to hide things inside
the drawer it's I can just get all the
clutter out and behave as efficiently as
possible that's a quick look at my phone
thank you guys so much for watching I
hope you enjoyed it if you have anything
that you think I need to use need to run
anything fun or cheap or helpful or some
good games whatever you name it let us
know in the comments be kind to each
other down there and I will see you guys
