to you by Dollar Shave Club what's up
everyone John rent you from
TechnoBuffalo here well back there
episode of rumor roundup the Tyler
should probably give it away this to
show retake all the tech rivers from the
week and I just like just trash
compactors ah into just a condensed
little ball of rumor so you know what
could be coming what might be coming
what is potential to probably definitely
come sometime in the next 18 years up
this week looks like the Nexus lines not
dead yet Nexus 6 might be coming iphone
6 getting two new features that Android
already has there might be a brand new
Galaxy s5 coming you're that right a new
galaxy s5 not the existing one that just
came out a few months ago there's rumor
roundup let's start rounding things up
let's start with the king of Andhra at
least in my mind the Nexus line I love
me some Nexus phones and if fresh Nexus
6 reference has been found in the
chromium source code giving a
not-so-subtle hint that another device
might be coming the snippet doesn't give
much in the way of information but even
a small mention is kind of enough to let
us know that maybe they're not going to
kill the lineup we've heard rumors that
it ain't gonna happen anymore but now we
think the next slide I might live least
one more generation you've also seen
hints of a nexus 8 even popping up as
well we don't know much with the Nexus 6
so expect it to be based off of LG's
upcoming g3 which will be announced
later this month if it's true you can
anticipate with such excitement an
improved camera with optical image
stabilization or voice and higher
resolution screen although I wouldn't
imagine the designer for the nexus 5 to
change all that much this is assuming
though that LG will even be in charge
the nexus 6 referred rumors grumbling
around the htc's been in charge nexus 8
duty possibly decay in that google might
want to go for another manufacturer for
its smartphones maybe see getting them
at nexus 6 action aside from a quick
next 26 reference we really don't know
much but they're coming device but quick
matches a handset might be all the
interweb needs to kick off an avalanche
of Insider reports rumors and all that
kind of other business but Iowa's coming
soon perhaps we will see some Nexus 6
info we believe in hand went out to
everybody that's there I could use a new
phone so I was kind of fun but may
texas line will live on for these one
more generations to negate a stay of
execution you can see what lives on
longer and go for the ipod classic or
the nexus line you can just just place
your bets right now from android let's
jump over to iOS and it looks like iOS
is getting multi-window support so
perhaps Apple is running a thing or two
from the competitors in the tablet
market which again just shows my
competition is good for everyone before
we keep saying you should shut down
samsung you should shut down a poor in
google focus night staff competition
brings everything up so according to
report from our friends at 9to5 mac
earlier in the week in fact on tuesday
mappo is likely to add a new feature in
iOS 8 then I'll users to multi task
easier by running two apps side by side
like this this is side by side samsung
already as i'm sure you're well aware
offers its on its android tablet things
kind of one of the cool features i think
of windows 8 a 9to5 mac also set the
apples implementation isn't just a
multitasking though it's all about
allowing two apps interact with each
other easily which means you can move
content from one window to another super
easily at least allegedly so for example
if you've got a browser window open and
an email open you can for example copy
and paste text under contest from images
from one to the other which kind of you
can already do already but as you can
see them like each other that's kind of
cool i guess the news outlet did say
that developers do need to tweak the
existing code for the functionality to
work and that it's only going to work in
landscape mode so long way on danceOn
cap with stuff you can run both apps in
portrait mode as well just saying just
thrown it out there tonight 25 mac also
said the apple in vail iOS 8 hopefully
all the new functionality during WWDC in
june which i will be there for i think
of iOS 8 as being what OS 10 mavericks
was to OS 10 last year at least that's
what 9to5 mac assange so expect iOS to
get a california name don't don't really
so it should be served core improvements
i wouldn't expect a giant overall like
we're all hoping but multitasking with
multiple windows sounds like an i step
in right direction but maybe someone be
listening to this video give me a better
way to see information give me widgets
please speaking of things that android
add that Apple hasn't a new report from
bright wire offers up yet another claim
for the upcoming iPhone 6 I think the
best kind of source in the world mr.
anonymous the site claims Apple
include near field communications better
known as NFC in the upcoming iPhone 6
part of a deal with china unionpay to
set up a mobile payment network you
heard me right finally NFC 8 an iphone 6
you just give it wireless charging 2
i'll be super happy so iphone 6 owners
will allegedly be able to download a
special unionpay app within passbook
tech mobile payments at over 3 million
quick past machines across china
unionpay is the only domestic bank card
available in the country being the deal
could end up opening up a huge source of
revenue for Apple if they're allowed to
get you a tiny little cut of that that's
China what about the u.s. I'll be
surprised the apple launched their own
payment system perhaps they've acquired
a company quietly few years back that
might make mobile payments coming but
could you imagine just tapping your
phone and being able to pay for things
I'm sure your Android users can imagine
keep doing it for quite a few years with
google wallet but it's nice Avenue to
get some revenue certainly would add
features people are cross route them
they look at Android versus iOS before I
get to what's coming next on the iphone
look at his face you'll notice two
things first I'm so pale I'm see-through
and that I really don't like to shave
mostly it's because buying razors just
super sucks first you got to get in the
car and I hate going places you gotta
ask the people for the key to the
doohickey and they like look at you like
you're stealing stuff all I want is
razors and you got a shell out just a
ridiculous amount of money for some
unnecessary shape tech I think the one
of the last great is that i bought had
like a vibrating handle and like a laser
pointer that Lucy loved to play with but
fortunately there's a company that's
doing with all that silliness and
getting down to what matters that's the
blades it's called the Dollar Shave Club
they made it super simple for just a few
bucks a month Dollar Shave Club ships
really amazing quality razors and other
bathroom sundries to your door and their
blades are just as good as the big shape
companies at just a fraction the price
they sell all kinds of other
accoutrements that was my fancy word for
the day like dr. Carver shaved butter to
give you a smooth buttery shave which I
really need to go home and use my Dollar
Shave Club but i kept the beard for a
prop so you should shave time and shave
money join now with Dollar Shave Club
comsol I checked on buffalo you bring it
to your door you don't think go places
just makes life easier getting the
Dollar Shave Club dot-com /
technobuffalo now I will get back to the
room
so you know that brand new Galaxy s5 you
just bought and you're like oh come on
new phone so shiny and pretty and you're
just stroking your phone's fake hair it
might not be the new hotness for much
longer Samsung allegedly has a galaxy s5
prime you couldn't see but I kept saying
galaxy s5 rhyme like three times before
I got that right supposedly coming soon
but it's possible the device will launch
alongside a galaxy s5 lte-a or advanced
smartphone a new product page recently
surfaced on price dot-com HK which
refers to the phone my name provides
other specs well it's not official at
all it won't be ordinary Samsung
creeley's such a product because they
love releasing billion variants at
exactly the same product last year for
example samsung launched a galaxy s4
lte-a model for sk telecom a few months
after the galaxy s4 made its debut poof
LTE day lte-a devices are capable of
running on an LTE advanced networks
which are available in some parts of the
world but so far not here in the US of A
so the product page lists a phone under
the model number SMG 906 s super sexy
I'm suggest it's got 3 gigabytes of RAM
a much sharper 2560 x 1440 pixel
resolution Snapdragon 805 processor so
it should be blazing fast galaxy s5 just
so you remember has two gigs Aram in
1920 x 1080 display and in the US the
snapdragon 801 processor so's processor
is for stamp dragons better there's one
photo of the phone post it appears to
look kind of identical to the existing
galaxy s5 I would be surprised at all to
see a galaxy s5 LTE advanced phone
launched in their future but whether or
not sampling besides actually add a 2k
display better processor even more RAM
which is delicious so up in the air for
we know though right now the price
calmed HK site might just listing dream
specs or wrong specs all together but it
does sound super awesome and maybe
galaxy s 5 prime to come after that but
who knows what that's even going to have
maybe I'll just be sure of the u.s.
variant or a more international markets
sales re likes to release a ton of phone
so I put nothing past them what you guys
think we're excited about you excited
about the new iOS features iphone 6
getting some new hardware features maybe
a brand new galaxy s5 I wanna hear your
thoughts please leave the comments just
in my gentleman parts down here you guys
