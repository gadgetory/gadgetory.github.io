from TechnoBuffalo here is an unboxing
of the world's first 3d portable gaming
console this is a Nintendo 3ds let's go
ahead and see if it lives up to the hype
alright so let's take a quick look at
the box the 3ds is going to come in two
colors aqua blue or black of course I
have the black version prices are the
same those set at two $49.99 in the u.s.
prices might vary depending on what
country you are in so you got a picture
of the 3d S on the front looks very
similar to the outgoing portable model
the DSi you've got sort of DS logo we've
come to see with the representative two
screens got some specs on the back
talking about a new design and Ted vo
3ds camera it does take 3d pictures as
well using cameras on the back we've got
some information on face readers and air
games and all kinds of other stuff but
that's not overly exciting let's go
ahead and get into the box we will use
Senor stabby here to cut some of the
plastic seals there are two of them
slicer one slice through the other the
three BS we're very excited about having
a 3d game console 3d certainly now the
rage but it is definitely victim to not
having a flagship launch title games
like Mario and Zelda are coming out
later on in the year unfortunately
weren't available at launch so the
biggest games launched were goes to
recon there is street fighter game and
Lego Star Wars I'd say it's probably one
of the flagship titles as well there we
go let's go ahead and open this up I've
actually not seen one of these yet nor
did I have an outgoing DS or dsi so I'm
very curious to see how this lives up to
the hype and certainly the excitement
that surrounds it so Nintendo includes a
gigantic operations manual here so if
you want to go ahead and read that
see what else is gonna come in here
looks like there is air games AR card so
our AR game so you can download games
you get that use your Wii Points you've
got a Wii or you can buy them pull that
off here we've got or one of these is
gonna have the console it's off I think
that it's in the middle and there is the
console push it off to the side for just
a minute that will run through all the
specs on it probably the first time
we're gonna see it without fingerprints
you can see me in the reflection there
are those two cameras that we're talking
about feels very light in the hand to go
out and push that off beside for just a
moment and see what else you're gonna
get in the box
looks like this is a docking cradle for
charging if you'd like and go ahead and
see there's a picture of it goes and
sits right down there and will charge
and it appears that it uses a
proprietary port now let's take a look
and confirm if indeed it does because
you've got the charging brick it looks
almost mini USB style but I do not
believe that it is it is a Nintendo
prior tarry format I believe now we've
got the 3ds out of the box let's go
ahead and take a look at the console
itself it's got those two 3d capture
cameras right on the back kind of looks
like eyes have had a little nose and
mouth right there I'd be smiling at you
right now let's only four still pictures
it feels very light in the hand even
with the battery inside let's go ahead
and open it up and this is where all of
the 3d actions going to take place it is
a glasses three glasses-free 3d try
saying that few times fast glasses-free
3d glasses free 3d glasses free 3d
display so it's got a motion and
gyroscope sensor inside the top screen
which is the glasses-free 3d has a
resolution of 800 by 240 with 400 pixels
allocated for each eye to catch the 3d
the bottom is a resistive touch screen
meaning it's going to use a style so
take a look at that in just a moment
which has a resolution of the
20 by 240 there's a new way to control
the Nintendo DSi or 3ds rather I'm gonna
say that probably mix those two up
Nintendo 3ds Nintendo is calling this
the circle pad served as an analog stick
we've got the very classic now 4-way
navigation up-down left-right that we've
seen on pretty much every Nintendo
controller dating as far back is the
first Nintendo the Nintendo
Entertainment System which is still one
of my favorites
we've got your four buttons here X ba
and Y you've got what looks like LED
indicators these are actually physical
buttons that sort of depressed denoting
select home and start power button right
there you've got two speakers and you've
got a still camera for taking non 3d
pictures and when you take 3d pictures
by the way with those eyes on the back
of course you'd be able to view them
right here on the screen continuing our
tour we've got a 3.5 millimeter headset
jack the LED indicators you've got power
and charging if we keep going on to the
left
we're gonna have a microSD card it's
going to come installed with a 2 gig
card you can go ahead and update if you
want to download games or whatever
there's a ton of things that are
available you can use your Wii Points I
believe so if you've got a Wii or you've
got access to buying some weak points
you can use them here on your 3d s see
how many times I call this D S or the
DSi it's got a volume not really a
rocker but it's more of a lever on the
top this is where a lot of the action is
going to take place that's where you're
going to charge it this is where the
cartridge rig is gonna go we'll talk
about that in just a minute and talking
about that resistive touchscreen this is
a stylus you are going to use for that
if you've used a dsds i-dsi Lite DSi XL
or DS XL are gonna be very familiar with
this you use this when you're navigating
because it is resistive you do not have
to use the stylus you can try and use
your finger as well it makes its contact
through pressure we've seen the
resistive touchscreen using a lot of
smartphones a low a lot of touchscreen
technology in fact most touchscreen
technology has gone away from the
resistive method so we'll go ahead and
close this up
pop the styli
right back in place let's see what else
we've got looks like we've got an
infrared port you're gonna have two
shoulder buttons left and right for when
you're game so if you open it up
tell your hands are gonna sit they'll
naturally get access to those two
shoulder buttons and now that we have it
open let's take a look at 3d stuff this
is a 3d lever I uses something called
stereoscopic 3d if you remember baseball
cards that you get in the pack that sort
of look 3d as you move them
that's the similar technology here as I
tried to say my tongue twister no
glasses are needed here but you have to
be sitting at a right angle and be
viewing this at the right angle as well
to get them 3d effect yet to be seen
sort of how the 3d is going to work
unfortunately
I can't just snap some video of the
three and you guys will see it in 3d
just gonna look 2d unfortunately so if
you want to pick one of these guys up
it's going to set you back again to
$49.99 two colors aqua blue and black
this is of course the black version not
many big games at launch as I mentioned
the two that were most interesting to me
and I asked you guys on Twitter what you
thought should be picked up and the
first title that everybody said you
should try is this Super Street Fighter
4 and you can see that sort of baseball
card 3d technology I was talking about
the stereoscopic you can see kind of an
effect trail it's not gonna look 3d to
you but you can start to tell it when
you drag your finger over and you hear
that noise so I've got Super Street
Fighter 4 and I'm a huge Star Wars nerd
and I'm also not afraid to admit that I
do like the Lego games and this hasn't
gotten the best reviews but here is Lego
Star Wars 3 I have actually opened up to
save someone bucks in time Star Wars
some go ahead and show you what the box
is we're gonna look like tiny little
cartridges gonna go there you're gonna
get a book speaking of said tiny little
cartridge here it is and this is very
very very small fully backwards
compatible with DSD si si si light games
all that business are you gonna get
about three and a half to five hours of
battery life while using 3ds games a bit
more when you're using the backwards
compatible games let's go ahead and see
how the cartridge fits into this guy
assume it phases out and it does indeed
if you want eject it just go ahead and
push in let's go ahead and turn this
thing on I have already set up the date
and the wireless now that kind of
business this does have Wi-Fi
connectivity so go ahead and power I
don't want to show you the splash screen
and I'll show you some hands-on at the
video as well even though you're not
gonna be able to see 3d so I'll walk you
through and show you whether or not I
think that the 3d is even a parent
screen fighters in there you can see the
Street Fighter logo I'll it's probably
gonna look super weird on camera
every time you move when you see when
these in person the screen tends to
change a little bit like those baseball
cards we talked about so I know if we're
gonna get any effect on camera here you
look at that but very different and
weird all the 3d effect does seem to
work the bottom screen here is just your
standard resistive touchscreen no 3d
miss going on there so guys what do you
think about the Nintendo 3ds you excited
not excited you're waiting for the Sony
PSP to NGP whatever they're gonna end up
calling it I read like to hear what you
guys have to say of course I'll be doing
all kinds of impressions and stuff here
with the Nintendo 3ds I'm John Rhett
enger' from TechnoBuffalo you should
check out the website for all your tech
news and I'll see the next video bye bye
