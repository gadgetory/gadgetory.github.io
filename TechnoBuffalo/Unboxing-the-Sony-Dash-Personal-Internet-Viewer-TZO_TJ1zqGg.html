technobuffalo here at that unboxing for
you of the sony dash personal internet
viewer is something we took a look at at
CES back in january essentially what it
is is a 7-inch capacitive touchscreen
running on top of chum be sort of app
driven operating system so you get
access to a thousand or so of free
application let me go and show you what
all those are and sort of do a
walk-through on go through the specs as
we get to be unboxing so of course we
use the obligatory back and we will cut
through this and this is a demo unit
ascent from sony this is going to run
you one hundred ninety nine dollars and
it is available now from sony style or
stony stores or other third-party
retailers the best buy's carrying it as
well go ahead and top of the plastic one
more time let go let's go and take a
look at it the form factor is going to
be very reminiscent else they probably
have in your house take up on the
plastic and here is the sony dash also
evidently called the h I dc-10 so let's
take a look at the box will throw the
cardboard off to the side that's not
terribly exciting so you've got a
picture of the device on the front there
is the sony dash let me know that it's
got Wi-Fi first linda of your son√≠s
make-believe slogan turn up some places
that can be used on the side I'll oh
here it looks like the power cord is
hidden this actually does need a power
plug in to work there isn't any sort of
battery option there's some example of
some of the applications of things runs
which includes Netflix Amazon you can
pull in Facebook Twitter Pandora and
it's hun of other kind of cool and
useful because i think is going to be
useful a web application to letting you
know that it is using chum bees services
so over a thousand free app stay
connected social networking news
calendars start your day and all that
goodness so let's go ahead and rip this
open
cut the plastic at least attempt to cut
the classic area and I will run through
the specs as we take a look at the sony
dash so as i mentioned it is a 7-inch
capacitive display on the front which is
quite nice with a wvga resolution which
means 800 x 480 it was just projected
capacitive technology essentially a
fancy way to say at the passenger screen
it supports all kinds of video format
that will stream to it windows media
video microsoft bc one mpeg-4 it weighs
about 1.2 pounds hardware wadis it's got
the accelerometer support for a vertical
flip and Wi-Fi at 802 11 BMG so no end
in here but BMG should take care of your
streaming let's go ahead and open this
thing up see how it opens up there you
go right from the top I need to slide
down so they difficult in box and turns
I'm say oh there it is right at the
front go ahead and lift that top off and
here we've got some sony dash booklets
probably never going to look at that
first off to the side and here is the
sony dash itself see else we got here is
your power brick you can see the size of
said power brick and justin
documentation nothing that i really want
to take a look at so let's look at the
sony dash that's going to look like i
mentioned earlier like a very familiar
device it looks like an alarm clock and
in fact you can use it as an alarm clock
because the top of it has a very big
menu and snooze button and that's
actually where you're controlling is
going to be from from this top button
the volume up and down and of course a
7-inch touchscreen so he gives as alarm
clock and wake up to Pandora or check
the weather would never be like right
next to your bed and all screws
everything wirelessly and I'll do a full
demonstration in the review to show you
how the dash actually works and how it
implements sort of apps with it so the
top as mentioned we've got your menu and
volume up and down on the left side
you've got this rubber port which I
assume house is a USB port and a looks
like a 3.5 millimeter headset jack you
want to plug this in and take it to the
gym you can rock out here music there's
the power port on the bottom nothing on
the other side and sort of a venting
port on the back and does have
accelerometer so you can sort of watch
it like this you could turn it over like
that sort of watch a movie it's shaped
like a wedge some kind of gears to check
this out i'm actually going to put this
in my kitchen and see if it'll be a
useful thing to pull in recipes and see
what facebook is getting updated to
without ever having to go to my computer
or tablet device always have it on
that's way to tell time I'm in the
kitchen as well so I think for 200 bucks
we'll see if it's worth while other is
of course at a big speaker down there as
well and you can watch netflix and
through the amazon unbox stuff right on
the screen which you may want to well
there is no way at least as of right now
to export this to a larger screen and I
guys leave your questions down below
what you want to see back the sony dash
very curious to check it out any weight
and jon rettinger from TechnoBuffalo and
I'll see in the next video bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
