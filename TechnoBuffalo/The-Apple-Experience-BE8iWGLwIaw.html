to you by Atlassian what is up guys
brawn pretty here from TechnoBuffalo and
if you guys have been paying attention
monday was the Apple event it's up in
Cupertino we're located down in Southern
California and I've never been to an
Apple event so while John covered the
new iPhone and the new iPad I wanted to
do a little vlog style video covering my
trip in my experience as a first timer
at an Apple event and share that with
you guys considering a lot of you
probably haven't had that opportunity
either so we are located in Southern
California meaning we had to fly up now
while I thought fly I meant commercial
flight that being said we got to go
private which was crazy I've never flown
private before it was such a cool
experience a little bit trippy looking
over your shoulder and seeing the pilot
amazing nonetheless we got up there and
drove up to the Apple campus got there
pretty quickly and we're immediately
taken by our hosts to the executive
floor now it sounds self-explanatory but
I did trip out a little bit when she was
like yeah Tim's office is up here what
she meant was Tim Cook Apple CEO and
Steve Jobs off is also used to be on
this floor so lot of history and
speaking of history that's kind of the
gist I got from Apple Campus as you walk
around you see a ton of massive black
and white photos of Steve Jobs quotes
that he said really really cool stuff we
made our way to the town hall in the
infinite loop of one which is where the
event was hosted and immediately Tim
Cook took the stage now we were very
lucky and got close to front-row seats
we got second row seats because from
rows for executives only and so right in
front of us was Phil Schiller at EQ Tim
Cook just awesome group of people who
you normally always see on stage those
kind of trippy seeing them in person
couple cool things that happen during
the event were not the product
announcements but a woman named Lisa
actually announced Liam who is a robot
he deconstructs old iPhones in their
effort to treat the environment better
and go 100 percent renewable energy they
said that over the last two years
they've gotten to 93 percent renewable
energy so good for them
next stop is the press room where we get
our hands on with the devices now this
is mayhem in here people who are in the
press are very very thirsty for products
and so it's very hard to maneuver around
that being said I managed to do so my
thoughts on the iPhone se er the it's a
really cool device for people who are
coming in at a low budget and for new
emerging markets across the world that
being said for us it's really nothing
new or interesting it's an iPhone 5s
with some upgraded innards from these 6s
so that is that as per the iPad pro it's
never really been the device for me and
part of what I understood was that what
made the iPad pro pro was the large
display along with the process and what
they've done is shrunk it down now to
the nine point seven inch essentially
cannibalized the iPad air 2 which has
now been demoted to a sort of last gen
device I don't mind the features being
added to the iPad pro now I just don't
like the way they pitched it as this is
a full-on pro device during the
conference although if you guys want
more on my beef with Apple and the word
Pro check out the link above on my rant
about it one thing John didn't get to
mention in his two videos were the Apple
watch bands now Apple just came out with
their new nylon band and a couple other
colors and combinations of leather and
other Melanie's bands the black
Melanie's they all look pretty cool they
all look fine I don't really want to
comment in the looks because it's really
such a personal preference thing and
there's so many different options people
have different tastes when it comes to
fashion so do what suits you but as a
whole everything felt high-quality the
nylon bands I've heard are gonna be
coming in at $50 which is a little bit
overpriced or a lot overpriced for nylon
bands then again it's Apple so what do
you really expect the black Milanese
band will be priced at a hundred and
fifty dollars just like the silver one
so that pricing stays the same
so that was pretty much it those are my
experiences at the Apple event as a
first-timer the event was really cool
flying private was awesome
once-in-a-lifetime experience the event
itself asked for the products were
pretty underwhelming if I'm honest we
did get to hit up the Apple Retail Store
on campus on our way out which is the
only retail store where they sell
merchandise branded by Apple's so Andrew
did pick up a Apple mug I resisted and
the rest of the story ends with me
sitting editing recording this voice
over and trying to get this video to you
guys so let me know what you think in
the comments below do you guys like this
sort of story oriented videos we get to
do a lot of really cool things working
in tech journalism and you guys don't
really get to see it or experience it so
sometimes I just think it's cool to
share these unique experiences with you
guys but let me know if you're
interested if you're not if you hate it
please let me know in the comments below
be sure to check out John's coverage of
the Apple event as well I'll see you
