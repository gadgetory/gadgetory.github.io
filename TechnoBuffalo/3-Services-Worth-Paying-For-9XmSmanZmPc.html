from TechnoBuffalo and the reason that
you're looking at money on the screen is
because today I'm going to be talking
about three services three paid services
that I think are well worth your money
so first off we have Google Play Music
and YouTube red the reason I package
these two together is I don't think most
people know but you can buy google play
music for $9.99 a month and get YouTube
read for free I actually didn't know
this one was using Spotify and Apple
music beforehand but after finding this
out this is a great bargain for me
Google Play Music has pretty much all
the same music that Spotify has so they
have a huge library in addition you get
a youtube red so you get Ad free youtube
viewing and one of my favorites is you
can actually lock your phone and still
have the video playing in the background
without having to waste data on the
video feed so you can listen to it
pretty much like a podcast next we have
an app that should get your comm on it's
called headspace well that's ironic cuz
calm as a competitor but headspace it's
a meditation app they actually have a
monthly subscription of $12.99 or $7.99
depending on how many months you
subscribe for if you're going
month-to-month it's $12.99 so it's not
the cheapest subscription out there but
I've been getting into meditating
recently and I highly recommend it by
subscribing to their service you're
unlocking all sorts of meditation and a
sort of progressive plan that'll go with
you so it'll go day by day and they'll
be teaching you something new every
single day I think it's a great way just
to calm down just literally calm your
nerves and just continue throughout your
day with a better mindset and more
headspace and last but not least we have
something that's not necessarily a paid
service if you don't want it to be but a
place that you can spend money where I
think is worth it and that is Vimeo so
obviously you guys are watching this on
YouTube and YouTube is great for certain
types of content however as of the late
YouTube's algorithms have really been
irritating me whenever I go on my
homepage I always get the same types of
videos over and over and over again
Vimeo on the other hand is awesome from
their staff pics to now their on-demand
content I'm a huge fan of the
documentaries and films you'll get from
independent filmmakers very famous
filmmakers - nobodies we're just putting
out great content Vimy does a really
good job of highlighting things that
might be interesting to you and yeah
you'll have to spend a dollar two
dollars to rent a movie maybe more
sometimes you have to buy episodes of a
TV series but I think it's really worth
it you'll see some genuinely creative
and artistic content that you won't find
anywhere else on the Internet and so
that's it for this video guys those are
three services that I pay for that I do
not regret ever I'm a big fan let me
know what you guys think in the comments
down below what are paid services that
you spend your money on that you think
are worth it I'm very curious to hear
again let us know in the comments down
below give us a thumbs up if you want
more videos like this and I'll do more
recommendations of things I love and use
hit subscribe for more tech content I'll
see you guys in the next one thank you
for watching and before letting you guys
go I do want to give a quick shout out
to our friends at Squarespace they are
another paid service that I think is
extremely worth in that I use personally
for my own portfolio website what I love
about Squarespace is they've put the
power of design at your fingertips

involving code things that are
intimidating or that may hinder the
design process if you sign up for a year
