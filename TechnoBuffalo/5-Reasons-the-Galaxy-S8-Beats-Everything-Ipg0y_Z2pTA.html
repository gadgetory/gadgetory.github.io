s 8 plus for the better part of like two
and a half three days not enough time to
do a full review which is coming and if
it's out when you watch this video I'll
link to it up here but the more research
I do on the phone somewhere I realize
there's a ton of incredible technology
that goes way beyond the iOS or Android
debate just as a piece of tech there's a
lot of firsts or almost first at
Samsung's credence to a really thin
package so do you buy a smartphone you
want something that's going to last you
1224 months be future proofing usually
with that you think of RAM you think of
processor screen and that kind of stuff
what you might not think about the data
speeds that's not just reliant on the
amount of bars you have or the amount of
bulbs you got pending on what OS you're
using got a lot of balls the Galaxy s8
I'm just going to say Galaxy sa for the
Sigma talking about f8 si+ are amongst
the first phones in the world the PAX 2
really unique and very different LLC
technologies are going to net you just
faster data speeds at least eventually
the first one is LTE you then for LTE on
license essentially what cares you'll be
able to do is use the five gigahertz
sort of spectrum is reserved for Wi-Fi
to put small cells in crowded areas to
give you better network in really busy
areas so that's awesome first one that
supported that at least as of right now
two Mobile's the first network that turn
some of those things on and perhaps more
paradigm-shifting is actually going to
be shipping with gigabit LTE
capabilities and actually the s7 s7 edge
or the first phones that shipped with
the four antennas necessary might have
heard like four bytes learn MIMO before
they weren't turned on it launched these
are on an active at log at least at
t-mobile so I'm going to try and not get
that and nerdy but I've been doing a lot
of research on this I spoke to folks at
Qualcomm learn more about technology
it's pretty awesome so gigabit LTE
you're going to theoretically get a
thousand gigabits per second really fast
speeds they're not really going to get
that theoretical number you probably get
around 200 to 300 if the tower is active
but where I think this is a really cool
essentially going to be the backbone of
what 5g is going to be it's going to be
simultaneously connected to 5g can get
you Penelope
so most of what you'll get when 5g is
out is actually going to be the gigabit
LTE that your phone the Galaxy s8
already has
and Bluetooth 5.0 is on this phone and
that might be a big paradigm shift for
you guys as well and it was definitely
kind of I think it's going to be a big
one for me so first you get to
simultaneous streams so you and a buddy
can vocab listening to music bluetooth
headphones control it separately which
is pretty awesome but I get four times
the range a Bluetooth 4.2 so if you
leave your phone and you walk far away
you'll be fine you're also going to get
twice the data transfer speeds as well
as 4.2 so do a lot of data transfer via
bluetooth and pictures you're going to
really appreciate what they daleks pf8
has done the screen on the Galaxy s8
Samsung has always had pretty awesome
screens but the s8 is unique for a few
reasons first it goes to a thousand nits
which is a lot of nits what that's going
to mean for real-world usage is in
direct sunlight it's going to look
really bright you can actually see it
when you're outside and that I've tested
and it does look really good when the
sun's hitting directly on it also mobile
HDR so if you extreme lot of Netflix
shows or anything else at the ports
mobile HCR
it looks really incredible on the
display keeping up with the nerd theme
of this video let's talk nanometer
process size whether you get the Exynos
88-90 5 with a Snapdragon 835 versions
of the Galaxy s8 those things are tiny
10 nanometers so they are 4 nanometers
smaller than was already the smallest
chip that out there that's going to
means you get better performance
presumably better battery life in a
smaller package which means a phone can
be this thin and still give really
awesome performance which I'm still
testing
so I'll attribute that to just spec
sheet and a real-world usage actually
vented review I'll let you guys know
there's a lot of really cool things
about the galaxy I hope you can look at
it not depending on what OS you prefer
whether it's Android or iOS that's a
piece of technology as a piece of tech
that's pushing the envelope forwards
sampling did a lot of really cool things
here and did a lot of things right a lot
of things that make me excited about the
galaxy Fe and really Tech in general so
what do you guys think what are you
excited about any of these things you're
like hell yeah one gigabit LG or what
the hell is LTE you i've never heard
about it the comments down below and let
us know and course the video a thumbs up
it really helps so next time Jon Ranger
