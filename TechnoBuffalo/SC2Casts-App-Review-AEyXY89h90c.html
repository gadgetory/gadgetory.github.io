technobuffalo and this application of
you goes out 10 if you starcraft two
players as today I will be reviewing the
SE to cast application for the iphone if
you do a quick search for starcraft 2
you will see sc2 cast in the number one
spot for 399 and after checking out the
screenshots I thought to myself 399 for
a bunch of YouTube replays that I can
you know just watch on youtube it might
not be worth it but I decided to give it
a chance once you open up the
application you can see all of the
latest casts ranked in chronological
order and something right off the bat
that I'm pretty sure a lot of starcraft
two players will appreciate would be
that you can see the symbols of the
races within the replay which is really
important if you know you want to study
certain replays to improve your game
let's open up a replay here you see my
man psy vs NRG vibe and you will see the
youtube video here and you can also
thumbs up the video which is a little
you know needs a little bit of tweaking
but it does work and if you press play
it'll open up the video in the youtube
video player which is very very slick
and very very iphone asked which is
something i really appreciate you can
also view the replays by top rated here
we see the top rated replays up today
the week the month and even of all time
and of course the top rated replay of
all time would be boxer vs fruitdealer
to legendary Starcraft players you can
even browse replays by player by castor
and by events and I got to give a shout
out here to my men artosis probably one
of the best starcraft 2 casters are
definitely my favorite and you can see
the list of all of its casted games
right here oh I drove vs OGS hero that
was a really really good game by the way
and you can even do a search and I'm
going to search for our ptosis here and
you should be able to see all the games
that he has casted and because i am a
zerg player i'm going to be searching
for i drew here who is probably one of
the more well-known Zerg players and you
should be able to see all of Idris games
I drove vs. Huck here and something I
really really appreciate would be that
you'd be able to favorite a replay you
know just in case you thought that game
was uber ultra awesome and of course
you'd be able to check out all of your
favorite games by tapping on favorites
overall this application is super
awesome and it's definitely worth 399 in
fact i'd pay 399 again to get a desktop
version of this application
obviously this application is for
everyone but it's really neat for those
of you who like watching starcraft 2
replays and a huge shout out to my
friend Phil for introducing starcraft 2
to me about two months ago I'm still
really new to the game I'm a total noob
you guys would probably destroy me but
I'm trying to learn so i guess that
counts so if you guys have any other
applications that you have in mind that
you would like me to take a look at feel
free to leave a comment down below and
yes i do read them it's just this time i
wanted to cover something starcraft
related so anyways I hope you guys
enjoyed this review video this was john
q from TechnoBuffalo and see you guys
next time when i have enough men aroused
because it's never enough minerals
starcraft 2 reference you guys probably
don't get it unless you play the game
all right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
