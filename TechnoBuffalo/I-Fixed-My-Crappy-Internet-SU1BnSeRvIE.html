called do not buy Google Wi-Fi for
obvious reasons it just did not work for
me
I thought a met justin was going to be
the perfect router answer to my lack of
signal strength throughout my home and
Google Wi-Fi just disappointed so in the
interim since that video came out I sort
of promised I was gonna test other
systems and I have tested gyro I have
tested amplify and I've tested or B all
with the same degree of kind of not
working so the folks at Asus reached out
and wants me to check out their mesh
system this is the Lyra so they did send
this to us for review but I only agreed
to do it if I could give 100% my honest
opinion everything I thought about it so
this is gonna cover the pros the cons
the good and Bad's about the Asus lyre
system and I guess kind of mesh Wi-Fi
and you know if you don't know what a
mess just amazed essentially it takes
like one access point and I'll sort of
send out signals to other access points
or make a broader mesh networks you get
a Wi-Fi signal where maybe you wouldn't
get it elsewhere it's definitely not a
perfect system it's not like having a
hard wired connection I still have a
signal dropped from about the 800 that I
have when I hardwired in to about 400
that 50% signal drop is still almost 200
percent better when I had on any of the
other mesh systems so here is the Asus
Lyra all all glowy and blue it's around
an oculus disk you can get one it'll
cover about 2,000 square feet 2-pack
will cover between like 2 and 4 thousand
square feet and a 3 pack will be covered
between 4,000 and 6,000 square feet so
I've got a loft area upstairs and my
kids play that's where I main access
point is then I've got another one set
up downstairs by my TV it's where a lot
of my streaming happens and then one
sort of off towards my garage creating a
triangle pattern which is what they
recommend things have been pretty solid
with it actually and I'll be using it
for the better part of two weeks
it's powered by a proprietary power
cable I sort of wished it would have
been microUSB your USB see what the
moral is it actually works well and I've
been waiting to make another mesh
network video so I found it actually
works so the app can do a lot of stuff
at I you sort of control of how you set
it up the setup was super simple you
pretty much plug it in get download the
app for iOS or Android and walk you
through a very simple
steps i booked from there you get a
little bit more granular control it's
8:02 11ac and just create sort of one
hour a little smartness or pick which
you should be on it it also lets you
control what devices are connected so if
like your kids not doing their homework
you can just turn off their iPad and
turn off the tablet if you get a lot of
control that way a lot of parental
controls with the software outside of
that there's not much else that you can
do a really neat to do the very sort of
the motto here is it's very simple
they've also implemented a lot of
security here for worried about network
intrusions I've got commercial grade
security built in I have not tested that
I hope that I never have to but I like I
guess to know that it's got commercial
grade security built in I didn't get too
much of the technical aspects of how the
mesh router system work to kind of
approach it from a consumer standpoint
if you want to know really how these
things work and you want to get into the
technology behind it Linus tech tips and
Austin Evans do incredible jobs for
breaking down the technology but for me
I just want something I was gonna work I
want you to be able to use my phone I
went outside I want to be able to stream
movies downstairs my family that was
really all I needed and surprisingly was
damn hard to find a system that works
the Asus Lyra actually did it so if
you're looking for a mesh system
consider the Asus Lyra and maybe my
house is like purgatory for Wi-Fi and
maybe I'm an outlier maybe other systems
will work for you but for me it's been
the most perfect mesh system that I've
tried so if you want a mesh system
that's going to work it's not going to
be an eyesore of Asus IRA is a really
good option and a good way to go</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
