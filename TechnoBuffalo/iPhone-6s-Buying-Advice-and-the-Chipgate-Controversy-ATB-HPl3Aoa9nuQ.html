to you dear friends by domain.com what's
up everyone walkabout there episode of
asta Buffalo I am your host John Rangers
the show where I send my ever growing
but in this couch and answer your tech
questions first one comes from Louis
Rosario who asks at John Ford Lakers
should I upgrade from my iPhone 6 plus
to the iPhone 6s plus thanks well to you
I say check out our review because I
answer that question but spoiler alert
no you should not upgrade save that
money don't let it burn hole in your
pocket save it for next year next one
comes from at all things gizmo I like
your name by the way who asks at John
four Lakers do you think Google will
start manufacturing their own phones and
stop using other OEMs for Nexus devices
Google's done this in the past they're
their pixel line has been built sort of
in-house and the new pixel see the
tablet sort of built in-house but I
don't think the Nexus line will ever go
that route google has been using it as a
way to reward OMS for their work or some
sort of new feature that they're putting
out they want to be a flagship for the
next generation Nexus devices the Nexus
devices are usually the reference phone
for the whole rest of the year for what
androids going to be able to do at least
as Google intends it so equals e OEMs
continue to make Nexus phones but maybe
we'll see like a third Nexus device or a
second one pay on generation that's made
just by Google fingers crossed but I
wouldn't hold your breath everybody
wants to start a website my grandmother
has two of her own and trying to figure
out where you go to start the website
can be tough domain.com is a place to go
in that next just brilliant idea just
lightning bolts into your head it's
one-stop shopping for everything you
need for your domain from web hosting

kinds of other stuff so if you had the
idea for the next crazy like dot ninja
web site go check out the main comm and
save 20% on domain names and web hosting

TechnoBuffalo all one word at domain
comms check out when you think domain
names think domain.com it's in the name
this is a question I got asked a ton
comes from I Nick 17 you ass
at John four Lakers what's your personal
opinion on chip gate and do you think
you've experienced the difference with
the iPhone six units that you've tested
Apple II use two different suppliers for
the a9 chips in the latest iPhones the
iPhone 6s the iPhone 6s plus TSMC and
Samsung tsmc stands for Taiwan
Semiconductor Manufacturing Company the
40 nanometer a nine chips are bigger
than Samsung's twelve nanometer a nine
chips so what does all that nanometer
and a nine stuff mean for you if you
have an iPhone 6s or 6s plus the tsmc
chip you might get an extra two hours of
battery life on your device I know it
seems crazy that Apple and Samsung we're
working together
nd I'm battling than each other in court
for the better part of half of a decade
but they both need each other they
continued to work together this like a
lot of things that ended gate is being
blown we add a proportion
we actually have phones with both
processors there a ton of apps and
website you can figure out what
processor you've been using the iPhone
6s plus I've been testing has a Samsung
chip and our iPhone 6s has the TSMC chip
and the battery life has been pretty
close I wouldn't know was looking for
something just relax take a deep breath
enjoy your phone you're gonna be fine
just a phone
I think it's blown way we at proportion
valued life differences are nothing
drastic so don't don't worry software
optimizations in an upcoming OS updates
should fix any sort of lingering issue
either so don't sweat it
that that's my like John rhett and your
official mantra for chip Kade don't
sweat it
it's good for day outside anyway thank
you guys for watching hope you enjoyed
until next time I'm John Ranger from
TechnoBuffalo see you guys in next video
