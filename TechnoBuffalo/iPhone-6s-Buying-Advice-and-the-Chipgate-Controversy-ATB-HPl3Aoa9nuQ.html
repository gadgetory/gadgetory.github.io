to you dear friends by domain.com what's
up everyone walk about their episode of
asta buffalo i am your host John Rangers
to show where I said my ever growing but
in this couch and answer your tech
questions first one comes from luis
rosario who asked at john for laker
should i upgrade from my iphone six-plus
to the iphone 6s plus thanks well to you
I say check out our review because I
answered that question but spoiler alert
no you should not upgrade say that money
don't let it burn hole in your pocket so
here for next year next one comes from
at all things gizmo I like your name by
the way who asks at John for lakers do
you think Google will start
manufacturing their own phones and stop
using other OEM Nexus devices Google's
done this in the past there there pixel
line has been built sort of in-house and
the new pixel see the tablet sort of
built-in house but i don't think the
nexus line will ever go that route
Google's been using it as a way to
reward OEMs for their work or some sort
of new feature that they're putting out
they want to be a flagship for the next
generation Nexus devices these exes
devices are usually the reference phone
for the whole rest of the year for what
android is going to be able to do at
least as google intends it so i think
we'll see OEMs continue acidic Nexus
phones but maybe we'll see like a third
Nexus device or a second one pay on
generation that's made just by Google
fingers crossed but I wouldn't hold your
breath everybody wants to start a
website my grandmother has two of our
own trying to figure out where you go to
start the website can be tough domain
com is a place to go on that next just
brilliant idea just lightning bolts into
your head it's one-stop shopping for
everything you need for your domain from
web hosting an email and everything in
between also there the 200-plus domain
name extensions that are happening now
like dot ninja for example dot NYC dot
website and all kinds of other stuff so
if you have the idea for the next crazy
like dot ninja website go check out the
main calm and save twenty percent on
domain names and web hosting we just use
the coupon code technobuffalo all one
word at domain comms check out when you
think domain names just think domain com
it's in the name this is a question I
got asked a ton comes from I Nick 17 you
ask
@john for lakers what's your personal
opinion on chip gate and you think
you've experienced the difference with
the iphone 6 units that you've tested
Apple use two different suppliers for
the a9 chips in the latest iPhones the
iphone success the iphone 6s plus TSMC
and samsung TSMC stands for taiwan
semiconductor manufacturing company the
40 nanometer a 9 chips are bigger than
Samsung's 12 nanometer a9 chips so what
does all that nanometer and a 9 stuff
mean for you if you have an iPhone 6s 6s
plus with TSMC chip you might get an
extra two hours of battery life on your
device I know it seems crazy that Apple
and Samsung you're working together
Cindy I'm battling each other in court
for the better part of half of a decade
but they both need each other I continue
to work together this like a lot of
things that ending gate is being blown
we add a proportion we actually have
phones with both processors there are a
ton of apps and web site you can figure
out what processor you've been using the
iphone 6s plus I've been testing as a
samsung chip and our iphone 6s has the
TSMC chip and the battery life has been
pretty close I wouldn't know was looking
for something just relax take a deep
breath enjoy your phone you're gonna be
fine just phone I think it's blown way
we add proportion valued life
differences are nothing drastic so don't
don't worry software authorizations in
an upcoming OS updates should fix any
sort of lingering issue either so don't
sweat it that that's my like jon
rettinger official mantra for chip Kate
don't sweat it it's good day outside
anyway thank you guys for watching hope
you enjoyed on till next time John
Ranger from technobuffalo see you guys
in next video Oh
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
