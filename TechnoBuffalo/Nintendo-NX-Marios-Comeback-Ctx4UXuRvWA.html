technobuffalo and over the last couple
of years unfortunately Nintendo has been
disappointing us a little bit with their
game consoles more recently with the Wii
U which wasn't really up to snuff for me
and a lot of you guys that being said
Nintendo is trying to win a place in our
hearts again with the code named NX and
that's what I'm here for today to
discuss some rumors we've heard some
things we haven't heard sort of get the
speculation started and really good feel
for what you guys are looking for as
well let's go ahead an get started first
off we have the sort of direction the
president of Nintendo has said that is
not going to be successor to the 3d s or
the wii u they said it's completely new
it's something completely different in a
new direction so that's pretty
interesting I don't know if we're going
to get some kind of hybrid console or
really what direction they're taking it
in but who knows definitely looking
forward to it what we do know however
are the dates it's going to release in
March of 2017 the reason it's been
pushed back is Lou Nintendo can develop
more games more games or release means
they come out the gate with more fire
good stuff for us more games to play so
that's very exciting as well something
else we do know is that Nintendo is
going to be making a profit on this so
they're either going to be pricing it we
can only speculate either lower and give
you a sort of cheaper console that isn't
hardware wise as powerful but making
experience good and then price it up
obviously or go for the top-end really
attacked Microsoft and Sony in that
high-end gaming realm and go for
something around five to six hundred
dollars potentially that's just
speculation not a fact one thing we do
know is that Nintendo might be going
back to the sort of cartridge system so
I don't know if they're doing it for a
nostalgia or if it's some kind of
updated cartridge or if it's not really
a cartridge casing their cartridge I
don't know what they're trying to go for
there but potentially exciting once we
get more details on that and last but
not least to sort of lube back to where
we roughly started which was with
release dates Nintendo is not going to
be announcing anything at e3 about the
NX they will however be talking about
getting Zelda onto the wii u and that
whole development so that should be cool
but you're gonna have to wait for more
NX news but let me know down in the
comments below what you guys are looking
forward to very curious to hear your
thoughts very curious to sort of start
this conversation get the hype ready

guys the next one thank you so much for
