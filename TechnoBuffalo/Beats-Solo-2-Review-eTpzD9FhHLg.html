to you by go daddy what is love baby
yeah
what's up everyone john wrench from
TechnoBuffalo here and i am not just
trying to look this cool i've got a
review for you of these guys these are
the beats solo2 that little logo on a
company behind it has been all over the
news the past couple of weeks let's go
ahead and see what I guess Apple's
latest has to offer I'd love to jump
right in and talk about comfort if they
got to sit on your head you got to make
sure they feel good so I've done at
least I think normal years I don't have
giant ears they're just kind of regular
normal ears so they added a ton more
cushion to the solo twos to help prevent
leakage sound in and stand out and to me
they sound almost like they have a noise
cancelling if you don't want that though
you gotta sit up to the studios but they
sounded really really good and I put
these on I'm probably yelling right now
and I snap it's really hard to even hear
the snaps I probably just make you guys
all deaf because I was you know
screaming the earcup on these things
isn't flat so you're kind of has to bend
a little bit when it sits on top of it
when I first got this and tried these on
they were really tight and they hurt so
she wasn't wearing glasses cuz my
eyesight is not so good but after two
weeks they kind of got broken in and now
they're way way more comfortable I
couldn't wear these initially more than
about 20 or 30 minutes at a time before
just really hurt now though no problem
at all the rubber cushion here on top is
the same as the solar ones but it's
still more than enough so I'm not the
biggest audio guy in the world I like my
music to sound crisp clear and without
interference that's really it and for
that the beats are great I was using a
pair of bose soundtrue headphones which
are way more comfortable but when
comparing the audio to the beats the
beats blow them away I always thought
that the bose sounds good today I heard
this and I could hear so much more of
the sound which is really impressive and
certainly you know what you'd expect
from a pair of headphones that cost
about 200 bucks they look to be super
durable sort of they can Bend pretty
easily they do fold
they don't fold flat then you've come
with a carrying case and then you come
with a 3.5 millimeter headset cable
which also has an inline mic and those
controls so that's kind of nice take a
quick second to think of friends and

out goo get e for more details we just
did the audio I tested amongst a variety
of sources so first and foremost there
was a lot of YouTube being watches
plugged directly into it we put that in
their leader headset jack on my iMac so
YouTube but all it's not a great I
listen to music directly from iTunes
listen to Spotify and everything sounded
really good also threw in some iTunes
radio in there and also I ripped some
CDs and played that music back to the
computer everything sounded really
really solid I'll talk to her described
sound but there was no interference it
was crisp it was clear you could really
hear the bass and I think beats did a
really nice job with these all that
though still a steep price to pay at 200
bucks in they do come in a variety of
pretty colors but if you are willing to
pony up that money for this kind of
headphones I don't think you're gonna be
disappointed I really like these as much
as I love my bows I think these are now
my go-to headphones hey I got aside if
you don't mind having that beats logo
around your neck you can get the more
subtle black and go for bright red
whatever you want but no they do sound
really good the value though is really
gonna be your decision 200 bucks is what
you expect to pay for headphones or not
for me though I think there are great
pair of headphones now it's certainly
recommended thank you guys for watching
