technobuffalo we're here at the asuste
press conference at CES 2015 wear suits
just announced this see a serious
transformer butchy this is the t100
model see it pops off here they're all
transformer so you have the keyboard and
the laptop separate just put it back on
but as I'm doing that you can see
there's a full-size keyboard so then it
just pops right on you have like a sort
of a laptop here the full-size keyboard
it's running on intel atom processor
clocked at 1.46 gigahertz if Windows 8.1
on here you can see the touch screen
display I'm kind of moving around there
that's a 10.1 inch display by the way
1920 x 1200 IPS under the hood you have
intel HD graphics that has support for
DirectX 11 which is pretty nice 802 11
ABG and n Wi-Fi up front you have a 2
megapixel camera right here looking at
us and then on the back there's a
5-megapixel camera there with autofocus
and then we'll just move around real
quick and see there's a micro USB
charging slot the 3.5 millimeter
headphone jack and it looks like a power
button or a windows button yeah that's
just a windows button there brings you
that's kind of nice right to the desktop
or home volume control keys nothing up
top here looks like a little microphone
on the right hand side we have looks
like USB 3.0 HDMI out and a microSD card
slot and then nothing on the keyboard
itself aside from that USB micro USB
charging port so that you can you know
charge the keyboard obviously so pretty
thin
pretty light kind of reminds me of some
of the notebooks or our netbooks kind of
devices that were announced at a far
earlier this year so any case that's a
quick look here at the asuste
transformer Butchie this is the tea 100g
