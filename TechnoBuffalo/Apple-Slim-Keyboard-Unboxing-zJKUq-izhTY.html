have watched if it was out there so
maybe you will too I'll do a review for
you guys also after i use it seems
worthwhile the new style works or
doesn't work anyway I got a keyboard
because I picked up a external monitor
so i could use dual screens and a much
easier to have a keyboard so here it is

much it keywords that's sitting inside
so let me take it out for you and like i
said it's a wired version all right here

guys a frame of reference may be for the
size of it till I can find something for

real small so take a look can I mean
things tiny continues nothing anyway the
wired one does have the number pad here
and some bigger keys down anyway guys
