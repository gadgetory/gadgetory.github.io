boxing for you of a brand new 13-inch
MacBook Pro this is not mine this is
just one that I have to review for just
a few days unfortunately but it is brand
new which means new unboxing so I'll be
comparing this with my current MacBook
which is a 2.4 gigahertz model not pro
and I'll do some head-to-head
comparisons for as long as I have this
unfortunately like I said I only get it
for a few days so in typical unboxing
fashion let's take a look at what we got
you've got the 13.3 inch aluminum
macbook pro displayed out closed telling
you what it is on the front on the top
you've got a list of specs which I will
run down for you very quickly
it's a 2.5 3 gigahertz processor so it's
a the higher end of the that particular
range it's got three Meg's of shared
level 2 cache 4 gigs of ram so this
thing will be fast for many years it's
got a 256 gigabyte hard drive spinning
at 5400 rpm and the 3.3 inch LED backlit
the screen and the rest of the stuff you
know you probably know and I'll show you
the computer as I open it up so let's go
ahead and unbox this sucker and this is
of course running Snow Leopard since it
is brand new and it's got a picture of
the computer open on the back so we will
use the obligatory big-ass knife to open
this up I'll try not to slice my finger
open as I do it alright so the seal has
been officially broken which always
makes you have to say so go ahead and
open this thing right up and those you
have seen MacBook and MacBook Pro in
boxes look very familiar there's a sort
of a layer on foam on the top to help
protect it here is the laptop itself
sitting in a tray we'll put that off to
the side for just one moment take a look
at what else comes in the box you get
your power adapter pretty standard fare
with a little bit of an extension cable
and you get the MagSafe power that plugs
right on in
and then you also have your everything
Mac everything else CD booklet which has
your backup and restore drives discs and
some information so can you close that
up that's not what you're here to see
anyway let's push that off to the side I
wanted to take a quick walkthrough of
the computer so of course you've got
your Apple logo the unibody aluminum
construction made out of a solid piece
of aluminum on the right side of the
Vice is upside down there is your DVD
burning super drive on the left side
which is where all the port action is
found
you've got your MagSafe you've got your
Gigabit Ethernet you now have firewire
back that's firewire 800 you've got your
mini display port for hooking up to
whatever monitors you want two USB 2.0
ports and the new SD card slot which is
actually quite handy if you guys use
cameras you're professional photographer
you're Patrick Hardin and you've got
your headset jack but you can actually
be used for audio in or audio out with
the microphone and you've got a battery
indicator right there tell you how much
charge you have left on the back
everything is completely sealed up
because this has the extended laptop
battery so gone are the ways of that you
can sort of pop these out let's do a
real quick size comparison with the
older 13 inch MacBook s' so here on the
right hand side is my macbook can see it
says macbook this was before they really
made everything unibody MacBook Pro and
they look identical the only place
really gonna see a difference is on the
back I've got instant access to the
battery and hard drive whereas on the
new MacBook Pros they are completely
sealed so you can't get access to them
but you do get a much much much better
battery so I think that would be nice to
have anyway like I said this is just a
review unit while we get it for a few
days so make as many videos as I can if
