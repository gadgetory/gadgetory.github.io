to you by Linda calm what's going on
everyone I'm John Bretton she welcome
back there pisode of ask the Buffaloes
to show with the fancy title we can
really just ask any question you've got
from technology there it's what
smartphone and get what tablets coming
or portion alors business questions that
you've got maybe if what i do /
TechnoBuffalo does is we can ask them
all up this week it's all about project
RS switching new smartphones rumors of
some new iPads coming what phone I would
get if I would sign a two-year deal
today this is as the Buffalo let's start
asking the Buffalo first question comes
from twitter user David ilm 3737 asks at
John for lakers do you think that
Google's project ara will succeed or
what people think the phones are ugly
it's very important to some people and
there ever comes to market I think it's
going to be widely successful it might
not be the best-looking things out there
but it is incredibly customizable
meaning that it's modular so you can
just pick new pieces that you want it's
really only have to buy technically one
phone that you could have for years and
years and you just keep upgrading the
components I think it's gonna be a huge
success of the price point comes in
reasonably if it offers support going
forward for future advances that
processors can be upgraded camera
modules and that kind of stuff so I
sleeping backed by Google certainly
Motorola's 21 spearheading it I think
it's going to be a huge success
especially if Google sort of continues
to offer the awesome support they've
already done for the legacy devices I
think it's going to blow the world out
of water and perhaps the next evolution
in smartphones so yes I am super geeked
out excited about it next question comes
from Twitter at blank looks for 15 asks
at John for lakers do you believe in a
thing called love I do listen to the
rhythm of my heart so our next question
comes from a me yak underscored k at
john for lakers was it like switching
from so many smartphones free viewing
them as a hard or do you enjoy it
hashtag ask the be so we review
obviously a lot of phones and i switched
to them all to try them using my daily
driver listen I love technology and I
still can't believe that I get a plate
it for a living so I still have like the
enjoy one it would open a new box
instead like it's a new phone so I
always always enjoy it no matter
what setting it up though sometimes not
overly enjoyable especially android
phones going from android to android
it's kind of tough to Switzer's in sort
of a universal backup that works mostly
i'm testing android devices so i've got
it down to a science to actually made a
whole video for how i do it but you know
it only takes me about 15 minutes which
everything over it's not a big deal but
i still get excited remember i try a new
phone i love it and the luster has not
worn off yet next question comes from
30th midget who asks at john for lakers
do you think we'll see any major
improvements the ipad lineup this
upcoming apples conference hashtag ask
the buffalo no nothing major ipad air
just got announced ipad mini retina
display just came nothing new is going
to create other than probably improved
specs probably a touch ID and that'll be
about it so i don't think we're going to
see any sort of giant improvements no
redesign of the ipad lineup at all i
only we're going to see ipad pro like a
giant 12.2 inch one i think what you got
is pretty much we're going to have say
for a few hardware upgraded specs we

technobuffalo that's ly ND a calm flat
technobuffalo back to the video so our
last question comes from event credit
who asked at John flickers you're a tech
reviewer and can have more variety etc
the current lineup what one phone would
you use for the next two years think
would you try and ask is if I could sign
a contract and pick wonderful and cheese
for the next two years which one what i
use and that is a good question so
phones out right now i could very easily
use the new HTC one m8 for the next two
years no problem at all and feel really
good about it i felt the same way about
the m7 last generations i still think
it's a really good phone like easily use
another year right now despite it being
a year old so that one would really be
number one the galaxy s5 the specs wise
this really will work it's not going to
slow down I'm not always the biggest fan
of how the samsung phones feel but I
really appreciate that it can use it for
you know if you're at the beach and sort
of weatherproof so probably the galaxy
s5 as well I wouldn't sign on the dotted
line for an iphone 5s right now but if
you're going to wait I think the iphone
6 coming presumably in September would
be the one you could sign for two years
for you know usually I advise against
goin the S models usually don't get sort
of the new things that come out just
upgraded specs so I think that would be
the one to get its for wait till the
iphone 7 or iphone 8 rather comes
introduces a new design will have a six
probably a 6s i would assume than the
iphone 7s i would probably be the best
way to go and I hopefully that helped
ain't your questions then you guess
