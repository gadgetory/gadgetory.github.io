to you by Toyota everyone is Todd
Hazleton from TechnoBuffalo reporting
live from CES 2014 Las Vegas this is a
Seuss's brand new zenfone 6 as its name
implies got a six inch display and
what's really awesome about this it's
actually in a retail for 200 bucks no
contract when it does hit the market
sometime later this year but as you can
see just looking at the phone real quick
it's got sucia snooze Nui which they say
is rather complete going on throughout
the whole operating system go back to
the home screen though under the hood
you've got an Intel Atom z2580 processor
clocked at two gigahertz 4.3 on here
jelly bean so no kitkat just yet
although I believe as you said it's
coming got 16 gigs of on-board storage
microSD card for adding additional on
the back here you've got a 13 megapixel
camera so there's a 2 megapixel camera
hiding up front there 3.5 millimeter
headphone jack up top try to get that a
focus for it nothing on the bottom and
on the right you've just got the volume
controls in the power button other
features you've got a 32-30 milliamp
hour battery and it'll launch actually
in black white red and gold this is the
black one red one looks really awesome
you can see it over there is a pause did
she quit anything and there's a white
one you can see a range of accessories
any case super exciting for this
six-inch phone and it actually feels
really solid for 200 bucks so take a
quick look here is the assistant phone
sixes Todd hasten with technobuffalo

the Toyota for sponsoring our CES
