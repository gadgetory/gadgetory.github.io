looking at is a 50-inch LG that I had
for just about three years it's a plasma
and the warranty expired after two years
and at two years in one week I turned
the TV on sounded like a gunshot went
off and the screen went totally black
could still hear audio but no picture
not a good sign
so I called LG and they were nice enough
to extend the warranty for parts but not
for labor so I had to pay 200 bucks for
labor to get one of the boards in the
back replaced I figured you know what
it's okay isolated incident well today I
wanted to turn on my TV and I had the
same gunshot sound and I'm greeted with
this gorgeous image quality that I
expect for my 50 inch high-definition
television I'll show you guys what I
hear what that looks like get a chance
to warm up a bit put that on mute there
you go there's a picture it's gorgeous
isn't it you can see a little flickering
over there
it's nice you really can see the high
definition of the television now I may
have just got a bum one I don't not
entirely sure
LG may very well make quality product
but what I will tell you is this lg tv
has been absolutely awful and as such I
will never ever ever in the rest of my
television buying history purchase an lg
television I would spend an extra $500
to buy a brand that's not LG thought I
would share this story with you guys and
give you a word of caution if you're
looking about a television you may have
a Nalgene it might work perfectly for
you in which case you're very lucky but
for me never again why buy an LED
television this thing is going out the
door very quickly so guys another video
John Rhett enger' with John for Lakers
comm this one doesn't have the most
happy tone because I'm really annoyed
did not plan on having to buy any
television but I will see you guys next
video for exclusive happier content be
sure to follow me on Twitter ww
twitter.com slash John for Lakers see
you guys the next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
