reviewing the $50 with two-year contract
pantech pursuit - this is an AT&amp;amp;T phone
follow me in my hot pursuit of the
pantech pursuit - after a considerable
amount of time spent with the pantech
pursuit - I can tell you one thing it's
a phone that really does not offer much
the pursuit - has a 230 megahertz
processor so operating speed was at a
base level now this phone also has a
touch screen LCD 2.8 inch diagonal and
it has a Motorola Droid 3 like keyboard
that slides out this phone is also
rather portable and stylish I got the
Green model but it also comes in several
other colors you'll find in any standard
rainbow connectivity is also fairly
limited we just have a USB terminal and
there's no 3.5 millimeter headphone jack
we do have a camera button a lock button
and we have physical call back and end
buttons on the phone's facade the phone
has a 2 megapixel camera and back but
it's devoid of a flash and image quality
was subpar also video quality resolution
way too small for any serious purposes
one of the most important aspects of the
Pentek pursuit twos existence was its
ability to make quality calls especially
on the 3G network so if you're looking
for just a basic messaging calling phone
the pantech pursuit - will do you just
right when it came to battery life
standby time on the pantech pursuit -
was fantastic it's slated up to 250
hours
however talktime as soon as you start
talking on this bad boy you have up to 3
hours of talktime so it's really not an
Everlasting Gobstopper when it comes to
call longevity I also found the pursuit
to to be exceedingly light on memory it
doesn't even ship with a microSD card in
the back and I think we have something
like 217 megabytes of on-board storage
but of course one of the most important
things about the pantech pursuit - was
its operating system it runs on a brew
MP operating system which is code for
proprietary pantech last-minute throw in
an operating system operating system for
the most part I found this operating
system to be fairly clunky especially
when combined with the 230 megahertz
processor basically you have three home
screens and on one of the home screens
you have the ability to add widgets and
programs and applications but the
scrolling you get this giant scrolling
panel and it's very it's not intuitive
at all when it comes to adding widgets
to the screen this is not an intuitive
phone it's not a phone that you could
pick up and instantly take advantage of
iOS or Android or any of the easy
shortcuts or anything like that and I
also download it I paid for Shazam okay
and Shazam cannot even recognize song
the internet browser on this phone is
anything but quick anything but
intuitive it reminded me of the molasses
swamp from candy land for me it's
difficult to justify the purchase of the
pantech pursuit - especially when the
iPhone 3GS
is $50 for AT&amp;amp;T as well it just when you
stack them up together it's it's a huge
monumental difference
the pantech pursuit - maybe too little
too late for a TechnoBuffalo I'm Mike
