TechnoBuffalo it's an unboxing for you
of the amazon firetv was announced
yesterday we've got it in our screaming
loving hands let's go ahead dig in see
what it's all about
so here's the box for the amazon firetv
it's gonna set you back $99.99 or $100
it's heavier than you think so on the
front it looks like an Amazon box tells
you all the streaming services that are
on here of course that's when they're
hoping that you're going to use most
often but they did open it up to others
Netflix Hulu Plus probably would be the
the biggest ones to note so there's a
lot of new features on here the box
talks about them but of course I'm gonna
tell you everything that you need to
know something go ahead and dig in and
for a special surprise so if you guys
stick around they also have the game
controller here will unbox afterwards
these are gonna run you just about $40
so here is the Amazon fire TV box that
mentions go ahead and try and get this
plastic thing off here alright plastic
tab removed slide that out amazon fired
and this looks like a typical sort of
kindle style box i'm gonna try to not
say Kindle Fire TV just Amazon fire TV I
set it enough so I wouldn't screw up on
the video go ahead and peel off that tab
with no whooshing noise I'll go ahead
and open this sucker up and there is the
box it's gonna give you access to over
40,000 Amazon Prime instant video on
your TV including exclusives like
Downton Abbey and justified and that is
really really tiny a creative tiny so
inside of here is a quad-core processor
is actually a Snapdragon 600 2 gigs of
ram and dedicated GPU plus 1080p video
and Dolby Digital Plus surround sound
which is pretty impressive
so it's really well SPECT they say
dedicated GPU Edition for the big for
gaming will really help with any sort of
UI lag this thing is really really small
gonna pull this out so here is the
entire box go and see what we got for IO
it looks like it's pretty standard a
little bit plastic around it there we go
alright so looking at power HDMI up
Audio Ethernet courses got Wireless
built-in and a USB port and that is it
really really tiny push it up to the
side for just a quick second we've got
some fire TV information registering all
that kind of stuff
we've got your remote which is a little
bit on the the bigger side for streaming
devices but it does have a trick up its
sleeve takes two double-a batteries
first of all which I think they included
in the box somewhere but it has voice
search which is quite tonight so you can
just search for what you're looking for
we're going to set this thing up and
wondering if it's voice search for just
Amazon services it'll do a voice search
for absolutely everything and of course
you should recognize those three buttons
if you're an Android user this is
Android based then your general sort of
media style controls does feel nice so
it's made us from a soft touch plastic
push that off to the side also in the
box we are going to have a little bit of
a power brick not a large one and then
we've got proprietary power connector
right there and as I mentioned you've
got two looks like they are a triple-a
batteries here they're the Amazon
branded triple-a batteries so the
biggest competition I think today amazon
firetv
in addition to to a roku device and
probably consoles would be the Apple TV
so you can see what both of those look
like here stacked on top the Kindle Fire
TV starting a little bit longer and
wider but a little bit on the thinner
side both very very small devices here
are the remotes for each as well looking
at it straight down you might see the
difference but when you look at them on
the sides you can see the thickness
although the Apple TV remote does not
have voice search built in so quick
comparison there one of the really big
selling features I think for the fire TV
is the gaming they're saying they really
want to make a big push for gaming and
even on the side of the box you sure you
send the game developers you've got
onboard they're some of the biggest ones
Sega Ubisoft - Kea Gameloft and more so
a lot of gaming focus on here they say
games are gonna cost about a dollar 85 I
want to play those games you're going to
need one of these guys we saw this
leaked
we didn't see much of the fire TV leak
which is pretty impressive considering
they were shipping same-day and we did a
really nice job keeping keeping it under
wraps so go ahead and take it this out
and it looks exactly like the leaks and
looking very similar I think to an Xbox
controller Pauline Xbox 360 controller
pull that one out and here is the
controller and it on first blush it
certainly feels a little bit lighter
perhaps less significant to say then the
next box controller but it does feel
very nice in the hands so you've got two
analog sticks you've got a coarser
four-way directional pad to trigger
buttons on each side your a B X&amp;amp;Y
Android control buttons and presumably a
go home button and also if you want to
control the media
I've got play pause rewind or chapter
back and chapter forward or fast-forward
and powering this I think we've got two
double-a batteries that they also
include in the box those are gonna go
right in there and then you've got some
a little bit of information on it so
this Plus this is gonna set you back
about $140 before taxes depending on
where you live we're gonna go ahead and
set it up and of course I'll do au I
walked it to see if it's a good deal if
you even do some gaming demonstrations
as well of the new Amazon fire TV
