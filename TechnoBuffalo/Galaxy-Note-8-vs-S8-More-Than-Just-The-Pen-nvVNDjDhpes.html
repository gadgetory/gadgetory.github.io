it's to flagships from different
companies will bash them screen to
screen into clear winner but sometimes
certain manufacturer from Korea whose
name rhymes with Pham Fung releases two
flagship phones a few months apart
mudding the water is about which phone
to actually get thus is the case with
the galaxy s 8 plus and the Galaxy Note
8 is a difference more than just a pen
I'm gonna try and answer that question
for you guys help you decide which phone
you should get should you upgrade if you
already have a Galaxy S 8 plus or and
why would you want to pick up a Galaxy
Note 8 so looking at these phones they
share a lot in common just looking
straight down they look almost identical
they've got the same Samsung design
language with the infinity display the
same pressure-sensitive home button
slightly different software experiences
but Samsung used to call TouchWiz it's
now Samsung user experience but for the
most part these phones appear to be the
same but there's a lot more inside of
these phones that make them different
let's start with the screen so the
screen on the Galaxy s8 me-sa plus it
looks pretty ball or a screen is
gorgeous it's Super AMOLED technology
it's a qHD screen but and this is
something I didn't realize until I tried
the note 8 it doesn't get that bright
until you compare it with the latest
from Samsung so the Galaxy Note 8
actually gets 22% brighter than the
galaxy s A+ in case you want to get
technical it's 1200 nits versus a
thousand it's just by random comparison
if you want to know I phone 7 at 625
minutes so that 22% makes a gigantic
difference when you are outdoors if you
have adaptive brightness on take out
your phone in direct sunlight in the
middle of the day you can see it much
better on the note 8 then you can't on
the galaxy s 8 plus and this is sort of
a thing of you don't know it until you
see it or you don't know which don't
know it's always thought the SI plus
screen looked awesome and I looked at
the note a screen I was like damn that
looks so much better so if you thought
things look a little washed out on the
galaxy s 8 over use your phone outdoors
a lot that is a big-ass reason to
consider the Galaxy Note 8 so yet again
another case of I didn't realize it
could be much better until you see
something that's much
better the cameras on both phones I use
a Galaxy s8 in the si+ for months and I
loved the camera in those phones and I
still love the cameras they're still
really good there's some of the best on
the market then I started using the
camera on the note 8 the pictures that
come out of the Galaxy Note 8 look in
sane perhaps it's because both sensors
have optical image stabilization
built-in perhaps it's psychosomatic but
the pictures look really good the Galaxy
Note 8 also adds a very Apple esque
portrait mode where you can blur the
background of an image if you even do it
after you already took the picture if
you go to the Samsung gallery app and
open up that photo you can adjust how
much background blur you want it works
really well what kind of minimal
artifacting around the actual focal
point of your image and also it's gonna
snap too so for pictures you've got your
wide-angle shot and your normal shots in
case you want to see what was in the
periphery of an image you can do that on
the node 8 you can't do that on the si+
battery at least on paper I think would
be a big reason to give a nod to the
galaxy s 8 plus with sheer numbers 3500
versus 3300 in the Galaxy Note 8 and it
was very clear that Samsung was let's
say good shy from recalls of the note 7
to say went with a smaller battery but
super software tends to matter this is
running the Samsung software experience
8.5 versus 8.0 on the Galaxy S a plus at
least as of this filming and due to
optimizations with software I'm still
getting almost this thing about 11 hours
of battery life that I got on the SI
plus now that's on time so when I plug
my phone at the end of the day with
almost exactly the same amount of usage
generally around 20 to 25% and that was
true with both phones so despite having
a smaller battery
I still got same amount of usage on it
so it's kind of a tie there and I guess
that tie is kind of a win for the note
and it's got smaller milliamp hours
performance at least pursued performance
is another reason to consider the Galaxy
Note 8 it's rocking six gigs of ram
versus four on the si+ and before you
yell at me the comments I know there are
versions that have 62 RAM but then one
most people have is 4 so 50% Ram made
the phone seem faster to me it might
have been again psychosomatic I ran
benchmarks and all that Geekbench scores
and yes it does come across as faster
but we will usages what we're talking
about here and it does seem pretty good
I think where that's going to matter the
extra RAM is future proofing so all
these things we're talking about
batteries screen for four months I've
even talked about the s-pen yet and
that's why a lot of people at least
consider wanting to get the Galaxy Note
II that's sort of the big flagship
feature about it yes it's here
no you can't put it in backwards and
it's also IP 68 and it's actually one of
the least reasons for me to pick up the
note I really like having it it's nice
but I don't use it all that often I find
myself kind of making up reasons to use
it if you're the kind of first untrim
stylist and a screen then yeah you
already know you want the note but for
me there's more icing on a cake instead
of the actual cake itself so I mentioned
the beginning of the video these phones
look identical but they don't feel
identical the note is 12% heavier than
the Galaxy S 8 plus and that matters the
phone is overall thicker it's wider
doesn't have that same sort of beautiful
design and feel at least that you get
with a Galaxy S Bessie plus they seem to
hold the phone in your hand just looking
at them screen down they do look very
similar so if you thought maybe the s8
plus was a little big for your hand and
definitely try the note 8 in store first
for your side to pick one up on the s8
plus side I think this is the best
feeling and best looking phone on the
market I think it's incredible a Samsung
blended the infinity display the
thinness of the device it feels
incredible in the hand this still
remains the best feeling device that I
have ever used so last but definitely
not least it's price so there are a ton
of sales and Samsung runs trade-in deals
and best buys got kills and carriers
have deals but generally speaking
they're about 300 bucks separating these
two phones I don't know if you're
getting $300 more worth of value if any
that features I mentioned are must-haves
for you or sort of all those different
parts make a whole that's worth spending
about 950 bucks then you're going to
love the Galaxy Note 8 figure to get the
best camera the best software that
Samsung has to offer if you decide that
300 bucks is not worth it for you you
are still getting an incredible phone a
phone that adds up like a month ago
would have been the best phone on the
market but it is still a really good
phone and will still be a really good
phone for the next year or longer so
here's what the morale boils down
- if you have a galaxy si - si plus look
longingly at the node eight be jelly of
your friends that maybe bought one but
it is not worth paying the money for the
upgrade you're coming from a previous
gen note that hasn't been recalled so a
note five a note 4 or an older a galaxy
s device so an s7 s7 edge or older but
all means get the note eight you're
going to love it notice the differences
in improvements immediately so before I
end the verses I want to thank the
awesome folks at Mac Weldon for making
this video possible
Ralf and Mark who are off camera tell me
where too many ram's gears and then I
need more casual clothes so actually I
legitimately use the stuff at Macworld
and I'm wearing Mac Walden's shirt right
now it looks nice it's comfortable it's
also probably most importantly
antimicrobial so if you go to the gym or
you're just sweaty dude like me it's not
gonna grow so when you leave it in like
a hot car it's not gonna smell when you
get back to it it's comfortable it's
kind of stretchy
they've got shirts under shirts hoodies
socks underwear
anything you need their websites super
easy to use and stuff comes really
quickly and it's high-quality I think
most importantly they give me 20% off if
you decide to pick something up and I
recommend it I'm a big fan of their
their navy blue obviously looks nice
against our white seamless use coupon
code TechnoBuffalo I'll give you 20% off
hope you guys check them out so what do
you guys think s 8 plus or Galaxy Note 8
which one did you buy and why I think
it's a big question is are you going to
upgrade from the si plus to the note 8
are you going to heed my warning if you
don't throw caution in a thousand bucks
to the winds and say give me my stylus I
want to know why I leave in the comments
down below and if we like your answer
well pin it to the top and then
everybody can see you you can become
famous and your mommy proud of you until
next time
John Ranger from TechnoBuffalo you guys
see I do this a lot I guess I do phone</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
