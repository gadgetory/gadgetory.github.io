mercifully comes to an end 2017 is gonna
bring us a lot of awesome android things
and in that vein I've got five
predictions for android for 2017 I've
got kind of bonus prediction too so I
guess we could say six but 55 sounds
better to me so 5 plus 1 predictions for
you this video that I did last year I
was pre accurate about sixty percent and
I feel really confident for this year's
let's go ahead and jump right in coming
in and May at Google i/o you'll
obviously see Android 8.0 announced and
if you're trying to do the alphabet in
your math begins with an O it's gonna be
Android a point oh oreo or it might also
be android a point O orange chocolate
candy but I'm gonna bet that Google
alphabet and Dravot every want to call
them gonna work out a licensing deal get
that Oreo name attached to Android a
putting a cardi already see the statue
sitting out on the campus so it's going
to be a lot of smaller changes improving
on what we saw with nougat but sorry me
some flagship things we are finally
going to see full backup and restore
across Android and I've been saying this
one for for a while this is like my
version of wireless charging for iPhones
it's gonna happen if I say it every year
one year I'm going to be right this is
also the year though that Google Titans
restrictions on what OEMs can do with
Android so get access to Google Play
services though certainly it's open
source like did over they want but they
want to have access to google play at
least out of the box they have to play
nicely I think this is a year that we
sort of see those restrictions tightened
to make sure you have a more consistent
experience throughout your Android
devices fingers crossed the next
prediction obviously we're going to see
new pixels it's gonna be the pixel too
but it's not going to be called that
pixel Prime mark that down by the domain
pixel Prime and the pixel x el these
specs should be identical save for
battery size screen size are going to be
the same as a pixel and the pixel XL at
five and 5.5 inches but the prime
they're going to bring qhd standard
we're going to see six gigs of ram
standard of course android 8.0 out of
the box with those awesome backup and
restore
features I don't know about Cameron
megapixel edge haven't heard any
grumbling so I'm just gonna say 20 but I
mean really I just made that I just made
that up better cameras are what we are
going to have with the pixel Prime and
pixel Prime XL don't look for that until
like way towards the end of 2017 you're
still good with your pixel and your
pixel XL and next the return of Nexus no
not gonna have is dead sorry doesn't
mean I just want to do that hashtag
John's a jerk next this is when i
whiffed on last year i said the return
of google glass this year I'm saying
Google's can return to augmented reality
in a big way I don't know what that way
is going to be perhaps it might be a new
version of glass we've seen a few
patents float around for more let's say
stylish wearables don't know what Google
is going to do but there's been a lot of
grumblings they've been staffing up
their augmented reality department it's
like you're gonna see a huge huge huge
push towards augmented reality from
Android next you probably been wondering
what the heck's going on with android
tablets seems like not not much is
really doing these new ones are coming
out think the pixels seek is gonna get a
successor I think we're finally going to
see the merger the marriage of Chrome OS
and Android I think'll talked about it
we've got android apps on Chrome OS
computers but I think this is a time we
see that then really just just get
together now don't know if it's going to
be me what we saw with honeycomb
especially OS just for tablets or if
it's gonna somehow be built into android
a point 0 or so Chrome OS starts to go
away but Google's it make a bigger push
for tablets and they're going to do it
by sticking with that pixel plan have
you noticed something weird happening
with Android wear just like tablets not
really seeing much in the way of Android
where we saw the new OS announced google
i/o back in May doesn't come out yet
we've seen lenovo say we're not going to
say it's like sequel to the Moto 360
Samsung's pushing out their own ties and
watches but nothing in the way of
Android wear and that's because
manufacturers know something that I'm
going to tell you pixel where it's
happening Google's going to pixel up all
of their things and we're going to see a
flagship
pixel branded wearable watch from google
just just write that down and last that
plus one that I mentioned Google homes
going to get waste remark consider what
you have right now is like early beta if
you ask it to remind you to do something
you can't do it yes good to send the
tech master contact can't do it the
directions to your phone there's a huge
list of things it can't do yet in fact
if you ask it it's gonna say I can't do
that yet we're going to see Google home
really be that hub that Google's
promised it to be third-party
integration galore it's going to be
awesome for debating whether or not you
want to go amazon echo or google home
you might want to give Google home a
second look in 2017 so those are my
really six predictions for Android nexor
what you guys stick you excited about
the pixel prime that's the one that I'm
almost jazz about the comments down
