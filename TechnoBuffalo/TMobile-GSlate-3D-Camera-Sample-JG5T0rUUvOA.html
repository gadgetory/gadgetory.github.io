road this week and I've got the tmobile
G slate and I figured you know what I'm
going to shoot some video see if i can
upload some freedom video to the web and
put on the crazy 3d glasses to come with
it because you don't have to have fun to
shoot the video actually but you have
that mod to watch the video in 3d
stereoscopic setup you can watch the
content on the display but you have to
have a glasses on anyway so there you go
we've got there'll be a full unboxing
video and sort of you lots other goodies
full coverage of the GSA over on
technobuffalo calm and the YouTube
channel send this out to John out in
Southern California check out the
coverage reason I figured since I'm
right here by the by the water by the
Long Island Sound I would you know and
walk around with the thing and try to
shoot some interesting video I get some
field of depth
so there's the rocks on the coastline
here my new york knicks playoff shoes
it's kind of hard to see that the the
performance of the screen and bright
sunlight is pretty much nil and with or
without the 3d glasses on any other LCD
display really difficult to see outside
so hopefully this video is coming out
I'll shoot some more stuff then also
walk around the neighborhood with these
glasses on so people are driving by
looking like what is wrong with this guy
but here I'll stick my hand in there get
some field of depth stuff happening some
motion the you know the G site in
general I love the hardware the software
is a little buggy that as far as I can
tell is the Android and software because
the proprietary stuff seemed to work
pretty well and the buggies isn't there
some annoying sayings flash in the
browser is not helping matters that much
things like that but I love the hardware
on this device Tegra 2 powering it is
snappy size is awesome
is a 9 inch widescreen form factor makes
it easy for one-handed use within the
widescreen you know playback full HD
video on the screen because it's 768
pixels so can do it into full 1080p but
it can do 720p on screen that is hdmi
out so you can send 1080p video out
beats and 3d video out as well I to a
larger model which is cool the 3d set up
here it's a dual 5 megapixel camera with
LED flash and autofocus so you can shoot
5 megapixel stills 2d or 3d and then you
can shoot video 3d video of the 720p or
2d video so today I'm just trying to do
some crazy stuff yourself so I'm yes of
course been really good the performance
of the 3d system you know honestly I
think it's kind of gimmicky some of the
stuff I've watched it doesn't actually
come pre-loaded with professionally made
for any content which is too bad I think
that would've been cool to show that off
but maybe you know maybe they didn't
because they know that the you know this
whole stereoscopic thing with the
glasses and everything like sometimes
it's kind of cool to look at and then
sometimes it just doesn't quite seem to
work right and instead of getting the 3d
effect you just get kind of this this
sort of irritating you know 2d that's
kind of going in and out images that
aren't quite lined up and it's kind of a
little headache inducing but it's sort
of back and forth and that's just kind
of how the tech is right now so the 3d
you know it's not really a reason to buy
this device but Austin's it's just kind
of thrown in you know it's not a deal
killer anyway so there you go literally
a 3d video hopefully that came out one
more time with the crazy glasses from
the east coast i'm noah from
technobuffalo calm much much more on the
G slate and all the other new stuff
coming out I took the buffalo icon on
the YouTube channel on the Twitter
accounts on the Facebook page you follow
me while John you file Sean you fell the
other giant your fault audrianna you
felt Emily you found Jack you found
Winston come Joey follow so I'll
