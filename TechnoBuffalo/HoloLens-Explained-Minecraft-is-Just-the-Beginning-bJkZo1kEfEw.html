to you by domain.com it's a brave new
world folks last week Microsoft took the
wraps off their latest wearable I guess
really they're only a headset wearable
hololens
I wanted to talk about what I think
about it how it compares to Google glass
so would ya
you like to get started so in case
you've been living under a tech rock or
I don't know maybe you just didn't have
any interest
Microsoft last week unveiled something
called hololens and when holland
essentially is it is a wearable headset
that is a full standalone computer you
don't the tether it don't they need to
set up separate PC or don't need a
smartphone attachment that essentially
projects Holograms and we're not just
talking like old-school holograms that
used to see on like the Virtual Boy type
stuff we're talking like real deal
help me obi-wan you're our only hope
type holograms and the opportunity for
this I think could really be incredible
and of course when I saw hololens I
immediately thought about Google glass
some would call it a failed experiment
but I respect Google for putting it out
albeit the utility might not have been
there so fifty hundred bucks to buy a
pair of Explorer Google glass with that
date was kind of augmented the world
around you tiny little screen over one
eye where I think it hololens differs is
this is a opportunity to augment the
entire world around you not just one
part to talk about first playing games
is an incredible thing that showed
minecraft of course kind of other gaming
opportunities that you can do they
people are getting used to wearing
headsets about the same size as the
current oculus headset out there of
course do you look a little bit silly I
think the opportunity is what this can
do are really incredible hear me out
before you judge it first you have
opinions about Microsoft push those
aside and judge the product on its own
merits first I do not think this is
going to be vaporware but until you can
buy one in the store developers get
their hands on it that has yet to be
seen so I think they can be a couple of
things that could really neat with this
first education imagine they talked
about astronauts being l10 like they're
visiting Mars drama magic doctors
performing surgeries being able to learn
how to perform those surgeries to make
sure they are better physicians and
we're safer when we go to the hospital
if you're leading about the
Revolutionary War in school you could
put on that headset make actually
experience what it's like to be in the
red
in a war you could talk to Thomas
Jefferson and of course the use of
everybody's thinking about I'm not gonna
say it but I'm sure those developers
will be the first ones that are signing
up for the developer kids you know what
it is it's the reason that VHS one it's
a reason to blu-ray kind of one and it's
the reason that you're probably thinking
about picking one of these hololens is
up so I wish I could holographically
stop for a minute and thank our peeps at
domain.com they are the place to go when
the next great idea hits yeah even if
it's like 4:00 in the morning it wakes
you up and you're like I need that
it's a one-stop shopping for all your
domain name and web hosting needs so the
list of available domain extensions is
growing it's not just calm org and.net
anymore
you have the opportunity to name your
site and build your brand and kind of
cool ways they never could before choose
from a growing list over 200 plus domain
names like dot ninja dot NYC expert Club
all are available now at domain.com
who doesn't want a dot ninja the guys at
domain.com wanna hook our fans up with a
great offer say 50% on domain names and
web hosting I'm gonna use coupon code
TechnoBuffalo that's one word
TechnoBuffalo at domain.com check out
that back to the video phone pick these
up though that's the question what does
this sucker going to cost as I mentioned
in as a standalone computer with
standalone computer parts I would wager
this is going to be very very very
expensive
Google glass of $1500 I would be
surprised this comes in a retail price
of around 3000 but I think if Microsoft
wants us to be successful they will get
it and hands developers at a significant
loss thousand dollars $500 after that
might be the more developers could
access the technology the more use
that's gonna be theaters to justify
spending what I think is going to be a
sorban --nt consumer price here other
cool uses that I'm thinking about are
ways to collaborate in meetings you can
see all of your Skype contacts if your
people that work all over the country
like we do TechnoBuffalo you could talk
to me to interact you could see things
that you couldn't see before and also
come on freakin Holograms I'm really
excited to see this haven't been this
excited for product in a very very long
time but like
to get excited about I could also be
very disappointed we don't know where
these men don't like I mentioned they
said sometime around the release of
Windows 10 so probably late this year
maybe early 2016
of course you don't know price you don't
know what developers are going to do
with it but I'm hopeful if be able to
use it for more than just a Minecraft
demo it sees a Microsoft execs pretend
to move around and build a quad copter
I'm looking forward to it are you
looking forward to it we burned by
Google glass and now you're like
wearables on my head I don't care about
