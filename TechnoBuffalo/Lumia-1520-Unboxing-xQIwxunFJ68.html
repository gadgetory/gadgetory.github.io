techno buffoon here with an unboxing of
the Big Daddy of Windows Phones this is
the Lumia 1520 let's go ahead and open
it up and see if this is the phone you
want to obsessively check every 15
minutes for the next two years
here is the box for the Lumia 1520
picture the device on it this is one of
those phones I've been really excited to
take a look at I've been a fan of
Windows Phone for a while and certainly
since it was unveiled in Abu Dhabi just
a few weeks ago go ahead and slide this
box out and there is that six inch phone
underneath a upgrade your camera app
stuff and a Quick Start Guide for AT&amp;amp;T
to go ahead and pull this out and this
is a gigantic phone nokia went from four
point five to six inches and really just
jumped right ahead
which is pretty an impressive jump it
off the top to the side for a quick
second see what else we were going to
have inside of the box we've got a sim
door key for opening or sim we've got
like there's actually a paper working
here on that very often so Nokia stuff
setting up your phone is fast and easy
with Nokia quick start up and usually it
is we've got a wall wart and charging
cable that is about it here is the phone
itself and is absolutely gigantic go
ahead and pull off the screen protector
here whooshing noise pretty satisfying
on the back as well peel that off it's
foam looks really pretty happy that we
got the sort of cherry or candy red
version of it so here is the phone with
its ginormous six inch screen it is for
the first time on Windows Phone 1920 by
1080 giving it a 367 PPI it's an HD LCD
clear black with Gorilla Glass 2 Windows
Phone 8 onboard windows will now has the
latest specs Qualcomm Snapdragon 800
clocked at 2.2 gigahertz 2 gigs of ram
32 gigs of internal storage but you can
always add more to that which is pretty
nice of course you get 7 gigs of free
cloud SkyDrive storage rather there is a
20 megapixel autofocus
lenz with optical image stabilization
nokia does a killer job with their
cameras with new camera app lets you
focus after the fact sort of what the
Lytro camera does as well
1.2 megapixel wide-angle lens right on
top taking all your selfies 802 11 ABG
and an AC 3400 milliamp hour battery
supposedly it's integrated for qi
wireless charging but I heard rumors the
18 t version may not so I'll put that to
the test but you guys know whether or
not a does charge so check the text down
below to see if it does indeed have
wireless charging built-in does have NFC
from a serve height standpoint it's 160
2.8 meters or 6.41 inches from top to
bottom it's a really big phone wing 209
grams or 7.37 ounces get it a ton of
cool colors including yellow white black
or of course looks like my favorite
glossy red let's do a real quick size
comparison because it's a hard thing to
do to make something like the Galaxy
Note 5.7 inches looked diminutive but
there it is this is the Galaxy Note 3 at
5.7 inches and of course a 1520 in my
right hand at 6 inches let's bring in
the previously most recent nokia phone
it is the Lumia 1020 you can see what
that looks like at 4.5 inches looks like
a teeny tiny kid brother and on the back
you don't have that giant PureView
camera hump that we've got on the 1020
oh there's a little bit of a camera hump
there and just for good measure let's
bring in a I phone 5s you can see
whether that looks like it just looks
teeny tiny next to it's gigantic friend
aqua tour of the device
I've got nothing really on the right
side other than your volume rocker up
and down excuse me that's where your SIM
card and expendable storage is going to
live under each of those doors on the
right that's where your volume rocker up
and down is going to be power and lock
button and your camera button charge and
sync cable 3.5 millimeter headset jack
that's they're really thin phone I'm
surprised how thin it actually is and of
course you've got your three Windows
buttons here you got back your Windows
or home button and your search button
that's guy appears to be out of juice
I'm gonna go and plug it in for a little
while come back take a look at the UI
and what it looks like on a giant 1080p
screen with a whole new row for live
tiles
alright so we've got the phone all
and that is what 1080p windows phone
looks like so a couple neat things are
happening here first you get that whole
extra row of icons second it's not gonna
translate well on video but this screen
looks absolutely gorgeous to be hold so
again I think Nokia Microsoft did a very
very nice job here
those interesting tweaks that we've got
first you can download an app which I
will show you it's called Nokia focus
and what that does are Nokia refocused
rather essentially takes that Lytro type
ability lets you refocus your shots
really on anything so I'll go ahead and
turn this around here now you can see
here's a picture that I took just a few
minutes ago and I could focus on
anything in there just by tapping
something that comes into focus and it
does a really nice job of doing that and
it's a free application for anybody with
a Nokia phone so it's a really cool
addition here everything else though is
pretty standard things we've seen in the
past you got Nokia music and all kinds
of other sort of standard Microsoft
additions some AT&amp;amp;T things are added in
here AT&amp;amp;T family map Walker and that
kind of stuff that you may or may not
choose to use but anyway it's all sort
of here and it's a Windows Phone and
glory again this is a very very big
phone but it's a really thin phone
usually didn't go hand-in-hand at the
Lumia device how it's gonna fit in your
pocket it's a little bit on the big side
and certainly knows a book you're
wearing room will do jeans and it might
get some look you're using it up to your
head to make a phone call but if you
like big screens and you like Live Tiles
it's gonna be a good phone to look at so
I'm talking to our head of mobile title
10 you had a chance take a look at the
device before I did and did his first
impressions now saying one of things
that I'm gonna miss when I use this on
my daily driver is a Google now and you
brought up a good point that why do I
need to Google now and I can have all my
information right on my home screen with
live tiles that's sort of a very good
point to make live tiles can show you a
ton of information so looking forward to
putting it through its paces and see how
the operating system has involved since
I last used Windows Phone before I run
away I do want to confirm the AT&amp;amp;T model
here does not have wireless charging we
tried it on two separate sheet chargers
and neither of them worked any questions
