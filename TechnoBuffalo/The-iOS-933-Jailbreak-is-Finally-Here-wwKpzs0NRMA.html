from technobuffalo here I've got a
jailbreak news update for you and you
guys been clamoring to update your phone
and now the folks at pangu have you
covered as long as your phone is running
9.2 or 9.33 or newer so 64-bit anything
newer that an iPhone 5 or five senior
you're good to go there are few
exceptions right now for some reason the
6th gen ipod touch and the 9.7 inch iPad
pro are not working it just kind of
crashes speculated though that that'll
be fixed within the week it just
probably a glitch in the jailbreaks you
got one of those devices just stay tuned
you should be good to go very soon I
think the best part about this jailbreak
is that it you can do it straight from
your phone or your tablet you just
simply type in the URL which you could
go to jail break me 9.com or slew of
other URLs are hosting it follow the
steps and you are done and jailbroken
one caveat though it is a semi
untethered jailbreak which means when
you go ahead reboot your device you got
to open up the pp app it'll
automatically show up on your home
screen will take 30 seconds and you're
good to go drought more information will
link to it all all down below so CLE you
guys can get jailbreaking if you want to
if you do jailbreak let us know what you
guys do if you want to see more
jailbreak coverage of the video a thumbs
up to let us know the next time down
