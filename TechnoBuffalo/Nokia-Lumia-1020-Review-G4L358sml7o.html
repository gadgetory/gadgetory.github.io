protec no Buffalo here's a full review
for you of the Nokia Lumia 1020 this is
the 41 megapixel bad boy that just came
its way to AT&amp;amp;T let's put it through its
paces and see if it's worth your
hard-earned phone ban buck so let me
begin this review as I do with all my
phone reviews with a disclaimer I use
this phone as my daily drive over for
five days got a chance really get to
know how to use it all the nuances and
started my love affair up again with
Windows Phone so let me start with call
quality that's really the most important
thing when it comes to phones no matter
how many megapixels the phones gotten if
doesn't make good phone calls it's not
gonna be very good for you and so not
surprisingly Kolkata is pretty awesome
Todd tested his review unit in New York
he had some different issues you can
read the full review hit the link down
below if you want to see his thoughts
and how I performed in New York City
including tethering which I did not test
but I had no dropped calls at all had a
really strong LT antenna and performed
very well speaker volume was actually
pretty loud as well if you like heavily
on speaker phone no problem at all so
we're gonna break this review up into
several parts we're talking about the
hardware I'm gonna talk about the
software we're talking about the camera
and we're gonna wrap it all up and give
this guy a full TechnoBuffalo 1 out of
10 score so looking at the Lumia 1020 a
very awkward looking phone if you look
at it from the bottom down looks like a
normal Lumia device the polycarbonate
feels awesome it's really well built
positions aren't looking at the top of
the device looks a little strange it's
got this giant camera of course is
understandable could you pack in 41
megapixels in here but it does do some
sort of odd things so the first thing I
found the very first time I picked up
the phone was it's really top-heavy
usually when I hold the phone my finger
comes along the back and I hold it if I
want to scroll I just scroll with my
finger if I let go though the phone
starts to tilt forward you have to make
sure you secure the phone on the bottom
while you're using it to do any sort of
one or two handed scrolling it's a bit
cumbersome another issues and you put it
down on the table it's got a huge rock
on it so if you put it phone down you
want to type or you want to watch a
video it's going to rock back and forth
and because it's going to rest is only
the lowest point of the phone is what's
gonna hit your table your surface it's
that camera lens and this metal here
scratches very very easily something
definitely keep in mind doesn't matter
what color you have either the yellow
the black are you gonna white
version this color is still the same so
they're always gonna have that issue so
definitely watch out for scratches the
build quality that was typical Nokia or
Nakia depending on where you live is
absolutely outstanding like all Nokia
phones of recent history this thing is
built like a tank and feels absolutely
awesome in the hands I loved his
dedicated camera button i like that
microsoft's mandating that's their one
thing i did have some issues with it was
location of the power and lock button
located below the volume rocker now
that's just personal preference i'm used
to it being above from samsung phones
but if you're used to using previous
Nokia devices it's gonna feel like
second nature coming for something else
definitely be aware that that's how it's
going to work other than after the
harbor's exactly you'd expect it is
awesome Nokia nailed the hardware out of
the park I wish the obviously that could
have been gone away at that camera hump
but I'll deal with it 41 megapixel
awesomeness so a couple crazy things
about the build quality on the hardware
if you shake it ever so slightly you can
hear them ball bearings in the camera
move and that's okay nothing is wrong
with your phone I know if he actually
advertises that it does this though I
had to look it up and ask you know what
that noise was but you can definitely
hear it so the big story here hardware
was that 41 megapixel camera captures 34
megapixel photos any five megapixel
picture and a 16 by 9 aspect ratio or 39
megapixel and five megapixel in a four
by three aspect ratio the spy resolution
on the phone though is super low at
least by flagship standards it's got a
1280 by 768 pixel resolution so all your
zooming and stuff isn't gonna look as
crisp as it would on a 1080p display
that's more the fault with Microsoft
though than it is of Nokia I'm not gonna
go too in depth to this off for its
Windows Phone 8 as we've seen it in
previous generations actually thirteen
months have passed since Windows Phone 8
was initially announced and everything
about Windows Phone 8 is all here Nokia
though did do some really cool things
and the first one I talked about is the
camera app that Nokia is calling the
Nokia pro cam
this is where you're gonna control all
of the awesome functionality and manual
control you can get with the Lumia 1020
it's pure view camera you can get really
granular or let it do all the hard work
for you I really like the UI that you
sort of a half-circle do to control
everything it's a really intuitive way
to able to control everything on the
phone from white balance ISO it's really
everything else you can do on a DSLR you
can do on the 1020 it's really
impressive
for someone who's maybe not the most
camera savvy guy in the world I really
enjoyed playing with it and seeing that
things change in real time on the
display when it comes to the camera
software Nokia hit this one absolutely
out of the park it is as easy to use as
you can expect they did some awesome
things with exposure and I can't say
enough how great the camera is but for a
phone is really main selling point is
the camera you would expect it and if
you're really looking for a device that
you can use as maybe a DSLR replacement
or at least a replacement for your point
and shoot I really dub no worries at all
about recommending the 1020 one thing I
really do hate about the software is
that photos can only be backed up to
SkyDrive I love Google Drive I wish
there was some sort of third party
option but perhaps that will come at a
later time
all right next let's talk about battery
this thing's rocking a 2000 milliamp
hour about it let me tell you a little
bit about my usage so you can put things
into perspective usually I get up around
7 a.m. I put off the charger I've got
two emails being checked every five
minutes maybe about an hour or so of
phone calls mostly connected to Wi-Fi at
home or at the office but LTE radios are
always turned on some like video viewing
some gaming and just generally in phone
just sitting idle most of the day I was
it very easily able to get through a
full day of battery life usually
plugging it in around 11 o'clock at
night with about 50% to 45 percent of
battery life but and this is a huge but
if you use the phone's camera quite a
bit you're going to drain your battery
life like crazy especially if you use
that xenon flash what you really want
the selling points of the phone you were
going to be surprised how quickly all
those milliamp hours are depleted if you
use the camera you're gonna notice
probably about 20 to 30 percent decrease
in battery life just taking a five
minute video and about 15 pictures I saw
almost 20% of my battery life go away at
the end of the day versus what I had
otherwise so really if you're gonna be a
heavy shooter be very careful what
you're going to do with battery life or
you wanta might want look at the camera
grip because an external battery already
built into it alright so I talked about
the cameras software let's talk about
the camera itself this is really the
main selling point of this device and it
really merits its own section of the
review we did a full camera comparison
with the Lumia 1020 versus the HTC One
the iPhone 5 and the Samsung Galaxy s4
hit the link down below to check all
those that you can see if they look like
both crops and a full resolution you
clearly get a sense of how it before
in low-light highlighting different
settings see if it's the right device
for you so the moral here as expected
the camera is really awesome the 41
megapixel sensor felt like a spy care
most of time so Todd and I definitely
agreed this is our favorite camera phone
so far there's a bit of lag when you
launch the camera about six seconds or
so if when you hit the button so you can
snap a photo there is lag also during
the photo shot no rapid-fire like on
Android phones or iOS ah that's worth it
for me to get those high res images and
again the camera software is absolutely
awesome
I know kia smart cam is great for action
shots adding motion blur and more and
the nokia creative studio is really fun
for tweaking colors and really getting
into the image I'm making sure you can
get stuff exactly the way you want it so
what's the verdict on the Lumia 1020
nokia did an incredible job what they
had to work with where the phone falls
short is in the Windows Phone side 13
months of an operating system is really
a long time at Windows Phone is starting
to show its age the low resolution dual
core specs I really aren't what people
expecting the biggest downfall I think
of a 1020 is its launch price time you
watch this video that price may already
be slashed but $300 for a two-year
contract is crazy should we need to
consider the phones you could get
without a subsidy for almost the same
price it's really hard to recommend the
1020 but it is for certain subsets of
people if you're looking for a camera
that is absolutely outstanding you don't
want to carry a separate point-and-shoot
with you or maybe you don't want to
carry a low-level DSLR the 1020 is
really really awesome you're looking for
a phone that just takes good pictures do
I look at the HTC One or samsung galaxy
s4 the hump is very weird to get used to
it feels like a little bit awkward in
the hands-on for that price point I just
can't recommend a Windows Phone device
at $300 that perhaps Windows Phone inal
totally changed my opinion it will get a
software update that'll make this phone
the one to beat at least right now I've
got a really hard time saying hey this
is the phone you should get so the final
verdict ear if you want a phone it's got
an awesome camera you don't want to
carry a point you shoot your DSLR with
you and you go out the tenth one is
gonna be an awesome choice if you want a
good phone that's gonna do everything
and also take decent pictures and I want
to look at an Android or iOS all franked
you're gonna get sort of the best of
both worlds you're certainly not gonna
get that crazy zoom where you can zoom
in
it's the absolutely everything like the
needle in the haystack but you are gonna
get a pretty decent camera
it's a tough phone to recommend overall
this gets a pretty solid eight on the
TechnoBuffalo scale so thank you guys
