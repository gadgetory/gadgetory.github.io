from TechnoBuffalo here with an unboxing
for you of the 46 inch sony bravia tv
with Google TV integrated this is going
to set you back just about $13.99 this
is a review unit that I was sent to I
checked out I'm actually pretty excited
to dig in I had a chance to play around
with Google TV at the Sony launch event
but I didn't have a chance to get to use
it on a daily basis and see if it's got
a place in your living room or mine so
without further ado let's go ahead and
get to the unboxing so before I cut the
box I want to run over some specs of the
TV in case you guys are keeping track at
home and you're thinking you know what's
the advantage of disadvantage of getting
the Sony device here it's got a 16 by 9
aspect ratio as far as backlighting it
uses an edge led but it is actually LCD
technology in there with a panel of 1920
by 1080 of course that's full 1080p it's
got a 60 Hertz refresh rate
the Google TV side of it it's using a
Intel Atom processor and room
marketplace with apps meant for Google
TVs coming in 2011 of course it's
upgradeable to new versions of Google TV
that'll be coming out it's got a web
browser and of course will a granade all
of your web content I'll be doing full
demonstrations of Google TV as well as
we see if it's worthwhile or not there's
also some cool mobile apps that will
work with it as well alright so let's go
ahead and dig in the big ol knife is
upstairs
good to be downstairs so we're gonna use
the unboxing scissors for this guy you
can see on the front is a picture of the
full Cordy remote which is interesting
bit difficult to get used to but we'll
see so there is the remote right
farting noises remote there's a TV with
google TV go ahead swinging a blu-ray
player with Google TV built-in try
Google TV but you don't necessarily want
to buy a brand-new television television
alright a little bit of what's going on
inside the box hopefully see what we
have we've got that let's take a look at
that McPherson TV looks like a
television an unboxing a dreamboat go
ahead and come around show you guys a
little bit more about what this looks
like
alright so here is the remote go ahead
and rip out of its packaging hopefully
that makes me buddy deaf from plastic
noise alright so here it is it is a full
QWERTY remote which has some handle
grips on the back sort of PlayStation 3
like including some children but ins
kind of neat but well they won't work
for gaming so you've got a full QWERTY
keypad obviously I've got enter up and
down this is actually a little bit of a
optical trackpad so you can navigate you
know left right up and down and select
it you've got your Android buttons I've
seen on pretty much every Android device
ever your home menu back and buttons and
such I've got a guide TV DVR this will
plug in right to your DVR it's not fully
compatible as far as content searching
with every DVR but it is growing pretty
regularly
I got your TV power cam up or down it's
a very different way to use a remote I
think it's gonna be pretty difficult and
probably a decent learning curve to get
used to it as well and top the shoulder
buttons those represents scroll and zoom
and it is infrared as well so you have
to worry about
sensor directly pointed at the
television all right so that's the
remote let's go ahead and take a look at
the rest of the television
it'll be fun see we get to be you said
remote it does come with two sony
double-a batteries so you've got power
cord that's just I've already got
someone please read this first problem
necessary we're not gonna go ahead read
it first
Oh gonna have looks like a infrared
adapter some sort of remote controlling
thing here we'll take a look up there
that is in the continent alright so now
let's try to get this TV out of here
which is always a bit more difficult
angels back so I'm going to go ahead and
push it on its side until I can pull it
off
there we go
alright so the box is on it's iet's go
ahead and see if we can pull out this
television and one person recommend
getting a framing boxing uh I'm after
monitor of touch monitor stuff is a way
difficult so this is the screen so it is
facing us nice looks like you did
the stand is almost mitigating six games
but television first it's just a little
span right fix on Stanford
all right get all this see what we have
alternative against the wall or
something all right
all of these all right so turn this
around there is what it looks like just
in the front it doesn't look just like a
television it's got the sony logo on the
bottom it is part of the Ravi a line
from a thickness standpoint I just have
sort of a full computer doesn't add that
much thickness to it just a little bit
so let's take a look at the ports in the
back go ahead and zoom in a little bit
as you guys can see what this thing has
on its rear we'll zoom in a little bit
down here so most city of component
action is happening right here you've
got our blasters about that first chord
that you know what what it was here two
HDMI ports understand another video in
video out there's optical audio there is
a port there for a Ethernet does have
built-in Wi-Fi as well power cord goes
right here this is where all these
mounting would happen looks like it is
universal mount compatible on the
outside there are another two more USB
ports reading this poodle or HDMI port
rather bringing the total up to four
there are four USB ports for expanded
building just kind of nice and then
there is a controller button and a
headphone jack as well because you don't
want it we go
invented all right so I enjoy ravager
and my workout for the day with an
unboxing of the sony 46 inch television
with a Google TV integrator they'll be
full demonstrations
coming up later see yourself filming
I'll see you guys in the next video bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
