technobuffalo here at that unboxing for
you of Apple's newest peripheral the
magic trackpad so let's go ahead and dig
in this is going to set you back about
70 bucks and it is essentially the same
track pad that you're going to get in a
macbook or macbook pro or even a macbook
air but larger and made external for use
with deck desktops or laptops this will
work with a pcs as well so we're going
to go dig in we use the nail clippers of
doom here for this the big ol knife will
make a comeback go ahead and pull it out
so there is the magic trackpad and a
very sort of familiar Apple packaging
got a picture of the device on the front
magic trackpad wireless multi-touch
trackpad letting you know again that is
a wireless in case of that Wireless
didn't mean enough for you Apple logo on
the side got some information here on
the back about some of the gestures that
you can do with it point click double
click right click click and drag to
finger scrolling rotate pinch and zoom
screen rotates page back info a coach
applications and activate expose and so
here's picture the guy using in case you
didn't know you get your hands just like
that there you go just like that alright
so let's go ahead and dig in and see
what this sucker looks like i have not
seen one of these yet in person so
actually pretty excited to to see one
this will require a software update for
max but it should sort of happen
automatically when you plug it in or run
software update manually from the apple
logo in the corner and then update
software this plastic dough can
sometimes be trickier than you'd expect
it to be come on alright there we go
check out the plastic off go ahead and
dig in of course it's apple sort of
minimalistic tight package think they've
become known for oh it's funny when they
show the show the gestures depending on
whether or not in love Apple you might
want to give it give it another gesture
with your finger alright so dig in here
is the magic trackpad pretty much just
sitting there and leave it takes
probably to double-a batteries we'll go
ahead and push it off the side for just
a moment see what else we're going to
get in the box
magic trackpad instructions and that's
about it I'm not they include batteries
not in here that's kind of interesting
what's actually see if there are
batteries gonna take a look at the
device itself go ahead and try and open
this up if I can got some handy keys
right here i think i can use to try and
get this thing open i would assume that
they do include batteries generally
Apple had a pretty good job about that
and it feels like from the weight that
there are batteries in here and yes
there are indeed batteries in there they
are not the rechargeable ones though now
Apple sells and now in the battery
business these are just sort of standard
batteries all right so I'll push that
back in okay so here is the magic
trackpad we'll go ahead and pull off the
plush and see what the build quality
feels like feels very much like it
expect like a big trackpad that you've
seen in apple laptops now the whole
thing actually can be clicked it does
depress the clicking mechanism is not
the track pad itself like it is in the
laptops actually these little feet here
will actually depress actually those
feet right there on the two bottom
actually depressed so you can get a
click anywhere you go if you can hear
that I go in from the side you can
probably see those sort of depressed a
little bit as you clicked you can use
everything it is significantly bigger
than what you get on a laptop for
comparison purposes let me show you
actually what a standard apple laptop
track that's gonna look like so I'll
bring in here an older macbook I think
it sort of see the keyboard or rather
the attract pad comparisons between the
two so there we've got trackpad and
there is the magic trackpad it's or
anything difficult Lee larger and go
ahead put that on top you can see it
extends far out over what other devices
have and kind of for another size
comparison here it is next to a magic
mountain sort of apples other pointing
device I certainly it's supposedly will
fit right nicely and from what I've seen
this actually fits almost flush with
apples wireless keyboard let's go ahead
and bring that in and take one quick
look and see if that is true so here's
the keyboard here's a magic trackpad and
indeed it does actually
sit completely flush so I don't know if
whether or not you enjoy trackpad or
Android traqpath definitely looks nice
we'll see whether or not there's going
to be some utility to it of course I'll
be doing some demonstrations and showing
your how it works on coming videos
anyway guys I am jon rettinger from
technobuffalo with an unboxing and first
look at Apple's magic trackpad
