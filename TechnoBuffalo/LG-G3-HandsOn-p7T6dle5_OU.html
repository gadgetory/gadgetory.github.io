technobuffalo over here checking out the
LG g3 in New York City the phone you've
been waiting for just go quickly around
the device it's bouncing around here
except this wonder about a cable on the
back on the settings but so you can see
the nice born factories got a metal
build with a matte finish and they said
they did that to avoid fingerprints and
so far it's not getting any fingerprints
on it but we'll go around the device
real quick up front you've got that 5.5
inch quad HD IPS display super nice
protect the viewing angles they're 2560
x 1440 pixel resolution across and
that's good to you 538 ppi LG said that
actually human the human eye can't tell
a difference in just standing right here
you can see it's super super crisp like
even this it's very cloudy up top might
be hard to see the light here is really
crisp and easy to read so we'll bring it
a little closer for a bit so moving
around the device it's again really
minimal nothing on the right-hand side
you can see the display con are
untouched edge on the bottom there
you've got the micro USB charging port
and a 3.5 millimeter headphone jack and
then try just one hand on the back
you've got the camera here and that's a
13 megapixel with 0 is plus that they're
calling it I so its optical image
stabilization what's really the best
they've ever had and then you've got
this laser focus which is supposed to
autofocus in about point two seconds I
think two milliseconds I'm super super
fast they say faster than any competitor
and then of course the dual LED flash
next to it up top nothing except for the
IR blaster and then below the camera is
where you'll find the power button and
the volume controls hopefully for one
easy one-handed use here and it's
actually it is really easy to just tap
that and
let's dive in some of the software
features you'll notice it all flies
around it's got a quad-core Snapdragon
801 processor clocked at 2.5 gigahertz
and we've got four point four point two
KitKat running on board here with a
brand new user interface at LG made and
it said it tried to use I believe the
word with more mature colors so it
doesn't look so childish and color fade
away that you see it generally is not so
colorful the left here you have hydrogen
helps with can monitor your steps and
stuff like that that kind of reminds us
to pass health break point over but that
Samsung introduced on the galaxy s5 so
there's some new features here we'll go
through them in text messaging for
example you have the standard keyboard
is not in English right here contestant
grin unit appears are there we can
actually change the keyboard height
everything so going here if you want so
you want a larger keyboard you can do
that or then bring it down for a more
compact device so let's just go through
some of the features here together look
at weather ice weather app we've seen
that before doesn't I got change for
much we're gonna cue our remote and
looks pretty similar as what we saw the
GSU oceanography main difference the
gallery should be a good way for us to
see some of the quality on the screen
here
you look really really awesome person
the orange slice so let's bring up a
video now to pre loaded clips we can get
the volume see how
again
this is actually just going through
photos as opposed to showing it sort of
a fluid video with seniors here we go
you can see awesome viewing angles there
the IPS technology of course you're
advertising a quad HD up top it really
does look pretty amazing here so quick
look at the video now let's check out
some of the other features the camera
should be really cool to see so we'll
bring up the camera here and focus
should be super super quick and it's
just snapping photos like that how we
can bring up other features and just
snap and go so really really quick
actually and hopefully with the image
optical image stabilization you can sort
of bump around and still get a nice
clean shot without too much floor but as
you can see it's for superfast there we
go we're slamming up pictures any case
really really beautiful phone here
should be launching tomorrow in some
markets it's definitely coming in ICS we
saw some of the announcements on our
site for the US carriers but just wanted
