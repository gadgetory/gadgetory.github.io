technobuffalo here at an unboxing of the
Moto X I know what you're saying been
there done that dude we've already seen
you do that I think twice but this one
is a little bit unique it's got one of
the brand new bamboo wood backs all done
up in teaks if you've been thinking
about picking up a lenovo Moto X I guess
maybe you can call it and you want to
see what it looks like with the brand
new wood back like I do let's go ahead
and open this up here's the box to the
Moto X you guys have seen it all to her
hole through the unbox and get right to
what the phone looks like i will bring
in the unnecessary large unboxing knife
the o back and let's go ahead and cut
the plastic just try to cut the plastic
cutting off my finger that could be the
drama with the video John start bleeding
this is the unlocked very and I picked
it up when motorola had their a hundred
dollar off then activate your phone
first what kind of business we're gonna
pop in a working sim card anyway so here
is the moto x box it did it with the
moto maker and there is what the teak
wood looks like I did it with blue
accents on a kind of an technobuffalo
and also has TechnoBuffalo emblazoned
right there on the back I was kind of
curious the waters gonna feel like it's
gonna feel sort of grainy like a stick
or feel smooth but it does feel very
smooth you can see the grain but you
can't feel it at all which kind of nice
and it does have sort of I guess you
could call it the hallmark of the Moto X
that dimple right there although you
paralyzed me you cannot see it at all on
camera even in person but it is indeed
there the blue accents I got the white
front see my gross I've been only sweaty
hands nor that look over here with the
white front I think it looks actually
really nice the blue accents on the side
for the spec standpoint you probably
know all of it it's a 4.7 inch 720
screen it's got the Qualcomm s4 pro two
gigs or am I got the 32 gig variant you
can pick it up in 16 too it's got a 10
megapixel clear pixel camera but for
what I've seen yeah the best camera at
all there's also a 2 megapixel shooter
on the front 802 11 a/b/g/n/ac I'm
pretty much running sock and ER at the
few tweaks and some of those tweaks I
can show you we've got another Moto X or
right here you can see those quick
notifications which are pretty awesome
you can tap and just jump right into it
and see whatever
they are and while I've got another Moto
X here here's some comparison shots so
this green one is Brandon's he actually
made its history motomaker a while ago
it's got that soft touch kind of rubber
feel on this one heel feels very
different it does not feel like plastic
it all feels really nice then we've got
sort of the stock when you can pick up
from your local carrier's store in black
you can see if these three look like the
dimples are very clear on these two this
one you can't see it at all it's less
deep on the wood that it is here on the
plastic but it is still there
fortunately on the Front's you can see
different in black and white these two
are black that one is what you get the
contrast more I tend to kind of like the
the white phones the black ones though
you know certainly people do enjoy them
so there you go the top you see there
isn't any sort of different colorations
white all the way through click on
brandon's you can see it go from black
to the green that he added other than
that here nothing else knew it is the
same Moto X but now I'll done up with
TechnoBuffalo colors perhaps this will
make its way into a giveaway sometime
soon but i'm going to use it on sort of
give it a shot I using Moto X while back
and I enjoyed it and now it looks like
this might be a relic with Lenovo
picking up the company so kind of
excited to try this and I guys hope you
enjoyed what you think of the wood back
would you go would would you go just
plain black would you pick another color
through the Moto maker I love to hear
