TechnoBuffalo here with an unboxing of
the Moto X and I know what you're saying
been there done that dude we've already
seen you do that I think twice but this
one is a little bit unique it's got one
of the brand new bamboo wood backs all
done up in teks if you've been thinking
about picking up a Lenovo moto X I guess
maybe you can call it and you want to
see what it looks like with the brand
new wood back like I do let's go ahead
and open this up here's the Moto X you
guys have seen it all to haul through
the unbox and get right to what the
phone looks like I will bring in the
unnecessary large unboxing knife the Oh
back and let's go ahead and cut the
plastic cut the plastic cutting off my
finger that could be the drama with the
video John start bleeding this is the
unlock 2 very and I picked it up when
Motorola had their $100 off thing
activate your phone first
what kind of business we're gonna pop it
up working SIM card anyway so here is
the Moto X box it did it with the Moto
maker and there is what the teak wood
looks like I did it with blue accents on
a kind of an TechnoBuffalo and also has
TechnoBuffalo emblazoned right there on
the back I was kind of curious what the
waters gonna feel like it's gonna feel
sort of grainy like a stick or feel
smooth and it does feel very smooth you
can see the grain but you can't feel it
at all which is kind of nice and it does
have sort of a gift you could call it
the hallmark of the Moto X that dimple
right there although you realize I mean
you cannot see it at all on camera even
in person but it is indeed there the
blue accents I got the white front and
see my gross I've got my sweaty hands
nor that look over here with the white
front I think it looks actually really
nice the blue accents on the side from
the spec standpoint you probably know
all of it it's a 4.7 in 720 screen it's
got the Qualcomm s4 pro 2 gigs around I
got the 32 gig variant you can pick it
up in 16 - it's got a 10 megapixel clear
pixel camera but for what I've seen yeah
the best camera at all and there's also
a 2 megapixel shooter on the front 802
11 ABG and AC I'm pretty much running
sock and ER at the future we can some of
those tweaks I can show you we've got
another moto X or right here you can see
those quick notifications which are
pretty awesome you can tap and just jump
right into it and see whatever
they are and while I've got another
motox here I here's some comparison
shots so this green one is Brandon's he
actually made its to sermo to maker a
while ago it's got that soft touch kind
of rubber feel on this one you know it
feels very different it does not feel
like plastic it all feels really nice
then we've got sort of the stock one you
can pick up from your local carrier
store in black you can see if these
three look like the dimples are very
clear on these two this one you can't
see it at all it's less deep on the wood
that it is here on the plastic but it is
still there fortunately on the Front's
you can see different in black and white
these two are black that one is what you
get to contrast more I tend to kind of
like the the white phones the black ones
though you know certainly people do
enjoy them so there you go at the top
you see there isn't any sort of
different colorations white all the way
through like on Brandon's you can see it
go from black to the green that he added
other than that hear nothing else new it
is the same moto X but now all done up
with TechnoBuffalo colours perhaps this
will make its way into a giveaway
sometime soon but I'm gonna use it sort
of give it a shot of using moto X while
back and I enjoyed it and now it looks
like this might be a relic with lenovo
picking up the company so kind of
excited to to try this and i guys hope
you enjoy what you think of the would
back would you go would would you go
just plain black would you pick another
color through the Moto maker I love to
hear your thoughts until next time I am
