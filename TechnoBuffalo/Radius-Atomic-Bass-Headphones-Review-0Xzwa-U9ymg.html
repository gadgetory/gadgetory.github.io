you the atomic bass headphones by radius
so radiance was nice enough to send
these to you and a couple months ago
they heard me complaining about the
in-ear apple headphones that ship with
all the ipods so these radius headphones
are 3999 and what they are are in ear
noise reducing organ ama headphones so
the couple of cool things about these
and before i get into review let me show
you a little bit about them they're
actually angled so let me zoom in here
so you guys can see that angle that's
what actually makes it very unique you
check it out and on my big mug right
there but notice that there is a bit of
a tilt to those tilt in so you put it in
your ear put one in there and one right
in there they sit in very nicely and
actually angled right into your ear
canal so you get the noise going
straight in I'm probably screaming so
I'm got these heads got these headphones
in so base quality is fantastic and
actually since they're not the
officially noise reduction they do do a
lot of noise reducing I'm used them on a
jog and excited in my ears nice and
comfortably and in fact they blocked out
so much noise I didn't even hear my
phone ring usually when I'm jogging at
the apple ones I can hear the phone ring
not a problem so there's something to
keep in mind if you're looking for these
headphones sound fidelity was great
noise quality was fantastic you know
overall they're just a great pair of
headphones you come to the very long
cords you have plenty of room with of
course a 3.5 millimeter headset jack on
the bottom the one complaint I do have
with the headphones these little earbud
things that attach to the top of it they
come with different sizes small medium
large and if you want to replace them
it's quite a hassle takes a little bit
of finagling a little know how it or to
get those on took me a good almost five
minutes per something to keep in mind so
overall guys I can really recommend
these headphones they're really not that
much to say about headphones other than
they sound great probably sound about
three to four times better than the
Apple in-ear ones that they ship for
free with all iPods and iPhones you know
leader bug the white ones so ubiquitous
you see them everywhere these are so
much better and 39 99
actually a pretty reasonable price these
are now my de facto headsets I use them
everywhere I go I'm flying or running or
walking around I'm always kind of
listening to music on the iphone so
these always carry with me and like I
said it guys free to keep in mind that
they are completely organic so the folks
at radius also cooked everybody up with
a ten percent discount so thanking that
you want to link in the sidebar if you
want these headphones or want to check
out some of the other products type in
John for lakers a check out and get ten
percent off which is kind of cool if
you're interested in headphones and I
guys just want to give you a real quick
review an overview of me atomic base
radius headphones definitely recommend
it guys for not that much money you
really get and I think probably five
times that value I've listened to 300
400 500 dollar sony noise cancelling
headphones and certainly those cancel
noise better but as far as just sound
fidelity I think these are definitely on
par with them so definitely hats off to
radius for put together create products
and I guys hope you enjoyed for
