it from technobuffalo and in today's
episode of rumor roundup we'll be
talking about the microsoft surface pro
4 Samsung's Galaxy Note 5 and the
updated Galaxy s6 we're also going to be
talking about the LG g4 c and an alleged
ipad pro blueprint this is rumor roundup
so let's go ahead and get started
Microsoft may not have announced the
surface pro for this week at bill 2015
but a new tablet could be just around
the corner a new report claims that the
company will unveil the rumored surface
pro 4 and an event in mid-may according
to slash gears anonymous source the
newest surface will debut this month the
site notes that it doesn't have a long
history with this particular insider but
it still trust the information based on
recent leaks the upcoming tablet laptop
hybrid is expected to pack a 5th gen
intel core processor and a thinner
design otherwise it could be pretty
similar to the surface pro 3 with the
same 12 inch qhd display we're not sure
why Microsoft would announce the surface
pro 4 just a few weeks after Bill 2015
but it could be possible that a new
hybrid device just isn't ready yet
though it seems unlikely that a few
weeks can make that big of a difference
but perhaps we'll see the device get a
release alongside windows 10 which
microsoft has said will come out this
summer ipad pro is leaked once again and
this time it's in a form of an alleged
blueprint for the device obtained by on
leaks on twitter there are no big
surprises here though we do get for
stereo speaker grows along the top and
the bottom of the device and there's
also a power button on the top volume
controls on a side in a port down below
now unlike previous leaks we've seen
there's no indication here of a second
port alongside of the ipad pro and maybe
that means Apple will stick to just one
single port with its design but then
again on leaks notes that this 2014
blueprint isn't final so it's possible
the second port may be added to the
final version based on earlier rumors
we're expecting the ipad pro to pack a
12 or 13 inch display and an 88 x
processor it may also introduce an
updated version of iOS with the ability
to view two apps at one similar to
samsung's multi window mode still
unclear when or if the ipad pro will get
an official unveiling but if the device
does make an appearance this year it
probably won't be until fall the LG g4
is still fresh off the assembly line but
the company may already be working on a
new version of the flagship device and
alleged g4 see recently leaked on dutch
retail site central
point hinting at a cheaper version of
the new device according to the leaked
image the LG g4 c will be available in
three different colors gold white and
silver for about three hundred thirty
dollars off contract it's still unclear
if the company plans to offer a
leatherback version of the phone but as
for the hardware we're hoping for
something pretty similar to the g4
though it is possible the specs could
get watered down a bit due to the lower
price of course this is just still a
rumor but we'll be on the lookout for
any more news surrounding the LG G Force
the galaxy note5 isn't expected to
arrive until later this year but the
upcoming phablet may have already leaked
online to a certain extent at least the
device recently surface in an IMEI
database along with a surprise galaxy s6
variant both new handsets are listed by
their model number which we can use to
guess what Samsung has planned first up
is the SM dash and 920 F which sounds
like a likely successors to denote for
which has the model number sm and nine
ten rumor has it that the galaxy note5
could pack a 5.9 eight inch ultra HD
display with a resolution to 20 160 x
3840 that the company is also expected
to offer an edge version of the device
with a slightly smaller 5.7 8 inch
curved screen meanwhile the SMG 928 s
could be a closed variant of the galaxy
s6 which has the model number SMG 920
gsmarena suggests it could be the galaxy
s6 plus though it could also be an
active or mini variant either way it
looks like Samsung's not done with its
latest flagship device we probably won't
hear anything official about the galaxy
note 5 until September though it is
possible we could see the new versions
of galaxy s6 unveiled sooner anyways
