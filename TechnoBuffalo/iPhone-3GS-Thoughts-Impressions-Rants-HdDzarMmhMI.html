want to give you my thoughts on the
iphone 3gs so first as an apple fan when
they announced the new iphone I couldn't
help but have my whoo moments and then
as they went along I kept waiting for
the big thing kept waiting for the
front-facing camera kept waiting for the
o LED display kept waiting for some new
design or some killer feature that maybe
I hadn't thought yet and what I didn't
come I and I'm sure a few of you were
definitely disappointed and I kind of
made me think is that apple's fault you
know it's almost impossible for them to
live up to the hype then one of those
companies that really is a victim of
their own success matter what Apple does
is always going to be people that are
disappointed with the results if they
put in a front-facing camera it doesn't
work well enough if they put in 0 LED
display it adds too much cost the
components there really is it's very
hard for Apple to find a happy medium
between features and hype and they've
been so successful in the past that
really then they have nowhere else to go
but down a little bit in very few times
they live up to those expectations so
once I was able to get over the where
you are all the cool features and I
started thinking about what the 3gs
actually does I started to get a little
more exciting so let's go over some of
the comparisons here between the 3g and
the 3g s so first of all comes in 16 and
32 gigabyte configurations which is
quite nice if you're a big audio file or
have a lot of videos pictures or
whatever 32 gigs is definitely going to
be a lot of space for you I mean the
entry level 16 gig model is quite nice I
have a 16 gig iphone 3g I never even
came close to filling it up so for me a
16 gig would be plenty you're getting
two times improved performance which is
just speed and processor was so I
started thinking about that a little bit
more and that doesn't mean just
absolutely quicker that means improved
graphics so when you're playing games
now bought through the app store you're
getting a lot of improved graphical
performance and for what I've seen in
videos you're getting quality which
looks much better than you
nintendo dsi so you're getting really
almost mobile console like quality on a
phone which is very impressive so that
two times improved performance doesn't
just mean app speed so that was very
nice you're also getting a built-in
video camera whip editing which is
interesting there have been a few times
when I really would like to capture
something the ability to edit it and
send it right up to youtube for mobile
meteor send it to a friend is very cool
it does take advantage of the iphones 3
megapixel autofocus camera and the
quality does look to be relatively
decent certainly i'm going to reserve
reservation until i see it but it does
look to be good enough although the
video recording features are not coming
to the current iphone 3g which is very
disappointing if you jailbroken your
iphone you've got ex having a video
camera the iphone 3g can certainly
handle recording video all the megapixel
sensor i believe is about 1.3 doesn't
look great nothing has the ability of
doing it so just interesting that Apple
didn't put that into the 3.0 software
but moving along you're also getting
voice control and this was more of an
assessment than anything else people use
their iphones in the car and whether you
have a bluetooth headset or speaker
hooked up the only way to dial was to
take your eyes off the road and look
down at your phone i'm sure there's a
lot of pressure on apple institute this
and they finally put in voice control
what they did was though was not make
the voice control just for phone calls
it can control your itunes it can make
genius playlist you can dial a number
just by saying dial 714 555 whatever and
it will dial it for us it did institute
some new features but force controls one
of those things that phones from five or
six years ago ahead and Apple was
definitely missing so definite was nice
to see that had it to the cache of new
features and I see me edit was a compass
which they're probably about three are
you out there that are excited about a
compass but it does have some
interesting functionality if you're
using google maps for example and you're
navigating with google maps you know
that you have to kind of turn the
to see which direction that you're
heading so you can follow that little
blue line but the compass will do is
that actually align itself for you or if
you're using let's say street view and
your attic olas afghan as you move your
phone around in your hand the compass
will know where your where your line dat
it'll move the picture for you not so
cool what I think it does have a lot of
potential those with the developers how
having access to what their our API is
they're being released for the compass
let me actually put into game which is
kind of cool maybe you can move around
and the game will sense that you know
the developers have really almost
infinite creativity so I'm very curious
to see what they do some of the things
that all the iphones are going to be
getting so the 3g in the first gen
they're coming with OS 3.0 gonna get cut
copy and paste and the mess which I'll
talk about in a minute spotlight search
landscape keyboard voice memos so one
thing I do want to bring up at least if
you're in the United States is WTF AT&amp;amp;T
if you guys have watched my videos you
know that AT&amp;amp;T is my primary carrier I
test a lot of their phones and I use an
iphone 3g but seriously dude seriously
you're not ready to handle mms at launch
for the iphone 3gs that is ridiculous
this is back to the argument that i've
had phones four or five years back to
mms 18t you can't handle it is it a
network issue what is it why can't users
are probably one of the most powerful
smart feature phones out there send a
picture or video message the phone now
has a capabilities it's not apple's
fault anymore and it's not like ETD
didn't have a heads up OS 3.1 in beta
for months they knew mms was coming or
even before that I'm sure Apple gave him
a friendly heads-up Steve jog calls up
18t CEO hey and this is coming your
network might want to support it really
annoying on the AT&amp;amp;T front apple also
announced tethering capability via USB
or bluetooth which is fantastic the
ability to share your internet
connection legally is is a great thing
and again AT&amp;amp;T is not supporting this
what the heck
how can you not support this I'm sure
you've had a heads up there are windows
mobile phones Simeon even blackberry
that you can tether with why can't you
tether with the iphone you do not have
enough heads up can't your network not
supported what is it I think that we
actually deserve some sort of answer
from ATT but why these features are not
included out of the box if Apple is an
American company the phone was developed
and a lot of research was done in
America on the US carrier it should have
it to the rescue in the world that are
getting these capabilities
congratulations your carrier is
certainly head of the ball as opposed to
what we have it is very very very
disappointing that 18k was behind this
although I'm sure a few months from now
once we have tethering and once you have
mms it won't matter as much but at least
right now it really is quite infuriating
another thing that's upsetting and I'm
not sure if this is an apple or an ATT
thing is the price points if you want to
get an iphone 3gs and if you're a
current 3d owner meaning you used your
upgrades get a 3g about a year or so ago
you don't qualify for the upgrade price
so if you want a 16 gig black or white
3gs you got to pay 399 and if you want a
32 gig black or white 3gs you're gonna
have to pay for 99 now at first I was
really upset about this because what
Apple did between the generation 1 and
the 3g they gave everybody who had a gen
want essentially an early upgrade and as
a consumer I can understand the outrage
Apple set a precedent now they're
changing the president when the iphone
first generation was released it was
sold unsubsidized at a ridiculous price
i believe it was 499 that it came out at
they change that with the 3g and they
subsidized it and they gave everybody an
upgrade with the 3gs they went back to
the old way and now you have to pay
essentially a full retail price now if
this is any other phone let's say six
months ago you upgraded your phone from
AT&amp;amp;T verizon sprint whatever your
carrier is and now that six months later
you decide you want to a new phone you
walk into the store they're not going to
you an upgrade at the end the day the
iphone is just a phone and I suppose you
can't expect a carrier to take such a
big hit when they just give you a
discount on the phone when you sign a
new contract you're getting that lower
price because your carrier is actually
paying a portion of that phone for you
anticipation of the revenue they're
getting gained through the light beer
contract if they again six months a year
year and a half late or whatever it is
take another hit to give you the
lifestyle who's got a certificate amount
of money from a business standpoint I
understand the move I understand why
Apple or ATT whoever made that decision
decided to not offer upgrades to 3G
owners I get it I can respect it people
are going to go to the iphone just
because it's an IFO people are going to
switch carriers they're going to pay the
more expensive price because it's an
iphone and you get a lot with that
however as a consumer ridiculous you set
a precedent you should stick with it
five hundred dollars for a phone that
you're not getting unlocked you can't
that doesn't have mms capabilities out
of the box I can't tether you're almost
getting a cut phone for five hundred
bucks or four hundred penny on which
model you get so again from a business
standpoint I understand it from a
consumer standpoint totally pissed so
just want to give you guys my
impressions on the 3gs and the last
thing that I want to talk about is
design apples known for revolutionary
designs they've done it with the unibody
macbooks the aluminum imax and even the
mac pro's to some extent i was hoping
for some sort of redesign of the iphone
3gs did have to be anything major taking
a matte finish just so you knew it was a
little bit different than the 3g
something subtle putting a 3gs logo on
it and it didn't have to be a radical
redesign didn't have to change the
functions or form of the phone that much
something a little bit different the 3gs
and a 3g look identical i would have
been another opportunity for Apple to
sell accessories is well if they change
the design even just a little bit think
of all the cases that are sold at the
Apple stores I think they lost out on a
significant
revenue by not changing it plus it's
nice to look at a three gene the 3gs in
your hand side by side and know that
this is a new version be able to see
something different it's exactly the
same with thickness it just looks the
same it's a little bit boring and for
those that have had an iphone first gen
and iphone 3g and are going to get an
iphone 3gs well the operating system is
quite elegant and very powerful you may
be a little bit bored with the looks of
the phone and the feel of the operating
system and in getting almost exactly
that same thing i'll be a little bit
faster with a few new features with the
3gs I'll are like something a little bit
different some sort of revamp I know
this is a pie-in-the-sky of thought but
even possibly multitasking something to
make it feel fresh the UI again well
very powerful and revolutionary the time
is becoming a little bit stale so I
would have liked to seen something done
there just want to give you guys my
opinions on the 3gs maybe maybe you
agree disagree you completely hate what
I said or you love it leave your
comments down below i'm really curious
to know what you guys think so that
being said everything put aside all my
rants and thoughts about the 3gs i will
tell you that i did preorder one i
pre-ordered a white just like a tell a
difference between the 3g and the 3gs
I've got the black the black model 3g i
had an upgrade on my account able to use
an upgrade to get it but had the phone
VIN 499 i would have been very hard
pressed to justify that much money over
3g get to the day whether the features i
went over are worth it for you it's
going to be a personal decision and i
hope you enjoyed for exclusive content
