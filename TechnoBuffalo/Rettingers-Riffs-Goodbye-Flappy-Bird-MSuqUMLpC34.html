to you by Dollar Shave Club what's up
everyone welcome back there pisode of
retinas risk I miss John renders the
show where I riff on anything going on
the words of Technology up this week
though it's all about a teeny tiny
pixelated flappy bird and where it went
who's written just riffs let's start
ripping usually we hear about developer
success stories usually followed by
their starting a company their IP owing
sort of following that rovio model but
very infrequently do you hear the total
opposite happened so let me tell you the
flappy bird story over the weekend
developer dong win make good on his
promise to remove flappy birds from the
itunes app store and google play store
to the what of everybody else in the
world so when is based in hanoi vietnam
has been super reclusive aside from his
twitter feed it's been a relatively
interesting back story though so sit
back let me tell you about the rise and
fall a head get it a flappy birds so as
soon as februari seventh win was
seemingly enjoying all the flap
attention answering questions and
talking about really anything had to do
with that little bird he was responding
to questions and we when one users said
he had input for when to which he
replied it just a minigame just let it
stay a minigame he liked the way it was
he didn't want to change it he said he's
not an entrepreneur in another tweet and
said the game was just built for the
masses and for everyone to enjoy and
then as a saturday morning would even
suggested that he was already working on
a sequel later that afternoon though he
started to say people are overusing the
app and suddenly his mood start to swing
not really sure what overusing means but
he felt that they were like if you use
it while on the toilet perhaps it was
causing longer than usual private
bathroom time speaking of private
bathroom time at the transition I never
ever thought I would ever make let me
tell you about our friends at Dollar
Shave Club if you watch my videos you
likely know a few things about me first
I'm so pale I'm clear in The Wizard of
video editing makes my skin tone look
human and I clearly hate to shave much
to my wife's chagrin buying razors sucks
you got to trudge the store get the
key is that plastic razor fortress
little thingy then they got a shell out
20 30 bucks and ridiculous shaped egg
don't even need like a razor that
vibrates you can use in the shower or
that's going to sing and dance for you
you just don't need it I don't need to
raise your it's also a laser pointer
fortunately though there's a company
that's doing away with all that
ridiculousness it is called you guessed
it Dollar Shave Club and it really
couldn't be any simpler for a few bucks
a month Dollar Shave Club ships amazing
razors and other bathrooms stuff right
to your door their blades are just as
good as big shape companies at a
fraction of the price but they're not
just about the blades I got everything
you need for your whole shaven face
including dr. Carver's easy shave butter
to make your shave even more buttery
smooth and listen we all do it you gotta
try one wipe Charlies the new peppermint
infuse wipes for men they tingle in a
good way save time save money join now
at Dollar Shave Club calm /
TechnoBuffalo again fat azz Dollar Shave
Club complex TechnoBuffalo now that I've
got my beard for a prop I can finally
shave it my wife can be happy again so
where we left off don was saying that he
was a little bit upset people over using
his app and then he took his Twitter
account again to say that he can call
flappy bird the success of mine he wrote
but it also ruins my simple life so now
I hate it but why keep in mind his
native Vietnamese speakers something
certainly might have been lost in
translation it was accused by gaining
site kotaku of stealing sprites from
mario though he denied those accusations
and said there's an art to doing that he
told another user on Twitter that he had
no plans I our PR agency or take some of
his work off his hands because the altar
doing so would mean he wasn't indie
developer anymore he lose the street
cred because supposedly if you're just
going to mainstream by mid-afternoon
that one februari eighth win officially
announced today we take down flappy bird
from both iTunes and Google Play
attention had evidently gotten to him
even though he originally labeled the
title success the game was indeed pulled
although wins last tweet says that he
was making game still he also said he
won't sell flappy birds so don't ask him
at all Oh an also said he didn't pull
the app because of anything related to
legal issues just that he can't keep it
anymore despite denying any of the
glitch
at all a Reuters report suggested Monday
that wind may have received letters from
Nintendo although the report said
Nintendo was not considering a lawsuit
has been rumors of extortions and all
kinds of crazy stuff but that's the
story of flappy bird so yeah on one hand
refreshing to see a developer not being
it to start a company or become a
gazillionaire on the other hand I kind
of want to yell WTF dong you got a
success you've got something on your
hands developers can only dream about
even if you want to keep your indie cred
you could still enjoy the success
opposed to the app was making upwards of
fifty thousand dollars a day so credit
for making a pretty fun game that I
deleted then i reinstalled and then I oh
I can't stop playing but there are ads
on that so there was a ton of money to
be made and perhaps if you didn't want
the success it could have go into that
money somewhere that could have used it
instead of just pulling it all together
but that is the story of dong win and
that is the sad sad rise and fall of the
flappy bird what do you guys think I
love to hear your thoughts on this sort
of crazy bizarre story flappy bird sort
of flapped onto the scene all of a
sudden and then flapped away just as
quickly one of the other developers
going to follow this path maybe release
an app making a huge success or try
making success and take it away to try
and you know up its publicity the
reality is you can still get flappy bird
there's a port of it even on the pebble
watch and play it on the web you can
still install it if you choose on your
iOS device if you want to look through
some back channels to get it there ton
of ways to get your flappy bird on but
not the official way so dumb maybe you
want to give its official statement on
