TechnoBuffalo here taking a first look
at the just announced Samsung Galaxy Tab
7.7 and just announced as of a few hours
ago we are here at IFA taking a first
look it's go ahead and unlock the device
and familiar Samsung location the upper
right hand corner and it is running
Android Honeycomb with Samsung prior
Thierry TouchWiz on top which you'll be
able to see soon as I get to a panel
that has something on it go and scroll
the other way there we go TouchWiz looks
pretty familiar to what we've seen on
the other Galaxy Tab devices has some
cool tweaks to the OS that isn't unique
27.7 now you got some quick launch icons
here go ahead and click that instead
open up calculator and all of a sudden
it launches right on top of whatever
you're doing no matter what application
you're in kind of a cool feature but you
seen this it's a quick look at the
hardware go ahead and hold it up release
try on the left hand side you've got
your micro SD card slot little rice
underneath there under a door pop that
off boom go ahead and throw that storage
written this on the front got a
front-facing camera right there you've
got your power bus and your volume up
and down this strange-looking blonde
thing with the Samsung we're up to work
so make sure what that does I'll follow
up see if I can get answers to what that
is I get your charging port living here
on the bottom on the back a bit
different than the other galaxy test
we've seen but if I metallic feel to it
here you've got your rear facing camera
and your LED flash so quite a bit of
people here trying to take a look at the
Tab 7.7 so consider this a very very
early first look at me funny at the
