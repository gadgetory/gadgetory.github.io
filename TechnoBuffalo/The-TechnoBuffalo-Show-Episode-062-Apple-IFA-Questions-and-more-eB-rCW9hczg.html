Buffalo show I'm live your to host for
today Sean ani editor-in-chief of techno
Buffalo com i'm joined by deputy
managing editor Todd Hazleton hey
everybody how are you doing today Todd
I'm good club welcome back to the US
yeah long trip and yes it was it was a
long trip it of course you come back
right into apple mm-hmm yep i was in
just for everybody for some background
was in Germany and Berlin for Aoife last
week sort of got delayed on the flight
home sorta Florida so spent another day
out there in Europe and then got back
and then came pretty much right in Apple
but of to get stuck in you know I was
stuck in Paris so they were better yeah
I mean there are worse places in earth
so it was a nice that was that was okay
yeah so a and you'd never been to Paris
so I how does a bonus notnot that you
were like where who I've have a day I
can go to the Louvre right right right
exactly i didn't get to see the Eiffel
Tower anything like that but yeah you
know how can you miss the Eiffel Tower I
know I didn't think I'd have time I just
sort of like nine no I mean even from a
distance oh yeah good question you know
I didn't think like you were gonna go
ride the elevator back hahaha anybody
tourist seasons I've never been to Paris
oh I don't know how visible it is as
you're driving around but you would
think that might stick out I didn't see
it so huh yeah all right then well we're
going are in town anyway we're going to
start with Apple okay uh so yesterday
was the big annual Apple September event
to introduce the iphone 6s and 6s plus
mm-hmm and that had to be one of the
most underwhelming two hour and fifteen
minute presentations I've ever watched
yeah i agree with you i feel like excuse
me everybody i'm getting over a cold I
feel like everybody you know in all
these months we had these rumors and
leaks and I mean for the apple TV 2 that
in
many years and and here it is you know
yesterday is the big date you know the
big we're getting that ipad pro the new
iPhones okay we know this are kinda
girly generally CS version so small
updates and then and then finally the
Apple TV and so we get to see everything
for the first time and I felt very
underwhelmed as well they said the
iphones like didn't change except for
everything or something like that and
okay the 3d touch teams need you can dig
into menus and stuff like that will move
away and we'll come back to the iphones
the ipad pro just an expensive huge
tablet like I just don't understand 799
dollars for something with 32 gigs of
storage like okay it can multitask but
we were just talking about this before
the show like go buy a surface pro 3 or
a surface 3 and we were joking this
comic it's floating around now
especially was making fun of Steve
Ballmer at Microsoft when he introduced
the surface pro 3 or probably the
original surface pro actually and how
you know everybody was like what that's
a stupid ipad what a dumb idea it's got
that keyboard and it's got a cup holder
and a kickstand you know like lots of
jokes and then yesterday apple
introduces the ipad pro the keyboard and
it seems like people are like whoa
that's awesome you know 12.9 inch screen
all stuff it's like to me a surface pro
3 is a lot more powerful i mean you
actually get a core i set up to a core
i7 processor which means you can load
all kinds of applications and full
version of windows or it's just iOS so
right there 799 mmm was a starting price
before you add in the keyboard which is
169 dollars and the stylus which is
ninety-nine dollars you're at like 1,300
bucks there just seemed to me I mean
just get a macbook air so that
immediately was like whatever that's
correct expensive and then we get into
the apple TV and again people i was
looking on social networks last night
are saying like oh revolutionising the
TV industry ah de yada yada I mean look
this to me seemed a lot like what
Amazon's been doing with the Amazon tea
the Roku's been doing for forever the
Google is doing now with android TV
released their partners you have nvidia
the shield and i think they're doing a
great job and now Apple comes in and
does it and everybody's like whoa like
maybe it'll revolutionize the industry
and here's why because Apple has a huge
following of developers and so they
could get a lot more apps than we've
seen in the past I mean there's the
shield TV for example android has very
few apps so that's my long-winded answer
now I agree with you the to me one of
the most glaring issues with the the
whole presentation was where was the
ipad air three the ipad pro so that they
read they updated the ipad mini the
release the ipad pro so now you have a
low end consumer product and a high-end
business driven product where is the
product for this year for the mid to
high in consumer right it's oh it's last
year's models yeah I which is funny
because they spend all this time showing
these charts about how much better this
iPad pro is and all that with the new a
9x processor and so it's like kicking
everybody else in the stomach that has
the ipad air 2 from last year and they
can't upgrade it if they don't want that
12.9 in the screen or just an 800 bucks
just like yeah you're right there's like
no upgrade instead you just feel like
you have this outdated product last year
that now costs everybody else a little
bit less well and i actually i had i
didn't do an ipad air 2 i'm still on the
ipad air i decided to skip the two
mm-hmm and wait for the three and yeah i
mean the ipad pro first off it's only
got one more pixel ppi than the air too
so on a 12 point nine inch screen it's
not going to look as crisp also i don't
want to carry around a 12 point nine
inch tablet on a plane right you know
that that any nice places it is me let
me take my tray table i mean if i was
just flying in some tree tables
this big like yeah exactly yeah I am
when I'm on a plane I always you know at
some point during the flight out I'll
turn they all start looking around
seeing what equipment everyone's using
you know be at a kindle or you know a
tablet or whatever mm-hmm I have never
seen a galaxy tab 12.1 on the plane you
know I've never the only time you see
someone with the screen that big is when
they're on a laptop trying to actually
do some work right you're not going to
see your average consumer right now by
12 point nine inch tablet it's not going
to happen especially at that price yeah
because here's what I mean most of the
people you see on a plane right like
you're maybe playing games which I was
doing with like either a 3ds or my phone
or if you have like your iPad on the
other tray table and you hope that you
can you know finagle it enough that when
the food comes by you can fit the
plastic food tray in front of it and
then your drink next to that I mean how
are you gonna do that with it I'm just
like joking around here but it just
doesn't make sense to me no it doesn't
because it's a it's a multimedia machine
in consumption device and if you want a
computer you know I would why not get a
macbook air I don't get it yeah no it
doesn't make any sense and just a
disclaimer to everyone that that's
listening to the show men of what Todd
and I are saying is to be construed as
the official TechnoBuffalo review we
have not tight with these guys no I
we've not had time with these devices it
may be a great product we're just
talking about the basic fact that
there's the now this odd gap in the
product line that makes no sense I i
think the ipad pro has some great use
cases I mean the stuff they showed us
with the you know the showing the
diagram of the human body and being able
to update I think the medical update for
the Apple watch was amazing yeah that's
that's really cool there was some great
stuff shown yesterday now but we do need
to address one mind-boggling moment when
the first company to come out
yeah and state support for the ipad pro
was microsoft which was mind-blowing to
me because here you are they've been
trying to push the surface but you can
see now that Microsoft is very much
about services to it and getting up
office 365 subscriptions out there you
know use it on all your devices and sort
of go that route as well and then I'm
sure they'll say you know it you want to
do it a little better do it on a surface
pro but it just it's weird to me yeah
that all of a sudden you have microsoft
these who are battling come out there
and say hey we have you know awesome
support for this and then adobe showed
some cool stuff too yeah there was some
very cool stuff shown right I just was
blown away by the company that makes the
surface and has advertised the ever
living bejesus out of that thing mmm was
the first company Ott's too much stage
with a Polly I know I talk about a
direct competitor product yeah and
here's the thing too that I think is
worth considering and I don't I don't
know that it had I don't think it I OS 9
has support for mice right like I'm like
a mouse um I don't believe so no which
is for me we were talking about this in
earlier episodes I've been looking for a
tablet that I can actually like do work
on and I think android can get me there
with all the Google stuff we work on
surface gets me there but the keyboard I
don't like but I always need a mouse and
now Android natively supports Bluetooth
mice so you just know at it you've got
cursor on your screen whether it's a
phone or a tablet and I still can't
believe that iOS is leaving that out as
if to say just touch the screen all the
time and that's not actually something I
want to do what I'm trying to type and
move my cursor around and I don't know
yeah no I it was a very very odd day and
as for the iphones i mean yet they were
essence yeah I don't think I've I don't
think I've ever owned an SI con I i have
not out of choice right yeah well i lost
my iphone 5 and in England and
ended up with a 5s and I had a forest
because that was the first i phone on
sprint I will not be getting the 6s plus
i just i don't see any need for it
unless of course I lose my 6 plus which
is not in the plans folks see I an
upgrade so like and I usually I have two
lines where they cycle for upgrades but
I mean this is a longer conversation
when we've talked about here too but I
don't think I want to do these upgrades
anymore I think the industry is moving
away from them I don't know that I want
the like a two-year contract well and
kind of a free to this we have a
question here from such an bahala it's
very relevant to that are any of you
guys interest in apple's iphone upgrade
at all or are you guys going to continue
to buy the iphone the way you did it
before first off i don't think we have
enough details on the upgrade program
it's like it's like 30 bucks a month or
whatever 30 bucks a month but you get to
upgrade every year every year yeah i
don't know i said there's there's
something in there weed in here yeah it
was a very odd situation so i need i
need to see the full details of that
upgrade program before I would even
think about that being said I would
rather just buy my phone outright yeah I
was gonna say I'm with you I'm not big
on the idea of sort of it to me it feels
like I'm renting something I don't need
another thirty dollar bill I'll just buy
it outright yeah but I'm not sure I even
want to do that i mean i guess i could
sell the six and then buy this one out
right for me unlocked is big at least
for travel although this time i use
project fire i didn't even get a sim
card for iPhone another job which it was
awesome ended up costing me six bucks
for my week in Europe which is pretty
incredible that's amazing um but anyway
so I would rather not do the upgrade
program because I feel like to me that's
sort of like oh I'm renting the phone
and they give me another one and I'm
writing it and I don't want to do the
contract again because I don't be
carriers these days who knows where
we're going to be in two years they're
all kind of bumping around and then i
guess i would buy it outright but it's
expensive so i'd have to sell mine and
I'm not sure I want to sell it then i
would say i liken this to like a car
leasing program yeah yeah exactly yeah I
just I've never been one to lease right
yeah you both our cars um I don't know
it's just I don't think it's for me i
don't i know i know that in the past
with two year contracts carrier she's
buried in that that cost that rental
that $30 p every month and now it's just
sort of exposed more and they have you
have these options like 18 teen x the
early upgrade programs t-mobile started
with jump and now Apple has their own
but i don't know i like the idea that
their rental is a fully unlocked device
though right right well i think we also
needed and you've mentioned it briefly
but we definitely need to address the
apple TV after a three-year absence it
was finally updated and actually just as
i said that 94 keygen ask is the apple
TV worth upgrading to that's going to be
a really tough question it's there's a
lot of interesting things going on there
but there is nothing there except for
one feature which I'll get to in a
second there is nothing there that I
have not seen elsewhere that one feature
though is the what did they say and it
backs up and puts on the closed caption
I thought that was a very cool feature
oh that wasn't and yes you can ask Siri
to look up news and all that all they
did was they took away you using your
phone in your hand and put it up on the
television screen yeah yeah it's the
same difference but I more likely I'll
end up getting what I'm the streaming
guy I I have to test this stuff out that
being said I see no reason to get a 64
gigabyte version I I I don't fill up my
32 gigabyte iPad i'm not going to fill
up a 32 gigabyte
Apple TV it's just right especially cuz
it's sort of left in your home so you
can scream a lot of things it's just I
think the storage is what going to be
four games is my guess yeah which I hi
Marilee ok great they've added gaming
can you imagine play and yes I know you
can go on by third-party game
controllers taking third party out of
that do you see yourself playing a lot
of games with that remote no and I think
no like I'd rather just put turn on my
ps4 yeah it's the that the apple TV was
very definitely not a jaw-dropper and I
think after a three-year absence it kind
of needed to be there are so many
streaming options out there now like you
said with the fire TV Roku is killing it
on channel selection I mean there's over
2000 channels on roku nail although some
of them are of questionable quality when
they're a I every week I I look at
what's been added and I swear some of
those icons were made and ms paint I
know those kind of us yes yeah so yes
Roku has a very robust channel selection
only ninety nine dollars you know it
does have gaming very limited I think I
played a game once just to test it out
and I just I don't see a lot in the
apple TV that makes me go everybody has
to own this right you know and if they
truly were if they'd are working on the
streaming service that we've heard so
much about I think they should have held
it until the streaming service was ready
I know it's been three years another six
months when I have killed them yeah I
know I think it would have been more
compelling to say oh and you can do this
that nobody else can do and I get like
you know that did TV OS the platform
they're releasing the developers like we
can have lots of awesome apps than
developed for the TV but the examples
they gave you
no like Airbnb like the family booking
together I don't understand why why that
needs to be on the TV it seems like
that's always been sort of dawn on it on
a computer tablet or okay so fine you're
in your living room we're guilty d for
shopping like I think I amazon has
proven that like a smart phone or a
computer is good enough like who I mean
I guess you like you can do it that's
cool but who's actually going to do yeah
I'm confused about and like the other
app you know that was that was so
bizarre and then the fact that there
look how much detail you can see in the
zigzag stitching on this yeah what haha
why why are we talking about zig-zag
stitch it I don't care yeah and guilt
like who uses guilt anymore i thought
that hapless in service was dead i can't
remember the last time i heard anyone
even mentioned guilt and then you know
what we'll just close out the the apple
section by thing by stating that both
Todd and I thought it was the boy band
One Direction coming out as like that
once they lifted the curves like oh no
it's one republic I don't know why we
both thought it was one direction I
don't know I didn't know there was like
a difference I don't think I ever liked
me either that much was like oh that
doesn't like a played in ok we have a
lot of questions about Apple and we will
get to those during the question answer
session but i do want to touch a little
bit on etho since that was the big event
last week and we didn't have a show last
week so Todd you ready for this year no
comment but were the big things that got
you excited um I think definitely saw
the trend of low-cost phones continue so
alcatel had several of them halka so one
touch rather had like four or five that
I saw you know all that their sing are
going to be under 200 bucks when they
hit the market or under 250 at the high
end which is pretty crazy so that was
neat I didn't make the huawei event
because it's a lot of running around
around town so Sony was neat I thought
actually I thought it was kind of weird
that the Xperia z5 didn't feel
like that big of a flagship upgrade and
rather their 4k version of that fun it's
called the premium right now all these
phone names are lost in my head now but
the premium version they didn't really
even show it they just had it like glued
to the wall which is crazy so like I was
like okay the display looks awesome but
like is this proof of concept or is like
phone actually working like it wasn't in
the demo stations ya know those very on
phones not going to come out for a long
time I can be wrong um you know but I
feel like they might want to have done
that to say like Oh first like we beat
Samsung like we were we're selling we
have these displays and stuff so um what
else I hope I thought it was cool though
that we're moving in that direction
whether actually can use for hair not um
I thought the gear s2 is really great I
spent a lot of time with that actually
Samsung gave us plenty of time with it
and it the rotating bezel is really nice
and smooth it's a great way I think
better than storing the Apple watch I
think better than the crown on the Apple
watch because sure the I mean look
you're gonna block the screen a little
bit which is what Apple has said you
know why they they put the crown on the
side but it was just really smooth Tizen
which which power is it was great there
were enough apps not a lot but enough
apps you know for news and weather and
sports the one thing i'd say i'd
complain about was that you still need
to use it sounded like the default text
messaging app like on samsung phones and
i use messaging and i'm not sure how
that's like google messaging or
messenger whatever it is for text
messaging and i'm not sure how that's
going to work on the other android
phones that are supported by the gear s2
because it doesn't require a samsung
phone this here which is pretty neat it
is important about um but they didn't
give us pricing which is kind of hard to
deal with because like I can't make a
final I mean I wouldn't give a final
until I actually used it for a long time
but a final judgment unlike whether this
is that exciting until I find out how
much it costs like if it's 800 bucks
it's not going to be but if it's a
comment box I'd be like well not that
great right it was really premium I
think the oddest thing to me
didn't Sony say they were going to scale
way back on phones yeah that's the other
thing they said like oh you know we've
got to figure out mobile because they
haven't figured it out recently and
they're losing money there and so what
they do this year they did experiment
this is just on the high end xperia z4
xperia z4 v which i don't think is even
hip verizon yet xperia z5 xperia z5
compact and xperia z5 premium or really
it's called click and that's just the
expensive phones yeah I know they've
released a bunch of lower in phones you
know if that's scaling back yeah what
were their original plans yeah but I
also thought it strange that HTC wasn't
there I mean I'm kind of used to seeing
HTC at these shows I guess they just
don't have anything to really talk about
right now but they have an event coming
up i think that was announced while i
was there right right yeah i don't know
where it is though so there's that
huawei like i said i didn't get to see
it but that phone seemed interesting
what else did you see oh I saw the Moto
360 s which was totally different
because I'm used to you know covering
mobile being in a motorola event and
instead of metal lenovo event now
because it's owned by oh no so they're
like talking about gaming computers and
tablets and like all this stuff and
you're like we're sitting there you know
me and some other mobile journalists and
then they're like a moto 360 like wow
this is different so then you know you
rush in and you got to cover the watches
and funny thing at that event lenovo has
a SmartWatch i'm not sure what it's
called but it looks a lot like at least
under the neon lights of these in the
loud music and crowds it looks a lot
like the Moto 360 so I rush over to the
stand and I'm filming it and I'm like
this can't be in it's got Lenovo
branding on and so I stopped filming a
look around and there's like a moto 360
table behind so I jump over there but so
lenovo has a SmartWatch to not even sure
what powers powers inside so it looks a
lot like moto 360 um there's a lot of
you know lot of stuff going on either
and the funny thing is with Aoife too is
like you go to the trade show or the
show floor for press conferences stuff
but you're also going all around
excuse me and they go I mean I think
Lenovo's press conference went to like
930 at night so it's a fun show yeah
good grief well we're going to jump into
the questions because we are getting a
ton of them and I want to get through as
many of them as we can and these are all
over the board folks so let's see here
from Benjamin McDonald is the one plus
one still a good buy for two hundred
seventy dollars USD 64 gigabytes i would
say so i think so i would also look at
the Alcatel OneTouch three that's a
really night'll three that's a really
nice phone I've played with it in my
hand several times I haven't actually
used it for a long period of time I
would look at that I think it's priced
around the same but uh otherwise it
anymore one plus one is fine I just a
kind of you and I kind of fell out of
love with it after a little while but
two hundred seventy bucks is a little
better than what we said ya know two
hundred seventy bucks i could see doing
yeah I I think part of the problem you
and I have is it's real easy for us to
fall out of love with phones because we
owe anything shiny yeah that's great
check out the moto g2 I mean it's not as
size sexy but it's a little bit cheaper
and I actually that's one of the phones
where I'm still like that was a really
grateful okay we've got a question here
from brazen Franco which is a puzzler
where does the ipad pro stand between
the cheaper macbook air in the entry
macbook pro will the air get X in favor
of the more expensive and weaker macbook
that's the strategy here is really
puzzling because you now have an iPad
with a similar screen size to a laptop
but it this this is going to be one that
it's going to be interesting to see how
it shakes out I figure it's going to
probably take two years for it to shake
out I think apple is moving towards
axing something I don't know what yet
yeah cuz you have to wonder like macbook
air and macbook are sort of right there
together but i think in my opinion the
macbook is just is underpowered it
wouldn't it wouldn't cut it for me the
macbook is a is an oddity in my opinion
i think it's a beautiful computer oh it
to look at it's gorgeous yeah that's
nice just don't actually try to use it
for anything yeah it's uh you know III
just have to bring this up I'm I think
Todd you and I anytime now someone calls
us Apple fanboys we can just point them
to this episode yeah but I normally when
an ample event ends I'm like oh yo I'm
really interested in getting bad or
maybe that this sound like yeah I might
pick up an apple TV yeah no no no and
that's the extent of my interest in
purchases this year right I think the
blurring though presence is to get in
there is probably between that ipad pro
and the entry-level macbook especially
considering the power they're saying
that the a 9 X has versus the power we
know that core m in the macbook has
which I don't think is very powerful at
all and I don't know what the a 9 X a 9
X is like but it is OS x and so where
does that start to blend but I think
those two remain right now is sort of
like the borders but where where do we
cross and I think that's what you're
saying Sean probably next two years
circus yeah we're definitely reach a
convergence point yeah because the
pricing is pretty similar yeah me when
you when your outfit the pro with
everything yeah exactly from such a halt
do you think apple will still have
another event in october november first
off we heard a rumor yesterday that they
are they are but i would say it was just
simply from the amount of stuff that was
shown yesterday there is not another
event to happen that yeah I mostly did
like something with compete
shooters but i don't know i don't think
so yeah I sort of it that's usually wdc
think yeah it's it's gonna be odd to see
what happens just be quiet quiet
refreshes with like the 6th gen intel
core i processors and stuff right uh
from divvying chandra chandra and I'm
sorry if I mispronounced your name will
the new Todd I'm getting some feedback
for me somewhere the heavier volume
turned on turn down you are ok uh was
the new Apple's new upgrade program
allowed the international models to be
exchanged like a person who has an
indian iphone 6 who will be shifting to
the US be able to take advantage of the
program um i highly doubt it I actually
I would I don't know because there's
only so many skews of the iphone 6 and 6
plus because they have so many bands
like the new ones to the 6s and 6s plus
that it might might work but I wouldn't
rely on it but i don't know i mean it
might work it's worth talking to him to
about but it might just be dependent on
like yeah like it might be us only for
all we know yeah that's and we would
love to help you but that is such a
specific use case i think you'll have to
ask somebody from apple um from real for
dyess uh 1 plus 2 or HTC One m9 plus hmm
i think i'd go m9 i'd go i would
probably go 1 plus i haven't really used
it that much but one plus two because
pricing and 9 + 0 and 9 plus i haven't
used that one I was thinking I'm not
yeah oh no guys thank you I can't give a
fair answer on that but i'm guessing the
one plus twos a lot cheaper so yeah if
you're after prices indefinitely 1+2 if
you don't care about the price i would
lean towards the m9 plus because I just
think HTC has such great physical design
yeah yeah I love slots yes since is the
only skin that I can tolerate yeah um
from Britain Franco what do you expect
if any of the zenfone 3 at CES 2016 uh
probably I hope so that was a confusing
press conference to be at it if I'll
tell you what because they re announced
they announced like six phones that have
already been on the market and I'm like
sitting there you know as a journalist
because sometimes days you know
sometimes these are exclusive to certain
countries and stuff when they're
launched I'm sitting there googling them
as we go like like making sure I do I
have to cover that have to cover these
phones they announced one of them was as
old as last CES so maybe we'll have a
sin phone three because what we saw
wasn't knew it are you working on
something I'm more just sitting here
going do we really have to start talking
about see us yeah that's you but where
is this your gun dog I don't know it's
flying by I very start getting CES
emails yep member da talk to be him
that's simple months down the road yeah
oh good grief from such an bahal is the
ipad pro worth the upgrade from the ipad
2 or show i can serve one of the ipad
air's from the ipad 2 i would say air
unless you really just want a bigger
screen yeah it's not only worth the
upgrade then yeah I panties old yeah
well I mean yes it's old it still works
yeah yeah yeah looks like is it worth
the upgrade certainly we saw the
performance difference yesterday oh yeah
I had the performance difference was
amazing I need one or not as yeah oh I
did I had died i cannot remember what
generation this is but when i was a
clean my house recently I found in a
drawer
or one of my old ipod touches nice and I
I have to try remember which model this
is because it cannot upgrade paths iOS
6.1 point2 hahahahaha what does it say
like that's it they're just like you're
up to date I'm white it's six point one
point to it I reisen it had been over
two years since I advise turns us on but
there's the the model should be on the
back bottom I just haven't taken out of
its case yeah i also found I got to go
through my drawers and find all things
my original iPad Mini that's awesome yes
yes I was quite excited to find i also
found i don't have it on my desk right
now I found my palm 7 X which still
worked Wow yeah well the thing was I was
like oh do I even have a charger for
this I'd forgot it rain on double-a
batteries oh okay someone bring me two
double A batteries hey look it powered
up but it's awesome can you imagine how
long would um I'm sure you can figure it
out how long would like an iPhone last
on two double A batteries Oh Charlie
like 10 minutes yeah I'm sure sigh I
don't know how to do that I I'm sure
some electrical expert could figure it
out but that's definitely not either one
of us right from brezin Franco is Apple
training entered the motion gaming
segment with the Apple TV you know this
was funny yesterday Joey are gaming
editor he he helps with the Apple events
by yo editing post after they've been
published and all that and he watches
along so he just knows what's coming and
what they started talking about motion
control he's like are you kidding me
because I'm gay these ayahs sure he's
like look we've done this it didn't take
off you know it was popular for a while
it's not going anywhere because what are
they doing but the whole family can have
fun didn't you see ya
where Joey killed me what I cannot
repeat verbatim what he said it was
brace a body part we've got screensavers
oh yeah yeah yeah I can't believe they
talked about screensavers I the fact
that they brought up screen savers is a
selling point for the Apple TV like High
Definition recordings good grief that
was something else from brazen Franco
and this is one that I'm very curious
about is the Apple pencil technology all
behind the pen or is it like the notes
split between the pen and the screen I
think it has to be split um because the
screen has to be able to detect you know
like it was saying that you know it can
tell what angle it's a door how much
pressure you're applying the only way
that pressure yes there could
technically be a spring in there that
the amount of the pen tip being pressed
would tell it the pressure but I think
since they said that the ipad pro had
this 3d touch which is a horrible name
has this 3d touch that i think it has to
be a mixture between the pen and the
limit pro i did want to mention one
thing i found it hilarious that the only
way to charge the pin is to suck power
out of the tablet yes hopefully it's not
that much but it's crazy I I was like
okay wait a minute the only way you made
this chargeable most you plug it into a
device that you're already going to be
wondering about how much battery life at
hats yeah and and since when does all
day mean 10 hours I think they're
thinking like all day work day no I I
know but I'm just like let's let's not
call that all day and I I don't disagree
yeah that's like be a quarter terabyte
hard drive they sent a comfortable 250
megabytes or gigabytes I had to be the
funniest naming of a size ever a quarter
terabyte a good grief oh let's see here
for
kemet rakesh Todd does the iphone
success or success plus have one
gigabyte or two gigabyte of ram lots of
contradicting reports all over the
Internet I can tell you why there's
contradicting reports because apple
doesn't tell us how much for everything
has usually the best way we can find
this out when we find out is when a site
like I fixed it does the teardown yeah
me and then they identify the modules
otherwise excuse me until then it's sort
of up in the air no unless unless
somebody gets a confirmation from Apple
but Apple never talks about that either
Apple never reveals the RAM on phones or
tablets it just doesn't happen so yeah
and like Todd said until I fix it or
someone else turns it down physically we
will have no clue how much RAM these
devices have yeah we cut a politico
matter yeah as long as it works but I
mean people care so not just add it I
think they're afraid that people are
gonna be like but this has four gigs and
this has one oh I can't why would I get
one gig you know and I agree that with
Apple on that front that it doesn't
necessarily matter on iOS and it's the
they've done a pretty good job yeah from
such a Mahal Todd what was your favorite
thing from Aoife 2015 and why uh the
flight home know that i'd say the gear
s2 i went or i guess the huawei watch
which was really nice for Android wear
but I technically I guess I saw that a
little early and then covered it
praneetha but what from what I saw have
to show the gear s2 I think I went into
it thinking oh Samsung's Tizen devices
have been okay but you know block and
then I walked away from that meeting
like okay I would totally wear one of
those so I think that was probably my
favorite thing from breslin Franco do
you think the pin will work on the ipad
air 2 or ipad mini 4 i highly doubt it
probably not properly yeah yeah I again
I think it's all going to come down to
how much of it is in the ipad pro itself
compared to how much is in the pen yeah
because i don't know if it did work with
the other two well I again they're soo
ayla looking at it if it did work with
the other two they might have said that
because then they could sell more pens
but they might not have said that too so
they can sell more ipad pro kids
love to find out i'm gonna guess doesn't
work properly though that would be my
guess as well from anab 9900 are you
happy about what you saw in the keynote
or would you want something else or
something different um that's a tough
one yeah I think we were pointed I don't
know if we were unhappy yeah I think we
knew so many rumors seem to be right
going into it that we sort of had a
really good idea of what to expect I
think I expected more from the apple TV
it just didn't feel as groundbreaking
and I suppose maybe that'll come later
with a service that they can activate
and again I haven't used it so maybe
maybe a lot of this is that it felt kind
of boring because we've been hearing
about it for so long but once we use the
products will you know be a little bit
more revitalized be like okay this is
actually pretty cool I can see where
this is going like 3d touch is actually
awesome I don't know I have using it but
right now I just don't feel like I was
as impressed as I have been in the past
yeah um from brezin Franco uh I'm sorry
Benjamin MacDonald read the wrong name
there i'm using a moto g first gin and i
am looking for enough new phone it's
slow as a word i cannot say on a clean
show my price range is 300 USD and down
I want as stock experience as possible
love the show the new Moto G yeah i love
the Moto G a and he's not kidding he
really loves the new beverage a like
oddly enough i was using it as my daily
driver past the review period because i
was just like this one is awesome I mean
I you know it's the processor and I
forget
off the top of my head we'll certainly
probably start to get sluggish and
everything as you load up apps and use
it for a long time but eventually get as
slow as your first gen but for the price
it's pretty sweet i mean i would just go
with the more expensive model which I
think has two gigs of ram and then you
get and then you're well under your
budget there yeah definitely um let's
see here from Brisbane Franco we're
going to be wrapping up here pretty
quick folks wouldn't be possible to get
options given by 3d touch on the iphone
6 by simply tapping and holding with two
different delta x for the pick and pop I
think Willie's just four different times
like the phone would recognize sort of
as it does on Android like when you want
to change the background yeah say you
want to change the wallpaper you just
hold down for a little bit longer I
think yeah that would make sense but
it's just apples sort of doing it
differently and I saw a lot of people
saying yes sir like well a droid team
doing this squirt of and yeah for the
fence but once you know if you haven't
used an Apple watch or were of course
touch on a MacBook and you can tell why
they didn't use for such maybe maybe it
works differently on a macbook pro it
does it does feel like it has this extra
push so it is different than that mom
hold but resident I think you're right
like it could theoretically seem to work
that way if you just one health well
just like you would move an icon around
on the home screen on an iPhone why
can't they just change the times like
that no well folks I is going to bring
