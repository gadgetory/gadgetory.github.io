TechnoBuffalo to test and review the
latest grade of smartphones on the
market right now but oftentimes these
flagship phones come with flagship
prices and it seems like a thousand
dollars and somehow now becoming the
normal price for a high-end smartphone
but a good solid smartphone does not
need to cost nearly that much Google
suite of Android one phones is beginning
to take shape and the newest addition to
that lineup the nokia 6.1 is here and it
aims to bring a lot of features to
customers for a very low price let's see
how good this budget smartphone really
is so let me get this out of the way
right off the bat the naming scheme on
this phone is a little bit confusing
it's technically called at the Nokia 6.1
20 18 edition for the sake of simplicity
in this video I'm gonna stick with just
calling it the Nokia 6 the first thing
you need to know about the nokia 6 is
its price it's gonna vary a bit
depending on location carrier specials
and where you get it but it's safe to
say you can get this phone for pretty
much under $300 anywhere with many
online retailers like Amazon sunlit to
closer for a two hundred and seventy
dollar price point now this is a big
deal for many countries around the world
where the price of a over $1000
smartphone is pretty much out of the
question
Nokia is teaming up with Google here to
offer a solid smartphone with lots of
features for a very affordable price and
I commend them for that but how good can
a smartphone the cost this much actually
perform actually it's not as bad as you
may think one of the biggest selling
points on this phone is the fact that
it's an Android one phone and that means
it's running pretty much stock Android
free of any skins launchers or that
really annoying carrier bloatware the
none of us want or ever use you're
getting the Google promise here of a
stable phone the latest software updates
security patches and one of the purest
Android experiences out there and I
really like that after using the p20 pro
for a bit I really miss that stock
Android experience you'd get on
something like the pixel there are no
duplicate apps there's no tweaks needed
there's no skins that need to be
installed it's just stock Android out of
the box and it's really nice and
powering Android on this phone is a
Snapdragon 630 processor 3 gigs of RAM
along with 32 gigs of internal storage
and these specs are not the bleeding
edge of
for this phone he's not trying to be a
flagship or really compete with one
there are my five days of testing the
phone was not super slow but also wasn't
super fast or buttery smooth though that
being said the average consumer who's
getting this phone it probably won't be
bothered by that at all day to day tasks
like multitasking and web browsing
you're gonna run on here without any
issues and even games perform well
though I did notice some occasional slow
app load times and some general Agyness
on multiple occasions it was a very
solid experience overall like I said it
can handle game as well even games like
pub G Mobile which can play on here
quite well though it's gonna be on low
settings and you're gonna get the
occasional drop frame it's gonna be a
like I said a very solid and enjoyable
experience moving on from performance
let's talk about that display the Nokia
6 has a 5.5 inch HD 1920 by 1080 display
that is technically just an LCD display
it's not 18 by 9 there's no OLED it's
just a regular old 1080p panel and it
looks like one and I will say that after
using OLED screens or Super AMOLED
displays you can find on other flagships
I do notice that the colors on this
display look a little bit dull and a
little washed out it's also got some
substantial bezel around it but hey at
least there's no knotch for the average
person using this to scroll through news
feeds or play videos it's gonna work
just fine and speaking of videos if
you're gonna watch a lot of videos on
this phone you're gonna need a little
bit of a heads up because you may be a
little bit disappointed
unlike other Nokia phones the earpiece
on the nokia 6 does not double as a
speaker so the only speaker you're
getting on this phone is located on the
bottom it's very easily covered by your
hand when you're watching something in
landscape but a little bit of saving
grace here there is a headphone jack on
top the entire body of this phone is
built really well it's made out of
aluminum it feels very solid and the
phone also comes in a variety of
different color options the back of this
phone sports well looks like on first
glance like the typical 2018 style of
vertically stacked camera system but on
a closer inspection that is definitely
not the case there's just a single
sensor sitting inside that little cutout
but that sensor is 16 megapixels and the
photos at 8 shoots are very solid I know
I keep bringing a price but I
think it's an important part of this
story compared to the pixel to excel in
the iPhone 10 and the s9 and s9 plus
this camera is far from comparable but
for the price it brings some very good
results in pretty much any environment a
few other things worth mentioning there
is a fingerprint reader on this phone
and it works ok I found there were some
small delays when using it to unlock the
phone a few times but nothing super
unreasonable battery life is actually
really good on this phone of course
there's no super high end display or
high end processor that's gonna run down
that 3000 milliamp hour battery but I
will say that I was easily able to last
a full day and I was able to play all my
games watch videos without having to
worry about that battery draining now I
did plug it in at night it does support
fast charging over USB type-c
I do want to mention also I was a bit
disappointed by the taptic feedback
built into this phone it came across a
little mushy and inconsistent when I was
typing and it just kind of was a general
unpleasantness despite all the
shortcomings this phone has the one
thing that I cannot ignore again is that
price for a phone that is about 270
dollars I can't help but almost forgive
some things like a slower processor or
an average display and an OK solid
camera obviously the price alone is not
enough to give this phone a free pass
from any criticism but putting this
phone into context understanding that
this phone is built not to compete with
high-end flagships but to serve a budget
conscious consumer and more emerging
markets to a certain extent I need to
understand that this for many people is
a very perfectly good phone it may not
be your dream phone may not be my dream
phone but for many who are looking for
an affordable good looking solid smart
phone that also happens to run in stock
Android you will be very hard-pressed to
find a better alternative than the Nokia
6.1 alright guys so what are your
thoughts on this 270 dollars smartphone
I know often times here TechnoBuffalo
we're looking at the higher-end flagship
so the cream of the crop the best the
best we want to change up our
perspective a little bit and look at
more of these budget-friendly more
affordable smart phones and one of those
phones coming out very soon is the
Motorola g6 and we will have a video on
that so be sure to subscribe to the
channel and hit that notification bell
so you're notified when that video comes
out I am Robert Roosevelt from
TechnoBuffalo thank you so much for
watching I'll
in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
