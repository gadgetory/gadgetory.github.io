TechnoBuffalo here with an unboxing
almost 13 years in the making
there's been a lot of talk about an
apple at Apple that's been coming I
thought before we can see what a product
you might do to get a perspective on the
history of the product and really what
they've done in the past so I've got an
unboxing for you today of the last Apple
Newton message pad the 2100 released
just about 13 years ago it's a still a
very exciting device and does a lot of
things that eventually found their way
into the iPhone and even Mac OS 10 as a
whole a few very very cool things I
think it's a device that will give us
interesting perspective on where Apple
may take this alleged isolate that's
coming later on in the month let's go
ahead and get to the unboxing this is of
course not Apple packaging which is just
you know set as is no this looks like a
no idea what's in here the Newton is a
very cool device it was really one of
the first and the biggest messaging pads
out there came out around you know if
you do the math around the 97 ish time
really right when the Palm Pilot was
starting to become more mainstream
Newton's a much larger device but
definitely did a lot more than the
initial palm offerings and it certainly
was years before or about a year or so
before Windows CE II was even thought of
or announced so let it go ahead get to
the unboxing enough of me babbling this
is what you guys want to see you
definitely what I want to see I'm really
curious about the new and I think it's
going to give a nice perspective a
little bit of a history lesson on Apple
product to the holes and this is
probably one of the most talked about
Apple products good or bad in their
company's history the voice heard a lot
of great things about the UI on the
Newton but you only see the Newton
associated with a product failure so not
really sure what to expect with this put
the knife aside let's go ahead and dig
in and see what we have and this is just
you know packaging certainly not the way
it initially came so just a little bit
of styrofoam and there is the Newton
mess up at 2100 this is the last of the
message pad lines as the most
someone I would say that was out there
and it is big I'll do some size
conversions for you if there's a battery
door on the side of course our power
adapter and that's about it
push this box off to the side and let's
take a look at the Newton's certainly
not coming videos I'll be walking you
through the software the hardware
showing you what it does and why in a
lot of ways this is still a relatively
modern device as far as technology and
surely is gonna be a good comparison
with even a device like the iPhone 4
what this can do you know almost 13
years ago that the iPhone still maybe
cannot do so here is the message pad
it's a pretty nice weight in size
Freyja comparison here is the iPhone 3GS
so you can definitely see that this is a
big honkin device which is relatively
thick you've got a screen right here
which is opened up I believe just by
pushing that and we'll do a full
hardware overview as well of this but
let me go over some of the specs this
thing has a strong arm 110 processor
which I believe is about 162 megahertz
so it's certainly not the most powerful
processor it's got 8 megabytes of ROM a
for internal and actually for that are
in one of these PC slots there two of
them here and these could do a sort of a
ton of a ton of cool things when it
first came out let's see what we got
going on here so watch out one of these
four megabytes yep that PCMCIA amazing
that this big huge card is 4 megabytes
backed over 13 years ago you look now at
micro sd and even SD cards and you get
you know 16 32 gigabytes on one of these
this was 4 megabytes you know probably
came in for 8 or maybe didn't succeed
and that was huge
this would barely even hold 2 songs so
it's kind of a nice perspective on how
far coming technology I believe that
this actually shipped with the Apple
Newton the edge 4 megabyte flash card I
remember having 4 megabytes thinking
that was a lot of room so if you guys
are a little bit older you remember that
as well I think we've got a dummy slot
as well with just a uh a filler one in
there but we'll go over all this at a
later time and there were things you
could put in there too that made this a
little more
so you couldn't think of facts with it
there's even a modem that you could send
and even do some possible emailing with
certainly no no internet though at the
time it's going to take a look at some
of the other specs that this has one of
the interesting things is the screen
size and the screen resolution
it's the resolution of 480 by 320 which
if that sounds familiar for you exactly
the same resolution as the iPhone
certainly this only shows just a few
shades of grey the iPhone definitely
shows many many colors but resolution
wise it's exactly the same and something
that you probably haven't seen from
Apple we've got a stylus this is
definitely not the stylus that first
came from with the Newton Sims from
Nabisco probably came free or bundled
with something but this is what the
shipper included it with that means we
are dealing with a resistive touchscreen
it does feel very hard in glass like
it's not relatively squishy certainly a
stylus is probably not something that
you would expect from an Apple product
one cool thing about this so that I have
seen other videos and other bright ups
got a little bit of style of styler
right on top so you can just doctor
psilocin do your writing and keep on
going the message pad just does a ton of
really cool things I'm looking forward
to showing it to you it's always kind of
fun and nostalgic to see the old Apple
logo to the color guy when it was Apple
computers we also noticed this is Newton
technology Apple actually spun off the
Newton technology from Apple which made
their own company that's why it's
branded as such on the device so it's a
real quick walk through and then we'll
save all the rest of it for um for
future videos you've got some rubber
feet here you've got some little
connectors that would have been possibly
used for some sort of dock adapter feet
to make it stand up there was another
little bit a bit of a numb forever might
have been a potential dock on the top
you've got your IR port serial port so I
think computer haven't seen the serial
port in many many years your power and
what would have been your stylus ila but
certainly this is not the proper stylus
as you can see I assumed it would have
sort of snapped in and clicked we've got
a big speaker on the front your Newton
message pad 2100 and what I would
is probably a microphone a little do
some checking on that to let you guys
know battery pack looks like the door is
falling out so you want to get that out
your pipes using a little bit of shaking
but we'll plug it in and try the power
that way and your power and hold switch
on the left-hand side anyway guys this
is the first reefers look at the Newton
message pad you can see where the the
tablet is the legend isolate is going to
be going they take a further look at the
mutant device hope you guys enjoyed
definitely stay tuned for TechnoBuffalo
for a lot more information and details
on the device I'm John Rhett enger' and
I'll see you the next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
