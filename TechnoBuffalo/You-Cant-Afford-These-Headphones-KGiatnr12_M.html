TechnoBuffalo this is a little more
solemn of a video then you might be used
to I tend to be a little bit more
excitable but we're about to put on
headphones that cost more than some
people's salaries I'd be lying if I said
I wasn't a little bit for clumped right
now there is an enormous amount of care
and quality that goes into making these
these headphones we just heard Scott who
is still right over here
heading up all of headphones for for
Sennheiser and it's phenomenal to see
and hear the kind of craftsmanship that
goes into these kinds of things by the
way I haven't put these on just yet the
base is made of marble the the glass
tubes everything from start to finish on
this thing screams artisanal if you get
my meaning so I wanted to wait to put
these on until I was ready to be on
camera so I'm gonna put these on I'm
gonna turn the volume up Hotel
California is playing right now
and that again according to Scott is
what Sennheiser has been using for
upwards of 30 years as a reference track
Scott says so I'm gonna turn it up and
you're gonna see my face and I'm gonna
hope I don't cry
it's almost like I can't turn them up
high enough there's not an inkling of
distortion there's not in the I don't
even feel remotely qualified to wear
these I don't even feel like I can
appropriately relay to you what I'm
hearing the the total number of units of
these that even exist in the world is is
staggeringly low and it is an absolute
privilege to be able to use something
like this from a brand that is so so
trusted in this particular field I wish
you guys could do these I really really
wish that you guys could hear these
anyway there's there's a lot more
information about these on the on the
post associated with this everything
from exactly how the tubes work and the
options for the bases and the fact that
all of these knobs are cut from the same
block of aluminum Wow
Wow thank you guys so much for watching
this video I hope you appreciated it and
I hope that if you're ever in a position
to be able to use this pair of
headphones that you do make sure that
you make it a priority and if I ever
make enough money or we get sent a
review unit then then I would be only
too happy to sit back in a chair just
like this at home and sip on my scotch
so let me get back to it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
