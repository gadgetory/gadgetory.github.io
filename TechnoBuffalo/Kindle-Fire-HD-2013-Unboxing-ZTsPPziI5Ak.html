are unboxing the brand new Kindle Fire
HD awesome pretty major changes on this
one compared to the last generation of
Kindle Fire HD so let's give it an unbox
and see what's inside
alright so here it is the Kindle Fire HD
this is the third generation of Kindle
Fire HD 7 inch here's the box so
obviously very media-centric that is
what the Kindle Fire is all about we
have the 8 gigabyte we've got 8 gigs of
storage onboard it's Wi-Fi only
obviously this is the one that's 139
this is the one everyone's kind of
excited about because it's a really
inexpensive entry level tablet so let's
open the box and see what's inside got
our nice smug I think of this Amazon
logo is very smug but I don't know about
you guys you have to tell me if you feel
that way
alright I'm gonna open this I'm just
gonna assume I'm just gonna break this
box probably because I'm really bad at
stuff like this there we go
it's a certified frustration-free you
haven't met me amazon you have not met
me and there is the tablet so it's in
here but before we get into the tablet
we're gonna put that aside for a second
and check out what else is in the box
you got you're getting to know your
Kindle for anybody who has not used the
Kindle before it's kind of nice always
good to have for someone who is a
first-time tablet owner especially with
the Kindle always good and then we've
got some other some other goodies in
here we see you're syncing and charging
cable your wall wart and that's pretty
much it it's pretty straightforward
there's nothing else in the box I could
lift it but it's stuck down so there's
nothing else in here but your cable and
your charger so let's get into the
Kindle here it is inside lovely bag pull
this out and these are like super tight
here alright here we go
so this is the new Kindle Fire HD 7 inch
there's a couple of pretty major
differences between the 3rd gen and the
2nd gen the first one being there is no
front facing camera now there wasn't a
rear facing camera
on the last gen of Kindle Fire so no
taking pictures and looking like an
insane person at a concert with a tablet
but on this one they have a shoot even
the front facing camera so you'll see
there's nothing happening over here and
because of that they've also gotten rid
of the microphone so you're not going to
be able to do video calls on this no
Skype no selfies nothing like that you
will you will be on your own this is
purely for consumption not output here's
the top here you've got your
three-and-a-half millimeter headphone
jack and then on the back of the device
volume up and down rocker I do like that
these are a little bit concave that's
pretty nice you know looks sort of
filled out on the back of the device
your power button right here and Dolby
Digital you got two speakers so we've
got one here and one here hopefully
because they're so low on the device you
won't end up with any issues covering it
but I could see where that might be a
little bit of an issue so we'll have to
test that out when we take a look at the
device for the hands-on and also for the
review so let's see if we can boot it up
get it running I'm gonna hit the power
button here now just so you guys know on
the Kindle Fire this particular
generation has one gig of ram just like
the last one and it's got a very small
spec bump in terms of CPU it's still a
dual-core processor but instead of 1.2
gigahertz it's 1.5 so 1.5 dual-core
processor on board on this it's still
the same 720p screen it supports 720p
resolution I should say it's 1280 by 800
so just a little bit over 720 and that's
for gestures and everything like that
very same networking 802 11 a BGN no AC
on this model obviously probably to save
a little bit of money but that's okay I
mean again it's it's sort of an
entry-level thing and then and lastly
it's really let's see sorry about that
you guys uh-huh and lastly it's you know
like we said eight gigs and it is based
on this is fire OS 3.0 and it's based on
Android 4.2.2 so not quite Android 4.3
but definitely a big jump
the previous API level for the Kindle
Fire second-gen which is based on
android 4.0.3 so so definitely a change
if you want to hit complete setup later
we can do that but yeah so here it is
and that is the unboxing we will get
into a hands-on with this and see how it
performs in terms of this silk browser
and also all of the other features that
it has available on it again really
compelling price and we're really
excited to sort of put it through its
paces here that's it for the video if
