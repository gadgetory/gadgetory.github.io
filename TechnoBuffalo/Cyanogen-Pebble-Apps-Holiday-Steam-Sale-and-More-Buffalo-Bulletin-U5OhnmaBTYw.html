top stories slama Jen Inc continues its
inevitable march toward a smartphone
partnership after announcing this week
they would be expanding their staff of
20 22 / 70 people yesterday Santa Jen
announced it raised an additional twenty
three million dollars in funding and
felt with that investment they were
ready to expand their company and bring
cyanogenmod to non smartphone devices
like TVs wearables and even cars to huge
win for the little mod that could and
will be keeping our eyes on cyanogen
progress as they expand pebble also in
the news this week on Wednesday they not
only introduced pebble SDK 2.0 they also
announced plans to launch an app store
for their smart watch in 2014 the store
will live inside the pebble app for iOS
and Android and will offer daily remotes
games notifications tools and utilities
sports fitness and watch face sections
pebble says the store won't support paid
apps from the get-go so absolutely free
at least for now paid pebble apps will
still be able to publish through the
google play store though so if you're
not developers in gaming it's the most
wonderful time of the year and by that i
mean it's the steam holiday 2013 sale
it's been unleashed wallets around the
globe cried out in unison of steam
launch their annual sale which features
deep discounts on some really great
titles for example BioShock Infinite
with 10 bucks on steam last I check ten
bucks the sale runs until January third
and they'll have flash sales and new
deals popping up regularly so get on it
people as games aren't going to play
themselves Nintendo held another
nintendo direct stream this past
Wednesday morning lots of games were
featured you can watch the entire live
stream embed on our site but one of the
best moments was a kind of surprised
game announcement a dynasty warriors
meet
to action brawler tentatively titled
Hyrule warriors nintendo president
satoru iwata also mentioned this game
was not the next official installment of
the legend of zelda and was just a
spin-off of the zelda franchise as a fan
of the dynasty warriors IP this is
pretty awesome news lastly our wildcard
story for the days from Apple pre-orders
have officially opened up for the new
Mac Pro with a starting price of just
two thousand nine hundred and
ninety-nine dollars if you really want
to feel like a baller you can max out
the specs and add a 4k monitor for just
around 20 grand of course the Mac Pro is
aimed at professionals and places like
recording and film studios so for them
it's total chump change but for mere
mortals like myself I guess I'll have to
hope for a winning lottery ticket that's
the Buffalo bulletin for today if you
enjoyed the show give us a thumbs up
that would be super awesome of you and
