customize the home screen for whatever
you want if you're a sports fan you like
movies you need to get update from
social media you can have that right at
your home screen I'm a simple man I like
to stock Android look it's usually how I
set up my phones I'm using Nexus 6p for
a few weeks now so figured I'd show you
guys what is on my Nexus 6p it's a
pretty simple homescreen I like to know
the weather I like to know the news so
I've got the Google News and weather
widget featured front and center I've
got it set up but I still have two rows
on the side for icons lets me change
what my profiles are going to be google
photos all my chat options are right on
the home screen some direct dials for my
family my wife all of my social media
stuff I keep right there and then I've
got a YouTube monitoring folder YouTube
studio lets me see what the stats are in
real time send a YouTube app and YouTube
kids when I need to keep my son
entertained for just a few minutes then
at the bottom everything we've talked
about in previous Android videos cloud
magic is what's being used right there
and then just the messaging app I try to
condense everything - to home screen so
I'll go ahead and swipe over I used to
have the ESPN widget on my home screen
but I moved to the side keep up to date
on all of my teams I've got a horrible
sense of direction so I've got a Google
Maps driving widget right there so I can
go ahead and figure out how to get home
a lot of our audience people that I work
with you Celsius and like to know what
the weather is in celcius so I've got
the amber weather widget right there
converted to Celsius this is about a
widget reborns like you know a battery I
have sort of big and bright in my face
you know I've got it up there and also
got it in the right-hand corner but just
see it very quickly and then my calendar
just a standard Google Calendar so
that's why I have my homescreen set up
the quick look at some of the apps that
I've got them and are not familiar with
easy screen record I'm using to record
the screen here there's battery widget
reborn sports I use bleacher report and
ESPN everything else I've kind of
covered as I've gone through Fandango
for movies iPhone ringtones
I use a particular iPhone ringtone that
I like I don't always want to use an
iPhone so I sort of get to have that on
Android everything else like I said I'm
not very app heavy just like sort of
keep things that I need to see
redfin like I always look at your house
my wife and I are looking to move at
some point or two kids at our house has
caved in on us
my wife drives the GMs we got the OnStar
app right there slack we used that for
group chat at the office a visual
voicemail I used you mail uber for for
getting a ride there is a TechnoBuffalo
app there it's not officially sanctioned
by us but it's pretty good
and of course speed tests but overall
this is a pretty simple layout I don't
want to get too much into icon packs
like to have the widgets and the icons
look as the developer and Google
intended usually when I'm not using an
exit device I try and sort of skin it
maybe with Nova launch or third-party
launcher I try and get as close to this
look as possible for me I could see
everything that I need I can start handy
for the business really with the swipe
of either one finger or just one or two
taps to hop into a folder so I showed
you mine it's time for you to show me
yours let me know what your favorite
home screen widget is what your favorite
app is share it down below and I'll
feature an upcoming video maybe we can
get the most ultimate home screen option
