go further hey whoa I gotta hand it to
him they have a little bit of a better
naming scheme with this one how's it
going guys am Aaron Baker from
TechnoBuffalo and this is the Polaroid
m7 it's a little bit better than the
10.1 inch tablet right down there with
it which I just looked at it was like
the q zy px4 10 may a creative name like
this the m7 also known as the code name
for the HTC m7 so don't get that mixed
up this is a tablet and they're calling
it a mobile internet tablet with a
7-inch displaced expect wise we're
looking at a 7-inch display Android 4.1
here you got google now capabilities
google now integration and you got one
gigabyte of ram a 1280 x 800 pixels
screen 2-megapixel front-facing camera 8
gigabytes of internal memory and free
stock a look and feel here when it comes
to the build quality apps and widgets as
you would expect from the android 7
inches though makes it more pocketable
tweeting on how big your coat pockets
are and makes it a little bit easier to
hold in the hand as well so you've got
that MSRP here we're looking at 129 so
you know as with CES is in the past this
is kind of the year of cheap tablets so
keep that in mind cheap tablets here are
all the rage 1.6 gigahertz dual-core cpu
android 4.1 on this device like i said
your connectivity you've got Wi-Fi and
bluetooth and you got a rechargeable
battery although it doesn't show what
the actual specs of the battery are but
you can see here kind of a nice little
mini setup i don't know how much of this
is the actual configuration that they're
showing off at CES and how much of this
is software that's actually on the
retail device but it's a so it's really
nice to have these shortcuts with power
settings Wi-Fi setup online help
download app stores I like being able to
go into the settings just by clicking
that I think this is going to be one of
those great devices for somebody maybe
that's first time tablet user first time
owner and they want something that's
easy to use as they grow with your hand
droid tablet I can see a perfect use
case for somebody in the 50 60 70 s that
aren't familiar with tablets they want
that first tablet to get used to it this
could be a nice jump into the android
tablet world for them so keep it
launched on technobuffalo for CES 2013
