to you by go daddy so up this week
celebrities aren't the only ones that
get leaked pictures looks like the
iPhones following this Kim Kardashian
around we might finally know what the
iPhone 6 looks like it looks like
Google's ready to kick the existing
Nyx's camera app to the curb and is
gonna update the native camera app for
Android this rumor roundup let's start
just round them up in my rumored X you
seen plenty of concept design for the
upcoming iPhone 6 and even a few alleged
leaked photos earlier this week we might
have gotten our first look at the actual
thing in the flesh or sort of the flesh
three new pictures reportedly taken at
Foxconn facilities and shared via Chino
Weibo I pronounced that correctly reveal
what appears to be the back of a
partially assembled iPhone 6
unfortunately the photos actually show a
picture of the alleged iPhone 6
displayed in a computer monitor rather
than the real thing it looks as though
the next iPhone could potentially
feature slightly rounded edges and a
protruding camera similar the current
iPod Touch and very similar to the HTC
one looks like it could be thinner than
the iPhone 5s certainly you'd expect and
finally it looks like Apple is going to
keep the headphone jack on the bottom of
the device next to the lighting ports
should these pictures prove to be the
real deal
we're just think rumours no clicking
iPhone 6 is going to come in this many
screen sizes with Apple offering a 4.7
inch and fingers crossed please do it
5.5 inch option so based on a recent
report from sunny Dixon the iPhone 6
will allegedly also come equipped with
an ultra Retina display at 389 PPI 2.86
gigahertz a processor iOS 8 and sensors
galore for activity tracking and sadness
tracking Reuters routers roof
roto-rooter's said it's intruders I know
don't yell at me in the comments said
that does learn that Apple supply
partners would begin building a 4.7 inch
display up from the four inches on the
iphone 5 and iphone 5s starting in May
so Reuters reports do line up with
several rumors suggesting Apple is
working on this many new devices with
varying screen sizes and it built in
those reports by identifying who Apple
select
to actually provide the parts the new
source said LG sharp and Japan displays
are still on board to build the screens
although it didn't really distinguish if
all three would build both sizes LG and
sharp are expected to begin production
in June with sharp starting next month
notice new Samsung mentioned in there at
all probably not a coincidence
considering those lawsuits going on like
crazy
Reuters also said the 5.5 inch screen
may face the legs because of the in cell
technology it's used on the iPhone
screens and that sure difficulty is
moving up to that size and if history
taught us anything it's usually that we
start to see iPhone parts linked once
the device entered production which
means we might start seeing some parts
suppliers spilling the beans as soon as
next month the increased production this
summer suggested Apple is indeed on
schedule to reveal its brand new shining
device in September of this year moral
is if you're looking to get a new phone
and they can maybe pick up an iPhone you
should probably at the point the area
should probably wait and I'm talking to
our camera guy Ron you just picked up an
iPhone 5s to spite us telling them to
wait don't be Ron you should probably
wait we're friends you be honest with
each other
let's have rational discussions and say
that Google's native camera app on
Android it's probably one of the weaker
points of a pretty awesome OS most phone
makers for example make their own tweaks
to the user interface and as of recently
we've even seen manufacturers like HTC
add additional hardware to improve the
camera experience Google's apparently
super aware that people are always
stopping camera apps thanks and
according to Engadget the company is
working on a major update non gadget
Google is working on the update they are
apparently going to allow developers to
create third-party filters for the
camera so that users can change the
effects right from the app itself
without having open a silly third-party
solution also among the features in the
update is a 1/2 percent to know crop of
view finder and I think gadgets said
will allow you to see the entire shot on
your screen as you're taking it which is
super nice nokey HTC and Sony have
recently introduced software HTC's case
hardware and software that allows you to
blur certain parts of the photo and add
DSLR bouquet effects so Google is
apparently working on an Allen's put a
filter that will create the same kind of
effect on all Android 4.4 point what
have you devices presumably only using
software the good news apparently Google
isn't going to wait until Android 4.4.3
or any
you're opting to get this out - which
peeps instead the girliest an update
inside of Google Play separately so that
everyone can enjoy the goodness at the
same time and so that any users don't
have to wait more importantly though not
to complain and I have to say carriers
what the heck
so get it didn't say that it's gonna be
available but I'm saying soon
you can just say John Rhett enger' said
soon go to your carrier like listen
