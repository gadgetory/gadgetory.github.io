from technobuffalo here at the gadget
event don't call it Gidget it's called
gadget and told the gadget live event in
San Francisco is my first time out to
one of these things and it's a good time
i got i was lucky impressed like i did
before the crowd came in they're coming
in now
all kinds of people showing up on a
Friday night to check out the latest and
greatest in the world of gadgets
including the latest from HTC I'm here
with Eric formation see this is the
sensation which is confirmed becoming
the t-mobile USA not yet sure when not
what yet sure how much across but it has
a new wrong and a cool live wallpaper so
let's take a look right so I you know I
h1 of HTC's like main principles is
reducing the number of clicks it takes
for people to get to their information
so now we've reduced the number of
clicks to zeros so you get stuff right
on the lock screen right before you even
unlock your phone you can you can see
right now this is our Facebook updates
that that would normally be in our
friend stream speed that we can just go
through so we've got the half ring down
there we're still locked right exactly
exactly see murmur and now we're
unlocked and and as you can see we have
a lot of 3d effects on this home screen
right so you can see things go around
corners or we can really get it going
and play with the carousel but the other
thing that we can do from the lock
screen is we can also jump right into
applications now so we have for
shortcuts and you can set what for
applications those jump to but if I use
my camera a lot I don't even have to
bother to like unlock my phone and tap
the icon anymore now I can so that
that's pretty much the soul like doing
stuff from the lock screen it's pretty
much a straight rip off about
oh yeah totally right I'm sure you can
watch the camera from the lock screen on
an iphone case yeah right yeah yeah yeah
yeah are they back to reality are those
user customizable yes I can put my own
yeah all four of those are used to
customizable so you can choose which for
shortcuts you want but that's you so we
launched right into the camera from the
lock screen and the camera lunch pretty
quickly too did another thing that I've
been telling people you know everybody
knows about the HTC widgets and about
how we're always trying to get people
the most the most amount of utility
without actually having to go into any
applications right right reduce again
reduce the number of steps it takes to
get anything done but one of the things
I've been really happy with because I
use this phone as my daily driver is
being able to go into the mail now and
if we go into a mail message you see
that now they're short cuts along the
bottom for all of the most commonly used
functions so I don't even have to hit
that menu key anymore right so reply
forward move delete all of that is right
there for me to do with a single click
right graduate right so and and for
those just to step back a second for
those who aren't initiated with the
sensation where the key features is a
setback well I think it's pretty easy to
see from from here that it's kind of
pretty amazing screen right so this is a
4.3 inch qhd screen
so qhd is it's one quarter of a 1080p
screen right so 960 x 540 so you got a
lot more pixels on the screen then you
do if mu did with that those wvga
friends right 800 x 480 in the WC and
now we're bumping it up and I'm right
right exactly so you know it's over 100
pixels and in both directions the the
other thing is you can see that it's a
lot narrower I'm embarrassed to say I
don't have very large hands and your
hands were fine man all right the the 16
by 9 aspect ratio means that the screens
narrower so it fits enhance a lot better
and right that's that's really nice we
have a great 8 megapixel camera on the
back about which you saw booted up
instantly right and it does a lot better
job in shooting in challenging light
conditions or if and I think you've seen
in the past and we had a little more
processor like behind all of this right
so so this is a dual-core snapdragon
correct correct the ad to 60s to step
back one notch there's it looks like a
front-facing camera as well front facing
camera yes and people like me like to
you know frame themselves and go to oh
they're here so a is hi guys how's it
going what's up I'm bald and he's got a
shape that
very cool alright so the HTC Sensation
we don't know when we don't know how
much but it is coming to the US on
t-mobile's right that's been talked
about exactly live from the gadget event
let's get their logo in there because
they're our gracious hosts with all the
new lockscreen goodness that floating
background all my facebook contents they
have text they have photos they're like
wafers in the air much much more over on
technobuffalo calm and our twitter feed
