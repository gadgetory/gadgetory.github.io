I want to show you a chart of a company
called zag because they're currently
down by over twenty percent sitting at
seven thirty four they used to make
protective covers for the ipad but of
course the the new one thats just come
out or just being unveiled the ipad 2
has self-cleaning covers so i guess the
theory is here it's not going to be very
good business for zag we're joining us
via skype as he's been live blogging the
apple event all day is noah Kravitz
editor-at-large for TechnoBuffalo and
noah before the presentation you sent
your wish list for the ipad 2 to me and
i'd like to know how many of your wish
list criteria did you manage to check
off well um expected list you know did
pretty well wish list um i don't want to
start rumors or anything but i think
we're gonna see another ipad unveiled
before the end of the year that'll hit
the wish list one ipad 3 why why would
they move so quickly with that proto
cycle to an ipad 3 when they just don't
got in the ipad 2 today i think there
are two reasons I think one is there's a
theory i like that apple has for the
past several years use an event in
September to launch their new ipods for
the Christmas season I think the
popularity of the ipod line is
diminished a little as iphones now ipad
have those media capabilities so i think
there's a good chance we'll see ipad
take up the the sort of halo product for
the Christmas season in Apple's lineup
to be unveiled at the September event
and then the other reason is competition
and and networks we just saw I've got
the motorola xoom right here which just
hit the streets this is a verizon
android powered tablet that will be
upgradeable to 4g very soon no mention
of 4g in the ipad announcement today and
while apple likes to wait to see if
these new technologies you know what
they want to wait for them to get up to
speed before they launch them I don't
think Apple can afford I don't think
they want to wait until a year from now
to launch a 4g ipad so i think we'll see
that yeah how much of a threat is
android
I mean it's a threat it's obviously you
know there's been a lot of progress a
lot of consumer adoption you've got you
know on the one hand Apple does it all
hardware software sales marketing the
whole thing their profit margins are
very high on the other hand they only
have you know one maybe two devices on
each product line whereas android google
makes the software and then everybody
from samsung to HTC to a sous to you
name it makes the products so I'm it
it's not just for you know it's a
serious threat to apple and what we
often see is when a competition heats up
the prices go down great for consumers
not necessarily good for the business do
you think there's any possibility that
Apple might start cutting the price if
it's either original iPad or maybe they
need in the ipad 2 leading up to ipad 3
just before going on air I got a message
that the original ipad is now a hundred
dollars off at least the base model has
been dropped from 499 to 399 so I think
that's how Apple likes to do it is they
try to keep their price point steady but
roll you know more capacity more
features into them and then I've always
said the best time to buy it up product
is to pick up last generation just when
the new one hits the streets so lately
that's the way to do it that's a way
we're all gonna do it stocking stuffers
thank you very much Noah I play</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
