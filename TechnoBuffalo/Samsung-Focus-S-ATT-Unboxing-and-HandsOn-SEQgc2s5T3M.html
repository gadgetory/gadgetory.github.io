thanksgiving is over Christmas isn't
here yet what about Hanukkah Kwanzaa and
Boxing Day I'm Noah from TechnoBuffalo
and this is the samsung focus s
all right it's the focus s from Samsung
and AT&amp;amp;T the first 4g Windows Phone
device in 80's lineup except that LTE is
coming RT here in parts of the country
so really when is 4G not 4G 4G is not 4g
when it's not 4g LTE because there's
already 4G LTE even though this says 4G
are you confused yet so my but that's
how fast marketing speak goes the focus
asks from Samsung and ATT thanks to the
folks at Samsung for sending us this one
to review on loan otherwise known as the
i 937 this is selling right now for 9999
on contract a new two-year contract from
a teensy although it's been seen for as
little as absolutely nothing around the
web during the madness that is known as
Black Friday Cyber Monday cyber week
even just saying lately I've seen it for
free online but I'd 9999 the official
price from AT&amp;amp;T which it in just
underneath the ginormous HTC Titan who
there i am the in the velocity
reflection what's up slots it in just
underneath the HTC Titan which is the
most expensive not to mention the
largest displayed Windows Phone 7 device
in AT&amp;amp;T is line up the 4.7 inch display
on the HTC 4.3 inches on the focus s
whoever would have thought that a 4.3
inch display phone would seem small but
I mean seriously look at it next to the
Titan Titan is ginormous anyway we're
not talking about the Titan we're
talking about the focus s and here it is
windows phone 7.5 it's got that for
plain 4.3 inch display that I mentioned
it's a super amoled plus capacitive
touchscreen 800 x 480 480 x 800 480 x
800 wvga because that's what Windows
Phone 7 maxes out at right now it is a
thin light phone 8 and a half
millimeters thin a little bit thinner
than the tight and I just showed you
which is nine point nine millimeters and
it is available now on this device take
a little tour around on the front you
got the capacitive touchscreen the three
windows phone buttons back windows
search
on the top you've got a front facing
camera this one collects in 1.3
megapixels on the back 8 megapixel main
camera with flash and capable of 720p HD
video and also you've got this sticker
not anymore a little bit of a wiki wiki
back panel there the texture also on the
back you've got little speaker grill on
the Rights fine you've got your power
lock switch and then also your dedicated
camera button on the bottom you've got
the micro USB port and the microphone on
the other side you've got a rocker
switch for volume and other sundry
things what doesn't make sense on the
top you've got your three nine
millimeter audio jack and then you
little sticker that says Qualcomm hspa+
again its 4G HSPA+ it's not 4g LTE just
getting more and more confusing all the
time I said that already sorry and there
you go the phone itself windows phone
7.5 you've got a Qualcomm processor in
the device it's a 1.4 gigahertz
processor on otherwise you know windows
phone is pretty much windows phone a
couple of ATT extras bloatware if you
will you've got your u-verse mobile and
your navigator your 18 to radio daily
briefing is a samsung app 18th you
family map my wireless u-verse mobile we
showed you that was pinned to the start
page yellowpages mobile otherwise not
too much that's different from your
standard Windows Phone install I've been
using the Titan for several days now I
got that before i got the focus s and
I've just really been enjoying it i just
i'm a big fan of windows in right now
there's some things still that it can't
do some apps that aren't available yet
you know depending on your specific
needs maybe the apps are available maybe
they're not for me spotify is available
there's not an official sonos controller
so you know that's kind of my big thing
right now because I have a sonos at home
and I use a cell phone
or an iPad to control it but you know a
lot that it can do i'm really enjoying
the messaging really enjoying the People
app I like the way social media is
integrated into the phone the xbox live
show is kind of neat i'm not a big
enough gamer to really know if it's a
lamb or awesome let's take a look at now
because that's a proprietary thing so
Sam saying you see the copyright at the
bottom it's a samsung app I've got to
get Wi-Fi go on there's no sim card in
this and so if you've never used windows
phone before you should definitely go
back check out some of the other videos
and posts we've done on the recent
windows phone 7.5 devices code named
mango let's go to add a city we're going
to add Oakland California all right
its pleasant 60 clouds of the Sun the
news is not been updated so it's kind of
like Samsung's daily briefing on the
TouchWiz phones stocks weather news top
tweets there you go but if you've never
used Windows Phone you know it's this
whole live tile system where you've got
these tiles pinned to the home page or
the start page if you will Internet
Explorer not the best mobile browser but
it works okay one's got an accelerometer
so you can use in widescreen mode and
the keyboard really nice the windows
phone keyboard so go to TechnoBuffalo
calm you've got the mobile version
loading up right now
pinch and zoom all that stuff from you
know for my money the the web browsers
are not quite as smooth as the one on
the iphone but but it's pretty nice I
preferred a little bit over android
myself you've got multitasking you hold
down the back button and then you can go
through your recent applications we can
go back to the weather or to the now app
there you've got the search key which
links into bing and has voice
activations you can do voice you know
hit the search button and voice search
allow search voice except I want some
Thai food and so there's web here's
local no local results for I want some
Thai food but can we go Thai food what
happened our maybe it's not so good
Thai food there we go local Thai food
yeah there we go it's voice the boy
that's good stuff if you like fish sauce
then you can also hold down the windows
phone button find Thai food in
Indianapolis oh I have to hit speak
first half fine thai food in
Indianapolis right so you know tell me
Siri I don't know it just doesn't matter
it's got voice control so that's cool ah
jasmine thai Indianapolis Indiana there
you go we can go back suit again open
calendar that's great good right oh
nothing on my calendar switch camera
mode there I like the way the the
animation zoom in and out anyway this is
supposed to be an unboxing got a full
review of windows phone 7.5 but like I
said I've been having a little
Renaissance with it having received the
Titan the unlock titan on now having the
focus s a little bit smaller a little
bit lighter you know it's typical
Samsung vs HTC the Samsung kind of the
plastic build but very very lightweight
the HTC kind of that heavier duty
aluminum construction but you know I'm
psyched to be playing with Windows Phone
7.5 I only wish that I had access to
u-verse where I live to try that out and
I'm psyched for CES because I hear tell
there's going to be some interesting
windows phone related announcements
coming up at CES in just over a month
but for the meantime it's not even
Boxing Day yet so let's slow down it's
the it's the samsung focus s from 18 see
a Windows Phone device again 9999
contract with two year contract
officially through AT&amp;amp;T although I've
seen it at for as little as absolutely
nothing free on contract during these
crazy pre and post thanksgiving sales
online so if you're interested in this
phone and check it out we'll be back
we'll have us some comparisons jon did
an unboxing of the titan already will do
a review of this one in some comparisons
that kind of stuff but so far dig in the
phone
which really is a reflection of the
operating system more than anything but
I like a lightweight wait this is thanks
again to the folks at Samsung natt for
lending us this device much much more on
all the new windows phone devices all
the new devices over on technobuffalo
