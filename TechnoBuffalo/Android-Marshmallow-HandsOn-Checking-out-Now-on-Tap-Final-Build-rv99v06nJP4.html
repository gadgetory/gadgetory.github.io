to you by domain.com hey what's going on
guys a märklin sangun from
TechnoBuffalo and today we'll be taking
a look at android 6.0 marshmallow on the
Nexus 6 Google's latest mobile update
began rolling out to nexus users Monday
morning including the Nexus 5 Nexus 6
nexus 7 2013 edition and Nexus 9 if you
haven't received the OTA update yet we
actually made a separate video detailing
how to manually flash android 6.0 l 0 on
your Nexus device so what's new in
Android 6.0 marshmallow probably the
biggest change in this version is now on
tap it's essentially an assistant that
listens in on your activities and gives
you the supplemental information to help
you get more done for example if someone
texts you or emails you about seeing the
Martian now on tap will provide links to
information about the movie shortcuts to
relevant apps and even make a calendar
entry if a date and time are mentioned
if you don't know anything about the
Martian you can simply ask Google now
who directed the movie and it'll be able
to pull up information about the
director of the Martian compared to
what's been added to Android in the past
now on tap is easily one of the cooler
features we've seen not only is it
really fun to play around with but it
makes Android even smarter making it
easier to find information without
leaving the app you're in Android
marshmallow also includes native
fingerprint support and marshmallow your
fingerprint will be able to do things
like unlock your device authorize
payments using Android pay and in the
google play store as well as signing in
to third-party apps another big change
in android 6.0 as those which is
marshmallows newest power saving feature
with those android recognizes when your
device is idle and will automatically
put your phone into a deep sleep state
to conserve power according to google
the screen off time of devices running
marshmallow lasted thirty percent longer
on average so even if you forget to plug
in your phone before bed your phone's
alarm clock will still ring there's also
app standby which essentially puts your
less frequent use apps into a reduced
activity states you conserve battery for
the apps you use more frequently last
but not least android marshmallow will
now give you the ability to customize
and control which permissions you give
apps for example i can revoke access to
my microphone inside instagram but i can
still use the app normally in the next
few weeks and months developers will
start updating their apps to support
this feature which means apps that are
designed for android marshmallow will
only ask for a permission at the time
it's needed in terms of the overall you
I not much is really changer with the
exception
the app drawer which now scrolls
vertically whereas before you'd need to
scroll horizontally in order to see your
different apps there's also somewhat
newish easter egg with android
marshmallow now I say newish because
it's essentially the same minigame we
saw last year with Android lollipop
which is kind of disappointing but this
time around you need to save your
Android buddy and pass through the cute
marshmallow that is probably gonna eat
