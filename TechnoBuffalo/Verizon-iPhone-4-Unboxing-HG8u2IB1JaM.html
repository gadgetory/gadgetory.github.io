from techno buffoon here is an unboxing
that has been many years in the making
all the way back from 2007 this is the
iPhone for Verizon Wireless let's go
ahead dig in and see if your patience
has paid off so when you look at this
box it's just an iPhone box it looks
exactly the same as the one we saw on
AT&amp;amp;T about six months ago same size same
dimensions absolutely everything is the
same break down to the 3G picture on the
front so this was opened in the store it
has to be activated in the Verizon store
that's how you order it otherwise you
can activate it at home
so unfortunately plastic has been taken
off but the box looks identical
everywhere except on the back where he
now says Verizon this is a 16 gigabyte
model you can get it in at 16 or 32 for
199 or $2.99 and those are same prices
as well on AT&amp;amp;T so take it off and it
should be a very familiar unboxing
experience so here we've got officially
the iPhone 4 from Verizon we'll take a
look at that in just in one second what
other stuff we're going to get in the
box is probably going to be expected
although I would not expect a sim
removal tool here because there's no SIM
card all right designed by Apple in
California fingertips and fear dips and
some stickers and they give you finger
tips for using stickers and then exactly
what you'd expect from an iPhone you've
got your wall charger sync cord and pair
of microphone headphones you haven't
seen the microphone headphones
does they look like there's a little
microphone down there and you can talk
out of them it's actually not happy
alright so enough of that jibber jabber
let's take a look here at the iPhone 4
for Verizon I'll go ahead and pop it on
it looks very similar from obviously
previous generation iPhone fours or the
one that's available for AT&amp;amp;T with a few
differences and most notably on the
right hand side
no it's SIM card slot if you look at the
iPhone 4 for 8
Chii notice that there is a micro SIM
tray right there and while we've got
both of these up here let's see if you
can tell where these antennae band if of
desire because the antenna bands are
actually redesigned for the Verizon
iPhone here on the left there's no
crease right here on AT&amp;amp;T verdant but
the crease is there on the Verizon
version moving on down this is where all
that antenna gate issue happened because
of that guy right there and now we've
got it redesigned on the other side for
the Verizon iPhone also you can see that
the mute rockers and the profile Swift
rather are down just a little bit so I
will run the Verizon iPhone through the
death grip test and see if it does
indeed have a death grip and of course
I'll be comparing the two phones the
test network tests everything else but
for all intensive purposes this is very
much just an iPhone and see you're right
there fills you have been waiting
