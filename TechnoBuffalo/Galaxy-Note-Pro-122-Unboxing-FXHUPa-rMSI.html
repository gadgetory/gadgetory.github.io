TechnoBuffalo at that unboxing of the
brand new Samsung Galaxy Note pro this
guy was announced at CES 2014 just a few
months ago and we've got it now and I'm
very excited hands to go ahead and open
it up and see if it should be your next
tablet so the box we have here I'm
presuming is not retail packaging it's
sent to us from Samsung's PR so it's
probably just PR type box go ahead and
lift it up and see if they're shoes
inside there's not we've got the Galaxy
Note pro sitting here or ready to be
unsheath in this giant box and probably
have some other things looks like we've
got fancy case for it so if you want to
protect your almost $800 so investment
you can do so and it looks like we also
have some screen protectors in here a
mouse not something you see with tablets
everyday and some batteries for said
Mouse and adapters and such and I'm
guessing we also have a keyboard in here
as well if you want to use this as a
server hybrid laptop tablet Zumba you
can do so so full keyboard alright
so push all that stuff off to the side
I'll check out how all this stuff works
when we do the full review alright so
here is the box for the Samsung Galaxy
Note pro this is probably gonna be the
retail packaging showing all the specs
inside and there's a lot of stuff in
here including that octa-core processor
which is 2 quad core things so pretty
fast so this is the note Pro let's go
ahead and dig on in try to open this
anything seems a little more appropriate
and boom there is the Galaxy Note pro go
ahead and pull that out feels really
solid very well-constructed vise what
else do we have inside we've got a
pretty thick booklet got your Samsung
wall work we've got less comes before
the
stylus I suppose those are extra stylus
tips and we've got a USB 3.0 2 USB
connection here is the tablet crazy
specs on this guy
looking at a 12 point 2 inch screen the
resolution of 2560 by 1600 giving it 247
PPI Android 4.4 at launch they mentioned
the Dinos 5ch it powering this guy so
that's a one-point now gigahertz
quad-core chip and that's not enough it
also has a 1.3 gigahertz quad-core chip
in there so yeah three gigabytes of
internal ram 32 or 64 gig configurations
not sure what you want to have here but
I'll wager we got 232 oh you can also
put an SD card in there up to 64 you've
got 8 megapixel camera on the back and
80 megapixel sensor living somewhere on
the front right there 802 11 ABG and an
AC bluetooth 4.0 and a beastly 9,500
milliamp hour battery but strangely
enough no NFC here let's go ahead and
pull off all the stuff powered on and
take a quick tour of the device oh that
was a satisfying whooshing noise I've
got that faux leather back that we saw
on the Galaxy Note oh this one sort of
has more of a texture feel to it off
soft touch I think it feels actually a
little bit better than the Galaxy Note
so typical Android controls here you got
your multitasking button your home
button and your back but also I presume
I could probably be a menu button as
well when contextually necessary goes
ahead boots up left hand side you've got
speaker grille 3.5 millimeter headset
jack on the right hand side there's your
USB 3.0 port if you don't have a USB 3.0
port the right side of it you can use
micro USB I don't that's going to work
to charge it but for other USB 3.0
devices you can do that speaker grille
right there that's where your micro SD
card is going to live we don't have a
cellular version this is just just Wi-Fi
what screen to unlock on the top of the
vice think you got
appears to be an IR port right there
volume up and down and power and lock
and then we've got the stylus living on
the side push that or right back in so
let's take a look at we've got here so
very nice 12 inch
tablet I know it sounds big and it feels
kind of picking the hand but using it
looked really really nice and this is
the size of the in most laptop screens
look at the 11 inch MacBook Air you got
a bigger screen here than that so I like
the way Samsung they layout here you've
got the aperture all the way off to the
right and the Google search all the way
down the bottom left not taking up any
of the valuable screen real estate for
widgets or other applications I really
like they did deck I always put Google
search somewhere on my screen it's
really nice to have that there and
access to you know Google now and of
course the Google search for voice is
really really good I think we're gonna
have in here settings wise these are
just gigantic icons all the Samsung
stuff you usually have in here and cons
viewer all the rest sort of the good
news usually see like watch on Samsung's
video YouTube app is installed on here
in Netflix Immie ting there's a whole
folder of Samsung things Evernote in
Flipboard certainly not Samsung and s
voice which you can choose to use that
or not a lot of business stuff on here
as well I've got is this week I think
this is Ames is sort of a more prosumer
type market but it's really good for the
consumer side as well say me to be a
device that sort of borders the media
consumption of media creation devices we
saw with those peripherals for keyboard
and laptop so we'd be good for a college
student for example as well looks me a
really nice tablet i if you Samsung
device in the past you might have had a
different opinion on how they felt
quality wise this one feels really
really nice it feels really really
substantial on the screen is gorgeous on
this I'm excited to test it put some
widgets on it you know see it looks like
you can see Samsung's you know brand new
sort of magazine style interface here if
you choose to use it it is all here and
right for you and you guys anything you
want to see particular about the Note
pro 12.2 be sure to let me know of
course we'll compare its other smaller
size tablets and see how it's working we
called it and whatever format you do but
it's really very nice to use I'm I'm
really impressed with it but we'll see
if that holds true and I do the actual
review I'll please give video a thumbs
up if we appreciate it until next time
