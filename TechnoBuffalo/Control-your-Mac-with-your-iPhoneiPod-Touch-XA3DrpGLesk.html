TechnoBuffalo here I don't do that many
iphone app reduces but the ones that I
do I try and make sure they're really
useful a very fun of their game and this
is an application that I've been using
for the better part but we coulda found
it to be really helpful it's called a
remote tap and it lets you remotely
access your mat from anywhere over Wi-Fi
or 3G this will definitely work with an
ipod touch as well it's a 499
application that needs to buy from
apple's app store so go ahead and launch
it right here i'm going to cover some
information that shows up go ahead and
launch my desktop so right now it's
going to pull up my desktop do you have
got a Firefox window open it's a little
bit shrunk and hard to read so if I
rotate it I now have my full desktop and
I use multiple monitors you support that
so i can scroll over it i can see my
other monitor will focus on one for
right here and we'll look at this
Firefox window so you can zoom in using
the pinch and zoom functionality you're
probably familiar with now what if you
wanted to click on something that was
very small it was hard to see like that
little X if I hold my finger over it
actually pulls up a little zoom bar can
see a better sense of what you want to
do however I will tell you the tapping
menus it's actually pretty easy so I go
to Firefox I want to quit Firefox to be
pretty easy to type just tap it and it
actually increases the size as you
select the menus to make it really
finger friendly the application does a
really nice job about making everything
very finger friendly so the big question
I had was how am I going to use an
application like this especially a one
that supports OS 10 that's very heavy on
keyboard strokes whereas a built-in
keyboard on the iPhone this really have
a command shift control well this
application makes all that really useful
let me show you go ahead and pull that
up and launch is your typical iphone
keyboard but now let's all of the keys
that you might want to use with it so
shift control option command all of them
they're right there at your fingertips
so moving right along if you just want
to hit the keys pulls up the lush the
list of the four kind of most popular
shortcut keys if we keep moving along
this thing's pretty cool too it's sort
of you can see these circles show up and
this if you want to control your music
so let's say you're in the other room
and your computer is controlling a party
and not on Wi-Fi for whatever reason you
can't use apple's remote app this lets
you control absolutely everything go
ahead and pull it up you get your full
remote control button so you can control
where ever you want or if you're let's
say you're on the other side of the
world and someone at home is listening
to music you can just jump in and
correct with the listener into which is
kind of fun so we'll keep moving along
say what else we have here this shows
you what's open makes a lot easier to
manager applications so tells me what's
running what's in my doc all my
application that i have and i can go
ahead and pick one right here and I'm
dunnage go ahead hit done so if you want
to open something up it could be a
little bit hard to go into the dock and
zoom in and find the application that
you want whereas right here you can just
well just select it it's got another
button for for music also control spaces
too if you've got space is used on your
computer and lastly it'll control their
music as well it's a very useful
application I've been finding that when
I when I'm away I want to send a quick
email I've gotten very quick and used to
using it it works very very well your
computer of course needs to be on and
when you download the application from
the App Store promise you to go to a
website and download a little bit of
software that will put itself in your
system preferences on your Mac but it
really just works incredibly well it's a
fun application to use and it is pretty
sweet to see your whole desktop right on
your phone I should warn you though it
can be a bit choppy over 3g but it's
definitely useful one thing that you
can't do is play video I tried to go to
youtube for example and play a video on
here it becomes very choppy but if
you're going to want to use this sort of
a slingbox or mobile hulu player it's
not going to work that way unfortunately
it's going to be just for basic tasks or
things you want to send yourself or
files you want access to at least right
now it's not the best for eating
streaming video just wanted to give you
a heads up that was the first thing that
I wanted to see when I download this
application any guys hope you enjoyed
this is a quick demonstration of remote
tap for the iphone or ipod touch those
you that our pc users i'll be doing
another video showing you a great
application that does the same thing for
peace
II hope you guys enjoyed checking out a
