go further what's up everyone john
rented from TechnoBuffalo here live from
CES 2013 we are here at the latest from
HTC this is the one SV it's a 4G LTE
phone coming to cricket let's go ahead
and take a first look here is the one SV
in a bright red coming to Cricket
Wireless again to 4G LTE device so
you're looking at here is a 4.3 inch
Super LCD d2 that touchscreen with
Gorilla Glass 2 on it so if you get near
a gorilla it's not gonna scratch it but
also if you drop it won't be a problem
little mid-range specs for this guy it's
got a 5 megapixel autofocus camera on at
the back HD video recording as well this
is an F 2.0 the 28 millimeter wide angle
lens so I'm not too bad being powered by
a Snapdragon s4 dual-core 1.2 Krueger
chip it's running Android 4.0 and has
cents for on it eight gigs of internal
storage but you've got micro SD card
slot 1800 milliamp hour battery and
again it's a CDMA phone for cricket
Wi-Fi 802 11 a B G and n it's gonna
weigh just about four point three ounces
and it's got NFC built into it pretty
zippy phone dual core it's gonna last
you for you know for the next two years
but the phone does work pretty well
there's no sort of Android lag on it all
arranged sort of lag we are at pep comm
which is a show before CES actually
kicks off and connectivity here is
always sparse so unfortunately I can't
show you much of the net functionality
so go into about and we are running
Android 4.0 point 4 with sense version
4.1 on it so from a design standpoint
its typical one design you've got your
back button your home button and your
multitasking button on the right-hand
side got the volume rocker up and down
on the top 3.5 milimeter headset jack
power and lock button ambient noise
microphone on the bottom that's we are
going to charge via now standard
microUSB and ambient noise microphone as
well and then there is the camera on the
back and totally removable battery here
though
filming one-handed so we're not gonna
take that off take my word for it though
it is totally removable I'm John Reggie
from TechnoBuffalo the first look at the
HTC One SV for Cricket Wireless I'll see
you guys the next video thank you again
to Ford
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
