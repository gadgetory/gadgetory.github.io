to you by godaddy what's going on guys
the Marlins hanging from TechnoBuffalo
and today we'll be talking about the new
iphone and what we can expect from it
will be talking about hardware software
what's new and everything else so let's
jump right into the video probably the
biggest change coming to the iphone is
the larger screen size and it looks like
Apple is ready to offer two different
options one way the 4.7 inch display and
an even larger model with a 5.5 inch
screen the overall design with what
we've seen with the new iphone is very
reminiscent to the ipad mini and ipad
air with a redesign aluminum back
speaker and microphone grill and the
power button being moved to the right
side of the device from recent rumors
nikkei sources also claimed that the
white stripe seen in the back of the
iphone 6 dummy units are actually
placeholders for another material
possibly some sort of glass there have
been conflicting reports about when the
larger one might launch but most recent
rumor suggests both will be available at
the same time this fall the device won't
just differ in size however reports also
says Apple can be using sapphire glass
for the 5.5 inch model making it
incredibly strong in near and previous
everyday dangers such as drops the
screens meanwhile might feature slightly
curved display though not as newly as
drastic as the LG G flex or galaxy round
maybe something similar with those
rounded tempered glass you could
purchase online the touch ID is still
intact now that it's finally available
to developers with iOS 8 we could see
some new apps before when iOS 8 publicly
launches alongside the new iphone we may
also finally see NFC and other new
sensors built inside the iphone now
let's talk about megapixels the iPhone
5s is still rocking an 8 megapixels with
an improved sensor that introduced 720p
slow motion video the iphone 6 might
still use the same 8-megapixel but what
an even better sensor we're not quite
sure yet if Apple will jump on the 4k
bandwagon just yet that it's always
possible other reports are saying that
we could finally see optical or
electronic image stabilization the 5.5
inch iphone is rumored to have the OIS
while the 4.7 iphone is rumored to get
the e is now seen what the LG g3 can do
with its 0 is and I think it's setting
standards to mobile photography now
another hardware change that we may see
on iphone could possibly be the end of 3
in
a half millimeter headphone jacks there
are reports that are saying the Apple
may ditch the standard three-and-a-half
millimeter headphone jack in favor of
the Lightning port which means new ear
pod would lightning port connector
instead this can be used for data in
higher quality music playback let's take
a quick break from my iphone 6 video and

detail now with software we already know
about it iOS 8 it's coming too small
it'll feature the new health app with
the health kit and like I mentioned
earlier touch ID is now open to
developers there's also support for new
third-party keyboards camera controls
that will allow more advanced
third-party camera apps that let you
tweak more settings and probably more
surprises as usual and when it comes to
pricing Apple may finally sunset the 16
gigabyte iphone this year a recent
report suggests it's going to offer 32
gigabytes n 64 gigabytes capacities with
the 4.7 inch model while also offering
up 128 gigabyte version for the 5.5 inch
iPhone we don't expect a micro SD card
support since Apple has never done that
in the past the entry-level iphone 6
should be priced right in line with what
Apple has done in the past which means
it should come in at two hundred dollars
with a new two-year contract the larger
screen and if true edition of 0 is and
other features may contribute to a
higher price tag it is reported to cost
a hundred dollars more but that doesn't
seem out of the question since the
display is the most expensive component
a smartphone and as always we won't know
everything until Apple discusses at all
production is set to begin this month
and it is rumored to launch in September
19th a Friday but that can change
obviously between now and then so what
do you think we'll see with a new iphone
