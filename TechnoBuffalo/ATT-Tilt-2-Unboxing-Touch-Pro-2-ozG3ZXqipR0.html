unboxing for you of the 18 t tilt - this
is 18 T's variant of the touch pro2 the
spiritual successor to the about a year
and a half old 18 scenes hilt and the
actual successor to the HTC fuse that
AT&amp;amp;T I believe is currently selling this
will be available tomorrow October 18th
let's go ahead and open this thing up
and see what it looks like this will be
my first experience using windows mobile
6.5 hours Microsoft is calling it now
Windows Phone so curious if it increases
usability so we use of course the big ol
knife - I'll put this up let's see we
got inside and this will complement the
HTC pure that AT&amp;amp;T has in their lineup
this has a full QWERTY keyboard as
you'll see in a minute so here it is the
HTC tilts to picture the device on the
front with the curved obligatory circles
letting you know it's a world phone
obviously email GPS and it has a 3
megapixel camera on it as opposed to the
pure and the touch diamond2
actually have five megapixel cameras
this one got downgraded a bit but we'll
talk about all those specs in just a
minute some more information on it and
some more info on the back let's go over
that real quickly battery time eight and
a half hours standby time 20 hours 3.6
WVGA touchscreen with stylus so that of
course means it is a resistive
touchscreen 512 megabytes of ROM 2088 2
megabytes of SDRAM and a 528 megabit
were sorry megahertz processor and the
rest of the business let's go ahead and
open the sucker up see what looks like
so we've got the QuickStart guide on the
front telling you how to use Windows
Mobile and one particular use touchflo
3d which HTC the manufacturer of the
phone sort of puts the skin on top of it
and the skin is known as
preview they also make the sense UI for
the hero for example this story shows a
little bit about touchflo 3d and how to
use it here is the phone itself put that
off to the side for just a minute and
see what else did get in the box
alright
digging through we're getting some
TeleNav information your first 30 days
of GPS navigation for free I can tell
you that the GPS navigation that ett
offers at Allen app service is fantastic
it actually is really really good got
some CD information and it's like a
screw protector in the box and that was
nice we've got HTC's wall plug with the
us plug plugs right down on the bottom
which i assume is right here so just
slides on down we've got a 18 T's or
sorry HTC's proprietary mini USB to
mini-usb - there's a 3.5 millimeter jack
on there somewhere and there is a 3.5
millimeter 2.5 millimeter and another
mini USB port the HTC diamonds - and in
this case the tilts - actually uses a
proprietary mini USB port but it will
work with standard mini USB ports just
something to keep in mind but if you
want to use 3.5 millimeter jack you're
stuck with this dongle what itself
is a funny word dongle and then we've
got the USB cable to plug it into the
computer alright enough of the
accessories that's not why you're here
let's get to the phone itself so here we
have the tilts to take out of the bag
and it's only a little bit about on the
front tilt - uses touchflo 3d gestural
navigation to the ATT Quick Start Guide
honestly who is gonna look at the Quick
Start Guide so I'll peel off the card
from the front is always a very
satisfying thing to do see if we get
that plastic whooshing sound which we
did so now we've got this surprisingly
flushed resistive touch screen now if
you used a windows mobile phone in the
past odds are your touchscreen was not
flush it was sort of reef
this is a next-generation resistive
touchscreen it definitely has a little
bit of squish to it but not nearly as
bad as previous devices so let's go
around and see we have on advice on the
left side we've got a volume up and down
and we've got a soft button on the right
side there really isn't nothing there's
a microphone port and on the bottom
there of course is a stylus which is non
collapsible and non magnetic now the
back is really where some of this action
happens so what we have here is the 3.2
megapixel camera that's fine and we've
got this speakerphone button and this is
pretty unique to the touch pro2 an
agency's case the tilt to this whole
grill around here is a speaker and it's
got two microphones and two speakers for
actually noise reduction it's got a
really cool feature that if you're on a
phone call and something you want to put
it on speaker or start a conference call
it take the phone turn it down and it
certainly has an accelerometer so it'll
notice that it's been turned and
automatically kick the speaker on
supposed to be one of the best speaker
phones on a mobile handset so I'm really
curious to use it and this is right here
is not an LED flash it's actually a
button to turn off the speaker phone if
you like so I will say the back of the
device does have a very nice feel to it
that's sort of a glossy plastic and I
speaker grill in the middle does give it
a bit of a classy look let's power this
thing on and see what we've got
continuing the tour though on the front
of us we've got a few hardware buttons
we've got what I assume is a send key
which I probably glow green got an end
keyed on the right you've got a Windows
key and you've got a back key let's do a
quick size comparison a few other
devices odds are you guys are familiar
with of course your obligatory iphone
3gs comparison you look at them from
this angle they look to be pretty close
competitors you stack them on top
certainly the tilt to is a little bit
quicker a little bit fatter and a little
bit fatter for a very good reason it's
got a full QWERTY keyboard let's see how
that was sliding mechanism out is a
little bit stiff but it'll probably
loosen up as we continue to use it and
on first blush the keyboard does seem to
be quite usable Scott's a full 5 rows
so you've got four rows for your actual
keys and a full row of symbols which
should be quite useful the number keys
are sort of staggered all the way
through but not too bad if you want to
dial a number you can just use the touch
read and I have to rely on these but if
you are texting with numbers
you got the function and number key in
my for review I'll go over how that
keyboard works and how useful it is but
right now I will tell you it does feel
quite nice and it's called to be tilt
too because drumroll she tilts and it
tilts not that high up but does tilt
enough that if you're on an airplane or
watching a little bit of a movie or a TV
show you've got a much better viewing
angle than you would if it was just
sitting flat or even if you're typing
and texting you know it could be nice to
have that up and type in text and you'll
notice that when the screen comes up you
lose some thumb room behind for using
this top row of keys that's like
something to keep in mind it was up
suddenly these top row is right up where
your thumb is now the last sort of bit
of hardware I want to talk about for
turn on the device if you can't really
see it right here but there is a zoom
bar which will let you zoom in on
webpages and pictures and a few other
key things so that's sort of Windows
HTC's answer as opposed to the multi tap
method found on the iPhone or the zoom
buttons on the t-mobile g1 and speaking
of t-mobile g1 since that is also a
slide-out QWERTY device let's see how
that stacks up on a size comparison
so the g1 is known for a lot of things
definitely not known for being the
pretty girl on school it's definitely
the girl with a good personality so eat
till 2 then clearly best sit in the
looks department right here certainly in
screen size as well size was just about
the same so if you're able to fit a g1
in your pocket gonna notice not much of
a difference here with the tilts to
let's power it on and see what we have
I definitely stick around to the channel
I'll be doing a full comparisons on
Windows Phone and how it compares with
the iPhone how it stands on its own legs
this has Microsoft's new application
store in there so
curious to get in and download things
from the rap marketplace and see if it's
worthwhile and worth the weight and
worth the hype I've been on a record of
saying I'm not the biggest fan of
resistive touchscreens but supposedly
this has been tweaked quite highly so
you don't even notice that it's
resistive but so as I will be the judge
and you'll be the judge of me
so we'll say in a minute first boot up
here generally takes a little while I'm
gonna cut off the camera until something
happens
alright so we finally got some action
here you get a new Windows Mobile or
router start calling out Windows Phone
splash screen telling you to prepare
your device for first use it's going to
restart the home the screen is going to
actually install touchflo 3d while it's
on the device that actually installed
the first boot up should taste it
through the install process so that's
what it's going through right now looks
different than the 6.1 screen and 6.0
spring that we've seen before you've
seen other devices but you know an
orange screen doesn't quite make a phone
good guess the quality of the phone
itself in the OS will so let's see how
Microsoft implemented their new version
the operating system that whole process
I'd say took about five minutes and how
we get a looks like a setup guide so
import sim contacts I think there's
already a sim in there but since I don't
know what's on that we're going to not
import the sim contacts so I'll hit
cancel and here we are with touchflo 3d
surprisingly it didn't ask me to
calibrate the screen and let's see what
it looks like it's kind of on first
blush and we'll do a full walkthrough of
a touch both reading looks like there
are quite a bit of setups guides to go
through here so guys just a what I would
say would be a short unboxing turned out
to be quite a long one of the 18 T tilt
