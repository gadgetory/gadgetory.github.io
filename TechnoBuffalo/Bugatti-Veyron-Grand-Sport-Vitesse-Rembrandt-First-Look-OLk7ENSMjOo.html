John retinue from TechnoBuffalo here we
were at the 2014 Geneva Motor Show and
there are many times throughout the day
I feel outclassed right now though I
feel way out of my league exterior I'm
trying to remain all professional inside
I just want to scream we are taking a
look at the Veyron Grand Sport Vitesse
Rembrandt is a fourth model in a six
part series of the la l√©gende bugatti
or the legends of bugatti when a regular
Veyron is just too pedestrian this is
what you pick up the car is based on the
already incredible Veyron 16.4 Grand
Sport Vitesse three of these beauties
have ever been produced we've got the
privilege of standing really close to
one of them you know the smell of brand
new car the smell of brand new leather
it is just permeating up from this car
is actually just an incredible sight of
carbon fibre to behold
this is the crown jewel of the
Volkswagen Group's portfolio so aside
from being absolutely gorgeous to look
at what's underneath and I'm not gonna
say hood what's behind the passenger and
driver seats we were looking at 1,200
horsepower and 1106 foot-pounds of
torque
it's a 16 cylinder engine of quad
turbochargers and inner coolers and the
thing is an absolute beast when you're
driving a Bugatti you're obviously
draped in speed luxury and probably a
lot of stairs and GOx from other people
the interior of this car is just as
exquisite as the exterior you've got
only the best hides that go into the
interior we've got carbon fiber and
leather everywhere
if you hard-pressed to find anything on
this car remotely made of plastic I know
this makes me creepy but I kind of just
want to lick the car
so in the realm of cars that maybe one
day you can afford
maybe our reach this car sits high above
absolutely everything else the bugatti
name is synonymous with premium with
torque and with raw acceleration as i
sit here staring at the car think i'm
the presence of royalty thank you guys
for watching i hope you enjoy any
questions that you might want to know
about this absolutely extravagant piece
of engineering and art leave it down
below in the questions until next time I
have a John Ranger from TechnoBuffalo
I'll see you guys in the next video bye
