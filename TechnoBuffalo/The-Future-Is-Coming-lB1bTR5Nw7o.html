certain in life death and taxes
I wanted a third and that's C yes it is
coming up like right after the new year
the TechnoBuffalo crew is heading out to
the Consumer Electronics Show to bring
you the latest stuff from the world of
CG and I want to tell you the things
that I expect trends I expect to see and
what you guys can look forward to from
the show and then what kind of tech is
gonna be huge in 2017 first it's gonna
be all about cars ICS used to be about
mobile than Apple kind of started doing
their own press event and everybody else
want do their own press event so now
nothing new in the mobile world happens
at CES but car manufactures have filled
that void so we're gonna see a ton of
v's
a ton of self-driving prototypes and a
ton of connected cars gonna see every
major auto manufacturer should be there
touting whatever is next we saw a few
V's revealed last year we should see
about four to five including the
production car from Faraday futures I'm
super excited to see previous year's a
big trend has been wearables wearables
seem to not be a trend at all so I don't
think we're gonna see much in the way of
wearable technology but we'll see a lot
in the way of televisions and OLED TVs
an HDR and 4k and 8k and 12 K in 16 K
they're gonna continue to throw things
at us we're gonna see thinner thinner
thinner TVs that the bigger push towards
HDR content we saw LG unveil an
incredible glass on display TV from the
Signature Series I think we should see
this as a continuation of that Samsung's
OLED panels are absolute saying we
should just see better technology come
out this year and most importantly more
affordable Ola technology when I first
debuted a few years ago it was crazy
expensive even now to get the LG
signature 75 inch let's $20,000 I'd
expect the big announcements to be those
prices cut in half also I would not
expect every major manufacturers to jump
in on old was a huge opportunity for
other TV manufacturers if they continue
to push new LCD technologies at that
really lower and Jilla price point
wouldn't you Vizio this next one is not
like the sexiest trend but batteries and
external batteries particular external
batteries that have you
Vesey and thunderbolt are going to be
huge and on that vein I think
accessories USBC and Thunderbolt three
accessories are going to be a gigantic
we haven't seen that many docs for
thunderbolt three quite yet there's a
reason for that
everybody's whole done for CES so if
you've been waiting to pick up a MacBook
Pro or as a computer that uses the
Thunderbolt 3 USB C combi port you are
going to be in luck Prince ain't on of
those coming out at CES and my favorite
CES trend vaporware we're gonna see a
ton of stuff announcements never ever
gonna see the light of day last year we
saw a drone that could carry people
things like that are never gonna hit the
market at least in the near future but
it's fun to see what people think the
future might be and that's a lot of what
CES is about so the moral here it's
gonna be cards can be connectivity
autonomy it's going to be displays TVs
and accessories for us and BC CES has
lost a lot of the sex appeal I think
that had yes all right as in sexy people
in years past there's still a lot of
sort of tech gems if we have to go
looking something a little more than
you've had to in years past but if you
are looking for them you know it's
TechnoBuffalo are gonna have you covered
and with all that new technology coming
maybe you want to get a new TV and on
I'm due for a TV upgrade this year I'm
finally gonna make the 4k jump and if
you want to take your Discovery Channel
content with you you can do it with the
Discovery Go app and you should if you
want to take a look at or give a
download yourself link to it and pants</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
