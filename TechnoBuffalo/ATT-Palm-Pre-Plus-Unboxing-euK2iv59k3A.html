technobuffalo here that advice I'm
actually pretty excited about this is
the AT&amp;amp;T variant of the palm pre plus
we've seen the original pretty launched
on sprint about a year ago and the palm
pre plus comes verizon a few months back
so this is the 18-team version it's
going to run you 149 99 on a two-year
contract after rebates and it'll be
available in stores on May sixteenth if
you do purchase in stores for a limited
time you will get a free touchstone
charger which Palm traditionally sells
for around 60 bucks so nice value add so
enough of me yapping let's go ahead and
cut in some boss top of the tape is
already ribs pull that of course we use
the obligatory don't cut your fingers
off big ol knife so here is what you're
going to get if you purchase a palm pre
plus you're going to get the palm pre
itself as well as a touchstone charger
for a limited time if you go to a retail
location so I'll push the charger off to
the side let's take a look at the palm
pre plus box i looks very similar to the
other palm boxes that we see in the past
it's a very nice and boxing experience
although this time it is now emblazoned
with AT&amp;amp;T orange there's a picture of
device on the front photos you're not
familiar with the palm operating system
called webOS it's a multitasking
powerhouse uses something called the
deck of card features and I'll show you
the operating system in an upcoming
video but handles multitasking very well
it's got a capacitive multi-touch screen
which is two point six three inches the
resolution of 320 x 400 it's got 8
gigabytes of user storage it does have a
removable battery which is 1115 million
of hours so about five and a half hours
of 3g talktime and about 350 hours of
standby talk time does have a 2
megapixel a forced focus digital camera
with flash and it does have a camera and
obviously has a camera and a camcorder
a lot of other sort of pretty impressive
functionality it's got about a 600
megahertz processor and isn't par with
some of the hardware that's been
released recently although it's
certainly not a gigahertz chip as some
of the other devices that have come out
our so here is the box just pulled off
that sleeve device on the front back of
the device nothing on the top so this
looks like let's go ahead and open this
up there we go so here we have the palm
pre plus it looks very familiar those
you that have seen a pre plus on verizon
or another carrier oh I will say it does
feel like the sliding mechanism has been
improved it was one of the complaints
that I had with the verizon version I
felt a little weak this one actually has
a very nice spring-loaded field that's
going to push it off the cipher to
submit it and see what else comes in the
box so it sits in this hard plastic
shell got all of your must-read
materials here so you've got a quick
start guide there's a lot setting a
messaging Wi-Fi of course has assisted
gps it has as well texting and driving
it can wait obviously very important it
can certainly wait and here are your
accessories sitting underneath this nice
little piece of plastic you have of
course your USB charger which I believe
palm uses a micro USB for their devices
which is hiding right under that flap on
the side we'll take a look at the device
in a minute so very small charger which
is quite nice we've got pair of
headphones which appear to be the same
headphones that are shipped with
previous devices assuming a USB to
microUSB cable these things are quite
ubiquitous and a little bag carrying
case which is not leather but some sort
of microfiber used to clean the screen
or keep your device in there push that
back close the box and let's take a look
at the phone itself since this is the
main attraction so like I mentioned it
does have a 2.63 inch multi-touch
massive tree which is very nice it's
gesture areas right down here if you're
familiar with palm webos it loses the
original button that the initial pre had
and now it's sort of virtual you just
touch it and it recognizes the click so
on the left side of the device you've
got your volume rocker on the bottom
you've got your microphone port and
there's a battery release on the right
side you've got your charging port that
pulls right out you can do your charging
on the top you've got your profile
switch to go from lock or provide right
to ring in your 3.5 millimeter non
recessed headphone jack 2 megapixel
camera with your flash it also does your
camcorder niss and you've got your
speaker grill right there so let's take
a look at the touchstone one of the cool
things about the palm devices that they
can make use of wireless charging you
have to have to plug in the touchstone I
believe it's called conductive wireless
charging plug in a touchstone and your
device that's right on top of it so
let's unbox the touchstone as well you
may have seen this with the sprint
version when the touchstone came in and
the verizon versions as well but it is a
really nice sort of addition to have
certainly not a necessity it'll charge
fine just the regular wall plug but it
does make it a kind of fun so here is
the touchstone box go ahead and pull
that out and see it is relatively small
go ahead and pop off some plastic and it
uses its kind of cool a gecko feet
technology the same technology that gets
having their feet the bottom of this
uses to stick it doesn't feel sticky at
all but it'll stick to almost anywhere
which is kind of neat and I assume in
here we've got a cord so we take this
wrapped inside cord which is not in
actually so you must use the cord that
comes in the box the microUSB to USB
cord you plug it into the back right
there that goes into the wall and when
you want to charge your phone you just
plop it right on top and you will be
charging without any wires connected to
your phone at least which is pretty neat
so I've used webos on May
different devices and I've been a big
fan of it I'm curious to see how AT&amp;amp;T is
implementation comes through though I
expected will be a very similar
experience stay tuned to the channel for
a full battery of reviews I will be
covering operating system how it
performs against its competitors and a
few other tests that you request but as
if I usually do with my phone unboxings
let's do some size comparisons with
perhaps the pre plus is biggest
competitor here is it's AT&amp;amp;T stablemate
the iphone 3gs you can definitely see
that there is a size difference there
stack on top of each other you'll see
there's a size difference there as well
the pre plus has a full slide out
keyboard as of now there is not a
on-screen virtual keyboard you have to
rely on the smallish slider move that
off to the side here is it's all I
suppose cousin here's the pixi plus this
which also will become an 18-feet this
is a verizon variant so there's
certainly a thickness difference there
as well and here is the just-released
droid incredible for verizon wireless so
this is been an unboxing of the palm pre
plus for AT&amp;amp;T Wireless against stay
tuned to the channel on technobuffalo
com for all of your tech news i'm jon
rettinger and i will see you in the next
video bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
