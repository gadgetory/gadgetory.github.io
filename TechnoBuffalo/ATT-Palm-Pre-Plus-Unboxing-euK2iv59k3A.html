from TechnoBuffalo hear that advice I'm
actually pretty excited about this is
the AT&amp;amp;T variant of the Palm Pre Plus
we've seen the original pretty launched
on Sprint about a year ago and the Palm
Pre Plus comes Verizon a few months back
so this is the 18 team version it's
gonna run you a hundred and forty nine
ninety-nine on a two-year contract after
rebates and it'll be available in stores
on May 16th if you do purchase in
storage for a limited time you will get
a free touchstone charger which palm
traditionally sells for around 60 bucks
so a nice value add so enough of me yeah
Pat let's go ahead and cut into the boss
top of the tape is already ripped pull
that of course we use the obligatory
don't cut your fingers off a big ol
knife so here is what you're going to
get if you purchase a palm free plus
you're gonna get the Palm Pre itself as
well as a touchstone charger for a
limited time if you go to a retail
location so push the charger off to the
side let's take a look at the Palm Pre
Plus box looks very similar to the other
palm boxes that we see in the past it's
a very nice unboxing experience although
this time it is now emblazoned with AT&amp;amp;T
orange there's a picture of the device
on the front those you're not familiar
with the palm operating system called
webOS it's a multitasking powerhouse
uses something called the deck of card
features and I'll show you the operating
system in an upcoming video but handles
multitasking very well it's got a
capacitive multi-touch screen which is
2.63 inches the resolution of 320 by 480
gigabytes of user storage it does have a
removable battery which is 1,150
milliamp hours so about five and a half
hours of 3G talktime and about 350 hours
of standby talktime it does have a two
megapixel forced focus digital camera
with flash and it does have a camera and
obviously has a camera and a camcorder
a lot of other sort of pretty impressive
functionality it's got about a 600
megahertz processor and isn't par with
some of the hardware that's been
released recently although it's
certainly not a gigahertz chip as some
of the other devices that have come out
our so here is the box just pulled off
that sleeve device on the front back of
the device nothing on the top so this
looks like let's go ahead and open this
up there we go so here we have the Palm
Pre plus it looks very familiar those
you that have seen a pre plus on Verizon
or another carrier oh I will say it does
feel like the sliding mechanism has been
improved it was one of the complaints
that I had with the Verizon version I
felt a little weak this one actually has
a very nice spring-loaded field that's
good push it off this Eifert to submit
it and see what else comes in the box so
it's in this hard plastic shell all of
your must read materials here so you've
got a QuickStart guide there's a lot
setting a messaging Wi-Fi it of course
has assisted GPS it has as well texting
and driving it can wait obviously very
important it can certainly wait and here
are your accessories sitting underneath
this nice little piece of plastic you
have of course your USB charger which I
believe palm uses a micro USB for their
devices which is hiding right under that
flap on the side we'll take a look at
the device in a minute so very small
charger which is quite nice we've got
pair of headphones which appeared to be
the same headphones that are shipped
with previous devices assuming a USB to
micro USB cable these things aren't
quite ubiquitous and a little bag
carrying case which is not leather but
some sort of micro fiber needs to clean
the screen or keep your device in there
push that back close a box and let's
take a look at the phone itself since
this is the main attraction so like I
mentioned it does have a two point six
three inch multi-touch capacitive
which is very nice its gesture areas
right down here if you're familiar with
Palm webOS it loses the original button
that the initial pre had and now it's
sort of virtual you just touch it and it
recognizes the click so on the left side
of the device you've got your volume
rocker on the bottom you've got your
microphone port and there's a battery
release on the right side you've got
your charging port that pulls right out
and you can do your charging on the top
you've got your profile switch to go
from lock or provide rate to ringing
your 3.5 millimeter non recessed
headphone jack 2 megapixel camera with
your flash it also does your camcorder
NISS and you've got your speaker grill
right there so let's take a look at the
touchstone one of the cool things about
the palm devices is that they can make
use of wireless charging you actually
have to plug in the touchstone I believe
it's called conductive wireless charging
plug in a touchstone and your device
that's right on top of it so let's unbox
the touchstone as well you may have seen
this with the Sprint version when the
touchstone came in and the Verizon
versions as well but it is a really nice
sort of addition to have certainly not a
necessity it'll charge fine just the
regular wall plug but it does make it a
kind of fun so here is the touchstone
box go ahead and pull that out and see
it is relatively small go ahead and pop
off some plastic and it uses its kind of
cool gecko feet technology the same
technology that yeah it was having their
feet the bottom of this uses just a
stick it doesn't feel sticky at all but
it'll stick to almost anywhere which is
kind of neat and I assuming here we've
got a cord so if you take this wrapped
inside cord which is not an actually so
you must use the cord that comes in the
box the microUSB to USB cord you plug it
into the back right there that goes into
the wall and when you want to charge
your phone you just plop it right on top
and you will be charging without any
wires connected to your phone at least
which is pretty neat so I've used webOS
on many different
vices and I've been a big fan of it I'm
curious to see how 18th he's
implementation comes through though I
expect it will be a very similar
experience stay tuned to the channel for
a full battery of reviews I will be
covering operating system how it
performs guess it's competitors and a
few other tests that you request but as
if I usually do with my phone unboxings
let's do some size comparisons with
perhaps the pre pluses biggest
competitor here is its AT&amp;amp;T stablemate
the iPhone 3GS you can definitely see
that there is a size difference they're
stacked on top of each other you'll see
there's a size difference there as well
the pre plus has a full slide-out
keyboard as of now there is not a
on-screen virtual keyboard you have to
rely on the smallish slider move that
off to the side here is its I suppose
cousin here is the pixie Plus this which
also will become an 18 Phoebus is a
Verizon variant so there's certainly a
thickness difference there as well
and here is the just-released droid
incredible for Verizon Wireless so this
is been an unboxing of the Palm Pre Plus
for 18 t Wireless again stay tuned to
the channel on TechnoBuffalo comm for
all of your tech news I'm John Rhett
enger' and I will see you in the next
video buh-bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
