technobuffalo here and i am excited to
announce the winner of our iPad to give
away it's not this particular ipad 2 but
a brand-new one that hasn't been opened
or fondled by my greasy fingers could be
yours and in fact one lucky person it
will be we did this very simply if you
are in the u.s. you had the chance to
win a 16 gig brand new ipad to either
black or white sent right to your house
if you're outside of the US we are going
to send you the cash equivalents of a
u.s. bought ipad 2 so 500 bucks which is
quite surprising the amount of people
that complain about winning five hundred
dollars um which better than not winning
five hundred dollars to enter all you
had to do was it the tweet button on an
article on TechnoBuffalo calm during the
entry period retweet the article and use
the hashtag so you can figure out who
was winning winning pound ipad giveaway
TV i'm looking at some notes off the
screen and that was it all you had to do
to win you just couldn't enter more than
once and you had to follow a few rules
it was nice and simple you can tweet as
many articles on the page and that's it
so let me go ahead and announce the
winner I'm in a bit of a crazy mood so
look into my eyes or look into my crazy
eyebrows whichever you choose and I will
tell you the winner this is probably
closer to me than you guys ever wanted
to be the winner of the ipad 2 was
chosen on march twenty seconds and his
