technobuffalo here with an unboxing of
the unlocked windows 7 powered HTC
trophy let's go ahead and see if this is
worthy of a spot on your mantel alright
so the box enter a typical unlocked HTC
fashion is very familiar at the name of
the device on top and image on the front
which is actual size HTC branding
nothing on the left nothing on the right
other than letting you know it's windows
phone and some specs on the back which I
will run through as we go and take a
look at the phone itself so we'll bring
in senior stavo hopefully not senior
stabo off my finger cut plastic let's go
and take a look as device I've not seen
one of these I get in persons I don't a
lot of you guys we're waiting for this
to be avail to go ahead and slide it on
out here we go and here is the device
looks very similar in form factor minus
the speaker to the HTC surround taking a
look at before let me go ahead and run
through some of the specs with you guys
and see what this guy is going to do for
you alright so it has a 3.8 inch wvga
screen with a resolution of 480 x 800
it's got eight gigs of internal storage
512 of ROM 576 of RAM it's got the HTC
hub which I've demonstrated on the HTC
surround gonna give you access to
whether stocks picture editing a few
other kind of cool things it's got a 13
hundred million power battery it does of
course have 3g but it's HSPA for bands
920 100 meaning no 3g here in the US you
are going to have on the back sort of
the requisite windows mobile stuff 5
megapixel camera with autofocus and LED
flash capable of recording video at 720p
and this is all coupled with 802 11 and
Wi-Fi so i'll go and pull off the
plastic I know you guys created when I
don't pull off the plastic on these
devices alright so let's let this focus
in
see what we've got we've got your
sensors on the top right there proximity
and such we've got your sort of standard
I mandated windows phone 7 capacitive
buttons you've got your home button back
button and search on the left hand side
this is a very thin device I've got a
volume rocker up and down micro USB
charging port on the right side of the
Vice we've got a camera hard one
microphone 3.5 millimeter headset jack
and the lock button which is on the left
side and a lot of phones are familiar
with having a lock button on the right
so the reverse you're going to get used
to that let's go ahead and see what else
we are going to get in the box with your
HTC trophy I'm willing to guess though
that it's pretty much the standard HTC
row of accessories put some contact us
stuff start here and correct it is a San
JTC stuff so you've got your wall plug
with USB port you've got a inline stereo
with microphone and volume adjustment
and then you've got a USB to microUSB
port for charging and that's pretty
stock phone accessories let's go ahead
and do a quick comparison here with the
HTC surround that this definitely sort
of bears a striking resemblance with
surround of course has the speaker that
gives it surround name which does not
really worthwhile to have that extra
weight and fatness for that speaker
doesn't really do much in a case you've
seen it the surround laying around AT&amp;amp;T
stores or in a friend's pocket here is a
quick size comparison and it is a
no-brainer here the trophy is much
thinner I would much much rather put the
trophy of my pocket then I would the
surround us to to wait sighs all right
let's go ahead and give this guy just a
first power on I can see what this looks
like sink the battery is already in
there no the battery is not in there or
there's something covering it to go
ahead and check it out
all right HTC has put a little plastic
piece there to cover the battery so they
turn on transport go ahead and pull it
off push the yellow backing on in throw
the back on let's get this guy a quick
power on of course I'll cover everything
else in the full review of the HTC
trophy let's go ahead and power it on
and see what she looks like HTZ
that first boot up is obviously slower
it's got to go through a ton of things
to configure the operating system first
boot up though in general boot up time
with Windows Phone is actually
relatively fast much quicker than an
experience with a lot of other operating
systems which is always nice in there
waiting for your phone to turn on will
probably let me know I don't know sim
card in there which I don't to go ahead
and get started I'm going to English and
let close no sim air accept terms of use
phone settings will just go to
recommended settings pick different time
zones
drop this what about it and let's go
ahead and pick whatever is it and go
next dating time and not now I get sort
of a walkthrough on installing apps you
can see sort of the load screen those
little red dots are scrolling across the
top icons are popping down 100 things
about windows phone seven people asking
was how come you can't tell the signal
strength or battery level while using
the applications a lot of time they hide
like that he had actually pulled them
down sort of interesting so right now
it's been stalling sort of the default
applications it's probably the HTC hub
that got installed go ahead and hit next
I'll done and now we should finally be
in the operating system and we are
indeed in the upper system and here is
the HTC trophies OS obviously looks very
familiar to the other windows phone 7
operating systems known differentiation
is generally the hubs and this in case
we've got the HTC hub which is probably
going to try and pull in weather and
data but it's not going to have access
to it's not connected to Wi-Fi but I
will connect this and you get a sort of
full overview in the review for all your
exclusive HTC trophy ish content be sure
