you by Linda calm what's up everyone
walk back there pisode of asta Buffalo I
am a buffalo my name is John renders to
show you could ask me any question
you've got from the world technology and
sometimes outside don't know what tablet
to get not sure what phone to get if
you're like Ron you're not sure why it
hurts when you urinate this is the show
you can ask this week would talk about
some note forward to talk a lot about
new iPads and surface pro 3 it's going
to get started first question comes from
aunt paperboy 786 which coincidentally
was one of my favorite Nintendo games at
John for lakers it's just me or there's
a note for not feel as comfortable the
hand does the note 3 I hate to say a
paperboy you might have thought it but
it's it's just you the note 4 I think
feels absolutely incredible my hands
I've knocked samsung for many years for
making super cheap feeling devices but
the note 4 totally bucks that trend I
love the way that sort of cold metal
feels feels really nice in the hand so
yeah man just you not me it's totally
you sex question comes from at the
boucher 1998 perhaps you know Bobby at
John for lakers do you still use the
surface pro 3 if not what was the reason
if so what are the best features so I
maybe I'm I certainly am on the minority
when I say I really liked the surface
pro devices especially a surface pro 3
cuz higher resolution I use it all the
time I use it at home mostly when I
don't want to go upstairs and you get my
laptop and I want their answers do work
but also sometimes my family I can't add
a multi task is when I used it the most
which really handy bill to put off my
lap because it has a half ability but
I've still use it I like it I use it all
the time pti five models of perfect or a
middle ground so yes I use it yes I like
it I'm a favorite feature is that it's a
full-blown computer that I can just
throw in my bag and doesn't weigh much
next question comes from at Gary Fox 90
who asked at John for lakers what would
you go for a nexus 9 or iPad air 2 what
do you think is the best hashtag ask the
Buffalo
I didn't really use the original iPad
air after came out always preferred the
smaller sized devices on the ipad air 2
is very similar just dinner with touch
ID I haven't yet seen the Nexus 9 a
person but it looked gorgeous I think
the easy question is are you android you
want to say that it can system are you
an apple you want to stay in that it
goes I think if you use a Mac it's
easier to go and I pet her out if you're
maybe a pc or you have an android phone
regardless of what the computer system
you have at home and go the Nexus 9 it
looks awesome HTC makes pretty ball or
hardware I think you can go wrong either
way I just ask yourself for joplin

TechnoBuffalo back to the questions next
one and the last one comes from Lakeview
ego who asked at John for lakers is it
worth giving the new ipad 3 mini if i
have the two main you save this answers
your question for you we're not buying
an ipad mini food review in the office
because the only addition is touch ID
that's it and a gold color so at the
touch ID the gold color is important to
you then yeah otherwise no way there's
no reason to upgrade unless you need
like more storage or something but I
can't see a reason why you'd go for the
mini three over the me to fact that
probably bought the mini to 900 bucks
less I don't need touch ID on my iPad my
phone makes more sense i'm not taking
out my ipad every five minutes to check
my email obsessively or check Instagram
word and I should I wouldn't worry about
it and especially wouldn't run to
upgrade to the mini 30 get up eight your
