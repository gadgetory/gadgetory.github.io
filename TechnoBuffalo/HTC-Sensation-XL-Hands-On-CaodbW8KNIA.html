John redtube TechnoBuffalo here back at
CTIA 2011 with jeff gordon we have with
us we just announced and not to beyond
us Shores
unfortunately the sensation Excel with
Beats Audio exactly yes so we can see
that the headphones here that's that's
one of the big headlines with this
device we we announced it at a big event
with Beats in London just this past
Thursday so the device is literally just
a few days old but really excited about
bringing the beats to this as you can
see on the on the back that that beats
logo so people will be really happy with
the audio experience on here in fact
alcohol demo what that looks like in a
second but just to give you a quick
rundown of the specs here you're looking
at a 4.7 inches screen WVGA resolution
with a super LCD panel and the Super LCD
panel is really beautiful to see the
viewing angle on that is unbelievable
yeah yeah yeah it is we're very very
proud of that
actually by comparison so I've got an
iPhone 4 here you go ahead and put these
two side-by-side and sort of we move
them in tandem as the the camera moves
around you can certainly you can see the
viewing angle I'm even right there with
the screens presentation excel the
screen looks beautiful and not washed
out depending on how you go hopefully
the camera is going to Aunt Polly
capture them yeah hopefully you'll see
that at home or wherever you're watching
but but yeah the colors are crisp and
and beautiful they really pop so really
happy with how the screen turned out on
this comes other specs this has a
single-core 1.5 gigahertz Snapdragon
processor 768 Meg's of RAM and 16 gigs
of ROM so plenty of space to to hold the
multimedia and games and other stuff
that you want to use on on this device
it's also running Android 2.3
Gingerbread along with the latest HTC
Sense experience that our customers have
come to know and love from us this is
Sense 3.5 and let's see as we flip it
around to to the back
we have an 8 megapixel camera which is f
2.2 with a 28 millimeter wide angle lens
and dual LED flash along with some
software enhancements that that we've
made and continuing to really just focus
in on the software side of the camera so
that way people can take great shots
without having to drill down into the
settings up on the camera so this is
coming soon it's gonna be available in
November in Europe
excellent so if we take a look at some
that beatsaudio yeah yeah good go years
on absolutely so this is another one of
those things where you know would love
it for people to check it out in person
because obviously I'm on video it's
tough to tell what the audio listening
experience is going to be like but for
those of you who are familiar with beats
I've used those headphones in the past
they have really awesome audio
especially when you're listening to you
know hip-hop or club music that kind of
thing they're really you know resonant
bass and then at that type so as I plug
in these headphones and these are called
ear beats headphones they're very
similar to that I beats that you can
purchase separately but these come in
the box with the sensation XL this might
be one of the rare pair of headphones
people actually excited to get out of
the box exactly right so we'll go into
the HTC music player app oh guess what
we've got some dr. dre already
appropriately enough appropriately
enough and as I press play on the track
up here in the status bar you can see
that the Beats Audio has automatically
turned on it's detected that we've got
the Beats headphones plugged in and will
that only work with the beats headphone
plugged in so essentially the way I like
to think of it is that the Beats Audio
profile is all about the sort of the
perfect marriage between the headphones
and the hardware and software on the
device so sure you can plug in another
pair of headphones but you're not going
to get the Beats Audio profile and
you're not going to have sort of
vertical integration between between the
two because what we've been able to do
is identify exactly the right
equalization settings and DSP settings
for things like the specialization of
the audio and as I said perfectly marry
the two in a way that you're gonna get
the best listening experience with the
beats headphones
and you can test that yourself as you go
in and here you can see that we've got
Beats Audio in the in the settings and
can easily disable it and then wah-wah
we've got normal audio so can I can I
hear the difference in between beats and
regular okay get pop in there absolutely
here but absolutely tell this on camera
don't take my word for it all right so
we got beats going now yep nice alright
so I'll turn it off I'm probably
screaming - so I'm disabled
now you definitely hear I'm not an
audiophile I'm not the best most
reindeers but you can certainly hear the
difference in the audio fidelity major
at yeah and like I said before it's one
of those things where you really kind of
have to go ears on yourself and of
course we're very dedicated to to the
beats technology and as we have Beats
Hardware in the States
you know certainly get up there check it
out for yourself if you're a viewer in
Europe as soon as we have this in stores
in November to get out to your local
store check it out and folks that might
already have a pair of Beats headphones
of beats by dre or DD beats whatever it
might be well you still get the same
beats experience definitely definitely
because we're so closely partnered with
the engineers over at beats we know
exactly what the hardware is in the
headphones are going to make that
perfect marriage between the two and in
fact some regions in Europe will get a
special edition of a sensation in Excel
that comes with the beats solo
headphones which is one of the over the
ear cannons excellent and let's be
available in any other colors or is
white going to be just wait at this time
yeah all right and the the back of the
phone has now no typical sort of HTC
middlefield dissolve one piece that
comes off and I'm not really typical I'd
call it a typically beautiful and very
much in line with HTC's kind of design
heritage as we look at the back of the
HTC Flyer or even the back of the
Windows Phone HTC Radar 4G this is
classic HTC it's beautiful aluminum
unibody very very sturdy and that's kind
of thing that our our customers really
love about HTC products so if I ask
another question about the beats is that
incorporated at all with the
speakerphone here or is it just when you
have the beats yeah it's not the
speakerphone at this time is just what
the
have fun listening experience the
external speaker is something that of
course you know down the road hopefully
the technology will evolve to that point
but the beats concept is all about
presenting music the way the artist
originally intended it and for that it's
all about as close to your ears as
possible
excellent so this is the sensation excel
if you're lucky enough to be in a region
where this guy's gonna be watching check
it out - thank you Jeff I appreciate the
time thank you - you bet
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
