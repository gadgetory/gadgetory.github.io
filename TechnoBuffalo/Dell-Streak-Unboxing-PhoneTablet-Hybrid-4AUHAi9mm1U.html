TechnoBuffalo here with an unboxing for
you of the tablet phone hybrid Dell
Streak this is the full US packaging
that is just about ready for release so
I had a chance to take a look at the
Dell Streak when I was at Dells campus
in Red Rock last month and it was a
really interesting device just big
enough to fit in your pockets but not
too big that you couldn't use it way
around and about a really a sort of a
nice compromise of size and function it
offers a huge 5-inch screen we'll go
ahead and talk about the specs a bit
more up at the time when I first saw the
device I wasn't quite ready for US
consumption now evidently it is let's go
ahead and get started this is right from
Dells PR folks go ahead and open it up
just sent for a few days for review no
big knife needed it's got the Fed Ex
handy rip thing we can take a look at
what the u.s. packaging is going to look
like for the Dell Streak so here it is
as of now I don't have any sort of
carrier information or pricing but you
have some specs that I'll go over with
in a little bit so here is the streak a
5 inch widescreen tablet Dell 5 inch
widescreen tablet it's got a picture of
it being mounted use for a GPS which is
actually probably a nice use for it
we've got some information on the side
about IMEI numbers and such and here are
some of the features let's sort of go
through this very quickly 5-inch WVGA
screen that resolution 800 by 480
that's a capacitive touchscreen is using
Gorilla Glass which is that very very
very durable glass you're seeing used
more and more on smartphones on a phone
and a device this big certainly having a
durable glass display is going to be
very important so I'm happy to see that
Dell we use Gorilla Glass is using the
snapdragon 1 gigahertz processor it's
got a 5 megapixel rear camera and a VGA
camera in the front UMTS bands one two
and three so that means this will
actually work with ETTs
3g network 2119
and 850 HSDPA all kinds of Bluetooth
stuff you'd expect let's go ahead and
dig into the box got a little bit of
plastic right there go ahead and try and
rip that we are without these big knife
so I'll use the big ol nail clipper to
cut that little bit of plastic and we'll
take a look at where you're going to get
in the box for it
all right so here we have it's like a
user manual quick start up guide this is
running a custom version of Android 1.6
Dell has said that it will be upgraded
to the most recent version of Android a
brighten at 1.6 is what the shipping ROM
is going to be here's the device itself
we do a size comparison just a minute
push that off to the side we've got the
back cover and a battery which is of
size 1500 and 30 milliamps ours in case
you guys were wondering there it is
right there keeping going into the box
we are going to get a pretty nice
packaging actually looks like we have a
case which is see if it passes the
what's case made of test
there's to be just a microfiber cloth so
you can clean the screen with it or keep
it safe warranty information there is a
very tiny wall adapter for the US and
there is the wall plug so that's going
to go ahead and slide right in
I assume we've got a micro USB adapter
which we have right here we also have a
pair of stereo headphones with
microphone so that appears to be the
Dell Streak box but enough of that let's
go ahead and take a look at the device
itself let's do some size comparisons
and a quick overview as to what this
thing is going to look like when you
actually start to use it is going to
come looks like with a 16 gig micro SD
card which is quite nice build quality
still feels very solid it feels almost
identical to what I saw when I first
took a look at this last month to go
ahead and pop the battery in and we'll
turn on you guys can see the first boot
up here to see what it looks like and I
will pop on the back and this can be
used as a as a phone like I demonstrated
a little while ago it does have a full
3G radio so you can actually use this as
a phone as a tablet is really an
all-in-one device alright so I did get
the back cover on and it's a bit of
point of clarification I shouldn't
mention that this is actually does not
use a micro USB port to charge I use a
Dell propriété port you can see there
on the bottom there will be a ton of
accessories available as far as docks
and cradles and such let's take a look
at the device you've got sort of your
standard array of buttons they are
capacitive buttons across the bottom
you've got a back a menu in a home
button and this is running a Dell
skinned version of 1.6 and a skin is
really essential when you're using a
phone sort of this dimensions to make
most use of the real estate so on the
left hand side there is that dock
connecting port on the front you got the
microphone and speaker sort of in their
logical spots front-facing VGA camera
and of course that five inch screen that
we're talking about on the right hand
side is where most of the action happens
3.5 millimeter headset jack volume up
and down power and lock and dedicated
camera key the back we just saw that
houses the five megapixel camera with
dual LED flash a removable battery like
down like we just saw and there's
speaker grille right there on the side
of the door so let's go ahead and power
this thing on and again this is Android
1.6 so we'll tap to unlock so press menu
to unlock go ahead and set up welcome to
the Dell Streak oh go ahead and good
English goes through what I just said
and stay tuned to the YouTube channel
and TechnoBuffalo be doing a full
walkthrough software and hardware of the
Dell Streak as well as our full
impressions of the device so you've got
sort of a very new look for Android yet
very familiar get the whole menu bar
here is broken up into different devices
status bar tips and sort of things work
um familiar with Android but a bit
different navigation tips and such sort
of go through this and we will hit done
and again this is still a a full phone
which is kind of interesting as well
let's go ahead and do a size comparison
its other devices might be familiar with
and you're thinking hey as a 5-inch
phone tablet hybrid going to be too big
for me or is it not so here is with the
iPhone 4 and the 3.5 inch screen you can
most definitely see a difference there
phones are getting progressively bigger
than the iPhone for example here is the
4 inch Galaxy S variant of the Samsung
Captivate see it starts to look a bit
more evenly matched and we go even bit
larger since phones are getting bigger
here we have the Evo 4G that's 4.3 inch
screen and you start hearing 5 inches
you think well you know that's really
big we look at devices that are 4.3 inch
initially not that much of a difference
go ahead and put them right up and you
can see through where that difference is
a thickness standpoint as well with the
Evo 4G this is a very thin phone we also
go ahead and bring in the other 4.3 inch
phone on the market here is the Droid X
you can sort of see the difference
between these two are as well the Droid
X is a bit larger than the Evo 4G not
that much your difference and go ahead
again stack on top of each other you can
see that there the Droid X is a bit
smaller but the Dell Streak is certainly
no fat device I am notice to that it
does not have support for portrait mode
on the homescreen of course does have
accelerometer
for other uses any guys hope you enjoyed
the sort of first look and unboxing at
the Dell of the Dell Streak ready for us
release as soon as I get information on
pricing and carriers I'll be sure to
disseminate that to you and again share
