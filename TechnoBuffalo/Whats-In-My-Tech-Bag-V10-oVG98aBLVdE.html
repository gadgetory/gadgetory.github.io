my bag video I carry a backpack with me
every day it's the same guy that comes
with you to the office the same bag I
take with me when I travel a lot of
questions about what I carry with me so
I'm going to tell you everything that I
got going on in Madhu purse
so first the bag this is the incase icon
actually a recommendation from your
average consumer so thanks gender I
absolutely love this bag first I loved
it had a chest strap when I'm traveling
you to the bag pretty way down takes a
lot of weight off my shoulders I love
the storage in it I love the durability
of the bag I've had it for about a year
it still looks brand-new it doesn't hurt
my back when I don't have the chest
strap it's got durable poles everything
about this just works for me not cheap
though some of the more expensive things
that I've got cost out two hundred
dollars available in about seven
different colors and if you want to take
a look any of the stuff I'm going to
mention will link to it all down below
we've been gradually switching for
editing over to PCs ended on Premiere
Pro so the latest addition is a razor
blade Pro and this thing is an absolute
beast 17 inch screamer and it's awesome
to edit on it's got a full 1080 inside
32 gigabytes of RAM 4k screen it gives
us desktop level performance in a kind
of portable mostly portable laptop size
we've played a lot of battlegrounds here
in the office and things been awesome
for it it's got all the stuff you'd
expect from Razer it's got the chroma
keyboard the full mechanical keyboard -
it feels awesome
the trackpad eggs a little bit of
getting used to is kind of off to the
right but performance wise this thing
has been absolutely incredible so next
up I don't go anywhere out keeping one
tile with me and this is a tiled slim
pickup a 4-pack for a hundred bucks
essentially bluetooth trackers I've got
one in my wallet my wife has one in her
purse I don't want to attach to my keys
I lose stuff this helps me not to lose
stuff it's not like a GPS I wish that it
was it's more of a Bluetooth tracker so
you have to be in vicinity of it or
someone who has another pilot being
vicinity of it kind of a slight knock on
the tile but if you lose stuff there's
usually nearby you it's a great option
for that what's out of my pocket my
Galaxy S
plus is my Goku phone Verizon's
currently the carrier that I'm using
I've got a bear case on it if you guys
have been following my crack in my
Galaxy s8 story our forum
editor-in-chief
Roy Choi sent me a link to bear cave
Instagram so I tried it it's a really
thin case but I've got it on there see
if it protects it or not it's not cheap
about 30 bucks for case set I don't
think is going to really do that much
that's not the only phone I carry
especially when I'm traveling I had
adjust to the back to show you what I
take with me when I am going somewhere
and this is an unlocked phone in this
case it's an unlocked iPhone 7 plus I'm
going along with that I also have a SIM
card holder Motorola sent this to us and
a press kit a few years back and it's
been awesome to have so I usually have
SIM card smally other carriers because I
need to tether I can find a carrier
that's going to be faster and when I'm
editing or one of the team is editing
usually we're editing off a Samsung g3
drive these are some of the best
external drives out there they're
incredibly fast and it's got the USB
interface not cheap though they start
about 150 bucks for spitting the 50 gig
they go up to 2 terabytes for just under
800 bucks but if you want to edit not on
your internal drive this is an
incredibly fast options to have I
generally don't go in there without some
sort of battery pack and the one that
I've been carrying with me now for
almost a year is the anchor Power Core
plus it's got a USB C port it's got two
USB a ports and this thing is a beast
over 20,000 milliamps of power this has
gone with me everywhere it's been thrown
around it's durable it's been drops
without any issues whatsoever it charges
really fast
I like LED indicators on it if I have to
pick one battery pack to carry with me
this is it mostly if I'm traveling for a
week I don't even bother bringing power
bricks the thing will just keep me going
when I'm not relying on the camera in my
phone I do like to bring my old camera
the Sony rx100 the mark one the very
first rx100 I still just like the way
the photos look like the manual controls
the auto modes are really good it takes
still pretty good looking video putting
that in the pinch
I haven't found the reason to upgrade
yet rx100 is an awesome camera I carry
this mostly because I think it's cool
and takes up almost zero space this is
the key
et micro duo 64 gigabytes of size such
it's got two different male ports got
USB see in USB a so no matter what
computer I happen to be using at the
time I can plug that in I could drop
files on I can give them to Sandra mark
for editing right take them back to the
office it's a really awesome versatile
little USB Drive to have I also penny
what computer I'm using or editing on
I'll usually carry a USBC Thunderbolt 3
dongle this case I've got the
unnecessarily expensive Apple dongle it
gives me an hdmi port USB a port and
then an extra USB see Thunderbolts
report and I've got some other random
cable my USB cable is the one that comes
with the MacBook I've got a lightning
cable that to charge the icon and if I'm
doing a lot of data intensive stuff with
it I've got a micro USB cable I sort of
cover all of my cable bases wherever I
think I might need so for headphones I'm
currently rocking the crusher wireless
from Skullcandy these 200 all our
headphones bring the base unlike any
base I have ever heard if you like your
music with a ton of bass these things
sound absolutely incredible it's gone to
adjust everything slide to adjust how
much you're actually going to be getting
into your ears but if you want to watch
a movie if you want to play a game
listen to your music it is incredible
and super immersive and if you turn the
bass all the way up put them on your
neck kind of get a little bit of neck
massage going I also really like the
battery life it lasts way over 40 hours
I have a hard time finding headphones
that are comfortable he's actually has
memory foam in the ear cup which has
made them really enjoyable and not
painful like I've had with some other
headphones to wear for hours on end and
also the kind of subtle branding it
wasn't like giant skull candy or giant
logo on the side to kind of appreciated
that so again I so want to pick these up
a link to them down below what could a
discount code they're it's crusher 20-3
for 20% off what's free shipping so
that's all the stuff it's in my bag it's
a lot of stuff it's not the lightest bag
in the world but it works for me it's a
practical man to bag missing something
though that's awesome that you guys
carry everyday let me know maybe we'll
do an updated video if you guys want to
see more what's in my bag videos for me
or other guys in the staff get video a
thumbs up to let us know this is a fun
one I sort of go back and take out all
the stuff that I carry with me day to
day see
was actually in there I forgot I even
had some of those cables going on in
there
anyway hope you guys enjoyed until next
