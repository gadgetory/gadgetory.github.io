to you by Squarespace what's up everyone
John render from TechnoBuffalo here and
welcome back French episode of rettinger
wrist this is sure I just talked about
anything tech related that comes right
out of my mind hole up this week it's
all about tiny individual pieces that
come together to make one bad ass phone
it's all about project are on its
modular awesomeness it's going to get
started in case you're not familiar with
what project are is sort of Google's
modular phone puff and they're working
on for years by modular I mean different
pieces that come together to make an
entire phone so you could have your
processor module your camera module ram
module your LTE module your cellular
module everything else can be popped out
and upgraded individually which sounds
in theory to be just ridiculously
awesome let's say you want a better
camera and set how you to buy a brand
new phone finder camera module pop it in
let's say you need more processing you
just go ahead and buy a new processor
pop it in you want upgrade to the new
Snapdragon chip drop it right in you
have to worry about upgrading new phones
just two pieces of the phone that you
want it sounds super cool and even
cooler than that it's actually going to
be a reality so today which is wednesday
the 14th google held a conference to
kind of talk a little bit more about
project r which is kind of lived in the
sort of mythical world of tech stuff
things that work theoretically possible
we've seen sort of early examples I've
never actually seen a real application
of it that people can get their hands on
that friendo is about to change so
Google unveiled a platform called spiral
to which includes a 3g radio support for
phone calls over 3g networks but what
you're gonna say hey what about LTE and
fortunately that's unexpected until the
second quarter of this year but it will
be coming it also has support for hot
swapping modules which is a huge deal so
while using the phone go and pop out the
camera module pop it right back in that
having to turn that thing off and then
do your swapping the focus of this
Congress to be on providing developers
with tools to create their own modules
then thinking of them badass modules
batteries can be hot swap now in
low-power mode spiral through to fully
support full swapping tune the phone is
powered on again which is just super
awesome google said the next iteration
is viral two sets
launcher in the second quarter of this
year which is not that far away followed
by a market pilot and official launch
shortly after that they didn't say the
dates but soon so imagine you want a
bigger battery just buy a bigger battery
module or you want to carry an extra one
just pop it in we stop just my giddiness
with modules tell you real quickly about
our friends at Squarespace I actually
built the original John for lakers calm
on Squarespace and that was back in the
day and if I can figure out to build a
website you will have no trouble with it
at all Squarespace makes it super easy
and they're on Squarespace 7 now they've
got integration of google apps i got
partial getty images a ton of new
templates if you want to build the
website maybe don't know how to code you
own it's gonna look great be functional
be scalable Squarespace is absolutely
the way to go I personally used it start
your free trial today no credit cards
required if you had an idea for a
website does a good time to do it when
you decide to sign up for Squarespace
make sure to use the offer code tech
down with a capital of teeth use ten
percent off your first purchase also
share your support for these guys
Squarespace start here go anyway and
maybe two generations for now Nexus
phones will have a modular design there
will be a separate module design
smartphone anyway this happens and then
get it just ridiculously cool and
imagines what developers can do with it
modules for absolutely anything you want
a module for detecting infrared you want
a module for texting pollution you want
a module for detecting moisture level in
the air or whatever it might be your
phone can now do that if one doesn't do
it when you buy it you just add
something on that'll be able to sort of
give that ability new charging standards
are going to be coming more upgrades to
USB you'll be there always kind of cool
things that you want on a phone that you
really reason that you upgraded now I'll
be able to just pop in a new module you
guys can't tell i'm super excited about
this things like this don't come around
every day i hope looking at the really
early stages of a paradigm shift in
smartphones and serve technology as a
whole i hope those that will start to
see this become available soon maybe
five seven eight years i know i miss six
in there and start to be the new way we
use our devices it just it's incredible
to see this dream that a lot of people
have thought of years ago start to be
realized and i just make me giddy as a
nerd to see this i'm reading along with
you guys this is happening you know just
like you guys are just like
drooling to try it hopefully they'll get
our hands on early production on these
things the relative future and I guess
we can think about modular phones are
you as just getting excited as I am what
application would you want what modules
would you want for me just better
battery life please would be really
really fancy and cool and you guys until
next time I'm genre technobuffalo
together next video thank you guys for
watching another technobuffalo video
hope you enjoyed we love consumer
electronics here and if you were as
passionate about them as we are hit the
