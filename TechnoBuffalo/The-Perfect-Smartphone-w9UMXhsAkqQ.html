TechnoBuffalo here so I do a show caught
us a buffalo people ask me questions and
this question I get all the time and I
try to answer it every few years I get
it on social media too but it's if you
could build your own like franking phone
what would it be so I want to take parts
that exist from current phones I don't
want to like create different operating
systems I don't want to say I want this
part from Android and this part from iOS
and that part from blackberry and put it
all together I'm gonna tell you what my
perfect phone would be with things that
exist right now
and if peoples in a harmonious synergist
worlds maybe somehow miraculously this
phone could come to fruition although it
is never would so it's phone let's start
with the screen I would choose the
screen that exists right now on the
galaxy s6 edge+ possibly even the note 5
I love that curved screen I think
Samsung makes the best phone displays on
the market they're qHD panels look
incredible they're AMOLED technology is
awesome and they look absolutely great
so 5.5 inch qHD a little bit of curve
doesn't have to have any additional
functionality just because I think it
looks really cool would be my screen of
choice who's gonna build the exterior
casing this phone I'm gonna tap HTC to
do that say which wheel by HTC phones
but you love them or hate them but their
build quality is outstanding I love
their metal design feels really high-end
I like sort of cool feeling I pick up
the phone I don't feel anything hollow
in it I would absolutely tap HTC to
build the phone but it came to battery
technology I would probably go back
again to Samsung and tap them for a
larger battery that we've got in the
galaxy s6 edge+
so we can use that wireless charging
with PMA or Qi I would of course add the
ability to have expandable storage the
battery I was just talking about it
would be removable sometimes you're
traveling you want to carry an extra
battery though for me it's few and far
in between but I would like to have the
option to do that on the processor going
back to Samsung one of their octa-core
exynos chips again same chipset that
currently exists in the s6 edge+ and
if I was incredibly powerful I would
also use that same four gigs of ram that
are inside of these phones to make sure
I was gonna have a phone that would work
and be powerful for a long long long
time on the camera front I would take
the camera that exists in the iPhone 6s
plus that 4k camera the 12 megapixel
resolution I think iPhone take the best
shots of any camera thrown out on the
market
like the Samsung phones are very close
second but I would tap Apple for the
camera module and now it was a tough one
operating system I'd have to pick one
that already exists and I went back and
forth on iOS and Android like I do I go
back and forth and iOS and Android and
like I switch like once a week I usually
just kind of throw my hands up in the
air and carry one of each because I use
software that helped me run the business
that only exists on one or the other and
I think if I had to pick an OS I'd pick
Android on there but with the caveat the
reason I'm picking Android is I like to
see information and glance on my home
screen I don't have to open an app to do
it like to see what the traffic was
yesterday or my stocks are at what the
news is at now the caveat being if 3d
touch get developer support I could do
all that with just doing a force touch
on the screen perhaps I would revert
back to iOS but right now having not
really tested thoroughly what 3d touch
is going to be I'm throwing Android all
in there to charge the sucker up I'm
gonna use Python a surprise USBC 1/4 for
everything is a lot simpler
I use a macbook when I travel so I don't
have to worry about carrying one cord
one external battery pack to power both
there's make life a lot easier it would
be the phone that I would choose the
speaker's is not one they talk about
bone pick the speakers either HTC's
boomsound or the speakers and the new
Moto X are super loud I'd mentioned that
in our review of the Moto X but I had to
turn the volume down
it's something I haven't really done
recently and the last thing that I would
add in there would be moto maker be able
to customise the hell out of saying
things from color textures and front
accent and side accents would be what I
would choose and the last bit of
software that
add I would take Motorola's take on
Android with the Motorola enhancements
they're so close to stock Android with
those Motorola Hansen's but I be my
ideal smartphone I would have power
I'd have build I'd have battery I'd have
charging of course the quick charging
built right in and wireless charging
capability is I'd have a killer camera
that can shoot 4k it has expandable
storage and that would be a really happy
guy for probably like three weeks and
I'd be like need something new because I
need immediate gratification
that's satisfied to this job I just
always need new things come it's sad
what it happens that would be my ideal
smartphone so the question to you
friends what would your ideal smartphone
be based on things that exists right now
not combining parts of different
software but that exists right now in
piecemeal but would your favorite phone
bill to your thoughts on it I think you
guys for watching and hope you enjoyed
it put a lot of thought into the video
until next time I'm generating from
TechnoBuffalo I'll talk to you friends
in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
