queries so let's see how hard it is for
Steve 10 or our lunch query very just
did it pretty easy better that queries
and its query more than just the word
restaurants of course we've also passed
your location what we see now is our new
search interface firm for mobile local
searches again launching today and you
see at the top we have a map that shows
the cluster of restaurants around here
and the blue dot is us so again trying
to make it easy to see what you're
probably looking for this query estate
begins to scroll through the results
you'll see that the map actually changes
in place they give me the context of
where each restaurant is in relation to
me mind you see the listing listed some
other information about the restaurant
and let's pick this restaurant here this
team taps through I want to point out
how quickly that result came up on the
screen to give me more information about
this particular restaurant and that
happened because we're using Ajax and
the power of the modern browsers on
these devices to make sure they're all
the information that user might lead as
they go through these local results is
available right away so there's a local
example easy to enter that very easy to
consume just the kinds of information
that I want from so hence let's do a
simple search task they do all the lunch
i'll go gray that i do a lot want to see
how the markets doing so let's do it S&amp;amp;P
by so let's see how hard this one is
there steve enterance ass and boom so
what happened there Steve only had to
take one character and he got the
Prairie that that we were looking for
what happened there is that we notice
the
Wow app that people do do repeated
queries on going through the day they
are doing things like checking the
market checking sports scores those
kinds of things and so what we have done
is to integrate security suggestions
from your history with our normal kinds
of query suggestions and so Wednesday
pipe desk because in my history I have
the sp500 query that's what came up with
Google Winston on mobiles they didn't
even have to hit return and the bills
came off but the real reason I wanted to
do this for it was to point out the
results here steam to scroll a little
dazed see that of course we have all the
usual kinds of results you can drill
into any of these but for this kind of
query with strong intent we've returned
to the top here and interactive winded
basically that gives me the information
that probably i'm looking for about is
even the tap examples you can go and
we'll get a little this index has been
doing would be here if he slides I will
see some news for the for the index
market overview and some other things
this is something we want back and Mark
trying to make again this kind of strong
intent query very easy to consume
information thank you so we've done a
local one we've done a simple one let's
do a little more complicated search and
for this one off to set this up this way
I have a feeling that I'm going to make
a trip to Russia soon the reason is well
we're backstage amin mention to me that
if the demos don't go well is sending me
to Siberia so I think it's going pretty
well so I'm hoping that he's only going
to send me to our Moscow office and I'm
going to need a hotel so let's do a blu
hotel Moscow Russia let's see what
happens with it Steve starts to enter
this he types age I not surprisingly the
whole weary Hilton Hotel Moscow Russia
more pop three things but notice that
alongside we added these pluses this is
again as a new feature launching today
something that we've had in the Android
search widget at the iphone search out
for a while now we call it a query
building so what he can do is tap on the
plus and he goes to the next a piece of
appearing get suggestions from there so
he's done he'll hotels he types mls and
there's so much so we counted this query
has 26 characters it seemed it actually
8 apps to enter that great so we did
making it easy to enter these more
complicated structures let's do one more
like that volim in Moscow I'm going to
want to hopefully get a chance to do
some sightseeing so let's do Moscow top
attractions so against he's going to use
the clerk the query builder to build
this query ok so there it is what i
wanted to point out about this square is
probably like this you get a lot of
different kinds of results and the
textual snippets are trying to help me i
choose what I want but what's team can
do here is to actually tap on the
spyglass icon that's all on the side
this again is something we launched a
couple months ago and what this does is
take me instantly into a visual search
mode where what we're seeing here is
previews screenshots of each of the
results and so by looking at those I can
see what kind of result it is and so SD
skulls long this is the kind i was
really looking for something with you
pictures of all the interactions and
little descriptions of each one and so
then of course you did have to get out
so for these more complicated queries we
use the query builder to make it easier
to enter your query and then things like
this feature which we call mobile
Instant Previews to make it easy to use
the results and get
