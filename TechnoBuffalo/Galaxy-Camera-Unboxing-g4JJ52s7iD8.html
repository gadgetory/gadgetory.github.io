TechnoBuffalo is an unboxing of the
Samsung Galaxy camera the Android
powered camera that seems like a very
logical convergence device frakerz take
a look at it unbox it take some sample
shots and see how this guy performs
let's begin alright so here is the box
for the Samsung Galaxy camera we are
taking a look at the AT&amp;amp;T version
there's all kinds of stuff crammed into
here a third of tablet phone camera does
all kinds of weird stuff but I'll walk
you through it all let's go ahead and
take off the top BAM it's topless and
we'll see the camera here's the first
time I'll ever take a look at this guy
so I'm actually very curious feels like
a regular camera back of it though
certainly does not push it off to the
side for just a quick second see what
else you were going to get in your
galaxy camera box so a SIM card since
that guy is 18 t LTE enabled and with
their mobile share plan for extra 10
bucks you can use this as often as you
want Quick Start Guide power charger
syncing cable and a strap for the camera
kind of handy and that is about it so
here is the Samsung Galaxy camera
battery I'm assuming is already in there
let's go ahead and power it on and I'll
walk you through all the specs glad to
peel this off soon it's got a regular
Android boot up here so this is running
Android 4.1 a dimension standpoint it's
about a little over 5 inches by 2 point
7 9 inches by 0.75 inches and it weighs
ten point seven six ounces ounces this
display is four point seven seven inches
with a resolution of 720 by 1280 that is
306 PPI it's got a Super Clear LCD
Gorilla Glass 2
display so all kinds of cool display
stuff going on here it's got a 1650
milliamp hour battery on it it's been
powered by a 1.4 gigahertz quad-core
cortex a9 Giga RAM eight gigs of
internal storage the camera stuff that
was what's important here it's got a 16
megapixel shooter they
twenty-one times optical zoom pop-up
xenon flash which lives right there 23
millimeter lens 1080p recording it's got
bluetooth for oh and it does not have
NFC but does have voice control
Wi-Fi is built-in and auto cloud backup
it's gonna come with 50 gigs of Dropbox
storage kind of neat so this is for all
intents and purposes a camera alright
zooms like a regular camera oh go ahead
and put something there to take a shot
of let's say a little Android guy and it
works like a regular camera but there
aren't this typical camera controls
you've got certain the shutter button
and a regular zoom but everything else
is done on screen from this capacitive
touch screen here so all your modes you
get almost DSLR type mode so right now
we're in auto mode let's go to expert
and you get your fold dial here you can
see your brightness the settings for
aperture settings for shutter speed that
would be video right there as well and
it sort of goes into why it's mean you
can just all kinds of settings there
full manual mode to adjust absolutely
everything you get dials to adjust
absolutely everything so everything from
f-stop high ISO sensitivity all kinds of
really cool stuff you could go ahead and
manage from this camera let's go ahead
and go to auto you brightness and let's
not picture so shutter speed seems to be
pretty fast and I front jump to video
mode you could just do that right there
as well jump out of it go back to camera
mode it's top go to camera and one of
the cool things about this guy is you
can automatically upload to Dropbox you
got Mac have it send an email so if you
want pictures shared automatically you
can do it right from here a few other
settings go ahead and check out settings
you can see all the timer focus face
detection where you want it to focus if
we go back hit home button you have a
very familiar interface here it's going
to shut the shutter and will go and
connect to our Wi-Fi here at the office
we're gonna have pretty much typical
camera experience so they go to connect
I'll come right back and on the back of
your gonna have a pretty typical Android
4.1 TouchWiz experience complete with
accelerometer it's gonna look like most
Android
out there galaxy s3 Galaxy Note 2 and
I'm performed as well especially with
that rockin quad core chip but
everything is here all the amps that
you'd expect gonna go right into Google
Play and get you a Google Play on you
can act as a web browser or anything you
want to do you can do right from here go
ahead and accept and continue I'll go
ahead and check out some the chrome
stuff and you get a full web browser
just like you would on any Android
device a media player if you want to
play media on here you can really do
anything it's got the ATT connection so
you're gonna get pretty fast beads
I hear the apps they're gonna come with
it again pretty standard Android stuff
instagrams of course built in for the
Instagram crowd this is from the camera
they might want to consider Google Maps
and a few other Samsung add-ons you can
go ahead and access all the widgets out
you can absolutely add here just like
any Android device so it's pretty much
an Android media player plus camera
hybrid device it does a lot of cool
stuff some really curious to take some
pictures put it through the paces and
see whether or not it's a worthy camera
and really just does everything that you
needed to do anything you guys want to
see but the Samsung Galaxy camera leave
some comments down below
for now though I'm John Ranger from
TechnoBuffalo I'll see you next video
buh-bye
