TechnoBuffalo yours and unboxing one of
my favorite devices of CES 2013
this is Sony's latest flagship the
Xperia Z it's rocking a 1080p 5-inch
screen HD our video quad-core processor
and a ton of other awesomeness that Sony
is hoping is going to carry them to the
top of the smartphone heap we'll be the
judge of that though let's go ahead open
this guy up and take a look alright so
here is the Sony Xperia Z in a pretty
nondescript box I got a picture the
device on the front with kind of funnily
enough a Walkman branding Sony is still
using that Walkman brand us all the
specs here on the back but of course
we're gonna run through that that is of
interesting note this was announced with
its brother the Xperia Z L the Z though
has some waterproofing on here and some
dust proofing I certainly wouldn't go
swimming with the phone but if it gets
caught in the rain storm you don't have
to worry all right so let's go ahead and
open her up
I will use my unboxing scissors and we
will take a look at this guy remember
when we saw it at CES
I just taken away by how solid the phone
felt in the hand we'll see if that
translated over from the concept that we
saw back in January to the retail
version that we've got right now I'm
speaking of retail version no US carrier
has announced that they're going to pick
this guy up this was sent to us from our
friends at Negri electronics so if you
want to pick one of them up link will be
down below it's where we get all of our
unlocked phones from and you guys should
too we'll go and take off the box here
and boom nothing else in the top there
is the Xperia Z just chilling out take
that out for just any moment push it off
to the side we've got you don't see
these shipping with phones that much
anymore a screen protector that's nice
what else do we have inside we've got a
wall wart with new that sort of adapter
but chances are you've got another one
of these laying around I believe that's
what's used in the UK but I could be
mistaken we've got a simple USB charging
cable we've got some earbud adapters and
I see those included in some Sony
branded headphones also nice and some
startup guide stuff push all that
goodness off to the side and let's take
a look right here at the phone comes in
black or white we obviously have the
white version and here is the whole
device the back is white the front
though still is black this is glass on
the back of it then go ahead and peel
off the stickers I'll run through all
the specs pretty satisfying to do it's a
really good looking phone and peel off
the front and Steve's got enough battery
there's no battery to put in because it
is not user replaceable we got a a giant
power button living right there on the
side of the middle I felt a bit of
vibrate so that should have enough to
power on so I tell you what we got here
we are looking at a five inch screen
which is 1080p that's 1920 by 1080 which
gives it a crazy ppi 441 it's got some
crazy clear black technology in the
blacks are really black and dark Android
4.1 at launch being powered by 1.5
gigahertz Qualcomm quad-core chip 2 gigs
of RAM on board here 16 gigs of storage
but micro SD card should be on here
somewhere there it is so you can expand
that up if you want on the back that
nondescript camera is a 13 megapixel
affair that can do HDR video which I'm
kind of curious to check out noise
cancelling mic slipping right there that
little N letting you know it's got NFC
onboard and of course LED flash on the
front we've got a 2 megapixel camera
living right next to the sony logo all
usual stuff you'd expect here 802 11 a B
G and n 2300 million power battery
hopefully little power that's long
enough and it weighs 846 grams or 5.15
ounces all right so let's take a quick
look at the phone to figure out how to
unlock it swipe up or down to unlock we
don't have any more time scape or media
scape like sony used to ship on their
old Xperia devices we've got a pretty
eloquent interface here let me go ahead
and get it set up I'll come back in just
a minute and show you what it looks like
alright so we got the guy all powered up
and it did boot up relatively quickly
one of the fastest put up so I've seen
actually for a new phone let's go ahead
and start the tour then we'll run
through all this business
left-hand-side living under a flap is
your microSD card got two connectors
presumably for external docking
accessories that will be coming soon
we've got a seam here almost where the
screen is and it's being powered by
Sony's Bravia Engine really nothing here
on the bottom it got some barcodes and
looks like a little area for a lanyard
in the corner on the right hand side
we've got a downward placing of volume
rocker up and down it's a little further
down than I've seen on most devices and
a very pronounced camera button right
there it looks like there's a little
door beside that for where the SIM card
is going to live and that's where that
guy is going to go I'll close that up up
top underneath another little flap we've
got a 3.5 millimeter headset jack you're
probably saying why there's so many
flaps for all the connections and again
that harkens back to the waterproofing
or water-resistant snis of this phone
all right let's take a quick look at
what we got here so it's running Android
4.1.2 and here is Sony skin and it's not
as heavy as once used to be but they did
do a couple interesting things let's go
and start with the on-screen buttons
down here so it is a 5 inch screen but
you definitely lose a little bit of that
real estate because of these buttons if
you hit the multitasking window you're
greeted with not only your multitasking
options which you can swipe away if you
want to close but all kinds a little
widgets that you can actually put on top
of the desktop let's take a look at the
calendar one here you just select it and
then there's a calculator or calculator
one rather I didn't go ahead and do all
your calculations whatever you want and
you can do it on top of really anything
you're at and close up when you're done
so very handy way to accessing is there
a few here that'll work you've got
settings notes and some others they
continue scrolling you can see some of
Sony's customized widgets but I'll show
what the rest of those are to go ahead
and long press you can access widgets
apps wallpapers or themes let's go ahead
and start with widgets and you can see
how Sony's got them arranged not that
many appear to be customized by Sony uh
but certainly a few so all the Sony
stuff the Music Unlimited is here the
rest of it are pretty stock Android the
tools widget is kind of neat you can
scroll through different options that
you use the most and pretty standard
array of widgets if we go back you can
jump right into apps
wallpapers or themes themes is something
unique you can go ahead and pix or
different styles that you like HTC has
something very similar but it does work
and you can pick whatever mood you
appear to be and we've got it set for
the default xperia one here let's go
ahead and jump into apps and there's
some fun stuff that can go on here first
we have it selected for own order which
means you can reorder these any way you
want oh it's a little nice tweak
otherwise you can view them by
alphabetical and most use or recently
installed so that's handy the kind of
letterbox
in which is a bit weird and if got sort
of the Sony ones that come shipped a
Walkman album movies and Sony select and
walk bends pretty much it's going to
take you to your music I'll show you
what that looks like right there go
ahead and jump back that was a
pre-selected music on here we'll
continue the tour we've got for the
general Android stuff it's on here some
video unlimited stuff that's default to
Sony some PlayStation stuff here as well
and the rest of the sort of standard
things that you see media remote is kind
of interesting social life and play
memories and such are here a few other
tweaks that we see if you pull this down
I've got sort of some nice-looking
shortcuts there go ahead and swipe that
up
the screen here is very nice looking at
the 1080p screen similar to what we see
on the Droid DNA and speaking of the
Droid DNA let me go ahead and bring that
guy in so you can see for comparison
purposes both 5-inch grains with sort of
different layouts you can see if they
look like side-by-side asserting the
experience he looks to be a little bit
on the chubby your side but it
definitely has a great feel to it
the HTC build quad I think is
outstanding I think Sony has done a very
nice job of matching it here so
certainly a personal preference whatever
you prefer looking at the back of the
device's you've got the glass bag versus
sort of that matte a soft touch finish
both will bring a lot to the table and
certainly are in direct comparison this
is hopefully going to be Sony's flash of
device Lisa company's hoping for the
next year or so if at a hard time
getting their flagship devices in the
hands of US carriers so there again
hopeful that the experience you'll be
the first one that'll do that again
though if you want to pick this guy up
you can pick it up from our friends at
Negri electronics we putting it through
its paces giving it a full review and
letting you know
