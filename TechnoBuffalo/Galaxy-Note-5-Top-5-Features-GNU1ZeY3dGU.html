Sangin from TechnoBuffalo and samsung's
unpacked event last week showcased a new
galaxy note 5 and the curvaceous s6
edge+ so we thought it'd be the perfect
time to go over some of the features
that make the note 5 in particular such
an exciting device starting off with
number one is the design I probably
don't need to tell you just how great
the note 5 design is but I will anyway
it matches perfectly with Samsung's
recent flagship lineup and it's just
drop-dead gorgeous
it features metal edges in a slightly
curved back that makes it easier to hold
the device Samsung's clearly committed
to a different design philosophy one
that attempts to match the appeal of
devices like the HTC One m9 and iPhone
six-plus aluminium is a material that
screams high-end and a note 5 is no
exception we absolutely love the s6 and
s6 edges design when we first got our
hands on them and the note 5 is no
different number two is improve s-pen
Sampson continues to make improvements
to the company stylist making for a much
more natural accurate and enjoyable
experience previous S pen's have been
good and they've only gotten better as
the years have gone on compared to years
past you can tell that the note fives S
Pen has been improved quite a bit the
overall organ auxin feel is much better
once you pick it up you immediately get
the sense that you're working with
something that's been carefully
engineered to offer the best possible
writing experience the note 5 S Pen has
learned a few new tricks to most
significantly the ability to start
jotting down notes even when a screen is
turned off it's perfect for jotting down
notes on the go or maybe writing
someone's phone number without you
having to turn on your device launching
your phone app and tapping the numbers
individually and hitting save number
three is a great camera now remember how
good the galaxy s6 this camera was
Samsung essentially took that exact one
and put it in the note 5 I personally
love the s6 this camera and think it's
one of the best out in the market right
now so I'm glad Samsung went this route
instead of putting a completely
different module in a note 5 to further
improve on the already great camera
Samsung apparently improve the software
based image stabilization in the note 5
and s6 edge+ to help local filmmakers
achieve steadier shots by using both the
software based image stabilizer and
optical image stabilization with that we
can expect Rocksteady video improving an
already great experience
number 4 is wireless charging now
wireless charging is all
convenience while the feature hasn't
been widely adopted just yet recent
breakthroughs will ensure our Wireless
future arrives sooner rather than later
and you have companies like Samsung that
think for leading the charge
aside from finally adopting wireless
charging Samsung talked about faster
wireless charging which gives you more
juice in less time the combination of
these two technology should alleviate
any complaints you have about the lack
of a removable battery the features have
worked out well for the s6 and s6 edge
and should work just as well in the note
5 last but not least is performance now
the galaxy note 5 is packing some
serious hardware inside of Samsung's
latest Exynos 7420 chip and four
gigabytes of RAM which seems a bit of an
overkill but should keep the device
running smooth pairing that would an
optimizing more minimalistic version of
TouchWiz you can expect nothing but a
great performing smartphone in our early
testing we haven't run into any issues
yet but we'll see how it holds up over
time however so far so good the galaxy
note 5 is a powerhouse that is perfect
for everyday use and the improved s-pen
will be great for productivity a lot of
focus will be set on the lack of microSD
support and a removable battery but
Samsung is still offering a powerful
device that users will love we're still
putting this guy through its paces so if
there's anything in particular you guys
want us to test or anything you guys
want to know let us know in the comments
down below and if you guys enjoyed this
video make sure to give it a thumbs up
and we will see you guys in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
