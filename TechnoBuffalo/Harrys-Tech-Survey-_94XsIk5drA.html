for lakers com sure you guys have seen
there a lot of tech surveys going on and
everybody's living some great answers to
it but one guy in particular I Harrison
30 or hair you may know him I'll put a
link to his channel in the sidebar
create his own texture ray so I'm going
to try and answer Harry survey as he's
calling it just got back from a 13-hour
orientation so this is nice way to
unwind before I go out so let's get
started his first question is what is
the main ofc use today I use 0 x 10
leper the most current version it's my
my OS of choice use windows at work when
I have to but my main OS at home is OS
10 leopard how many desktops do you own
currently just own the one I Mac a
24-inch to plan gigger that I'm making
this video on is my dedicated desktop
machine how my laptop's do you own
currently actually I don't own any just
sold my macbook pro for the imac but i
will be getting a new laptop in the next
month or zone so for right now big guzik
what does the highest spec system you
currently use well as i said it's my
imac it's got 2.8 bigger processor i
just upgraded to four gigs of ram thing
as a screamer i love it so that's the
most high expecting you've got right now
i expect something that we used used
regularly i assume he means and system
that guy I either owned or used on a
daily basis is still the imac the only a
few weeks old and is still the highest
spec one that got to see the folks back
to check out the unboxing uh watch piece
of software do you run that is the most
system hungry IE photoshop final cut um
question I gotta say parallels actually
parallels desktop through point O lets
me use windows on my mac and I've
dedicated two gigabytes of RAM to that I
don't use it very often maybe once a
month whenever I have to go to window
into windows for something but right now
that's the most power-hungry a non
emulations software I gotta say would
probably be I movie which I do most of
my video editing in
and that I don't really do that much
strap processor hunger stuff and I
wouldn't use for photo editing I use
iphoto for photo wedding great it's
really easy one click for a red-eye one
click for zip reduction get to tap it
your tits gone your eyes are red aren't
red and your face them look so shiny um
there's always a nice thing what you use
for movie editing I use iMovie 06 which
actually called I movie HD I don't use
iMovie 08 I just prefer the look and
feel of iMovie 06 you can actually get
it for free if you have I'm the weight
from the apple site just type into
search to find it there current web
browser Firefox all the way firefox for
me has been the most stable open most
reliable I'm not dissing Safari I think
it's a great browser but I came from
firefox when I switched over to Mac I
which is used to it so that's my primary
browser although I've tried so far as I
mentioned I've tried camino I've tried
opera tried windows explorer I tried
Netscape back in a day so I really tried
them all I think Safari i'm currently
using i believe through point O is been
the best for me uh what should you
prefer OS 10 microsoft windows linux
unix BOS or any other OS 10 all the way
at least for me it's been the most
stable i like to not have to worry as
much about viruses or I worry as much
about computer crashes I like the fact
that i can change machines really easily
just use time machine or migration
assistant to change data and migrate
over new computer I like the use of use
when I need these of use hugged
complexity but I need to get to programs
it a more def more in-depth just overall
I think it's a more elegant and
well-rounded operates within weeks for
me windows for some people is the best
way to go but in my opinion it's OS 10
all the line lets you scroll down here
see the next couple questions the next
question he has is if they've used
windows before which has been your
favorite version windows 95 windows 98
etc um well I want to rent the mac for
your a nap so I've used them all use
millennium I use 95-98 I used two
thousand I used to XP and actually I
have not really used vista very much but
my favorite I guess is still got to be
XP you know when I used it it was great
for the first in a couple years and as
Windows generally goes it starts to slow
down but it was fine I didn't have any
major issues windows just wasn't there
wasn't doing for me what I needed to do
if you've used macs before which is your
favorite version OS ninth Panther tiger
etc cancer that leopard was my first
real exposure to the rack world so
answer that one there I do any tech
related qualifications um I love it
other than that no real qualifications
or technological degrees an
undergraduate degree or university
degree was in liberal arts and I'm
getting my master's degree in business
so no technical degrees but just a lot
of Technology um out of the technology
revolutionary switch you think most
inspires you Steve Jobs Bill Gates Steve
Wozniak Paul Allen etc uh interesting
you know I think that what Bill Gates
did actually growing a company from you
know his garage Paul Allen is very
honorable whether you love Microsoft or
hate him he leased out to respect what
the company has done and what Bill Gates
did for that company and now what he's
doing philanthropic alee he really is an
amazing man at a fantastic businessman
so I really have a lot of respect and
admiration for Bill Gates um similarly
for steve jobs as well he took a company
that was failing famous quote by Michael
Dell I believe I'm on the lines of I
shareholder asked him what he would do
for Apple he said I'd give the money
back to the shareholders and sell the
company and that was before Steve Jobs
came back on and that was situation with
Apple it was a dark horse it had some
hardcore fans but it was never going to
have mass adoption they had ugly design
they had Anan elegant OS that wasn't
very scalable wasn't terribly
user-friendly and Steve Jobs came on
early created its cult of mac if he will
revolutionize the products
revolutionized the operating system so
from a business standpoint in a marching
standpoint which is my business really
have to throw a lot of respect for Steve
Jobs the apple marketing machine very
few companies can charge of premiums
Apple does and really and the consumers
mind do no wrong so much respect for up
for Steve Jobs I can't go on for this
question forever but try make it video a
little bit short for you guys if you
could have any get in the world not get
invented to help you and what would you
what would it do for you that's a tricky
question you know there's the obvious
answer time machine go back to time by
all the google stock you know but
realistically I'm attached to my mobile
I would like a more featured mobile one
that could do live video conferencing
one that had a great battery one that
could do flash video faster than 3G data
I want to hit a web page and have a load
instantaneously so I guess that would
know 5g at that point and something that
was adaptable than my need so if I
needed something that was gonna be used
for internet the phone could def /
internet I need something to type an
email keyboard would adapt to me a
device I would adapt to the user at the
mobile communicator we really be my
ideal and something that's realistic and
I think probably coming in the next few
years um what search engine do you use
google at the easy what is your favorite
apple product of all time a lot of
people are going to say iPod the iPod
certainly revolutionized Apple but my
favorite product is the iphone what they
did for Safari mobile was unbelievable i
use a browser all the time and it's an
unmatched experience i've tried the
windows mobile versions I've tried
skyfire I've tried the new version of
operating sign point five but still
nothing compares to
our mobile on the iphone have you ever
tried a linux distribution I tried
redhead a little while back it was nice
I just didn't have an effect player that
so it can't really answer that one more
detail oh can you program and if so what
languages I can do a little HTML not too
much so sorry have you ever developed
you in a webpage or for another person
well if you guys check out w WG on for
lakers calm which you should all know
you know i helped develop that Armand
did majority of the coding but he and I
work together on design stuff but as far
as coding and programming it's
definitely him but T&amp;amp;I uh co partners in
co-founder and founder and founding of
the website which office we do use
microsoft office 2008 for mac and it's
fantastic i do not recommend off 2007
for pc the ribbon thing up there totally
sucks but office 2008 defi the way to go
