memorable year for Apple but 2016 is
looking like things could turn around so
I've gotten my top 5 predictions for
Apple for 2016
come in at number 5 finally a streaming
TV service from the Apple TV this one
has been rumored about as long as the
Apple TV has itself the rumor goes that
CBS installed some talks and Apple
finally pulled out from all talks with
networks but those are going to be
reignited again in early part of 2016
and towards the end of the year
we'll finally see a la carte trimming
packages from the Apple TV number for
the iPad air 3 will hit in the first
four months of 2016 not surprisingly
it'll be thinner lighter faster but what
future it's going to be missing will be
3d touch we will see though 3d touch
added to the iPad pro 2 which should hit
towards the end of 2016
coming in at number three this is going
to be my most controversial of all my
predictions the 2016 is going to mark
the end of the MacBook Air Line the
macbook introduced last year was all
about being thin all about being light
which should sound familiar to an Apple
position the MacBook Air as in 2016 the
complaints that I and other early
adopters in the MacBook had will go away
is it will finally get a proper Intel
Core series of chips making the MacBook
Air and it's ridiculously chunky bezels
obsolete the Apple watch 2 will hit in
the middle of 2016 it looks surprisingly
similar to the first gen they'll have a
built-in iSight camera for FaceTime
calls they'll be better battery life
more fitness focused features I think
most importantly though Apple is going
to offer a trade-in program so if you
bought the first gen apple watch and
wondering why would I want a second one
alpha is gonna hopefully make that
decision a little bit easier for you and
the number one prediction for 2016 for
Apple the iPhone 7 aside from getting a
brand new casing and looking different
look at features other West's have
enjoyed for years namely wireless
charging a new and improved retina
display it's going to up the resolution
to 2k water and dust resistance improved
optics while all the improvements the
iPhone 7 and 7 plus will have what's
that device will not
though is a 16 gigabyte option instead
32 gigabytes going to slide and as the
entry-level and the price point will
remain the same if these hold true 2016
should be a resurgence year for Apple
they're gonna trim the fat release new
products with features that I think the
users have been clamoring for for years
what do you guys think are you excited
not excited love to your thoughts until
next time I'm John Ranger from
