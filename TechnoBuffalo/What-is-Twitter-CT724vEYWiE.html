lakers calm here a lot of you guys hear
me mentioned my videos follow me on
twitter and I've gotten a few comments
asking what Twitter is so I'm gonna go
ahead and help answer that question for
you firstly I don't know what Twitter
was just a few months ago I was dragged
into the world of Twitter kicking and
screaming by Armand and once I learned
what it was and learned what a cool tool
can be i'm very glad that i joined and
I'm very appreciative that he dragged me
into it so I'm gonna try and do the same
for those you that haven't joined
twitter I'm gonna try and drag you into
it kicking and screaming so first let me
tell you what it is and i'll give you
the technical Wikipedia definition of it
well not really cool cuz I'm going to
read from Wikipedia and then I'll tell
you kind of what I think it is so
wikipedia says it's a free social
networking and microblogging service
that allows users to send and read other
users updates otherwise known as tweets
which are text-based posts up 240
characters all the updates are posted on
your homepage so Twitter is actually
very cool let me tell you why for a few
reasons first you get all your friends
to follow you so that's always fun
secondly you really know what your
friends are going to be up to and not
necessarily friends you know what some
businesses are up to HTC as an official
Twitter macrumors has official twitter i
have an official twitter so you can know
of exclusive content you can know of a
new phone that's coming out you know by
following these companies or following
your friends knowing where they're going
tonight or tomorrow what they eat for
lunch you can post pictures people can
see and comment on it's kind of cool to
track how many people are following you
and how many people are following your
friends and just a nice fun way to keep
a contact with other people it's almost
replacing I am of sorts you know people
still use I am I still use I am but this
is just another way to communicate
really short blasts of messages so it's
a lot of fun I think you should join
Twitter i'll post a link to it in the
menu bar so you guys can check it out
the link is just twitter com Twi tter
com nothing terribly fancy just a nice
simple service which can be a lot of fun
and that's what we're all about so guys
just wanted to give you a quick update
and tell you a little bit about the
service hope you enjoy and if you do
decide to
sign up Twitter give me a follow at John
for lakers i'll put a link to that also
in the sidebar and if you sign up send
me your twitter name so i can go ahead
and check you guys out as well anyway
guys jon rettinger john for lakers calm
and i will see you guys in the next
video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
