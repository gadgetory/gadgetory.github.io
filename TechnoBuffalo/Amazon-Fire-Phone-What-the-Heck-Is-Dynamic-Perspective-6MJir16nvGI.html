from TechnoBuffalo and today we'll be
taking a quick look at dynamic
perspective on Amazon's fire phone we're
going to show you what it's all about
and see our initial thoughts the fire
phone might look like an ordinary black
slab but upon closer inspection you'll
begin to notice that in front of the
device sports a unique new custom sensor
system known as dynamic perspective that
responds to how you hold view and move
your phone
that means more immersive apps and games
easily one-handed shortcuts and a better
way to read Amazon included four cameras
in each corner of the phone allowing the
device to track the position of a user's
head at all times
Amazon set dynamic perspective actually
only needs two cameras to operate but
included four just in case any of the
other two are covered each camera also
includes an infrared light meaning the
feature will still work in complete
darkness while the feature is certainly
unique our experience so far is mixed it
doesn't really seem to add much to the
overall experience and seems more
gimmicky than anything however it is fun
to show off the friends and family and
does set it apart from competing devices
Amazon was adamant dynamic perspective
is not the same as parallax which we saw
in iOS 7 and it's not the full-on 3d
display many rumors said it would be
when you move your head or tilt your
phone the phone literally shifts
perspective you'll be able to see the
size of icons peak around the edges of
an object and even see parts of an image
you couldn't even see before it's part
of the core UI the Amazon built-in with
this version of fire OS and it seems to
work pretty consistently probably the
coolest demonstration of dynamic
perspective capability is inside the
Maps app Amazon's map experience is
similar in execution to other regular
maps app but it becomes a little more
immersive thanks to dynamic respective
technology landmarks pop out and with a
simple tilt you can easily access more
information about restaurants and other
shops around you it doesn't really serve
any real purpose though it does make
navigating a little more fun that kind
of extends to other experience
throughout the fire phone too there are
a handful of games such as Lily from
Amazon studio that are already taking
advantage of the technology and the
approach reminds is a bit like the
oculus rift in some ways making you feel
like you're more immersed inside the
game it won't really change how you play
but it does add another element in other
apps you can tilt the device left or
right to access menus or more
information and when you're reading you
can also just tilt to scroll though we
just found it very frustrating to use so
we just stuck with simple swipes the
success and potential of the fire phone
really relies on Firefly and dynamic
perspective but so far we're learning
both features still need some work we
did a video explaining how Firefly works
so you can check that out in the link
down below dynamic perspective makes
everything a bit more fun and it's
definitely cool to show off the friends
but so far we kind of wish it wasn't
even there
luckily there's an option to just turn
it off altogether in the settings so
you're not forced to use this feature
that's it for this video guys if you
guys have any other questions or want to
see any other videos let us know in the
comments down below and as always a mark
on the sanguine from TechnoBuffalo I'll
see you guys in the next video thank you
guys for watching please subscribe right
here be the first ones to know whenever
new videos get uploaded we got a ton of
stuff we do phones tablets cars anything
has to do it sensor electronics that's
to be plugged in or uses batteries we
