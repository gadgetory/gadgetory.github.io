the Buffalo where you can ask any
questions from the world of technology
in this episode we are going to talk
iphone 5 and iphone 4s possibly when
it's coming what carriers it might be
coming to the new sprint EVO 3d whether
or not it's worthy of the hype or
deserves to have the evo name on it on
what the best phone and Sprint's lineup
is we are going to talk tablets whether
or not the HTC Flyer is a worthy
investment if the galaxy tab 10.1 is the
best android tablet on the market how
the eee pad transformer holds up we're
going to talk about my dream list of
features for my most ideal phone when a
good time for you to get your new phone
is and we're going to mix in a little
bit of more geeky tech all in one sort
of small package so stay tuned for
another episode of ask the Buffalo
welcome back to another episode of ask
the Buffalo where you can ask me sort of
a buffalo anything that you want to know
from the wide wide world of technology
from cell phones video games laptops
tablets or anything in between you could
ask your questions one of two ways first
you can check out TechnoBuffalo calm we
put up calls for questions all the time
and you can leave your questions in the
comments or if you prefer you can send a
message to my personal Twitter account
at at John for lakers or at
technobuffalo asking whatever question
you'd like any time of day any day of
the week just use the hashtag ask the be
alright so let's go ahead and get the
party started the first question comes
from user jason d and Jason asks do you
recommend the evo 3d over the evo 4g
also what's the best smartphone on
sprint at this time well that's actually
a very timely question we just got the
evo 40 in of the testing it for the past
two days and thus far I'm very impressed
the 3d as I found most stereoscopic 3d
which just means glass is free actually
if you remember when you were a kid or
maybe when your dad was kid the baseball
cards that you'd move around and as you
move it and look like the guy was
swinging the bat that's sort of the same
idea behind the stereoscopic 3d you have
to sort of hold it right at the right
spot and then you can kind of see the 3d
if you take out the 3d part of this
phone you're left with a beastly easily
1.2 gigahertz dual-core machine which is
extremely capable on just from that
aspect alone the 3d completely put aside
it's a worthy successor to the evo name
if you're considering one or the other
death would go with the 3d it's going to
be a bit more future proof hopefully
that helps answer your question I also
think that this guy's currently the king
of the sprint smartphone lineup you
might also want to look if you're not
stuck with sprint a very comparable
phone minus the 3d both an improved a
megapixel camera the HTC Sensation for
t-mobile offers
similar specs minus the 3d if that's not
important to you hopefully that helped
to answer your question our next
question comes from William Duckworth
William asks what would your ultimate
phone be if you could create one with
any features ? ? ? fracture emphasis my
first thing on my list would be battery
life I want a phone that can please get
me through a full day of heavy use I've
got to exchange accounts that are always
pulling that information one to two
hours of talk time sometimes pickett to
bluetooth I do a ton internet browsing
obviously like being on video and I
watch a lot of videos so there's a lot
of YouTube going on like to watch their
movies and TV so I just need a battery
life that's going to work I don't get
that caught up and specs I don't care if
it's a 1.2 gigahertz dual-core 1.5 or
just a single core 1.5 I think it's fast
not any slowdown I'm pretty happy so I'd
look for at least a qHD resolution so a
quarter HD would probably be just right
I love the Super AMOLED screens that
Samsung has on their newest line of
phones the galaxy s2 a particular those
things all gorgeous if you haven't seen
them definitely check them out but
colors pop you don't have that sort of
color q tints that other phones had I
love the 4.3 inch screen size I think
it's absolutely perfect Logan 8
megapixel camera with LED flash that
just works and takes nice pictures if
possible I love a full qwerty keyboard
but I'm not picky so even an on-screen
keyboard that works would be just about
perfect for me I'm a simple man with
simple own tastes so hopefully that
helped answer your question the next
question comes to us from user monito
rock and he asks do you think the
original galaxy s device is still good
now that the galaxy s2 is out well the
original Galaxy S line devices that we
had out on Sprint t-mobile eighteen t
Verizon other carriers around the world
are still awesome phones are rocking
that very very capable one gear it's
hummingbird chip in a beautiful screen
but the galaxy s2
who is just so much better stop to say
if those devices are bad but the galaxy
s2 is just so so awesome so the answer
and I hate to say that phone is bad
because certainly the Galaxy S line of
phones is still a great high quality
phone but you're looking to get one
right now you want to get one that's
going to be a bit future-proof chances
are you're getting new phone are going
to be locked into two years so you want
to make sure whatever you're going to be
using is going to be you know spect up
for those two years so the galaxy s2
would definitely be my choice I think it
should be your choice when it comes to a
carrier near you alright the next
question comes from user Tokyo Drift a
cosh 8 you asked John my contract ends
in November I'm seeking an iphone
forward you think they'll be an iphone
4s / iPhone 5 well if there are some
things in the world that are certain its
death taxes and a new iphone probably is
just a few months away it seems to
always be the case so yeah there will be
an iphone 5 iphone 4s iPhone 17,000
whatever yeah we're going to see a new
iphone and with Apple it's especially
bad because you don't if you don't get
the phone one right when it comes out
there's always a new one coming and
there's always rumors that are the new
one coming certainly I probably don't
help put those to rest but the rumors
are adhering that we're going to have a
new iphone whether it's a for ass or a
five in September so your contracts up
in November chances are you be able to
get that new phone I know there are a
lot of you that are in that same boat
alright so the next question comes from
an easy to pronounce name user ramon and
remote asks which tablet do you
recommend the samsung galaxy tab 10.1
acer iconia tab a500 the asus eee pad
transformer or the motorola xoom that
was a lot of questions and the one
tablet i think that perhaps you didn't
mention is the HTC Flyer is also a
fantastic tablet did you guys read or
saw my review on the asus eee pad
transformer you'll know that I thought
it was probably the best android tablet
out there well there's a new tablet in
town that I
he's even better than that one it seems
like every week much like cell phone
sony tablet coming out but the galaxy
tab 10.1 is an amazing tablet it is
extremely thin it does the nvidia
dual-core processor good and justice
with a beautiful screen this screen is
probably one of the best most responsive
screens that I've ever seen in tablets
and it doesn't a very thin package so my
first choice would definitely be the
galaxy tab 10.1 followed very closely by
the asus eee pad transformer then
anything else and then the motorola xoom
would be last I was extremely
disappointed in motorola xoom galaxy tab
10.1 asus eee pad transformer if android
tablets are your thing those are
definitely two of the best on the market
they are screaming fast I can't believe
how thin actually Samsung is able to
make the galaxy tab 10.1 really got a
poet in your hands that hold it you'll
be impressed with the engineering of it
alright so let's go to the next question
this question comes from Twitter user
Ricky Garrett and Ricky asks what does
your ideal iphone 5 look like oh right
so my deal iphone 5 would for sure have
LTE please LTE I'm an AT&amp;amp;T users so
please AT&amp;amp;T give me LTE at the very
least hspa+ faster data I would ideally
love a 4.3 inch screen left to keep the
retina display resolution they're
swimming upping it a little bit
sometimes people get caught up and
what's the resolution of the display is
but the higher the resolution the
smaller things are going to look so even
if the resolutions say the same but the
screen size got a bit bigger I still
think the screen will look nice and
beautiful so 4.3 inches certainly a
little bit thinner is always preferred
better battery life I talked about is a
must and I'm hoping for a secret super
secret updates iOS 5 the new
notifications are certainly welcome I
messages a welcome addition the home
screen notifications are a welcome
addition but in my mind iOS still a
little bit on the stale side I'll we're
very much left with the same
functionality the same look and feel
that we had since 2007 so something that
could spice that up would always be
appreciated so that would be my ideal
iphone 5 above it to be available on all
carriers so Sprint t-mobile I whatever
carrier in the world you might be on I'm
sure you love to have the option so
iphone prevalence everywhere iphone 5
perhaps coming to a carrier near you at
least if Apple is listening to me which
I doubt they'd our next question comes
to us from twitter is 61 gabster and you
asked the Apple back to school promo
gives you a hundred dollar app credit
instead of an ipod touch like it or no
um good question totally subjective I
think it's nice to have one hundred
dollar credit certainly I know people
would have liked about the discount
towards the ipod touch however if you
look at the life of your your computer
if you're getting a new computer got the
mac app store on there forgetting you
want to get an ipod touch or have an
ipod touch for an ipad or iphone with
chances are at some point you're going
to spend a hundred bucks on the app
store just it's a very expensive
ecosystem and there's so much out there
so Apple pretty much saying here save
the hundo certainly quite nice you can
download the newest version of OS 10
lion coming out soon I can shave off you
know 30 bucks there you can download
pages numbers or keynote and you sure to
have all those choices there to use I
books for example you can download maybe
some of your text books if your students
so I like it it's 100 bucks back that
you wouldn't have had otherwise it's
hard to look a gift horse in the mouth
certainly 200 bucks would have been
better and give you a free laptop even
better pay your mortgage even better
prevented NBA NFL lockout lockout would
be even more better work but 100 bucks
is still 100 bucks alright so let's go
to our last question this also comes
from Twitter and this is user tuba nerd
88 anyone with nerd or geek in your name
you are a friend of mine you asked have
you noticed any slowdown in performance
with iOS 5 on your iPhone 4 well I've
got iOS 5 and I've got it on my iphone 4
and I have not noticed any slowdown or
performance hits at all the one thing
that I have
though is a huge decrease in battery
life what could a twenty to thirty
percent now less than I had on the most
recent build of iOS four hopefully that
will be fixed with subsequent beta
builds as of this filming we're still on
beta 1 but I haven't had any slowdown a
performance the only bug or hiccup of
notice is a camera application sometimes
opens a little bit slowly I'm photos
might crash on occasion but that's about
it the first beta build has been
extremely stable stable enough to use as
a daily driver so if you guys enjoyed
this episode of ask the Buffalo we will
be back here in this seat on your
computer tablet or phone however you're
watching this every mondays to be sure
to come back ask your questions i am
your host jon rettinger and i will see
you in the next video it's my sprinkler
phone then I see you looking at me
