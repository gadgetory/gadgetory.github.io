technobuffalo here's you guys go out to
get your ipads or your brand new ipad 3
g's chances are you're going to want to
protect you or significant investment
you may have seen the apple case and
figure it's made by apple they know
their device chances are they know the
best way to protect it well if like me
you assumed that you would be very very
incorrect this forty dollar investment
offers very little in the way of
protection but it does offer a bit of
utility so may go ahead and give you the
rundown here is the box that comes in
you may have seen me unbox it when I
initially got my iPad on launch day so
here's a case it's made of almost a
rubber feeling microfiber material got
the apple logo on talks got a crease on
the side I'll show you why that is there
in a minute the front of it feels like
it's got a probably a thin layer of
cardboard in there there's no cushioning
it's just sort of a hard piece doesn't
offer that much protection if you were
to say drop it or if you're putting in a
bag and there's a lot of things that are
hitting it here could very easily still
pushing you can see I'm depressing it
very easily it's got a bit of a flap and
I'll show you why in a minute on the
back it really is nothing it's just sort
of that material and a stand which I
will demonstrate the purpose of that the
back really offers nothing a pencil or
anything that's relatively sharp could
very easily pierce that and again if it
was in a bag and your books from hitting
up against it this would offer no
protection for the backyard device so
here's how the official ipad case works
we're going to go ahead and take my iPad
and slide it right in it goes in pretty
easily it can be a bit harder to get out
though go ahead and just push it right
on in take this flap that we just saw
push it right in to protect the SATA
devices there are no buttons there slide
it on in and now you have your ipad in
the apple ipad case you still have
access to all your ports speakers volume
the screen rotation lock right there the
lock button and power button and
course the headset so when you're
walking around with it doesn't really
offer again that much protection but
also doesn't offer that much bulk as
well which is nice you're putting in the
bag you're not going to get a lot of
sort of extra profile to it so let me go
ahead and show you some things that it
does and you can see whether or not you
think it's worth it up for you if you're
looking for pure protection this is
definitely not the best investment like
I said this is really all there is
protect your device so they can protect
the screen a little bit but not that
much so you can use this a few ways can
go ahead and take the iPad push the
front of it right under that little lock
protector and you can go ahead and sort
of prop it up a little bit now this is
useful for watching some movies or even
for typing if you're in class and you
want to use a keyboard offers a very
nice angle for typing actually makes it
a lot easier this is one of things that
i do like about the ipad case and see
the angle right there it's not that much
the few degrees but it does offer you
know a little bit of utility you can
also prop it straight up if you like
although I not it's not so stable I
don't know if I would recommend it all
that much but if you want to watch a
movie in let's say you don't want to go
manse keep you on a watching portrait
this will sort of do the job although a
bit on the wobbly side wouldn't
necessarily recommend it so overall if
you're looking for something that will
help prop the case and you want sort of
the official apple thing this is your
only option however you can take your 40
bucks and wrap your iPad in some bubble
wrap and it'll be much better protected
and you'll save some money because this
really does nothing in the way of
protection it looks nice does not for
that much both but that is really about
the extent of it I think you're much
better off looking elsewhere for ipad
cases most of which offer the same sort
of functionality of the propping up of
the screen that you can use really with
any of them so guys hope you enjoy this
quick overview of the ipad case and
hopefully i save you 40 bucks or
unfortunately I wasn't wasted mine and
we have jon rettinger from TechnoBuffalo
and i'll see you the next video bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
