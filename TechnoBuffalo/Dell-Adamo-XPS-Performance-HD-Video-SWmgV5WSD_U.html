technobuffalo here I've had the dell
adamo XPS for just about a week when I
first got it in for testing i had two
initial concerns the first was typing
how was type and going to work in
different environments with that weird
slanted keyboard well i did a video
showing how it worked on a desk on a
couch in a chair and while it was on
your lap and suddenly typing on the
keyboard wasn't a concern it actually
was a very pleasant experience the next
big war ii i had was performance with an
ultra-low voltage chip traditionally
they're not known for any sort of
graphics output or the capability to
handle significant amount of HD video
and I'll under no illusions that I'm
going to be able to play 3d games on
here I'm not that big of a pc gamer
anyway but watching HD video is very
important both on hulu and youtube so i
want to make sure that the adamo XPS
could handle that sort of got right here
is going to be a demonstration of how
that works i'm recording the screen
directly from a camera i didn't want to
use a screen recording program so i
wanted you to be able to see what the
processor could do on its own without
having to run any sort of screen capture
program so let's go over some specs
before we start it's a running an intel
core 2 duo cpu it's the you 9400 at one
point 4 gigahertz it's got four gigs of
ddr3 RAM surrounding a 64 64 bit
operating system of course that's a
Windows Home Premium seven and it's
sitting on top of a hundred twenty eight
gigabytes solid-state drive so that one
ran the windows performance windows
experience index let's see what the
scores shut down to sew a 3.2 is the
score overall but the score is based on
the lowest number so for processor we
got a 4.2 which is not bad for memory we
got a 5.2 for graphics we got a 3.2 this
using intel integrated graphics gaming
graphics 3.2 in primary hard disk not
surprising a very strong 6.7 due to that
solid state drive let's go ahead and
start opening up some youtube and hulu
and we'll see how all that works out i'm
going to open up here as well the task
managers you can see how far
are and how tax the processor is just
sort of sitting here and doing general
stuff hovering around fifteen percent
just with this open up opened up nothing
else is really open here the exception
of Google notifier so we will open up
YouTube and we'll check out an HD video
go to web to my youtube channel and
we'll check out say it's fitting the
unboxing of the adamo XPS can see the
number right in a corner as far as a
process being used so this year for
playing on a standard playing on certain
budget standard video it jumps up to
about forty percent now if we take a you
know regular video and we make it full
screen I can we will see the processor
but it plays pretty smoothly there's no
skipping or jumping in standard data
resolution the audio is sunk up nicely
it's like watch by any other computer
now what happens if we bump this up to
high def so we'll go from 322 480 and
right now worry about forty four percent
let's see what happens so you do see a
jump definitely one for that 44 range of
65 but it is still playing very smoothly
no hiccups no jumps looks very good
certainly you're more than capable of
handling 420p video now this one goes up
to 720p let's see how it handles 720
thinking about it and there it goes now
it jumps up not as much but definitely
goes up high now we're sort of hovering
around the high 70s low 80s I'll jump to
90 now I'm back up to it one hundred
percent and then it falls back down so
it does play and again it plays very
smooth but you're definitely taxes
taxing the processor let's skip to where
there's some some actor you can see that
it's relatively fluid here not on full
screen let's go ahead and fullscreen us
and see how it looks so it's playing at
full screen it looks very smooth I'm not
seeing any jumping or pixilation or any
loss of frames it looks just like it
would on any laptop without a club super
ultra low voltage chip so I'm your
servant standard core 2 duo it looks
very nice it's very capable it's
certainly taxing the processor though
quite a bit playing that so here we are
now it's still playing 720 and we're now
we're about 80% let's say you want to do
something else so you have a microsoft
word document open in the background how
is that going to kill your process that
can affect everything going to open that
up just minimizing here now we're up at
a hundred percent and things are still
playing smoothly even though we're at
well now we drop down to 80 we haven't
experienced any loss of frame rate jump
around so as far as having one program
open we're still okay what if we've got
a couple tabs over here so we'll go to
how it just go to CNN a few times what
happens well still seem to be playing
smoothly I'm starting to see a little
bit of jumping there looks like i had a
catch up so you start to see a little
bit of choppiness now although we did
catch up and things are back to being
smooth but it wasn't a completely
seamless transition what if we go
fullscreen now with word and a couple
tabs open
so it still is playing smooth it's not
as smooth as it was it's there's a tad
bit of chopping us and I'm noticing but
it's definitely watchable so go ahead
and close it so the moral with YouTube
at least is that this is a very capable
computer for streaming youtube video you
can have you got to be careful what you
have open you can't have you know I am
Microsoft Word Excel and five or six
programs open while you're streaming HD
video fullscreen it's just not going to
cut it but if you're sure of selective
about how you do it the adamo XPS can
more than handle it so let's jump things
over to hulu and i'll shut down
everything else so we sort of ran during
our tests i will see how this plays
streaming content from hulu so we
immediately jumped back down there to
thirty six or eight nine percent let's
go ahead and pick clip the clip from
saving office so just standard
definition and see how it plays we're
gonna get a commercial beforehand i
think so it is play nice and smooth the
audios turned down but the audio does
sync up quite nicely in the audio is not
an issue the only issues that i ever
experienced when things did get choppy
was just in the video Department so I've
guys been for Disney right now we're
still at about thirty six percent so
we're pretty low it so what's a video
plays we're going to jump up so about
sixty fifty percent it seems to hover
down doubts back to 43 no loss of
fidelity whatsoever it seems that hulu
is actually less resource of intensive
than youtube was kind of interesting
let's go ahead and up the content here
up the sides we'll go ahead and make
this full screen no problem things like
nice and smooth no loss of video
fidelity all right what if we up this to
right now at 420p or go to 420 p
so that was high resolution that worked
pretty well now we're a little bit lower
and if we want to you know go full
screen here we're able to play it no
problem so what if we have word open
again let's say we got a cup of tabs
sitting here let's CNN a few times you
know sort of standard South you know if
you have an IM program of flint river it
might be let's see how that taxes the
processor so we're still at about forty
percent and we're watching this still in
HD we can kick it over to 320 but video
fidelity is still quite good we're a bit
high at seventy percent let's see if it
does full screen no jump it up video
quality looks fantastic so the moral
here looks to be that hulu is more
resource efficient than youtube and this
is a very capable laptop for doing
almost everything i've actually been
really impressed with the chip they put
in here especially in such a small thin
package it's extremely capable of
handling really every day to day tasket
i've thrown at it I've even done some
light video editing on it as well and
it's handled it like a champ so if you
were worried about how the adamo XPS is
going to be with HD video you can put
those fears and worries at rest and you
can enjoy your computer so it will be
more dell adamo XPS coming up so stay
tuned to the channel for all of that and
of course technobuffalo i'm jon
rettinger and i'll see you in the next
video bye bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
