technobuffalo here today is January
fifth 2010 and google officially
unveiled the nexus one the long-awaited
google phone that we've been hearing
about for months and relates the
surprise of no one respects mashed exact
would have been leaked and what we'd
seen in the past so i go over with you
what was discussed today if you see me
look down i apologize i've got some
notes in front of me the conference just
ended so before Google got into talking
about the nexus one they mention that
they're going to be having a more
hands-on approach with their hardware
manufacturers like they did with
Motorola when they came out with the
droid and the click and that's both good
and bad I think it's going to be good
because you're gonna have tighter
integration with the operating system
and bad because manufacturers might have
to sort of bend over backwards and sort
of work around Google's restrictions but
we'll see how that plays out let's move
on to the nexus one the tagline of the
nexus one is where web meets phone
they're calling this a new category of
phones are calling it super phones um a
little bit ambivalent on there I'll
think really says much more of just a
marketing buzz word but super phones is
a new category that we are dealing with
so on to some specs it's got a 3.7 inch
am Oh LED display like we've seen the
resolution of 480 x 800 which is super
high-res it's running the one gigahertz
Snapdragon processor which is very fast
same processor that's running the HTC
hd2 and a few other devices like a sir
but it's very fast and extremely capable
it's got a multicolor notification
trackball it just means the trackball is
going to light up when different things
are happening nothing really
revolutionary there but it's kind of fun
it's god of course light and proximity
sensors it's got an accelerometer in GPS
all the stuff you'd expect especially
now from a super phone from a size
standpoint it's eleven point five
millimeters thick and weighs 130 grams
so if we were sitting there at home
watching this video and you know the
scale in front of you essentially it's
thinner than a number two pencil and it
weighs less than a standard Swiss Army
pocketknife so it's very thin and really
light and it seems like HTC who made the
device
I was able to pack a ton into a really
slim form factor so you know kudos to
them it's got a 5 megapixel camera with
an LED flash which is nice of course
it'll record video and if you are gonna
record video you get one touch uploading
to YouTube which is pretty cool it's got
active noise cancellation it's got a
couple microphones on there to help
accommodate that which is nice if you
were driving and you've got a whole inch
ambient noise you're walking around in
the street it's going to help make the
call quality a little bit better you can
also get some custom engraving on the
back there's a little bit of a metal
plate you can put your name on if you
want so those are really the big specs
of the device let's talk about android
2.1 which is what this is going to be
running previously the newest version of
android that we've seen was 2 point 0 if
you're keeping track 2.1 was codenamed
flan some of the cool things about 2.1
you now get five home screens instead of
three which is quite nice on the bottom
left and right corner you get some
notification to tell you what screen
you're on and if you hold down with
notification you get sort of a deck of
cards look like you see on the palm pre
we can select which home screen you want
to go to nice useful i suppose there are
new widgets like an improved weather
widgets kind of cool i guess also a new
thing that called live wallpapers i
think are sort of a interactive
wallpapers that sort of move around on
the screen there's some that looks like
you're in a pond if you touch it you
know water starts to rip old or
something like to go around as you touch
it responds to your hand it's mostly
just sort of gimmicky and probably a
huge battery drain but I guess they
probably do look pretty cool there's
also going to be a new app that they
previewed they showed it talking to be
launched with the phone but it's the new
google earth for android just like
Google Earth on a desktop browser but on
your android phone super 3d you can zoom
around and do mini gets her the same
features you get on your home computer
so out some other android 2.1 features
you've got a new application launcher
gone is a little drawer you now get sort
of a 3d looking wheel really everything
on this device is very 3d because that
can handle it because of the processor
so that is quite cool you're also
getting a new picture gallery the whole
bunch of 3d animations which is quite
nice you're also getting improved search
by voice
be a little more accurate in one of the
cool things android 2.1 brings is voice
recognition for text century so if you
want to send the text message or an
email you hit that little microphone you
say hey I'll be there in 10 minutes and
it types it out for you and you can just
hit Send it makes it quite a handy
feature if you don't have can't type or
you're not that accurate with an
on-screen keyboard because the nexus one
doesn't have a physical QWERTY keyboard
so those are really the highlights of
the phone and 2.1 2.1 will of course be
coming to other android devices
including the droid if you're wondering
or waiting or feel a little bit ripped
off facta you've got a drawing you
didn't wait for the nexus one but to the
nexus one will get to that just a minute
so how are you gonna buy it Google is
now doing this new thing that they're
calling a google web store so you can go
to google.com / phone and you can check
out some of the phones it available and
got the droid up there you can buy
really a lot of the android phones on
there you can be able to purchase new
android phones that might be coming out
so as of right now if you want to buy
the phone unlocked would you certainly
can it's in a cost five hundred thirty
bucks and you can use it on AT&amp;amp;T or
t-mobile although with tmobile you'll
get 3g on ATT you're only going to get
edge hens be 180 bucks if you want to
buy it on tmobile those of you that are
verizon users in the US your prayers may
have been answered because it will be
coming to verizon the spring and also to
vodafone in the UK they're launching the
web store first in the US but they're
going to be shipping to or the unlocked
version to the UK singapore and hong
kong so if any of those countries you
can go ahead and buy the phone and get
sent out to you google claims is going
to be shipping today it's like a really
great phone i'm quite excited to use it
however being an AT&amp;amp;T user i'm a little
disappointed that i will not be able to
use 3g and hoping 18t gets our act
together and joins the open handset
alliance and gets us some Android
devices quite soon of course for all of
your nexus one coverage stick around to
to the channel and technobuffalo we're
going to be going over this thing ad
nauseam I'll should have a device in
house later on in the week so we can
sort of run through all the specs with
you hey guys hope you enjoy it jon
rettinger and i will see you in the next
video bye-bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
