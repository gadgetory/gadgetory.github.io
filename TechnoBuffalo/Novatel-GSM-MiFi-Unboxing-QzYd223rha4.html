personal Wi-Fi hotspot you can get it
right now on verizon and on sprint they
cost about fifty to sixty dollars per
month and they give you really a Wi-Fi
hotspot wherever you are for your laptop
or your netbook or your iPad trouble is
like I mentioned they cost fifty to
sixty dollars per month if you are using
AT&amp;amp;T and you have an unlimited data plan
or even just that limited data plan you
can take your SIM card and turn it into
a wireless hotspot Wi-Fi with the
novatel mifi 2372 gsm hotspot let's take
a look okay and thanks to negri
electronics for sending this out for us
to review and let's open the box and do
an unboxing here for you and then we're
going to do some speed tests after I get
to use this device for a couple days
right a lot of people don't know about
this device they don't even realize that
you can take your SIM card on ATT turn
it into a wireless hotspot we just
fantastic view of the wife Wi-Fi only
ipad or if you bring around your laptop
or netbook wherever you are okay this
o'keefe got a lot of a lot of packaging
peanuts you're going to clean those up
alright that's much better here so the
only disadvantage that I see with this
product is that you have to take the SIM
card out of your phone in order to use
this but if you have a device like the
iPhone it's super easy to remove the SIM
card you just take a course of paper
clip and pop it right out you can do
this within seconds let's take a look at
the Box world's first intelligent mobile
hotspot wonder why they call it
intelligent looks like you can share
internet connection up with up to five
Wi-Fi enabled devices which is quite
nice it has HSPA so we can do the faster
3g speeds that you get on AT&amp;amp;T let's
take a look around the box see what it
says access HSPA mobile broadband
networks with UMTS HSBA edge and GPRS
although these two are last generation
technology is very slow fits easily in
the palm of your hand curious to see how
big this is Novus speed capable enhances
the performance of streaming video
online gaming and large file transfers
perhaps that uses some kind of caching
up to 4 hours of use time that's similar
to the mifi that you get on verizon and
on sprint integrated micro sdhc slots so
that's pretty interesting you can
actually access storage over Wi-Fi or
USB wealth to look at that and GPS
enabled some of these features are
pretty unique that you don't find on
other my thighs out there on the market
place so let's let's take a look inside
of here alright slides out here very
tiny it looks to be not as thin as the
mifi on verizon and sprint but it is
quite small you can fit in your pocket
you're running out the door let's take
off the plastic wrap here really nice
looking device black shiny with a chrome
strip all the way around the edge under
here we have a sim card slot so I can
just pop in my sim right there and you
can put in the battery over here is the
micro SD card slot and this is for the
USB transfer so let's see what else we
get in the box a lot of stuff actually a
charger plug for a variety of countries
here this is not a us plug USB cable
another country charger here's the u.s.
plug hold on to that and then of course
the charger and the battery is of size
1530 milliamp hours so again it says
you'll get about four hours of battery
of life using this and we get a quick
start guide okay let's do some size
comparisons of the novatel mifi 2372 so
here is next to the iphone definitely
not as big as the iphone but a little
bit thicker the next to the google nexus
one so if got a lot more coming up on
the mifi novotel gsm hotspot it's maybe
a really good option for people that
have an unlimited data plan on AT&amp;amp;T that
don't want to go out and buy a verizon
or sprint mifi this will set you back
two hundred and sixty dollars over at
negri electronics com that may seem like
a lot but if you think about it the mifi
is sixty dollars per month for unlimited
data access which comes out to seven
hundred and twenty bucks a year so
you're getting a really big cost savings
if this is a kind of product that you
would use on a regular basis to get a
Wi-Fi connection your laptop netbook
iPad or whatever else you're using
that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
