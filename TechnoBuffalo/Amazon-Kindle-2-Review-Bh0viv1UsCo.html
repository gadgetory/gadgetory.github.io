review for you of the amazon kindle so
during my software overview amazon
kindle two I walk you through the
software even showed you some tips and
tricks this review is mostly going to be
me talking about the device and the
features that I like and don't like
about it to help augment that'll be
putting as a picture behind me to help
show you guys what I'm talking about so
first let's get to reading this is an
e-book reader eating it's meant to be
able to read off of screen is actually
quite nice and very easy to read from I
tried reading side by side to this to a
standard hardcover book and we noticed
little to no difference so reading is
very easy on the eyes the non reflective
screen but it's also not backlit so I
don't think you're going to be able to
read this at night best use of a light
think of it as just an electronic book
anything you can do with a book you can
do with this you can't do with the book
most likely you're not gonna be able to
do with this device I'm going to keep in
mind the backlight would also be a drain
on battering since we're on the topic of
battery power let me tell you how I did
on battery with a full charge and with
sprint's 3g whispernet on all the time I
got 10 days of battery life on of it out
of it that's a pretty heavy reading and
I was actually very impressed i still
had more battery life when i started
charging it but I was going on a trip I
wanted to go with a full charge battery
life is stupendous on this device and
hats off have to go to Amazon and the
engineers put this together because it's
absolutely fantastic navigation some of
the issues that people had it the first
name was on kindle was that the next
page but was too large so he picked up
the book and try to hold it you
definitely hit the next page that has
been fixed with this version so when you
hold the book you actually hands rest
very nicely on it you don't accidentally
push the page one thing of note they
really like when Amazon did well you
can't click the next page button by
hitting the outside of it actually have
to push the inside in order click weird
actually very nice you can rest your
hand here without worries of pushing the
next page sound of something that was
very happy to see so one kind of quark
that have the devices issue of
navigation it realized primarily on this
five-way d-pad you can scroll up down
left right and push it
for that fifth direction I think the
kindle would have really benefited from
a scroll ball similar to what's found in
most blackberries they used a wheel in
the previous version I think a ball
would have made it for much more fluid
navigation pushing up and down on this
little joystick need cumbersome
sometimes and the eating does have a
relatively slow refresh rate so you push
it out sometimes left waiting for
notification to show that you actually
have made a change and what you're
looking to do I think go ball we've made
it much more fluid if you scroll down to
where you want to be and then wait for
it to refresh something definitely to
keep in mind so next thing that I want
to talk about is the screen size if you
look at the kindle to you notice there's
a lot of real estate on here a lot of
it's taken up by the keyboard if I've
ever seen a device crying out for
touchscreen it's the kindle to this well
over a quarter probably a thunder device
take out with a full qwerty keyboard
which is very nice to have way you're
searching but ninety ninety-five percent
of the time you're not searching you're
spending your time just reading so
really is a poor use of space i think i
like to see the next version the kindle
three make use of some touchscreen key
technologies that be seen from companies
like Sony hopefully utilizing some sort
of on-screen keyboard clearly make it
the whole front of this device appear in
ink and that would make a reading a lot
easier and also less next page buttons
so it may be something I would look
forward to something that I would
certainly recommend amazon do so one of
the big questions that i got about the
kindle is why isn't it color is hard to
read not in color and actually I prefer
it in black and white and I think that's
one of the reasons amazon designed it
most people I think are on the same
mindset as me and let me explain why
first of all you're reading a book and
reading a book it's black and white
print color is nice for pictures this is
not meant to show pictures while it
certainly does show illustrations in the
book it does show it in just black and
white in 16 shades of grey color also
takes more batteries you're going to
sacrifice a lot of battery life to have
color really when you're just reading
black and white text there's not much of
reason for it so I'm okay with not
having a color
but again a touchscreen really would
augment this device I think quite
perfectly it's also a very cool looking
device and so this is only released in
the US a lot of people haven't seen
anything like this I was just recently
Canada for a friend's wedding and I
brought this on an airplane with me and
about four or five people as I'm saying
they're reading this thing what is that
that's some sort I didn't didn't know
what it was I'd never seen an e-book
reader before I know there have been
previous generations released by sony to
other companies they've never been that
popular that people have seen them some
people we're very curious about what it
was and what it did and that was
actually very kind of cool to be able to
show it off and say here's what an
e-reader does here's what it looks like
you know check it out you tried for
yourself people came away very impressed
these the Canadians did they were
looking for something like this that
would work on one of their cell networks
so that was something that I was I was
shocked at I figured what people knew
what an e-reader was evidently I was
mistaken so the next thing I want to
talk about is the kindle store and i
gotta say the kindle store is what makes
this device it's what makes it worth in
my mind a 359 dollars which is a very
steep asking price i was traveling and
while I was traveling I was sitting
there and thinking I was little bit
board my flight was delayed an hour I
kind of been reading a book ahead on the
Kindle but I want to read something
different so I went on the kindle store
I downloaded the newest issue of
Newsweek and the newest issue of the LA
Times I was able to read them right on
the device and almost instantaneously
and things are so much cheaper so you
can get a newspaper issue for 25 cents
or you can subscribe to a full month of
it for just a dollar forty nine to two
dollars which is actually really nice
the same price scheme actually
translates over to magazines as well
since the magazine's aren't paying for
the paper and the shipping and packaging
these magazines you don't be paying for
the content actually get it for a much
cheaper price and that same thing also
should books all new releases that
usually might cost you twenty-five to
thirty dollars in a regular bookstore
generally run 999 here which is actually
quite nice so if you are a heavy reader
you can offset the really big asking
prices device across the books something
to keep in mind does have a rudimentary
web browser that I showed you guys there
the software overview but it's nothing
fantastic it's just something that's
there for a cool experimental feature
they call it so you think of
experimental features the text to speech
function is a novelty at best it's nice
to have I suppose I would never use it
certainly never going to replace an
audio book for me it's that mechanical
voice that keeps talking and that's
something I would think I would ever use
but if you do use it you can take
advantage of the 3.5 millimeter headset
jack on the top of the device so one of
the things I'm talking about as I'm
showing you this you'll notice that I'm
showing you with the kindle cover the
kindle to no longer ships with a cutter
and since the screen has no protection
this is actually the eating itself the
cover something it's a must haves I'm
sure you factory next for thirty bucks
for your purchase if we're looking at
the kindle to size wise it's absolutely
fantastic i so let's write in a backpack
i was able to have six books two
magazines and a newspaper all on it
right inside and it was really nice and
very thin to have and I actually really
enjoy reading from it as they can have
enjoying reading from it it also kind of
makes reading fun you know you realize
that you're still so reading but also
doing it on a device kind of this cool
and high-tech definitely adds a new
dimension to it so if it is possible to
make reading fun or more enjoyable for
you i think the kindle definitely
accomplishes that so definitely
something else to keep in mind so
overall i've been very happy with the
device though quality is strong it does
exactly what i expected it to do i
wasn't disappointed in any area I did my
research beforehand I knew what it did
and what it didn't do definitely if
you're looking to buy the kindle make
sure you do your homework and you know
what it does so you're not disappointed
that makes that out of 5 stars i really
give the kindle a solid four and a
quarter stars a touch screen really
would have put it over 25 and i think it
would have been the perfect device it
makes use of its two gigabytes of memory
very nicely and easily you can store i
think they claimed over 1,500 books you
can view pdfs on it actually has an mp3
player as well and also actually can be
bored document so you can send them to a
kindle email address that will convert
it and i'll put it right on a document
for a charge of 10
sense or put it right on the device
rather so I'm very happy with it I'm
enjoying it I'm going to keep enjoying
it and it makes a very nice way to read
hope you guys enjoy this is jon
