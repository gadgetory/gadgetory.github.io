from technobuffalo here and i want to
give you a very early sneak preview of a
new browser for android devices in a few
other mobile platforms called fennec
it's brought to you by the same guys
that made firefox and thunderbird and a
ton of other fantastic open source
applications of course I'm talking about
the development team at Mozilla so the
idea behind fennec is it's going to
bring the Firefox experience to your
mobile device meaning you're going to
get the ability to add plugins and
add-ons that's going to increase the
functionality usability and
customization of your mobile device go
ahead and launch it up here there is the
icon it's called fennec it looks almost
like a baby Firefox but go ahead and
launch it up and we really with the
fennec Start screen looks very similar
to any other browser start treating you
may have seen hoger I notice a definite
lack of button the navigation options
you've got a favicon in the upper left
and a refresh button the right and
that's about it fennec uses screen real
estate very nicely let me show you how
if I take my finger and I scroll over to
left I now get a list of open tabs I can
open up a ton of tabs that will show
themselves right here and I can create
new ones simply by hitting the plus
button down below I can go ahead and go
off to any other page that I would like
now if I also want to go back to other
bookmarks I can scroll over to the right
let me back Adam I go over to the right
now I get a star which you may be
familiar with from Firefox you get a
back or forward buttons if you had
viewed other pages and more interesting
when you get the Settings icon I'm going
to go ahead and show you right here take
your typical web browser setttings you
get show images enable javascript
cookies passwords dressed up business ah
but what makes this platform most
interesting is this last tab right here
which shows you what your add-ons are
and whether or not you can serve add
additional functionality so actually are
decent amount of add-ons already
available for a platform that's still in
very early alpha so you've got you two
been a blur so enable flash video for
youtube a rapport de fennec Twix bar
post Twitter directly from your address
bar you can have a weave bookmark sync &amp;amp;
sinker
bookmarks across your different devices
there's a lot of functionality that
these add-ons are going to bring so if
you use firefox plugins and add-ons it's
going to be a very welcome addition to
you we've seen fennec for other mobile
devices we've seen it for a few of the
nokia devices I believe we've seen it on
windows mobile first time we've seen it
on Android and it's definitely early
early alpha so the first question I got
knife and I thought of when i was first
using this was does it support flash and
the answer isn't it sounding no it does
not yet support flash and i'll show you
in just a minute I go to a website like
flash calm the content will
unfortunately not load up so here is
flash calm you got that very familiar
flash is not present on your mobile
device download here and there really
isn't a download to have flash enabled
now I'm using this on the HTC droid
incredible which natively does support
flash how are the fennec browser does
not a navigation do this is actually
still very rudimentary sing as it's a
very early alpha build no multi-touch
there's no pinch to zoom for anything if
you want to zoom in you have two very
closely DoubleTap make sure you're not
tapping on a link double tap again to
zoom out and that is really the only
sort of navigation that you get other
than your finger although I will
eventually assume that we will see
multi-touch support and flash enabled
when this becomes a beta and a release
candidate but for right now it's a very
early alpha and you lose a lot of the
browser functionality I certainly could
not use this as my daily browser right
now but does show the potential of the
fennec platform potential the add-ons
and what it could bring you know down
the road so what do you guys think about
fennec are you excited about the add-ons
or think they don't have much of a place
in a mobile platform you use add-ons on
firefox do not use add-ons or plugins
I'm very curious to what you guys have
to say if you are an Android user pretty
much you've got a droid incredible or a
nexus one or a droid you can go ahead
and download fennec i'll put a link in
the underbar or on technobuffalo and go
ahead and give this download just go to
your mobile browser and download it
alright guys hope you enjoyed and jon
rettinger from TechnoBuffalo and i will
see you in the next video bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
