my favorite black friday deals you know
you can score some amazing products sold
on the cheap this year but only if
you're brave enough to leave your house
and battle the crowds so let's check out
my favorites kicking things off of what
else at television walmart will have a
70 inch vizio 1080p LED TV with a
hundred and twenty Hertz refresh but if
you recently upgraded you probably want
to wait for 4k or UHD TVs to get a
little more wallet-friendly in a couple
years but if it's been a while since
you've upgraded I say go for the 70 inch
television you're in the market for a
new handheld gaming device or maybe you
want to bump up the screen size of your
original nintendo 3ds target will be
offering the nintendo 3ds XL and pink
red and black for just 149 99 i'm the
kind of person who likes to think well
by getting it at this price I can afford
a new game too so as an aside pick up
the new Legend of Zelda link between
worlds because link is amazing most of
our staff has macbooks as their personal
laptops and I thought best buys 1099
dollar price for the 13-inch macbook pro
with retina was a pretty sweet deal it's
200 bucks off the normal price of 12 99
so if you've been looking for a laptop
for school work or travel it's a good
price for a new macbook if it's Windows
you're wanting best buy is also offering
an intel core i7 equipped HP envy
touchsmart laptop for just seven
ninety-nine also two hundred dollar
savings lastly tablets it's a big year
for the tablet market but I'd say target
totally wins Black Friday for offering
the ipad air this friday for 479 bucks
that's only twenty dollars off the
normal price I know but it also comes
with a bonus a 100-dollar target gift
card with the purchase of any 9.7 inch
iPad now if you're leaning android best
buy is selling the 16 gig Kindle Fire HD
7 inch for just ninety nine dollars
which is also a killer deal so there
they are my favorite black friday deals
at big-box retailers also and I have to
say this because my dad is a small
business owner saturday is small
business saturday so try to buy
something at a local shop near you that
isn't owned by billionaires they do
appreciate it
