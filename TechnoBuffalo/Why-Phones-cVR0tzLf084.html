lakers calm here but posting a lot of
phone videos recently and i wanted to
give you guys a little bit of an
explanation about the impetus behind
them and where they came from so I've
always loved any super technology and
before I became a fan of apple I was
always a big fan of wireless devices and
right now I think we're really
witnessing a transition in a revolution
in wireless technology from the old
startech phones of last decade to the
new mobile computers like the iPhone
storm really are witnessing just a chain
in the industry phone is no longer just
for phone calls it's now for email it's
a personal media player really is does
everything for you and it's very cool to
be a part of that so these PR firms from
the carrier just any of these devices to
share with you guys I'm under no
obligation to review them positively or
negatively and I'm certainly not getting
paid for them often time to get the
phones for just a few weeks and send
them back and just get a chance to
compare them and use them for a little
while and it is very cool when I feel
very fortunate to have the opportunity
to do that I do have other videos coming
up I've got some new Apple videos coming
up a lot of other topics games really a
myriad of other things so stick around
and hope you guys are enjoying the new
change in the site and enjoying some of
the transitions that we're going through
right now so once they give you guys a
little bit of an explanation and if
there are any phones that you'd like to
see or you're curious about drop me a
line I can't promise and I can get them
but I'll certainly request them and do
the best I can so god it's just a real
candid explanation want to give you guys
a little bit of explanation and I hope
you've been enjoying so be sure to check
out the website www John for lakers calm
and follow me on twitter ww twitter.com
/ on poor lakers see you guys in next
video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
