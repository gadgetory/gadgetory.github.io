TechnoBuffalo here thought it'd be kind
of fun to film a video talking about the
iPhone on the iPhone I'm actually using
the VGA front-facing camera to film this
according to Cult of Mac the iPhone is
destined to another carrier but not
Verizon like some of you may be thinking
they are climbing it towards the end of
the year the iPhone will make its way to
t-mobile in the US which certainly makes
sense from technological standpoint at
t-mobile and 18 tier above GSM based
technologies in fact a lot of t-mobile
users are using unlocked iPhones on the
edge network the only changes that to be
made would be to the 3G band's t-mobile
uses different bands than AT&amp;amp;T but that
would be about it this transition would
make a lot of sense from practical
standpoint they wouldn't have to rework
the chipset or create a new CDMA radio
like they would for a Verizon or Sprint
iPhone this would probably involve very
little work this coincide with rumors of
AT&amp;amp;T exclusivity ending around q4 of
this year so if those expecting another
carrier looks like the big pink t-mobile
folks out there may be in for a nice
surprise would you switch to t-mobile to
get an iPhone if you've been waiting for
one for Verizon or Sprint or another
carrier would that make you want to jump
- go ahead - really then one of the
nation's smaller carriers t-mobile's
network where they have is very reliable
they're just launching their new HSDPA
Plus which has you know 4g s speeds in a
ton of markets I've used t-mobile pest
to t-mobile their call quality is
outstanding
very few drop calls what they're lacking
is really a ton of flagship devices from
the iPhone would most definitely give
them that so would you jump to a
t-mobile iPhone no it's not the Verizon
when everybody is expecting but it is at
least a different carrier you know it
depends if that's what you guys looking
for kind of curious what you guys have
to say and again this is shot using the
front-facing VGA camera on the iPhone 4
and not the rear-facing 720p shooting
one that'd be kind of fun to see what
video looked like on this get a bit of a
different view here of my filming area
anyway I am John Brennan drew from
TechnoBuffalo and I will see you in the
next video bye-bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
