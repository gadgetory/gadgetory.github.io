TechnoBuffalo here at the full review of
Samsung's latest flagship the galaxy s4
brings a ton of new features software
and hardware into a pretty awesome
package let's go ahead dig in and see if
it's the right phone for you
so want to start the review as I do now
with all of our phones with a disclaimer
I use this device for seven days as my
daily driver the version we had to
review a Sprint's version to support
flare LTE network although unfortunately
where we are in Southern California we
didn't have any LTE support so all the
battery tests I'm going to talk about
are just representative of using
Sprint's 3G network coupled with Wi-Fi
so before I get to all the specs this is
a phone it's got to make good phone
calls and as is pretty true now with
most new devices coming out phone
quality was pretty awesome call us on
the other ends reported hearing no
popping blipping blah ping or any sort
of white noise and it sounded pretty
awesome I had a lot of requests talk
about the speakerphone I speakerphone
was pretty average it was a little bit
tinny it wasn't as loud as some of the
other phones that we've tested recently
but certainly was suitable if rely on
speakerphone for business calls or
conference calls you may want to look at
an external speaker option so let me
refresh your memory what the galaxy s4
is packing all these specs for the US
version so it is shipping with Android
4.2.2 so hats off to Samsung's for
getting that out the door you're gonna
want to check with your carrier for
pricing and availability though it will
be an option on all four major US
carriers as well as some regional
carriers as well so from a dimension
standpoint it's five point three eight
inches by 2.75 inches by a pretty thin
at point three one inches and it weighs
not that much four point five nine
ounces so the big story here in one of
the differentiating factors versus the
outgoing s3 is this gorgeous screen it
is a full 5 inch screen which is the
1080p resolution at the 441 PPI using
Samsung's pretty awesome Super AMOLED
plus technology Samsung's done an
incredible job with their screens over
the years going back to the original
Galaxy S and they've just gotten better
each time this really is a culmination
the screen here is absolutely gorgeous
we'll talk about that in the screen
section of the review so battery it's
been powered by a 2600 milliamp hour
battery it's got a 1.9 gigahertz
quad-core chip I have to pick up the
International Version it'll have a 1.9
gigahertz quad-core
1.2 gigahertz quad-core it's actually
two quad-core chips making it octa-core
but all the US versions are going to
ship with a single 1.9 gigahertz
quad-core chip it's got 2 gigs of RAM
storage you can get it either 16 or 32
but either configuration you can expand
that with micro sd and you can get to
that microSD card in the back you pull
off this plastic back you can get to the
microSD card the SIM card and a fully
removable battery so the camera here is
also well improved as is this software
that's gonna power the camera it is a 13
megapixel sensor that can shoot 1080p
video with a single LED flash down below
and on the front we've got a 2 megapixel
sensor for all kinds of front-facing
camera that's gonna come into play when
we talk about the software of the phone
so it's not the interesting things here
it's got an IR blaster on the front you
can use it to control your TV it worked
pretty well it's funny that most phones
that are shipping with technology it's
years old but IR blasters are coming
back and they are very handy some other
neat things here 802 11 a B and N you'd
expect it also has support for 802 11
NAC I don't have anything yet that
supports 802 11 AC but presumably over
the next two years that you'll have this
phone AC will become the sort of
commonplace standard so there is full
support for that other stuff you'd
expect NFC and Bluetooth 4.0 are also
here so let's start with the design this
is thinner than the Samsung Galaxy s3
and uses a very familiar product it's
the same polycarbonate plastic we've
seen in most of Samsung's products I'm
kicked out for what it is the back of it
is a very thin plastic but I will say
when the back is placed onto the phone
it sits pretty flush with the battery so
you don't have any sort of push on it so
the sides also now take advantage of
some metal esque accents they're not
really metal up they definitely make the
phone feel more significant in the hand
it's flat on the side there so we hold
it on the side the phone does feel more
substantial than the outgoing s3 model
the phone feels really light which is
very surprising considering all the
hardware that's packed inside of this
it's got a really familiar feel to the
s3 the note 2 and it borrows design
influences from both of those this is
really typical Samsung
through-and-through if you're a fan of
the s3 the s2 the note or the note -
you're gonna like what's done here
nothing new in the design
standpoint it's a little bigger and a
little thinner than the s3 so one odd
thing the back almost has a greasy
liquid type fuel to keep looking at my
hands make sure they weren't super gross
just the way the back is made that was
it feels like there's a coating of
something on it took a little a while to
get used to the last sort of interesting
thing the phone doesn't sit totally flat
once it's on a table there's a little
bit of a shake in either side have you
been on playing games doing something
like that
definitely be aware there's gonna be a
bit of rock in there when you use your
phone this is a really high quality
device it's a premium phone doesn't
always feel like premium build quality
but shouldn't you compare it to the
iPhone 5 or the HTC One while the phone
is certainly in that class for specs
performance wise doesn't always feel the
same when it comes to hardware in the
way the phone actually feels in your
hand but having that plastic design just
has been trade offs you do get a
removable back which lets you access
that battery if you want to carry an
extra battery with you for me that
hasn't always been a deal breaker I just
carry an external battery that I can
plug into any micro USB port but some
people they really like having that and
also I really like having the option for
removable storage having microSD is nice
to have if you want to do any sort of
routing it's great to have but also just
for expendable storage bring your music
along bring your pictures and if you
want all your photos to go to Dropbox on
your external card it's really a nice
feature you can determine how much extra
storage you want so really the more with
the design it's got to figure out what
to trade off to you if you want to have
the expandable storage and you want to
have a moveable battery then you're
gonna have to enjoy the plastic feel the
phone or at least have to deal with the
plastic feel of the phone the plastic
back that's not important to you there
are other options but certainly that's
something that you want your device to
have galaxy s4 is gonna be the way to go
alright so next let's talk about this
gorgeous screen and this screen really
is gorgeous and for me a 5-inch screen
really is a sweet spot and Samsung hit
this one out of the park images look
absolutely gorgeous text looks crisp and
clear there's no sort of pixelation that
goes on with it
videos of course you'd expect to look
awesome games look straight up baller
the screen here is just gorgeous I don't
know how much to say about it what I can
show you that's gonna represent it when
you watch this back on YouTube but the
screen here is really good
I thought the screen on the s3 was good
weight TSE the s4 it's very comparable
to the screen on the HTC One and even
the screen on the iPhone 5 if you want
that
beautiful crisp hi-def screen you can't
go wrong here at the Galaxy s4 so from
screen let's talk about software there's
a lot to talk about here at the galaxy
s4 let's start with touch with those
Samsung is not really calling it
TouchWiz anymore I'm going to just for
the sake of it cuz it's easier to call
it something so you really can't call it
a skin anymore it's almost a straight
brand new carrier version of Android and
it's straight TouchWiz through and
through from the colored icons the
cartoonish look feel it is all here but
what's also here isn't a ton of new
features so when I say a ton you better
bring out dump truck to carry all these
new features because you're gonna need
all the room you can get so some of the
highlights here you've got a brand new
notification panel with shortcuts in the
lower you can access everything that the
phone can do pretty much sbeam NFC smart
scroll sync airplane mode air gestures
all kinds of stuff I'll be accessible
right then now which is really nice so I
mentioned something called air gestures
that's new here essentially what you can
do is you can control different aspects
of the phone by waving your hand in
front of it so the best way I could
demonstrate that say I want to move an
icon say I want to move that calendar
icon right there but I can hold it I can
wave my hand in from the center and I go
to the right keep going to the right go
to the left and I go to the left you can
do a couple of cool things with that you
can answer the phone for example by
waving your hand across it and actually
does work you got to make sure that
you're waving her hand across the top of
the phone I first started testing this
HIPAA wave my hand across the screen it
wasn't working it's you got to make sure
that you are hitting those sensors it
actually does work surprisingly well so
the other new feature here is air view
if you hover over things you're gonna
get a bigger view similar what we saw
with the s-pen on the note 2 if I go and
open up calendar for example go back to
let's go to month view and if I take my
finger which is not going to touch the
screen I hover over a date it's gonna
pull up some information to show me
what's going on in that day it's a very
handy feature use it for a lot of
different things you can use it to zoom
in on text on a website for example a
new features should be coming as well
and that is air view and it really does
work very well some other neat things
here that were borrowed from the note -
you've got multi window view so you can
bring up a quick view of icon so you
hold down the back button it'll pop up
let's say I want to do some chrome
action and go ahead and open up Chrome
let's say I want to see what's going on
with messenger for example I can go
ahead and bring that back hold on the
back button take messenger you can drag
it out here I pick the size that I want
it I can move it down and now I could
view whatever I want on to its separate
screen you can switch them and if you
want a close one
you go ahead and just close it and you
are all done and good to go kind of a
neat feature it's nice to a nice to have
I don't often that use it but it's
definitely here a ton of incredible
other new features as well things like s
translate lets you translate from really
any language just by holding the camera
over it and there's really just too much
to go through each one but they packed
this with s specific features and ton of
options so they really did a nice job
with it
so let's jump from the software to talk
about the camera I know it's kind of
software based but there's a lot to talk
about here when it comes to camera did a
pretty decent job in low-light did take
a while for it to actually focus we did
a full post showing camera comparisons
versus the iPhone 5 the HTC One Lumia
920 so you can check all those out as
well
camera and normal light pictures were
gorgeous air presented colors very well
without really much artifacting in video
we did demonstrations showing indoor and
outdoor video footage was be very good
most surprisingly I was audio quality
the fidelity of the microphone was
awesome it's difficult I'm in Southern
California skies are a little bit
overcast I am holding the phone in
landscape mode with my fingers on the
top and the bottom so it shouldn't be
any microphone issues here at all you
can see how colors look so when you go
into the camera there are a lot of
options here and a lot of things that
you can do that mode button holds a ton
of pretty crazy secrets if you hit mode
you're gonna get regular auto beauty
face it'll enhance facial features as
well taking a portrait picture is kind
of neat best photo will take a series of
pictures and pick the best one best face
will do kind of the same thing to pick
the best face if you have sled and your
family at always blinks or can't click
it that smile is a pretty cool feature I
can do sound shot you can take a picture
and put a little bit of audio behind it
so drama is another really cool one to
essentially give you a trail of motion
throughout the picture you can pick
which trails you want to have in there
which images you want to have and
they're kind of neat and there's a lot
of options here from HDR and animated
photo
really
does a ton of really cool things so
again Samsung did a really cool job with
making sure all the features were here
one of my favorites though is your
eraser if somebody walks in the
background you can actually just erase
them right out and actually worked
pretty decently all the rest stuff you'd
expect over here panorama sports night
mode and then back to automatic so one
of my favorite features that sam
something fun to hear at the s4 is
ability use the front in rear facing
camera so if you hit that button right
there in the middle you're gonna get a
view of yourself using the front and a
rear so we'll go and get something or
you can see John filming or I'll try and
get it on me you can move it around
anywhere you want if you don't like that
circle that's there you can pick from a
ton of different options so let's say I
want a heart shape for example I can go
ahead and put myself in a little heart
and push that back down move it anywhere
you want you can resize it to make it
bigger or smaller you can shoot pictures
or video like this which is kind of a
neat thing to do if you want to you know
video chat I want to take a video so
we're showing your reaction to something
kids react to galaxy s4 video or
something I just a very neat feature so
Samsung really just did a lot of stuff
you notice that's the theme of the video
Samsung did a lot
they added a ton of features to the
software side it really would stand to
make it stand apart from other
smartphones alright so let's go from
camera and talk about battery and again
we were only using Sprint's 3G network
we didn't have support for LTE and
unfortunately but battery was pretty
impressive twenty-six hundred milliamps
go a long way on this guy I didn't have
auto brightness I'd actually set my
brightness to about 75 80 percent my
daily usage to take the phone off the
charger about 7:00 a.m. in the morning
I'll make about an hour and a half to
two hours of phone call it's connected
to Wi-Fi 90% of the day some pretty
heavy instant messaging I have two
emails being pulled down and checked
every five minutes so replies a few
minutes of video probably about 15 to 20
minutes Facebook Twitter rest of time
it's just sitting I'll on my end of the
day I usually have about 45 50 percent
battery life which is a little bit
higher than when I had another phone's
HEC one for example which was connected
to AT&amp;amp;T LTE network while I was here was
about 10 percent less so I'm curious
what that hits going to be once we check
out a phone that has support for LTE LTE
network that's by us but battery life
don't worry about it actually was very
good and of course cuz guy removable
back just pick up an extra battery if
you need it alright so next let's talk
about performance as you'd expect from a
1.9 gate
core felon two games ran made by Samsung
it is stupid fast apps open crazy quick
games load awesome there's no sort of
lag when you're scrolling at all
everything about this phone is really
really fast the quadrant scores ranged
anywhere from 12,000 to 13,000 last time
we did it was about twelve thousand four
hundred so really just an incredible
performer this thing is absolutely
blazing fast and handled anything that
Android can throw at it and it did it
with a plum so no she's performance at
all a few on the phone is going to be
cutting edge and you can just handle
anything at all galaxy s4 is gonna be a
great way to go all right so what's the
conclusion on the galaxy s4 as you can
tell it is an awesome phone packed to
the gills with features if you have a
galaxy s3s did you upgrade I wouldn't
upgrade this phone is more of a galaxy
s3s
the software features are awesome some
of them are going to be percolating down
to the galaxy s3 if you're looking to
jump into the phone you have an older
generation from the s3 if you got a
galaxy s2 and iPhone 4 or one of those
through generation of devices this is
going to be a great upgrade for you
you're gonna get cutting-edge specs
gonna serve you well over the next two
years
yeah ask yourself to what kind of person
are you the kind of person that wants
removable battery the kind of person
that wants expandable storage are you
the kind of person that either likes the
plastic back from the way the get
Samsung devices feel or you prefer that
more aluminium solid feel you get on the
HTC One or the iPhone 5 if you follow up
to that latter category then the
decision is very clear but if it's a
former and you want some of those things
galaxy s4 is an incredible option
I enjoyed using the phone it was fast it
was powerful stamps I hit this one out
of the park I would have liked to have
seen some new design cues here but
sampling went through the old mantra if
it ain't broke don't fix it and we've
seen the sort of app we'll take that
similar path with their devices so this
phone gets a very solid nine and an
editor's choice recommendation if you
want to pick up a new phones get a
sturdy well in the next two years look
no farther than the Samsung Galaxy s4
