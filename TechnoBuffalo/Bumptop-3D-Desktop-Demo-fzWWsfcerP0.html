TechnoBuffalo here and i want to give
you a cool example of a new
three-dimensional desktop application
called bump top this is just a release
for mac it's been available for pc for
quite some time what it does is it turns
your desktop into a three-dimensional
interactive workspace let me show you
what I mean so I've got a messy desktop
right here - all these icons there's a
video that I made for iPhone OS 4.0
predictions these can interact with
other things the environment I can throw
them around you can see that they move
other icons if I want to say put it up
on the wall this is the
three-dimensional can take it drag it up
here and move it around and let me view
it as I like if I've got a picture for
example I can put a like a picture frame
up on a wall so a picture of me and my
family or my dog wherever it might be
you can shrink or grow the sides
depending on how big you want it to be
and it'll grow as big as the wall will
allow so there's a pin mean you can move
it over to the side here or move it over
to this side anywhere you like you also
get the option to add new sticky notes
which are always quite handy so add a
note learn bump top since there's a lot
of cool stuff and I can go ahead and
push push this right up here and when I
turn on my computer I'll remember that I
need to learn bump top you can organize
your icons any way you want
essentially it gives you at its simplest
form gives you more real estate you're
not limited to just your desktop now for
your icons if I wanted to say take all
of my pictures I could put all my
pictures up on the side wall here to
make sure that I always knew where they
were and they can even that picture
folders or anything so here's a folder
that files like to copy to my external
hard drive I can always keep those up
here no right where they are it just
gives you more real estate doesn't this
really get in the way you can change
this background here if you'd like
there's a pro version let you have more
sticky notes this is just a free version
of bump top and of course I'll put a
link in the sidebar to give us a
download if you want to try it it is a
fun application I found it actually be
pretty useful I tend to keep my desktop
pre organized but occasionally like you
see right here files tend to stack up
this could be a great way to organize
them plus it looks sort of
cool to play around with so guys hope
you enjoyed this really quick
demonstration of bump top I'm probably
gonna keep it on my desktop for a little
while and you want to turn it off but
just an application nice and simple you
get your preferences right up here at
the top of bump top purposes are pretty
simple you can upgrade to the pro
version you can pick your backgrounds
and some general options our bump top
start at login automatically check for
updates or send anonymous you should
statistics that's about it nice and
simple nothing terribly fancy but it
does work well and there's a lot of fun
so I want to give you guys a quick
viewing of it is it something that maybe
you're interested in you're gonna try it
