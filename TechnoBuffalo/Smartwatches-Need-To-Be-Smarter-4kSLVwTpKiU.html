to you by the national highway traffic
safety administration had a neighbor's
i'm jon rettinger walk back episode of
rettinger riffs most you probably didn't
get my mister rogers reference that's
okay i got it and it was funny to me
this is a show where I talk about
anything tech related CES is coming up
but I talked about some of the trends I
think we're going to see in 2015 the one
the biggest ones is going to be probably
on your wrist in a wearable apartment so
I want to give a bit more detail on what
I think 2015 is going to hold for
wearable department I think it's going
to be big I'm gonna be bold dickies
gonna be colorful I think is gonna
measure your heart rate this is retinas
ref switches let's start riffing like
friends I took twenty fourteen was a
year we're kind of introduced to
mainstream wearables 2015 i think is the
year that people actually start taking
them very seriously for a few reasons
first Android wear is getting stupid
good I would a first launched it was the
opposite of stupid good I would probably
say stupid bad but Google's been working
very diligently to improve that almost
every quarter we are getting software
updates that are offering new features
and one of the things that I like about
Android where's it's the same experience
whatever manufacturer you want to get so
those new features are sir pleading down
to every Android wear watch out there so
that generation of Android wear I think
it's going to be pretty tough not to
great start seeing those actually at CES
processor is going to start getting
better I would should see Snapdragon 400
or moooore start to be standard we
already have those in a few of the
Android wear watches processor does
really matter the OS and I for your
processor intensive we're going to start
seeing high resolution screens perhaps
OLED displays you know obviously they're
gonna have to be mostly square but i
think the resolution is going to get
higher it becomes more apparent ease and
looking at our low res screen and on
that note I think battery is going to
start improving yay processors are going
to get a little bit smaller boards
getting a little bit smaller more room
to cram a few extra milliamp hours in
there I think even if we start seeing
things a millimeter to thicker I think
consumers are going to be more
understanding of that they can go
battery technology
we just have a very candid word here are
some of the manufacturers here charging
your watch should not involve a little
plastic accessory with a really crappy
hinge that breaks make it easy to charge
your watch look with motorola 360 it is
awesome elegant easy to use its cheating
able you can throw it on any g charger
and charge make it wireless it it's on
your wrist you don't have to have a USB
port on that make it wireless let me
just redirect that again please make a
wireless or find another way to make
charging easy don't make it a giant pain
you ass don't forget about bringing an
adapter just make it easier to charge
your watch do not drink and drive that's
doesn't selling something that you
shouldn't even need to say it should be
just as innate and you like breathing
and going to the bathroom because I know
you do but if you've had anything to
drink do not go in a car and also friend
said something to drink don't go in a
car with him or her it is not worth it
call a cab call an uber call a lift call
your parents call your friends call her
grandma somebody will come pick you up
that has not been drinking it is just a
stupid thing to do you see thousands and
thousands of lives every year just
foolishly lost from that especially
again with new years coming up just bc
we're going to start saying get new
updates Android wear I think you'll see
a lot more in the health department
integrates with android wear bush
recognition is getting better we can do
with google now is getting better and
it's going to continue into 2015
obviously another company is getting
into the wearable department we saw the
apple watch announced last year we're
actually going to get our hands on it
sometime in the earlier part of the year
that's gonna do not yet sure a
pleasantly announced all the new
features right now i can see the apple
watch be useful for is Apple pay and
drawing pictures of inappropriate things
to send to my friends on the watch we'll
see once app starts announced the new
features it is very nice looking it's
got a very elegant design you use the
crown to navigate but no one's had
really hands-on time with it yet so I
don't know if it'll be good certainly
going to be expensive it's got varying
price points and various models you're
gonna arrange from probably relatively
affordable so why would you spend that
amount of money on a watch your gonna
want upright in the year so that's sure
the Apple gamut samsung also has got a
few tising watches that we should see
updates to attend
done a really nice job with those when
the first gear launched again seems to
be trend was not good it was clumsy but
it was a good first step for samsung we
saw the next generation of gear watches
in the middle part of this year 2014 in
for watching us in 2015 and they got
much better designed wiecej then down
Adam more features in samsung controls
tysons they can sort of add more
features that perhaps Android wear can't
do I am hopeful it's at least an open
that up though tuned on samsung phones
because they're really getting good
starting to offer very new features are
the girls are gonna start to see curved
display sort of saw that with some of
Samsung's but sort of curved your wrist
they couldn't become more fashion
focused as we move into 2015 I think the
trend of maybe standalone watches with
their own data plan is a novel idea I
don't a consumer you're going to want to
pay another data plan or want to you
know use something that's going to drain
battery faster when you have a Bluetooth
connection to the phone in your pocket
anyway just my thoughts my ramblings I'm
excited for what 2015 is gonna bring for
wearables I'm still wearing a pebble
steel it's got the best battery life
using notifications and that's all I
need right now but this time next year
remember that I said that because it
might be all I need for my watch is be
able to buy things send dirty pictures
that I draw to my friends send my heart
rate and also be able use Google now who
knows what do you guys think what do you
want to 2015 wearable apartments you
even care I'll appeared on the comments
