quick look at some a gear that we've
gotten recently we do stuff camera gear
here with Ron of course whoo you guys
have seen a little bit more of recently
so we're gonna do two videos this is our
kind of like go gear and then we also
have some more studio gear that we've
gotten recently you guys might have
chain notice to a change in in kind of
like what things look like so we thought
we run you through what is in our travel
bag yeah this is this is the travel pack
we've been traveling I personal been
traveling with John quite a bit as of
last month and a half or so so we just
want to walk you through our travel pack
people ask us better gear all the time
all the cameras are we using what lens
is what tripods that kind of stuff yeah
so we want to give you guys a quick
rundown of what we use and why we
slightly different gear so some of the
things in here I have no idea what they
are or yeah I know what they are I was
just never use them myself I used them
sure I like to have them sure so let me
start off with a couple things that that
I use and then you can kind of go yeah
let's start the body start with the body
so we just switched to these is sony a7s
mark twos I love these incredible
cameras these things are seriously like
industry leaders I think in terms of the
form factor and the quality that you get
provides I think this is the best camera
on the market right now because to me
when you switch the professional stuff
you do get like built-in undies and
stuff like that we put down from an F s7
we sold the FSF so the FS seven and we
got two of these instead and we
personally liked it better it's the
smaller more portable internal 4k okay
we have the audio mount on the top which
we're currently using to film this video
they also change the bodies on these
cameras and now they're much more
slightly more robust little the grip the
grip is amazing the fact that the
mirrorless makes it means the viewfinder
works which is huge just with when
you're shooting handheld and stabilized
so that thing right there is that's the
the audio mount that we can stick up on
the top of this yeah that makes a really
big difference for we have two XLR
inputs on there so that's really nice
plus this thing is SD yeah we should
enact SD versus something like that for
seven sheets Sony X Q DX Tony always
does that stuff for the memory with yeah
they always have proprietary memory and
then we were shooting 4k on a Shogun
which had a solid-state drive enclosure
back again now becomes huge because
you have this camera with mana and their
economics become weird all we need is
this this is us this is the the whole
situation and this thing has been such a
dream and it's full-frame and it looks
fantastic so we've been using it with
all manual ins oh no man lenses the
reason we had auto focusing lenses
before is because we had Stills and
video needs yeah so we ended up doing
now was actually just separating them so
we could do better in both so we have to
24 to 70 bucks for still so we don't
take that our packet is purely for video
we have a 14 millimeter which we're
shooting on right now that one we have a
35 millimeter choose this one and so on
yep we have a 50 millimeter which we're
also shooting on that camera and then we
have a 35 5d 85 which is a beautiful
portrait lens so nice and tight for the
Tigers focusing distances were a little
bit closer yeah it's focuses to 4 feet
which I really do wish it were tighter
but we can we can punch in because we
shooting 4k but uploading 4k for the
most part exactly yeah so moving on to
you mentioned audio briefly let's just
yeah it's out of the way real quick yes
guys look here without hitting my mic
and one now we have these sennheiser
packs yes these are wireless so the XLR
that actually plugged into our main
camera right now
receivers receivers for these and so we
have two actually running right now
which is pretty cool
these have been amazing for us I can I
love these these pairs so easily you can
do two at a time it sounds fantastic the
battery life's great plus it also came
with the this I like to have this in the
travel bag because in case I want to do
an interview at a press event or
something like that I like to have this
but it came with one with one of those
plus we keep this battery pack because
everything that we have in here is
chargeable via micro USB including the
camera so you have a battery in your
which that is one of the weak points of
the batteries batteries awful saw so bad
but you can plug in and migrators being
charges while you're filming which is
right mazing yes so yeah you can plug so
we keep this thing charged it's a little
mo fee pack you can plug in the camera
you can plug in the mic so you can plug
the receivers you can plug in almost
everything that we nearly with
everything charged up by it's a really
nice backup to be like oh crap we're
running low like plug around I'll be
right in
just keep going I like to have this for
press event you don't use this I know
you hate this thing
but discussed I like to have it just as
a backup if you go to a press event you
know
don't always get lucky with like nice
skylight or lots of natural light uh
especially like Apple stuff is is
usually pretty bright but I like to have
a little bit extra light dusting I think
that's great as a backup because yeah
those who go to events sometimes you'll
run into sort of setups and areas that
are super dark and like really unusable
they use these really weak LED lights
and so right it doesn't worry in someone
this is there's a backup you're like
okay I literally need to illuminate what
I'm looking at change the color
temperature that's pretty cool I
personally just don't like how harsh the
light is on yeah it's you know it's it's
a lie it's not a last resort but it's a
backup situation because I'd rather you
guys have a good look in some weird
light than to have like really low light
grainy footage that you can't really get
a good look at the device for because
that's what you come to us for so we've
also got this little boom mic here in
case you want excuse me a shotgun mic
yes in case we need to stick that on top
we need a little more directional stuff
and then we've got this tripod which
isn't the old one right this is the old
one we've upgraded but this is still
gonna be a travel topic because this
fits nicely in this pack is just a
regular Manfrotto I believe it's 701 HD
head we'll have links everything below
yeah we've got this brand new one here
which which is I love this thing it's
it's a fluid head but it's a bowl at the
bottom but the bowl is different than
regular bowls because it has a flat head
of mouth which I am none of this makes
any sense but the point is you can have
a bowl and put a slider in between the
tripod so which is how we get those
right ices and have slideshare on
separate sticks or on a c-stand or all
that kind of stuff right in here
wrapping up pretty much we have a
neutral density filter from Tiffin
variable we have two of these duplicates
yes we don't really travel with two
cameras but we travel usually one but
yeah because but if you want to do a two
camera setup outside then we need two nd
filters exactly but again this is travel
pack so we keep things right simple is
like a light here we have just XLR to
3.5 millimeter so this can go right in
the camera if we don't want to mount the
top XLR mount I just said we want to
keep things light and just keep it
moving this is the clip that goes in the
hot shoe so again for just yell our
setup simpler setup if you don't want to
plug two mics in and that pretty much
sums it up yeah is a great
great great travel bag I feel I feel
very confident especially with the a7s2
the SM is too has very very quickly
risen in the ranks to be one of my
favorite cameras on the market I
personally own as each for and Nathan s
mark 2 is just it it knocks it out of
the park knocks it out of the park cool
well that is that's our gear bag looks
like check this out it's also a really
nice in case yeah camera bag that we
really like it's got separators inside
of course also I like to make sure have
my business cards for business when you
got to get down with business time
anyway
of course that's a quick look at what
we've got in our camera bag also what
you guys think if you guys have any
questions about any other stuff that we
do you know we're also gonna do another
tour actually or something on Twitter or
whatever if you get like because
obviously if you're Purita Ron poor Ron
kind Rita I'm at mark B you can you can
send us some tweets ask them ask some
questions and then we're going to do a
studio of your tour soon too yeah so
we're gonna believe
just a little more gear a little more
thorough walkthrough right you guys
asked there's questions we can answer
questions we did not answer in this yeah
and let us know what you want us to
cover in the next one and we will catch
you in that next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
