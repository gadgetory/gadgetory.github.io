TechnoBuffalo here they say the
essential needs our food and water for
the mobile traveler and the geeks among
us its food water and data and now we
have another way to get some mobile data
this is thus wireless 4g LTE mike by
long name 4110 el intelligent mobile
hotspot by novatel wireless this is a 4G
mifi device running on verizon's LTE
network let's go ahead and dig it
so what you're thinking yay he's
unboxing am I five but there's actually
a decent amount to see here as opposed
to other mifi devices that I'll bring in
and of course most importantly we will
be doing speed tests with all the mifi
devices that are roaming the
TechnoBuffalo labs so stay tuned for
that video so here is the device itself
in the box from a plane standpoint fifty
bucks is going to get you five gigs of
data ten dollars over per gig or eighty
bucks is going to double that to 10 gigs
of data at that same ten dollars overage
this is sent by the folks at verizon to
review your g sim card so weird to see
Verizon with a sim card I assume it's
they probably already installed it which
they did and here it is a little bit
thicker than other mifi devices that
we've seen but there's a lot of good
stuff that happens here that we haven't
seen it on some of these 4G LTE devices
and kick that off to the side for just a
minute I said well we're going to have
him here is some information a charger
in a USB and we do it charges via micro
USB which is great and you also have a
little bit of a cleaning cloth or a bag
for it take a real quick with which this
is and you can keep your device clean i
guess microfiber cloth to hold it okay
so push all that business off to the
side and let's take a look at the device
itself now this is the second mifi
device in verizon's lineup they've
launched a Samsung device a little while
ago about three weeks ago we'll take a
look at this here to see what the
differences are you trying to decide
which one might be right for you the
novotel variety so the one that we just
opened up is a little bit fatter and a
little bit longer but you are going to
get full status indicators here on top
let me go ahead and kick this on and
i'll tell you a little bit more about
the device all i do that i'll see if it
has any power so the green light is on
so this guy can do a lot of goodness
verizon is saying it's going to get a
typical download speeds assuming you're
in a 4g area a 5 to 12 megabits per
second and up of 225 you can connect up
to five Wi-Fi enabled
at one time which is kind of neat a slim
compact size all that business battery
usage up to five hours auto shut off for
30 minute timer by default he actually
charged this while you're using it as
well so you can plug it right into your
computer and get ready to rock and this
does have a 3g fall back so it appears
it's boot it up one of the nice things
about this guy you can actually see your
signal strength with the other device
you only knew if you're on 4G or not
depending on the LED indicator light
with this you can actually see whether
or not you've got a 4g signal and right
in my office 4G tanks to go in and out
if I go outside I get a pretty decent 4g
signal all right so you guys didn't see
this but if you ever saw the movie
Zoolander when he spends a few minutes
trying to smack the imac to get the
files out of the computer that's sort of
what i just spent doing here at the mifi
hitting it trying to get it to work I
hadn't realized that the sim card that
was praying solving here was actually
installed upside down before I finally
got to see a signal strength which you
get right there I here and have your
battery and it's also going to tell you
how many users are connected by those
little dots hopefully you can see that
on the screen there's just one user
connected right here what you're not
going to want to see is that purple
color light which just means you're
connected to 3g what you're going to
want to see is green green is going to
mean you're connected to 4g as soon as I
step outside of my office I got very
strong 4g signal as I mentioned but
inside here not so strong so it tends to
turn on or off I'll be stepping outside
and doing a full 4g speed test of this
device and I'll compare it head-to-head
with the other mifi in verizon stable so
if you get one of these and the SIM
cards already installed note to self go
ahead and check it out to make sure it
is installed properly it's very easy to
connect to one of these on the back my
thumb's covering up there just sticker
there that tells you what the Wi-Fi
network is and the password and you can
login to the IP address actually give
you directions in this mastery or advice
book to login and change the password
very easily it's actually right on the
last page if you end up picking one of
these up that's how you're going to do
it you're going to want to go to HTTP
colon slash slash 19
Oh point one six eight dot one dot one
and that'll let you change the network
name and the password something that
you're going to remember that's not a
ten long numerical code so this is the
mifi 4G LTE the novotel variety for
Verizon Wireless this is a long winded
and boxing but you guys know that's how
I do I love to hear myself talk I hope
you guys enjoy it and again we'll be
doing full speed tests here coming up is
4g mifi something that you're interested
in would you use it if you do a lot of
traveling it's probably going to be
something that's a lifesaver this of
course obviously has 3g fallback if you
can tell by that violet blinking light
or purple blinking light depending on
what color you wanted to have so you do
sort of get the best of both worlds and
should that ever turn green and you're
rocking a 4g signal you'll be getting
very very very fast speeds I know when I
was at CES last year in vegas where 4g
was alive and well i was pulling down
upwards of 16 megabits per second which
was awesome anyway guys i'm jon
rettinger technobuffalo and i'll see you
the next video
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
