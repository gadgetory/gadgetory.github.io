from TechnoBuffalo and the world of
hi-fi audio is one that is very
intimidating and very expensive but it
has been one that has interested me very
recently so today I want to bring you
guys a video covering a couple hi-fi
audio products and what the best way
might be to upgrade from your standard
audio setup to get higher quality sound
and music but before we get to new the
products the first thing you're going to
want to address is the source of your
music so if you're a video maker or a
music maker music producer something
you're making your own stuff you don't
have to worry about this you're working
with raw high-quality files already but
if like the most of us you're consuming
music you want to use a service like
title or something where you can stream
hi-5 music there are other ways to get
if a title is the easiest in the most
accessible way you just pay the
membership download the app and you're
pretty good to go once you have that
high-quality music source the first part
I want to talk about is a pool audio wa7
fireflies the general idea here is that
you have higher quality components with
the DAC and the amp as well a DAC is a
digital to analog converter you're going
to find them pretty much all of your
devices that output sound every device
the outputs sound it converts that
digital musical file into an analog
waveform that you can actually listen to
so when you go with things like wa7
you're getting much higher quality
components and do a much better job of
that conversion giving you better
separation in the sound giving a clearer
sound profile rather than a compressed
muddled file the characteristic of the
specific vacuum tube amps on the wa7 are
going to give you a bit of a warmer
sound some of the effect you kind of get
with vinyl that people like slightly
warmer acoustic feeling and tone and
sound profile and the last two things I
like about the WH seven are that it
works with one cable single USB to plug
in you have other plug-in options like
the RCA input and others but the USB was
the simplest cleanest for me and how
good it looks on your desk is an
incredibly well designed piece of
hardware and it doesn't interfere at all
with my desk setup visually from an
aesthetic point of view
once you've outputted your hi-fi sound
through your wa7 you're going to need
either speakers or headphones to play
through the headphones I want to
recommend for this video of the
Sennheiser HD 650 s these are
tried-and-true have been around the
market forever and been widely regarded
- some of the best headphones you can
get under $1000 they are open-back
headphones so if you're not into
open-back and having the ambient sound
mixed
don't get these but for me they're much
more comfortable over long periods
because you get better air ventilation
so my ears aren't sweating like crazy
the headphones themselves are very
comfortable have an incredibly wide
frequency response so you're going to
get the lows of lows and the highs of
highs and if you want a slight
alternative you can check out the
Sennheiser HD 6xx
these are a pair of headphones the
Sennheiser did with massive drop these
were limited release only but they were
the exact same internals as the HD 650 s
cheaper and they were slightly
redesigned so you can get a hold of
those good for you those might be a
great option as well if carrying around
the wa7 isn't really an option for you
which it shouldn't be it's not portable
at all you're going to want to get a
portable hi-fi audio player some of them
aren't so portable but the one we found
that we liked was a very portable one at
the Ashland Kern a k70 so we're out at
the gate this product is very very well
designed very well built very solid
feeling in the hand has a high-quality
dock and high-quality amp and it's going
to really help step up your game if you
listen to music on your phone or
something like that before one of the
downsides is it doesn't come with
something like Android built-in so
getting high-five music onto your device
is going to be a little bit harder you
can't just download the title app and
just stream from it or go offline you're
going to have to find a workaround but
once you do that this device is
fantastic for on-the-go high-quality
listening and so that's pretty much it
for this video guys those are sort of
rough overviews of all three of these
products they're all very very good
tried true and tested over years if you
want to see a more in-depth look from us
into any of these specific products or
in hi-fi audio in general and to how
some of the technicalities work and what
makes it back good what makes an amp
good and all that good stuff let us know
in the comments down below and we'll do
a more in depth video I'm Ron Frieda
