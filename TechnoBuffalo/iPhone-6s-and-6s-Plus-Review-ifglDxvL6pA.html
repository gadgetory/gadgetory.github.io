iPhone reviews like a family gathering
for most people either you can't wait
you count down the days or you just
loathe every single minute of it these
reviews are fun for me to do because
they are so polarizing this year we've
got the iPhone 6s in the iPhone 6s plus
just like looking at these two things
you think they are identical to last
year's models I'm going to focus on
what's new what isn't it ultimately
answer the question would I buy them
Apple says the only thing that changes
everything
right I'm Jen right here from
TechnoBuffalo this is our review of the
iPhone 6s and the iPhone 6s plus as I do
with all my reviews let me start with a
disclaimer I use these guys for 10 days
on AT&amp;amp;T testing both 128 gigabyte 6s
plus and a 64 gig 6s Todd I did a
written review use his plus for 10 days
an 18 t as well if I want to see more of
anything I'm going to talk about camera
samples just more detail hit the link
down below and check out the full
written review so obviously a lot to
talk about with these phones but I'm
going to break it into five categories
help semis kind of everything that goes
into these devices talk about hardware
software camera battery and I'll give
that conclusion at the end so let's
start with hardware Apple doesn't
typically change the design of its S
models traditionally relying on under
the hood upgrades and sticking with
thinner lighter faster mantra which
oddly is not true this time around
although they are definitely faster the
iPhone 6s plus an iPhone 6s measures
just a hair large and last year's models
difference is so non-existent that cases
for last year's phones are still going
to fit these models the weight is a
little different here as well the iPhone
6s plus weighs six point seven seven
ounces up from 6.0 seven ounces from
last year and the iPhone 6s weighs 5.0
four ounces up from 4.5 5 ounces to last
year it's noticeable once use it for a
couple days not going to notice anymore
after that so that's really it for
change as you can see or I guess changes
you can feel the rest of the upgrades
are pretty much under the hood the
exception of things like the fingerprint
reader which is now twice as fast or the
camera which I was 50% more megapixels
up to 12 instead of eight I'll be
Cantley discern any of those things just
by looking at the phone at least my eyes
can't
speaking of touch ID though it is
very very fast I never thought last gens
was slow but this one is way quicker
sometimes I take out in my pocket I
think er just grazes the home button its
unlocks this is the best fingerprint
reader I've ever used any device
it's instantaneous and very very quick
so iPhones have never had cutting-edge
hardware mostly because they haven't
needed it Apple's got the whole thing of
vertically integrated controller
hardware and the software generally make
and user experience very fast despite
not having the latest specs but Apple
stepping up the game a little bit this
year oh now I've doubled the RAM in
these phones up to two gigs packed
inside that's a subtle change blends can
make a huge difference from developers
start taking advantage of it the new a9
chip is also on board making sure
graphics and computing prowess are also
improved I'll talk more about
performance of these in the software
section but other than that save for the
new rose gold color option Apple left
well enough alone so next let's talk
about software iOS 9 is obviously
available on other phones and just the
plus and the 6s I'm gonna focus on what
these phones bring with iOS 9 you can't
get on other phones the big mammoth
jammer here's 3d touch but I've heard it
referred to as forced touch it lets you
press deeper into icons bringing up new
menus it's not the same as the long
press which I know folks have been
noting that androids had for years also
side note iOS has also had it for years
as well apples broken up what you can do
with 3d touch into peak and pop you can
pick into an app and you can pop right
into it other notable things it can do
can execute live photos by long-pressing
you'll see photos start to come to life
but I really found myself taking
advantage of most those 3d touch
functionality primarily because it's
only Apple's first party apps that are
supporting it a lot of people have
called this a game changer and maybe it
will be in the long run developers are
taking advantage of the new feature but
it didn't feel that amazing to me not to
say that it won't be this promise quote
game changer developers just need time
take advantage of it something that will
definitely talk more about I promise
it's also new here is the always-on and
no longer needs to be tethered hey Siri
I probably just turned like half your
phone's on with this face Todd found it
really worked for him but for me it
calls her up every time it just said our
answers are really what I needed and
mostly just opened up a web search Siri
is definitely better here
but it's still lagging behind Google now
they promised to talk about this the
extra RAM the a9 diffic the phones feel
faster doing everyday tasks opening up a
Safari page for example it's quicker
once developers start taking advantage
of the extra horsepower I'd imagine the
gaming and overall app advantage over
previous models will be huge but it's
going to take some time next let's talk
about the ever important camera
megapixels have been upped from 8 to 12
and it's great not just in the it's the
best camera you have is when you have on
you type sense the pictures it takes are
awesome after using these guys for the
better part of week and a half I can
trust it most of the time my images are
going to come out really crisp with
accurate colors this was true in almost
all situations in a darker restaurant or
out in the park or even just shooting
around the house indoors or in the
office the new front-facing flash it
really just takes advantage of the
display to provide extra light for
selfies is pretty good to give hard time
telling difference between front-facing
and rear-facing camera we're just
looking at it on your phone if you want
to see gallery samples I hit the link
down below to check that out a written
review if you also want to see versus
for how the cameras compared versus last
gen well link to that as well and you
can just judge for yourself focusing for
me was very quick on both phones but
Todd did have some issues pulling focus
also live photos are neat I can't think
of a better word to describe them
they're neat then they're kind of fun
most of the time Apple Records
additional 1.5 seconds of content before
and after you snap a photo bringing the
image to light finger camera rolls so to
speak this is not an implementation here
though we've seen it at Nokia Lumia
camera on Windows Phone they offered you
the identical feature HTC Zoe were also
very similar as a side note though live
photos can be viewed on older iPhones
they didn't tell you that my son's
birthday was last weekend and I was
shooting pictures with my iPhone 6s plus
and my wife wanted to see them to
airdrop them to her and if I just held
down on her screen I could play those
live photos on her last gen phone so I
don't bear that in mind my problem
Apple's implementation of live photos
that I almost forgot about the last 1.5
seconds of the photos that means if I
played it back there was anything
important to see is mostly me just
putting it back in my pocket so if you
want to use it it's remember that it's
there and take advantage of it while
taking your pictures toggling on and off
is pretty easy just hit that little
yellow button you can decide for
yourself but bear in mind if you do
decide to turn it on
it's going to take up twice the space on
your phone also new here and I'd be
remiss not to mention it is 4k now I've
long criticized Apple phones for not
taking advantage of 4k although can't
see the 4k footage is going to look like
inch resolution on your devices but if
you want to play 4k content back on your
4k capable TV it's here and it can shoot
on the phone and the footage does look
great alright next let's talk about
battery the one factor at least for me
is more important than any other on this
phone the good news
despite being slightly smaller in the
milliamp hour Department battery life is
almost identical to last year's phones
which means it's good my use case
generally I don't have auto brightness
from donek up my brightness usually set
to around 75% although a weird software
bug three times while testing the phone
brightness would shoot itself all the
way up to full brightness I don't know
why I did it maybe it's a just a ghost
of the machine but it did happen
but with brightness at 75% phone off the
charger maybe around 7:30 7 o'clock
depending on when my son decides to to
wake me up
about 2 hours of calling some really
heavy social media a lot of this this
action happening viewing back YouTube
videos playing games I generally put
this guy back on the charger around 11
o'clock at night with about 55 percent
battery life so plenty of battery on the
6s plus apartment and with the smaller
iPhone 6s generally about 35% it's about
15 or so percent difference between the
two but both will easily get you through
one day probably easily get you through
two days if you turn down the brightness
or just set it to auto so battery life
very good alright so what's the verdict
on these phones are they the best
iPhones Apple's ever made yeah of course
they are but that should be obvious the
flagship change here is 3d touch and I
don't think it's gonna have widespread
developer support for conservatively
let's say about three months at that
point it's already 25% of the way
through its 12-month lifecycle I do
think 3d touch though is going to be a
game changer it's just not changing
anything today developers need time the
camera is awesome battery life is
stellar but is that enough
this gets a bye / wait from us by for
switching from Android are using a 5s or
older iPhone
it'll be a gigantic upgrade for you but
if you're honest
6 or 6 plus I would wait for the 7 by
that point 3 touch level widespread
support developers are turning out
awesome app taking advantage of the
extra RAM and horsepower and they get
the fun of a brand new design so do you
guys think about the iPhone 6s and the
iPhone 6s plus worth the upgrade not
worth the upgrade did you preorder are
you using your phones and loving it or
you're getting your decisions love to
hear your thoughts on it even the
comments down below and be nice to each
other you guys something likes different
phone than you doesn't make them a bad
person or a stupid person just just bear
that bear that in mind and I think you
guys for watching until next time from
Jon Ranger from TechnoBuffalo see you
