TechnoBuffalo here with an unboxing of
the latest to come from Nvidia this is
the brand-new Tegra notes it is the
first tablet to launch with NVIDIA Tegra
note platform there's a ton of suppose
it awesomeness here including what I
hear is one of the best stylus has ever
on a tablets put it to the test though
and see what it looks like alright so
here is the box for the Tegra note made
by EVGA a company more known for their
graphics card then perhaps tablets but
we'll see what they've got here so all
the spectra on the box but that's no fun
we're gonna go through them all take a
look at everything here it says on the
back faster is everything creative
freedom and photo magic this platform
the Tegra note platforms got a ton of
tricks up its sleeve
which we'll talk about so let's go ahead
and pull the tablet itself out of the
box and there it is
7-inch tablets and it looks very much
like a 7-inch tablet it's got front
facing speakers which we'll talk about
which I really look when tablets do that
and phones have that I've always made no
sense saying this because either rear
face and you're coming out on the side
or they get blocked so see how the
sounds sounds on that definitely a
aggressive looking tablet the Tegra note
branding right there and some cool
design cues turn that off to the side
we've got Quick Start Guide for getting
started slowly else we're gonna have in
here pull off the top and I assume we've
got just a charging cable in here and
that is indeed wall wart charge cable
that is about it let's take a look at
the tablet there's a lot to talk about
here I will power it on while we start
discussing so we're looking at here is
of course Tegra for mobile processor so
that's up to 1.8 gigahertz that's
actually four cores plus one it's pretty
impressive platform it's a seven inch
screen with a 1280 by 800 resolution
it's IPS in case you were wondering it's
got a rear facing five megapixel camera
and there's a lot to talk about about
that camera it's got a gig of ram 16
gigs internal but you do have a micro SD
card slot and if you notice it is stock
Android No
skiing nothing as stuff Android 4.2.2
4.3 is coming in an update December and
there's a lot of other stuff coming in
that update a or 211 a B gene and a
Bluetooth 4.0 it's got a battery that's
going to last it supposedly pretty
decent hour time for ten hours of
playback it's a fifteen point one seven
watt hour battery let me go ahead and
get through the whole setup rod signal
talk a bit more about the tablet we got
this guy all powered up we are looking
at totally stock Android with the Tegra
zone and some other pre-installed apps
we will get to scroll down to the bottom
go to about tablet Android 4.2.2 all
updates will come over the air directly
from Nvidia so a few things that might
look interesting how about that icon
right there if you're an iOS user you're
gonna know what that is it is camera
awesome which has been one of the more
popular camera apps for iOS it is
launching exclusively on the Tegra note
at least initially it'll come to other
Android platforms later so this tablet
does a couple cool things you've never
seen before it's the first tablet to
feature kind of always-on HDR so what
that's gonna do is you're gonna be able
to see HDR in real time
that would come with the Android 4.3
update sometime in December so I can't
show that to you but whenever that is
here and working you'll be able to see
an HDR shot on your display without
having to wait snap a couple pictures
process the image and then show you what
it looks like we want to take HDR video
and HDR pictures and burst mode and see
if that's gonna look like right on the
screen it's probably one of the things
I'm really excited about so it also has
something they're calling direct stylus
I'll pull that out right from the bottom
and this is supposedly one of the best
styluses ever at least according to an
video when we got our pre-briefing so
this appears to go ahead and hit okay
we've got a Tegra note draw go ahead and
it closed and it's got the pressure
sensitivity so if you tapped lightly
it'll draw a light line if you push
harder you get a thicker line if you
turn it around something like a
calligraphy pen are you getting even
thicker line you can see the trafficking
is actually pretty good but all you use
it for taking notes and see I think work
and we'll cover that and we do our full
review it's also got a cool lasso
feature for screenshots and stuff if you
want to just snap an image to go and
take a picture directly of that so go
ahead and examine that put the style is
back in its style this house another
cool feature on the camera is a
have to track this is for video so I
always kind of made fun of folks that
use their tablets for taking pictures
and video but this is one I might
actually use so what this is gonna do
essentially it'll track something in a
video so let's say you're at a soccer
game two kids playing soccer you can tap
your kid and they'll track him or her as
they play didn't they go out of frame
and come back in they'll start to track
them again so a lot of really neat
things in here too I also can do with
slow-mo at 100 frames per second also
has support for NVIDIA Tegra for
supported external controller so kind of
neat here so tour of a tablet we've got
these pretty beastly looking
front-facing speakers we've got a
front-facing camera which is VGA and a
rear facing five megapixel camera that
we should be talked about that's where
your stylus is going to live
we've got your power button three four
and five millimeter headset jack HDMI
out and charging port volume and then
expandable storage slot which is sort of
oddly left open I thought any sort of
cover for it so further accessories
gonna come with this we've got the Tegra
note slide cover go ahead and pop this
out of the box see what it looks like I
mean interesting thing about this as
well as a price point coming in at you
know just under 200 bucks
doesn't make a pretty incredible value
buy I feel it go ahead and slide that on
looks like it actually slides down and
in to connect it's not as much do you
think is magnetic but that will connect
and you can use it to prop your tablet
up if you choose so that is the note
slide cover so about time you guys watch
this video already I spent a couple days
with the device we had it under embargo
so love first impressions up and a for
review and ever we feel we are ready any
questions on the Tegra note powered by
