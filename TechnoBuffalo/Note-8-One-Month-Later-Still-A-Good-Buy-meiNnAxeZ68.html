note 8 came out and I've been using as
my daily driver for three of those weeks
and then in conjunction with an iPhone
II plus I've got a good sense of the
phone I know it's nuances I know what
makes it hum and purr and my opinions
have changed a little bit from our
review so I thought I'd revisit the
galaxy note and you haven't picked one
up
and maybe help you decide whether or not
you should and if you bought one perhaps
or perhaps not justify your purchase so
let's start with the good on the no date
holy moly that's 6.3 inch screen is
still absolutely beautiful there
sometimes I look at the screen and I'm
still shocked that it's actually on a
mobile device it looks like a sticker
the screen is absolutely beautiful black
levels are really black it hasn't been
as good that would like in direct
sunlight
I usually don't keep out of brightness
on on my phones but I had to keep it on
on the note 8 so I can see it in direct
sunlight it kicks all the way up to max
brightness so if use your phone outdoors
all the time you might be disappointed
in the screen but if most of your usage
is like indoors you're gonna be really
happy with the screen so I didn't use
the edge panels at all and surprising to
me if initial review was I didn't really
use a pairing either and that was a big
thing for gonna do the review because
when I did it for that first week I used
it all the time and part of me just
stopped doing the top and bottom o
testing just using one app at a time I
was a disappointed myself that I didn't
that I didn't use that pairing then I
remembered and Abaco I should probably
use that and I just forget about it
again so as much as I thought that's
gonna be a reason to perhaps by the no
date again perhaps sheer laziness or
forgetfulness I did not use it as much
as I thought I was going to and speaking
of not using as much as I thought the S
Pen that's a big reason why a lot of
people get the note devices they wanted
the functionality of the pen I probably
only use a pen maybe ten times
throughout my month but it was really
handy to have it those ten times and
despite not using the s-pen I always
liked knowing it was there it's kind of
like a safety net I started using it a
lot at the beginning take notes and
meetings and then graduate so I just
stopped using it like anything sort of
over time but having it for shopping
lists having if annotating screenshots
having it for drawing mustaches on
pictures of mark and Ralph
we're
helpful I didn't find myself making many
gifs or animated pictures on his often
as I thought I was going to but I really
liked having the safety net of the s-pen
I know that's kind of doesn't make that
much sense I didn't use it but I like
having it I don't know perhaps I'll use
it more as I keep using the phone but I
was shocked that I didn't use it as much
as I thought I was going to but what I
didn't use more than I thought I was
going to was the camera so these cameras
are absolute incredible we covered him
at length in the review the portrait
mode is absolutely beautiful on here and
I used that a tremendous amount I love
this camera in every situation that I
took pictures in they always look good
whether it was sort of low-light shots
whether not I was in broad daylight
outside at the park wherever pictures
always looked good next to the camera
it's still that fingerprint sensor and
listen I read the comments you guys
think I'm over blowing the location of
fingerprint reader you think oh you put
a case on it and you could find it well
I don't have a case on this
I got a dragon skin deep brand skin on
the back because the black one is a
fingerprint magnet which coincidentally
if you want to check out will link to it
down below back fingerprint reader is a
joke to me I never use it when I can
find it with my finger it doesn't work
all that often I find myself using the
facial scanner and the iris unlock more
than I used a fingerprint reader but
perhaps that's a testament to how many
different options you got to unlock your
phone if you don't like the location of
that or you're left-handed it's hard to
find there are other options but I hope
for the next-gen for the s9 they move it
somewhere or get rid of it
to put it somewhere I can reach it and
you can yell at me again in in the
comments the 3300 milliamp hour battery
my thoughts on battery life it's kind of
the same for the review it's good I can
get through a full day which is what
matters I wish I could get through like
a day and a half for a day of heavy
usage or day of video streaming I do
like having a fast charging that's nice
to plug in for 10 or 15 minutes but the
fact that I can just put it on a
wireless charger I'm sitting on my
office really alleviates for me a lot of
battery concerns other intangibles I
love about the phone always-on display I
still really like so before you guys
tell me that Samsung pay is the same as
Apple pay and Android pay it does the
same stuff with an extra trick in
terminals that don't
except tap the payments so don't take
NFC Samsung pay will still work it'll
put out a magnetic fields like your
credit card you just hold the next two
terminal making it work almost anywhere
so I still really like having Samsung
pay on here the phone is still fast I
don't know if it's psychosomatic because
the extra 2 gigs of ram versus the s8
plus 60 grams is nice probably not
necessary but though I never had any
slowdowns there any stutters I didn't
have through of OS lag and some people
claim Samsung has in fact I really like
the software that Samsung has on a
device now I wish that or you already
who knows when that's gonna come if you
want the latest software updates you're
gonna want to look at the pixel 2 but if
you want a phone that's a really overall
good package that's got decent enough
battery life and incredible camera a
beautiful screen brap some poorly placed
fingerprint reader on the back a lot of
other options to unlock your phone get
the no date I can still absolutely
recommend in the note 8 so if you
haven't tried it try it if you're
thinking about switching just do it
their deals to be had right now it's an
incredible phone perhaps my favorite
device out there what do you guys think
about the Galaxy Note 8 to echo your
sentiments you guys gonna yelling about
the fingerprint reader I want to know
your thoughts in the comments down below
so next time I'm John render from
