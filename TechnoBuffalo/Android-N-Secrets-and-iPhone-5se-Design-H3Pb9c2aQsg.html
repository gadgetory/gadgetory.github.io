from technobuffalo it is a gorgeous day
in sunny Southern California makes me
want to be outside and talk some rumors
today it's all about Android n and the
next new iphone it's not the iphone 7
the very silly seemingly named iphone 5s
e or something along those lines let's
start with Android n a good friend
android police unearth a few images of a
seemingly innocuous bluetooth settings
screen and if you look at it it looks
like every other bluetooth settings for
that we've seen but Steve that delicious
looking a hamburger icon what that is
supposedly going to do is open up a side
menu that let you access the other
settings instead of jumping back going
to settings and running back again make
things a little bit simpler but it's a
sign of things to come with Android and
other things I expect to see with
Android and split view multicast and
finally and Google's even hinted that
they might get rid of the app drawer in
a way to streamline the UI I'm hoping
that just a vicious horrible disgusting
rumor we don't know yet when and
rihanna's going to be called with CEO
sundar Pichai said they might open up to
a poll that people vote on what android
ends going to be but i'm just saying it
right now nutella it's delicious goes on
everything kind of like android we
shouldn't have more about android end
though at Google i/o towards the end of
May next let's jump over to Apple and
the iphone 5s seems at this point is
like taxes no it's coming we don't quite
know what it's going to be let's add two
more rumors to the mix coming from on
leaks himself from shared schematics of
two alleged design options that Apple
was supposedly considering for the
iphone 5s see both look eerily similar
to the current gen iphone 6 and 6s which
conflicts with other rumors we've seen I
say the phone's gonna look like an
iPhone 5s Annie schematic you can see
it's are the curved rounded edges of the
iphone 6 and success you can expect a
pretty powerful a 9 chip touch ID to
being bored I will not expect though to
see 3d touch on there so no force touch
for you folks of course support for
apple pie and the rest of the things you
can expect from a modern gen iphone what
we do kinda know at least have a better
idea but when we're gonna see this guy
and that date is March fifteenth but
we'll see
debut alongside the next gen ipad air
the appropriately named ipad air three
so what do you guys think iPads iPhones
Android and what are you excited about
up to your thoughts on it and does
anybody even care about a lower price
iphone at this point the iphone 5c was
not the hit Apple expected but perhaps
this one will be the home run that the
company needs I know what do you guys
think video a thumbs up we always
appreciate it the next time i'm jon
rettinger hey guys next to you okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
