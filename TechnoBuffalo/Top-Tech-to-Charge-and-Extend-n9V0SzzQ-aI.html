TechnoBuffalo and I'm back with another
episode of cool tech but today the tech
is going to be sort of under the radar
cooled or not blatantly awesome things
but they're extremely useful and they
should improve your day to day life
let's go and get started so first off we
have the tp-link Wi-Fi range extender
the AC 1200 I'm sure we've all been in
that position where you're sitting in a
certain corner of your house you're
pissed off because you're not getting
good Netflix feed and it's messing up
your house of cards time this is going
to be the solution for that what's cool
about the tp-link one specifically is
that it comes with an app called Casa
which helps you set up the Wi-Fi
extender and place it in the most prime
positions for the best Wi-Fi signal so
that takes the guesswork out of where
you're going to place it I also just
like the minimal design of the tp-link
so you can sort of hide it in a nook
cranny crevice and it's not this huge
thing that's sort of taking up space or
blocking other plug points however there
are other options out there so if you
want to compare and contrast I highly
recommend you do that first next we have
the anchor powerhouse compact not so
compact
400 watt output portable generator
alternative it's a giant battery that's
basically this is the Hulk's idea of a
portable battery and you can plug pretty
much anything into it that you need I
don't know what the day-to-day
practicality with something like this is
but it's definitely a great sort of
earthquake backup solution if you really
need power over your phone or your
laptop or something like that
it also seems like a great solution if
you're going camping but I guess if
you're going camping you're trying to go
off the grid then again if you're doing
some new-age camping with tech go pick
this up and last but not least we have
the Logitech base for the iPad pro so
this is essentially a charging dock for
both the twelve point nine inch and nine
point seven inch iPad pro it charges
through the smart connectors and that
was the big debate that we had at the
office is that whether or not this is
actually Wireless because sure there's
no wires but it's still making contact
points it's not quite like qi wireless
charging but it's definitely a weird one
that being said let me know what you
think in the comments down below is this
or is this not wireless charging I'm
very curious to hear either way it works
pretty well
the iPads gonna sit at a 70 degree angle
so that looks pretty good and it charges
from zero to a hundred and about
seven hours so sadly it's not that quick
and I'm sure Drake would be very
disappointed but that's what you get
when you're using the smart connectors
it's made of aluminum so build quality
feels great and overall it's a very
solid product however something to note
is that you're gonna need your iPad
charger to plug into the wall you can't
run it off of anything lower powered
like plugging into a USB port on your
computer or something is just not gonna
charge that way so that might be a
limitation for some of you but maybe
just a note to think of before buying it
and so that's really it for this episode
of cool tech let me know in the comments
down below what you guys think of these
three products and what other types of
products you want to see us cover in the
near future we love getting your guys
feedback give us a thumbs up if you

tech content like this in the near

I'll see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
