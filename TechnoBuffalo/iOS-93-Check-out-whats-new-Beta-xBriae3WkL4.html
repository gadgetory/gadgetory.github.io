TechnoBuffalo here Apple earlier this
week took the wraps of iOS 9.3 so I
thought I'd download it install it and
run through everything you can expect
when you finally hit that over-the-air
download button let's go ahead and start
with flux sorry nightshift mode now what
that's going to do it's going to reduce
the blue light emissions from your
device which studies have shown I have a
real deep impact on circadian rhythm so
it can help cause insomnia which I
showed myself or from such it's gonna
eliminate the blue light and shift it to
more of a yellow hue looks pretty in
yellow Apple now is finally adding 3d
touch and quick actions almost all their
first party apps which arguably should
have been there from day one on the
iPhone 6s and 6s plus for example the
apps that now get 3d touch include
weather settings compass and health
there's also quick action options for
the App Store and iTunes Store probably
my favorite update though the App Store
at quick action now includes update all
to make life a lot easier
notes got arguably the most useful
update though there's a new option to
use touch ID or a password to protect
notes within the Notes app itself when
you flip the sucker on notes is gonna
ask for either the user's password or
fingerprint when opening there's also
options now in settings to organize
notes by date edited date created or
titles if you store passwords and notes
are the personal information you cannot
keep those lock down and secure the news
app is also getting some updates Apple's
made it more customizable for the person
that's actually looking at it the for
you section for example now includes
trending topics and Pacific pics from
Apple themselves help you better
discover content the content they want
you to discover at least also included
is a new landscape you for notes on the
iPhone to let you have inline video
playback the health apps also getting in
on the updates when viewing the weight
workouts and sleep categories health and
out links too after you can download the
allow you to track all of this data with
the combo of iOS 9.3 and watch OS 2.2
the iPhone can help prepare with more
than one app to watch so you can just
punky brewster it up and have like four
Apple watches and just one phone you'll
be good wallet also got some updates
when using Apple pay for example there's
now an option to open an app that's
linked to a pass or credit card let's
say you've using the united app you've
got a boarding pass there a new icons
gonna show up that's gonna open the
united app whatever tap you don't have
to close the app find the app that you
want to open and go back and forth
carplay is also getting in on the
updates apple music for example now has
new and for you sections to help with
music discovery maps also has an update
now
bethe 9.3 it's been provides you better
information on what's nearby things like
restaurants and gas stations will be
just a lot easier to find so what do you
guys think about 9.3 is there a killer
feature you've been waiting for in iOS
is it another bland update up to your
thoughts on out leave in the comments
down below good video a thumbs up always
appreciate it until next time I am John
Ryan Jeffrey TechnoBuffalo thought the
guy's next video
time for some Elmo's World do I don't
know the alphabet
Apple music ends it's a blessing and a
curse and now they'll yell on the back
at us
we're like play cheered you boogie
serious and I was gonna have options to
discover more more music that's gonna
annoy us</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
