from TechnoBuffalo heareth and unboxing
i am really excited about this is the
BlackBerry Bold 9900 the newest flagship
from rim for those of you that follow me
on YouTube or check me out on Twitter at
John 4 Lakers you know that I have been
a pretty happy blackberry user for the
better part of just about three months
so I'm looking forward to replacing my
97-80 with this 9900 and putting it
through of course all its paces so I'm
as excited as you are I have never held
one of these guys before let's go ahead
and rip it open this is of course a
retail purchase unit it comes from
Rogers it's a Canadian carrier this is
an unlocked unit I had our own John
Quach scouring Canada to find one for me
and he sent that along with this
well Angry Birds piggy so John thanks to
you this is of course going to be coming
to all major US carriers AT&amp;amp;T and
t-mobile as a 9900 and Verizon and
Sprint as the 9930 but it should look
pretty close to identical obviously the
packaging is gonna look different on US
carriers got some French here you're not
gonna have and all kinds of other stuff
telling it's a blackberry bold great
let's go ahead and pull off the Box
pretty typical blackberry stuff black
box
I think it's been opened so they could
unlock it the tape oh maybe not nope
tape has been broken some of the top
slides on or if it pulls open so it
comes off and boom there we have the
BlackBerry Bold 9900 I'll put it off to
the side and we'll run through some
specs and see what else you're going to
get in the box
it's really stuck in there tight well
it's kind of prettiest you'll do it
we'll talk about that in just a minute
weird to see a Rogers branding here on
the phone I don't generally review or
check out Rogers branded phones so we
are going to get inside of this here box
I'm guessing some user guides there's
that business I'm never going to look at
user guides cleaning cloth and a pair of
stereo headphones with I think a
microphone let's take a look just look
like they even is a microphone on here
yep there's a microphone so you're going
to get that
all right so enough of that box that's
not exciting its power through this
stuff pretty quickly you're going to
have a pouch carrying case so if you
want to carry this thing on your belt
and look kind a tool ish a or
super-professional depending on what
your definition is you're going to have
that option here is the battery we're
going to need that got your wall charger
simple two prong wall charger and then
your syncing cable two micro USB blah
blah blah enough of that stuff let's go
ahead and talk about the phone itself
the 9900 this guy's been rumored for
quite a while a bold touch has been high
on everybody's want list that is a
blackberry fan certainly that number is
dwindling day by day so what do we got
here with the BlackBerry Bold 9900 we
have a bigger two point eight inch
screen that is now a touchscreen with an
improved resolution of 640 by 480 it's
now got a pretty modern processor a
relatively modern at least by trim
standards a 1.2 gigahertz Qualcomm built
Snapdragon chip 786 megabytes of RAM you
can see the 5 megapixel camera right
there with LED flash and I can shoot
720p video that's 1280 by 720 the
battery is smaller than expected one of
rims newer smaller thinner batteries it
is up size 1230 milliamp hours so you
get in track it's the jm1 battery which
is totally going to give you 6 point 3
hours of talktime at 307 hours of
standby time weighs 4.5 9 ounces and
it's got 8 gigabytes of storage
internally and of course micro sd I pull
off the back here but this back pops off
there's some tricks hidden under here
that is where the NFC your radio lives
and that is near-field communications so
you're going to have that battery will
pop right on in go ahead and slide the
battery on it will actually pop in my
SIM card - I will come back in just a
moment alright so before I pop in a SIM
card and make this marriage official
let's take a look at the outgoing model
here is the BlackBerry Bold 97-80 you
can definitely see a clear difference
here this sort of harkens back to the
it's got a new sort of brushed aluminum
strip across the side of it which is
sort of a new thing for blackberry
keyboard here is markedly larger I
believe it's about six percent bigger
even that original bold certainly it's
marketed lis larger though than the
97-80 it's got a bit higher quality feel
to it I wouldn't have tested the
keyboard yet certainly you can see the
keys now are all one color as opposed to
the colors that we have here larger
screen we stack these little guys on top
make a blackberry sandwich you can see
the size difference
the 9900 though is the thinnest
blackberry and definitely see the
thinness there all right so let's go
ahead and pop in a SIM card I should let
you know this does not come with a micro
SD card in there so a key good bytes is
what you're going to get that's the
internal storage you can up that
certainly 240 with a 32 gigabyte card or
whatever increments of cards you want to
pop on into your BlackBerry let's go
ahead and power this guy on alright so
I'm about to pop the battery in here
just for fun I'm gonna put the battery
into the 97-80 as well we'll see how
both do from a cold boot certainly this
one's got programs installed on it and
they haven't been clean and wiped in
insults not a scientific test just if
you want to see how much quicker boot up
time is there's my SIM card it's a it's
actually cut and it's in the housing of
a bigger SIM card so you can actually
use the bigger card that you cut out to
make a micro SIM as a nice little damp
kind of a neat little trick alright go
ahead and pop this in we'll do the same
here pop this in so a couple seconds
behind slap the battery doors back on
here's the again little NFC radio kind
of ingenious they put it in the battery
door go ahead and put that back and
attempt to put the battery door on which
is harder than it looks let's say it is
booting up though that's a good sign
come on battery door there we go alright
so that's on that's booting up I can
certainly see a difference here between
the speed of the two of them on the
torch to prototype that I took a look at
a boot up time was way faster so
certainly the slowness here is going to
be attributed to the app and it's been
used before and there's other stuff in
the memory but clearly you can see a big
difference in the speed as this guy
boots up so I'll go ahead and let it to
continue to do with a little bit of a
boot up thing here and let's bring in
another
take a look at here bring in another
blackberry here is the torch one and go
ahead and see what this looks like the
8900 pretty similar to the torch -
almost identical from a size standpoint
go ahead and check out the those two
next to each other it looks like the
guys almost done and boot it up kind of
wait to see our rogers logo there
definitely see this is still only a
quarter of the way done so a lot of
distance to go hopefully if this phone
was unlocked like I was told it will be
we should see AT&amp;amp;T there and also we see
an H plus ice has support for I believe
the 14 megabits per second HSPA+ so
Pacific times where we are what to say
okay and time zone has been updated so
it's unlocked it's on e t--'s network
and we are ready to go so it is a
touchscreen we're just kind of weird to
see and feel here on a blackberry I'll
put it through its paces do a ton of
videos and coverage on it anything you
guys want to see on the u 900 I
definitely let me know first blush is it
feels very light on has a high quality
feel that maybe we haven't seen on
blackberries in quite a while so I'm
excited to give it a whirl hopefully I'm
not be disappointed again anything you
guys want to know leave it down in the
comments down below
John Rhett endure from TechnoBuffalo and
I'll see you in the next video bye-bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
