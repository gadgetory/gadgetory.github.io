to you by Linda calm what's up everyone
welcome back to another episode of ask
the Buffalo the show where you can ask
me Ashley ask la ka not jon rettinger
any question you might have from the
wide world of technology John and his
adorable wife are expecting their first
child later this year so they went on
vacation to do some major relaxing
before the baby shows up this week we're
going to talk about stuff I didn't write
in the teleprompter this is asked the
Buffalo so let's get answering this
question is from technobuffalo commenter
the elusive Carlos who asks one can we
have a video where all the members of
techno Buffalo are featured in well
elusive Carlos first of all it's very
difficult to get all of techno Buffalo
in the same room because so many of us
live not near our headquarters here in
Southern California a lot of us are in
New York and the all of the East Coast
proper so it's really tough to get
everyone together for video I think as
the senior content producer here
TechnoBuffalo i can say that hopefully
at CES we can get a video with everybody
together maybe we'll do a little Q&amp;amp;A
session for all of you in the herd for
all of the different members of techno
Buffalo calm but that's about as good as
I can do right now next up twitter user
asian dude 101 wants to know what is
more important for you hardware or
software on a phone well asian dude i
think that it's sort of one of those
situations where it's like looking for a
significant other of course you want
them to be kind and cool and funny and
just awesome in general but you also
have to have some kind of attraction
there there has to be some sort of
physical attraction and i feel the same
way about phones so obviously you want
whatever phone or piece of hardware
you're using to do all those great
things for you on the inside and
productivity wise you want them to you
want that software to make you feel
really good you want it to do all the
things you need it to do
and some things you didn't even expect
them to do for you but on the other hand
you have to make sure it looks good to
you you you're not going to want to
carry around a phone that you think is
ugly unless you are compromising or
settling and that is a whole different
can of worms that we will not even get
into on this show put our user invisible
note wanted our opinion on this question
do you think the Nexus line is worth it
anymore skins have more features and
google has slowed down updates that's
actually a really interesting question
and one that has been asked a lot in the
last couple of months especially now
that these google play edition phones
the HTC One and the galaxy s4 Google
Play editions are out now I actually
like a lot of what sense has to offer
and a lot of people who use the galaxy
s4 love TouchWiz or at least some of the
options that are available one of the
things that for me is really important
is camera so the camera software for a
nexus device for me is not as good as
something that's on the HTC One so for
me it would definitely be trade off to
buy a nexus device now that we're
getting these devices that are Google
Play editions that run sort of stock but
then also have the form factor of these
really great flagship devices I think
it's an even tougher decision for people
who are thinking about buying a nexus I
definitely think that at the end of the
day Google will start slowing down and
we have seen that as you mentioned will
start slowing down updates we're not
going to be seeing you know major
updates from four-point-oh 25 point oh
we're not going to see these major
software updates once every six months I
think they're moving to a much more
standardized once a year upgrade for
Android so if you want those upgrades
which to be fair I mean most of us who
are tech junkies tend to buy phones a
little bit more often than every two
years but if you don't and you want
those software updates I would say a
nexus is still worth it but other than
that go for a google play edition if
you're really thinking about it but you
don't want to commit to a contract on a
carrier and you want those updates and
lastly Twitter user Eric Wilbourn asks
in honor of john for lakers what new
mobile tech
she will prove the most useful for those
with babies on the way well Eric I am
the worst person to ask about this
because I don't have kids and the last
time my family was around children was
when we were kids so it's been a while
since we've had little kids around but I
can say that based on friends and loved
ones who have had kids in the last few
years there's so much technology now in
everything so even strollers things that
are as simple as a baby's bottle now has
self-forming technology and there are
all kinds of really great baby monitors
that you can use with your phone there
are different things that are available
to parents the new parents especially
who might struggle with having their
first kid even in the most mundane
things for kids so I don't think John
will have any problem finding really
good stuff and I'm sure will probably
throw some kind of weird man is it would
it be a man baby shower Ralph a man a
man shower we're gonna throw a man
shower for her John at some point and
it'll be great and we'll probably all by
him like really techie cool stuff for
when he becomes a first-time dad but
generally speaking I think everybody can
find if you have a new kid or if you're
about to congratulations and also I'm
sure you can find some great stuff
pretty much anywhere you go now because
technology is it that's that's what our
lives are now we live in the 21st
century we're almost at the Jetsons guys
were almost there before we go we would
