there's a lot of confusion over the
iphone 3gs pricing and a lot of outcry
over the upgrade policy so I'm going to
try and break it down for you explain
why 18t lap and Apple are doing this and
possibly give some suggestions as to
what you can do about it before we get
started it's important to understand
what the terms subsidy means most you
probably know but if you don't subsidy
is an economic incentive for a purchase
so what that means in terms of AT&amp;amp;T is
if you buy a phone any phone let's say
not even the iphone 4 for free you sign
a new contract you get a free phone
certainly that foam that you just got
has value to it it's not zero there's rd
hardware costs but you're paying zero
what 18teen most other carriers are
doing is they're taking a loss on the
price of that phone they bought it from
the carrier but their knowing that
they're going to make that loss up over
the term of your contract so essentially
what they're doing is giving you an
incentive to sign new two-year contract
so in the first iphone launched it was
subsidy free meaning 18t wasn't taking
any of the cut off it that's why I when
the iphone first launch was 599 600
bucks was a lot of money the price
dropped a little bit later but even then
it was still an unsubsidized price when
the iphone 3g launched 18t was able to
subsidize it and take a little bit of a
loss because they hadn't for the
previous generation of phones so anyone
who had an iphone 18t didn't lose any
money by giving a discount on that phone
that's one of the reasons it was so
expensive so they conditions to the 3g
they can afford to give you a discount
anticipation of having everyone who
bought a 3g have a two-year contract now
if you're following me this is where
things get a little bit tricky with the
iphone 3g s since 18 p gave everyone an
incentive and a subsidy to purchase the
iphone 3g they can't give another
subsidy for the iphone 3gs well
physically they could but it would be a
huge economic hit they would lose
millions and millions and millions of
dollars by giving another subsidy so
it's actually what they would be doing
is taking a loss on one phone taking a
loss on a second phone and those two
losses would not be recouped on the term
of a contract so having the iphone in
there Staple would actually be losing
proposition for them that's the big
reason why 18teen didn't offer a subsidy
or is not offering a subsidy for current
3g owners and those already on a
contract think about it like this let's
take the iphone out of the equation
let's say six months ago you want AT&amp;amp;T
and you've got a new phone you signed a
new contract and you've been really
happy with it six months later you want
to get a new phone you probably don't
expect a tnt to give you another
discount on a new phone six months later
because they haven't recoup the cost of
this count they gave you on the first
phone and the same thing is applying to
the iphone 3gs so let's get into the
pricing of the 3gs for just a minute
here it's going to run you 199 if you're
eligible for an upgrade for the 16
gigabyte version or 299 for eligible for
the 32 gigabyte version if you're a
current 3g owner or you're already on
contract the 16 gig is going to run you
499 or the 32 is going to run you 599
those you keep it track at home there's
a $300 price difference so AT&amp;amp;T is
subsidizing the price of your phone by
three hundred dollars so there is
something kind of interesting that you
can do and I'm not recommending that you
do this because there could be some
little squirrely things that happen but
let me explain them least give you guys
some options AT&amp;amp;T and all other carriers
have what's called an early termination
fee so what that essentially means you
can terminate your contract and so you
lose your phone number and you can start
a new contract it means you're also
eligible for and you line up service so
before I go through and do the math
about this let me tell you I know a lot
of people are talking about early
termination fees I don't recommend doing
this there's a time lapse in between
terminating your phone and getting a new
line of service that may not make you
eligible to even open a new line you may
have to do it under a different name or
have a parent's open it for you it can
be very very very difficult not to
mention the fact you're going
lose your phone but there is a lot of
discussion over the early termination
policy so I'm going to explain it to you
essentially what the early termination
policy for AT&amp;amp;T is it's a hundred and
seventy five dollars at the start of a
contract so you sign a contract today
you have 30 days to make up your mind at
31 days if you want to cancel your
contract you have to pay a hundred and
seventy five dollars what they'll do is
sorry hundred seventy five dollars what
they'll do is every month after that
they'll take five dollars off the cost
early termination fee so over a 24-month
period you could sexually take off one
hundred twenty dollars over the early
termination fee so there would be fifty
five dollars to cancel a day before your
upgrade was available so if I've got
some some math in front of me here so
bear with me so let's say for argument's
sake that you've got a full early early
termination fee you have to pay 175
dollars so the difference between the
unsubsidized iphone and paying full
price would be 125 dollars so let's do
the math here $125 plus 1 99 for what
would be a new contract for the 16
gigabyte iphone equals 324 bucks which
is actually a hundred and seventy five
dollar savings over the 499 that you'd
have to pay for the 32 gig it's 125
bucks savings again plus a 2 99 gives
you the same one hundred dollars more
savings of 424 I'm sorry total of four
24 and still the same savings of 175 so
I just want to explain the math to you
so technically would be saving money but
you might not be eligible to start a new
contract you're going to move even if
you are you might have a lapse and it's
going to be very difficult to start a
new contract so I'm not advocating going
out and terminating your contract I'm
just explaining it to you since I've
been getting a lot of questions about
contract termination so I hope that made
sense essentially if you could in a
perfect world terminate your contract
and start a new one the same day you
would save 175 bucks over the iphone 3g
upgrade price of 499 or 599 that being
said it's not worth it if you want an
iphone 3g it's probably better
unfortunately to pay the full
unsubsidized price 500 600 bucks are
respectively I know it is a lot to
swallow from a consumer perspective like
I said in previous videos I understand
the out pride Apple give you a discount
on three gene you want that same
discount for the 3gs but from a business
standpoint you just can't do it and you
have to understand it just a little bit
you don't expect a discount of
everything you get and if you take the
3g out of the equation you can't expect
a phone call phone company to give you a
discount every time you want to upgrade
it's an anchor the beefs that new
technology comes out there's going to be
an update to the iphone 3gs in probably
a year it's going to be an update after
that for that after that and
unfortunately if you want to be on the
cutting edge of technology it's going to
cost you money and people get a little
sensitive when it comes to their wallets
so I can get the consumer al cry but
from a business standpoint it's just not
smart business sense I always probably
get a piss a lot of people off but it's
the truth I know you're there's a lot of
emotion involved of getting a new phone
because you love the iphone or you feel
strongly about Apple but from a business
standpoint ett just can't do it doesn't
affect Apple one way or another whether
or not AT&amp;amp;T subsidizes that they get it
they would get a price of a lung check a
bathroom from AT&amp;amp;T you know what Apple
could do is make the phone a little bit
cheaper component-wise haven't been torn
down yet but I assume there's a big
profit margin built in but that profit
margin doesn't account for all the R&amp;amp;D
that's research and development that
went into the iphone so this is a little
more technical and math and like to get
in my videos but i didn't want to
explain the pricing and how it worked
and the reasoning behind why AT&amp;amp;T is
doing it I'd be a little upset too again
I understand it from but from a business
standpoint it just does not make sense
for another substitute for the 3gs now
we meeting it was the next phone will be
subsidizing after that would be
subsidized and it really would get to be
a very long and negative process for the
carrier and this would be true if the
iphone was on any other carrier who is
on brides and sprint or t-mobile the
Curia just could not afford to subsidize
every
vice every year so I do I hope this
helped answer some of your questions for
exclusive content and you want to ask me
some more iphone related questions
