and check out those black levels in the
intro it's clearly an OLED TV yeah I
love Sony sets
I bought a 75 inch z9t for my house
there's a ton of Technology but there's
something unique about this set that
makes it stand apart from anything else
out there it's their acoustic surface
technology essentially the entire screen
is the speaker I know that sounds
bizarre but there's actually actuators
in the back of the screen that's gonna
vibrate the glass and turn the entire 65
inch or 55 inch just heading what side
you get into the speaker and it gets
even crazier than that it'll actually
follow the sound so if you're watching
like an action movie and there's a shot
fired on the left it'll sound like it's
coming from the left and you look at
that technology and you figure it's
gonna sound not good kind of like we did
but it sounds incredible to effect you
might not need a sound bar even external
surround sound the speakers on this
thing are that good I just want to get
that out of the way at the beginning
because it is an incredible minute
technology to actually see so some back
story we've had the same four case set
of techni Buffalo offices for about four
to five years looking a little dingy
pictures weren't looking so good we use
it almost every day for video games for
watching back videos and sort of
watching TV and I wanted a to upgrade
our set here and being a big Sony fan
want to take a look and obviously the
OLED set from Sony so Sony offer to send
this one to take a look at so the reason
that I bought a is e9d I'm really a big
fan of their x1 Xtreme processor most of
the TV that I watch is sports and if I'm
playing video games it's usually FPS or
sports video games it does an incredible
job with things with fast motion you
don't really think that much about the
processor in your TV but it's important
when you're doing a lot of things with
huge amount of playback
I also really liked it's powered by
Android TV it makes it really easy to
set up I always say for streaming it's
gonna work really well but of course
it's got inputs galore you can plug in
whatever you want but I did like having
Android TV as the brains of the set you
also can get a couple other cool stuff
we're gonna get Google assistant
built-in for the remote wood you can
just just talk and have it play some
TechnoBuffalo videos from YouTube for
example so a lot of old lets of taking
kind of unique design approaches some
are crazy thin some are gigantic so they
took a bit of a minimalistic approach
here the TV itself looks like it's
floating it's because of the stand in
the back so that's where all of your
input and i/o is going to live and I had
some concern about being able to wall
mount the set because we're gonna wall
mount two here in the office with that
giant stand and that's where all the
brains of the set are going to live and
it folds down almost flat so you can
sort of put the TV almost flush on the
wall which was super important to me the
other stuff you'd expect from a flagship
oh let's set is there you've got 4k
obviously you've got HDR support for
both formats and the picture just looks
incredible and that's why I spent my own
money for a sony TV I just think the
picture quality looks incredible I think
looks better than anything else out
there colours pop the black pebbles look
incredible watching sports on this thing
is like being at the stadium I can't
overstate that enough the difference
here is huge if you remember when you
first started looking at HD content from
standard def it was incredible you can
see the grass on the field it's almost
that big a jump here from regular HD to
what you get with OLED that's absolutely
incredible another reason the a1e is an
incredible TV actually gets plenty
bright so if you want to put it up in a
bright room with a lot of windows
picture is not going to be washed out a
lot of oh let's have that problem that's
another reason that I personally spent
my money for a sony set they do an
incredible job with brightness and that
transferred over to their OLED sets had
a chance take a look at this when it
first launched actually at CES 2017 and
the picture quality looked good it was
her stock footage I want to see what it
looked like actually just watching back
stuff anything I did looked awesome from
from YouTube videos to gaming to sports
to
anything you watch back looks good you
can also stream obviously the forecast
stuff because Android TV powered so last
bit of tech that I really liked about
the Sony sets there triluminos display
it just makes the colors look really
good I could get into the tech side of
it but it just means the colors are
gonna pop more even more so than on a
comparable all that set by another maker
if you're looking for a flagship OLED
set you don't want to break the bank you
want one in varying sizes it's actually
available in 55 65 or 77 inches
I really recommend looking at Sony this
was out when I bought my z 9d I would
have I would have gone for the a1 either
picture quality is just insane an
acoustic technology that turns the
screen into a speaker's I'm you're a
tech guy is really cool it something you
have to hear to experience it so
obviously being OLED in a flagship it's
not the cheapest set out there but it's
comparable with other flagship OLED sets
will link to it down below in case you
want to check out the pricing I'm kind
of gushing about the set
maybe it's my sony tv fanboy I buy a new
TV every like eight years so I did a ton
of research and I just fell in love the
combination of technology and design
from Sony they're obviously there are a
lot of other good OLED sets out there
but for my money i legit put it behind
the Sony tech because I trusted it and I
think you guys if you're looking for an
OLED set you might want to consider the
a1 EE as well so we're planning on doing
a lot more TV reviews coming into the
new year if you don't want to miss those
hit the bell icon to get alerts or new
videos come up what do guys think about
oled sets in general i'm a huge fan of
the black levels are you upgrading let
us know in the comments down below until
next time Jon render from TechnoBuffalo
