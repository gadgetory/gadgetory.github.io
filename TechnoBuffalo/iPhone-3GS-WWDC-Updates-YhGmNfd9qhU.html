is Monday June eighth the first day of
Apple's Worldwide Developer Conference
which is headlined by kia co executives
giving what turned out to relatively
large product announcements so without
further ado let me go ahead and get
started and I'm gonna actually begin at
the end of the conference there was not
a cameo by Steve Jobs by the way in case
you were wondering so the conference
ended with announcement of a new iphone
which is certainly much speculated this
model is called the iphone 3gs excuse me
if I'm looking down the conference just
ended I've got a couple pages of notes
apartment so the S clearly stands for
speed and it looks almost exactly like
the iphone 3g all these pictures we saw
with a matte back turned out to not be
true it looks almost identical you
really can't see the difference
physically internally though there are
some substantial changes let's start
talking about those so first data tasks
are almost forced times faster and
speeds can go up to 7.2 megabits per
second on hsdpa which is quite fast the
camera was actually one of the big
discussion points it's now a 3 megapixel
camera with tapped autofocus and auto
white balance and as most people
predicted and now supports 30 frame per
second VGA video recording with an
editing feature meaning you can now use
your iPhone to record a video and
actually edit it right on the phone
which is really going to get up upload
it right to mobileme you also get a
built-in compass which is kind of cool
if your say using google maps and you're
looking at a location as you move your
phone around the google maps will pan
it's just another thing for developers
to have access to it's not that exciting
but it is nice that it's there so
there's also a new battery that they say
will offer up to five hours of 3g
talktime and nine hours of Wi-Fi
internet usage that was to be expected
battery technologies changed over the
years since the iphone 3g was released
so you expect improved
your life and you expect things to be a
little bit faster they'd only get into
processor specs but certainly it appears
that it's going to upgrade that you'd
expect the RAM and the wrong to all have
been upgraded as well so moving on there
where else those are all things are kind
of predicted there were some surprises
as well for example now holding down the
home button now enables a new of voice
control interface so it's for voice file
you can actually use it in iTunes use
really firm most things so you can hold
down the home button say play a song
like this if you're listening to a song
and iTunes and they'll start playing or
you can pull it down and say play green
day they'll start play start playing or
you can also hold it down and say call
jon rettinger and they'll call jon
rettinger that's a feature that's been
available on most phones but the iphone
really didn't have any at selby very
nice there was no word on with enough
that I'll work with Bluetooth devices
but I assume if you're using a Bluetooth
headset or speaker you push the button
on the headset or up on a speaker in
love access said voice commands well it
makes driving much safer so that was
quite nice so what's the big thing
pricing it's going to come in two
configurations a 16 and 32 gigabyte
model in both white or black the 16 gig
is going to run you 199 and the 32 gig
is going to run you 299 the same price
points as the iphone 3g when it released
in eighth and sixteenth figurations if
these updates aren't enough to make you
want to run out and get a 3gs the good
news is you can also now go pick up a 3g
for ninety nine dollars on a new AT&amp;amp;T
contract or a contract extension which
is actually a pretty good deal there
wasn't that much of an update with the
3g hardware was wasn't it front-facing
camera like people were expecting you
know apples always has a tough time of
living up to the expectations their
products are hyped and forums and blogs
and I'm guilty of it myself so anything
that they do is generally bound to let
you down a little bit what they did do
was bring the iphone up to features that
what people would expect things that are
coming at three point 0 as well mms
voice dialing they announced tethering
cut copy and paste in landscape and
portrait all the things that probably
should have been there from launch and a
lot of thing
said people were great thing about with
the iphone you know I add the iphone so
great but why doesn't have mms i have it
on my nokia phones six years ago you
know you always hear people say things
like that well those arguments and
points are now rather move so that was
very nice at Apple to update it a little
bit although it was to a little bit of
disappointment so well the conference
when I booked into the spectrum too
disappointing and exciting let's get you
some of the exciting stuff so they open
the conference with laptop updates which
most people were not expecting actually
and they updated every laptop so let me
go ahead and tell you what they did here
so they loosed a new 15-inch MacBook Pro
and what has the same removal or non
removable battery as a 17-inch MacBook
Pro meaning you can't take the battery
out hot swap it but because of that they
said that's going to last an average of
seven hours or claiming which actually
really impressive seven hours of battery
life is really nice and they say that
the battery will last for five years or
a thousand recharges which is pretty
cool they also now added a SD card
reader and they got rid of the
expresscard slot but not many people
used an SD card reader is really nice if
you want some external storage or your
video camera camcorder use an SD card
slot you can pop it in and you're not a
good to go and that really was a welcome
addition I think to the notebook line so
the nice thing they did was they also
dropped the prices of the macbook pros
so i'll tell you the configurations out
there now come in for 1699 you're going
to get a 2.5 three gigahertz four gig of
ram geforce 9400 graphics 250 gigabyte
hard drive the SD card slot and you have
options for solid-state you can
configure things differently for 1999
dodge you get it 2.63 give your
processor the same specs and now you
also get the 9400 em and 9600 GT
graphics processors so you get two of
the graphics cards lower-end doesn't
have both and in the upper echelon for
2299 you're getting 2.8 gigahertz 4 gigs
around
the graphics cards if I want to get good
bite hard drives they all have the SD
card slots the 17-inch MacBook Pro
remains the same spec wise but it did
get a price cut to 24 99 which is really
actually pretty good deal if we're
getting with that seven teenager and all
those models are shipping today apple
also updated the macbook line so they
now have the same built-in battery as
the macbook pros thinking that claims to
have seven hours of battery life five
years or a thousand charges things I
just went over but it can now support up
to eight gigabytes of RAM as a firewire
800 port and now has a backlit keyboard
as standard so the interesting thing now
is this 13 incher that I'm talking about
with the types of great gigabytes of RAM
with everything else it's actually now
called a macbook pro it's actually
there's now a 13-inch MacBook Pro which
is very cool the macbook the line below
that got a price cut and specs bump as
well for 1199 you're going to get a cue
point 26 gigahertz core 2 duo two gigs
ram your geforce 9400 60 game 160
gigabyte hard drive and an SD card slot
and for 1499 you're getting a little bit
of a spec bump and a bigger hard drive
also excitingly at least for me since
i'm a big fan of macbook air it got
speck update and price cut which is
actually quite nice so the macbook air
now starts at 1499 and you for 1499
you're now going to get a 1.86 core 2
duo processor 2 gigabytes and i am
geforce 9400 and 120 gigabyte spinning
platter drive now the cool thing for
three hundred dollars more you're going
to get a solid state drive at 128
gigabytes you're also gonna get a 2.1
three gigahertz core 2 duo processor so
for three hundred dollars more you're
getting quite a lot and that solid
straight model actually marks a seven
hundred dollar price drop from what the
macbook air would cost you yesterday and
that's huge there were three hundred
bucks you're getting specs and the
solid-state drive if you're in the
market for a macbook
err you're really now getting a very
full-featured machine if had time to
work out the kinks and I think it's
pretty solid deal at 1799 so those are
the laptop line little confusing now at
the 13-inch macbook pro so they also
released safari for they talked about it
for quite a bit the mortal being it's
fast it's much faster than ie it it's
and speed comparisons it's no longer in
beta it's quick and it's available today
they also spent a lot of time on snow
leopard to follow up to their operating
system leopard again a lot of things I
talked about 64 bit it's fast if you
install it on any current machine that
is currently running leopard you're
going to say sticky gigabytes of space
so you are saving a lot of room and
you're getting a lot more for it now one
of the real cool things about leopard is
there going to be selling it as an
upgrade for twenty nine dollars which is
absolutely unheard of for a full OS
upgrade or forty nine dollars for family
pad you need more licenses that is
really cold as enemy shipping in
September the next thing they talked
about is if that wasn't enough was OS
3.8 the operating system that's going to
come on the new iphone 3gs or what
you're going to get on your current 3g
so it's a new feature called find my
iphone to service that helps you locate
your lost phone and i'll let you log
into your mobileme account it's only
show your phone on a map you can even
send a message to the phone and say hey
my phone's lost give a number of them to
call or hey dbag you stole my phone get
it back and calling the police if they
don't give it back you can now do a full
remote wipe which is kind of cool get
word for information on it so they can
access your pictures or email or
personal contacts which is quite nice
they also now finally turn by turn
directions at partnering with tomtom
they're the first ones that are to
introduce a full application for
turn-by-turn directions with maps
that'll be available in the App Store no
price was announced and they're also
releasing a dock for the car essentially
it's a suction cup that's sixty or
windshield nothing terribly exciting but
turn-by-turn direct
very very nice they also released a
scroll motions iceberg in a bookstore
for the iphone think of it as the kindle
store for your iphone we could have more
than 500 best sellers at launch 15 major
magazines and 170 daily papers with a
total of a million books at one is
actually kind of cool OS 3.4 all iphone
customers so you got original iphone or
a 3g unfortunately going to be 995 for
ipod touch owners I love the available
worldwide for june seventeenth ranjan
17th i should also say that the iphone
3gs is going to be available on jun 19
so just a few days later so that will
really ran the gamut of all the products
they did I phones laptops talked about
their operating system released a new
browser what is unclear those two what
features are going to get with OS three
point out that are in the 3gs is the
voice recognition is that just an
application that can be part of the
operating system or is that something
that's hardware-based with the 3gs they
didn't really announced that i assume
more information will kind of come out
as the day progresses hope you guys
enjoyed the brief overview of WWDC i
know this was a little longer video but
i could have talked for much longer
about it but I cut it down to just cover
all the important stuff what do you guys
think about the updates were you excited
about the 3gs was it underwhelming are
you overwhelmed by what they said are
the price cuts and new laptop specs
enough for you to upgrade are they not
enough for you don't frame and I guys
hope you enjoyed for exclusive content
be sure to follow me on twitter
twitter.com / John for lakers i'll see
you guys next video oh boy hey guys so
since i just finished recording there
have been some updates that have come
out so let me go ahead and give you
those right now first one regards
pricing of the iphone 3g in the iphone
3gs if you want one of the eight
gigabyte iphone 3gs and you're currently
in your contract it's going to run you
too
nine obviously that's us you're not
going to qualify for that 999 price
unless you're on a new contract or due
for an upgrade if you want an iphone 3gs
when they are released and your mid
contract or you currently have an iphone
3g or not due for an upgrade it's going
to run you a whopping 399 or 499 for the
16 or 32 gigs so no such good deal like
you had with the iphone 3g launch it's
going to cost you 3 99 or 499 for those
two phones so just want to give you an
update and to clarify about the macbook
and macbook pro updates let me sum it up
like this the plastic macbook is now the
only macbook available anything unibody
that's not a macbook air is now called a
macbook pro just thought i'd let you
guys know and clear that up for it
anyway now I really will see in the next
video bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
