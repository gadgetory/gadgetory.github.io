here every now and then I like to take
to the streets and ask you guys
questions most of the videos I make are
things that interest me and that I think
that maybe you might like but very
rarely do I stop and ask what do you
guys want so I posted a message on my
twitter account at twitter com such John
for lakers about an hour ago asking you
guys to ask me questions anything you
want to know in technology or my
personal life I'm pretty much an open
book so I picked nine questions I'm
going to go ahead and answer them for
you I'm going to try and do this series
a little more regularly it gives you
guys a chance to get to know me a little
bit better and it helps me understand
sort of what things you're looking for
in future videos so let's go ahead and
get started the first question comes
from Thais iphone help really a
fantastic youtuber if we check it out if
you have it and he's asking who is your
favourite youtuber other than me and Ty
like a good question you can check out
my subscribers box to see who i watch
mostly but some of the bigger name
youtubers that that i love and i watch
all the time i watch sxephil videos i
love SMP films shaycarl i like alter the
comedy v-log type things and it's nice
to see how people that are talking to
the camera do it see like to pick up any
tips how they put comedy into their
videos and just see how they interact
with their audience really is a nice way
to you know get some ideas and also it's
very injured enjoyable I love college
humor barely political all those those
are some of my favorites so the next
Twitter question that we have here is
from user caging car fan and he asks
John have you carry your iPhone that a
case without a screen shield or no
screen shield well I actually use clear
coat on my iPhone I did a real a big
comparison versus the three I consider
to be the largest sort of plastic
coating for the iphone there's even look
like a case but this thing is totally
scratch proof and the clear coat for me
has been
best so that's what I use for my iphone
protection not god help me if I drop it
but I can now put it in my pocket with
my keys and I worry about scratching the
whole thing up so hopefully they
answered your question next question
comes from and Draya tunes one of Galen
my favorite youtubers he actually asked
a very good question here's one kid
non-professional YouTube reviewers
competes with professional ones like
that's an excellent question you know I
consider myself sort of walk in between
amateur and professional and certainly
you look at videos from cnet and you
look at some of the more amateur videos
on YouTube and you certainly see a big
discrepancy in production quality I
don't think you see a discrepancy in
actual review quality in fact I think
some of the bigger tech reviewers the
ones that are professional rather don't
necessarily do the best reviews they
just have the biggest audience and I
watching the videos on cnet and keep
them real short to hold your interest
they don't answer all the questions that
you want to know about the phone they
show you what it looks like tell you how
a keyboard is they don't tell you really
much call quality been looking at a
laptop they don't really tell you real
world tests at least in the video at
least and I think that's where some of
the amateur youtubers really can step up
and fill in the gaps that some of the
professional reviewers don't offer you
know I try it might be just and
sometimes got a little bit long let's
they try and give you guys a details and
maybe you couldn't find it elsewhere a
little bit harder to find so answer to
your question I really do think that the
amateur youtubers definitely on the shot
against professionals in fact i think
that the amateur youtubers now can be
tomorrow's professional reviewers that
can help change the perception of these
my perception of the pro reviewers so
andreia i hope that answered your
question and i said that with an accent
for you too I'm debated okay so we'll go
to the next one this is from user rad
gmr what is the best advice for getting
notice on youtube or getting your
website noticed this is really a hard
one because I think it's most of it's
just dumb luck you know the first thing
that don't recommend don't email people
asking them to subscribe to you don't
post your video on
other people's websites or YouTube
channels it's just going to get you
marked as spam and for most of the
common viewers we can find a little bit
annoying the best way you can get
noticed is to put out good content good
content will eventually get noticed and
don't be discouraged if you're not
gaining on it that you you hope for or
that you wanted because it does take
time to build up that audience it really
really really doesn't just be patient
have confidence build up your reviewing
skilled not something you can turn on
the camera and just do one day if you
watch my first hundred videos I sucked
I'm not saying I'm not good now I
certainly have a lot more to improve on
but I was awful nervous I'm looking away
from the camera all the time every other
word out of my mouth was ah I was making
more mistakes than usual and what I was
saying they were just really bad but I
enjoy what I was doing and I stuck with
it and actually got a little bit noticed
and sort of like you can get Sam out of
attention that I have if not more if you
just stick with it that's the best
advice that I can give you next question
is from Nick moc what features in the
smartphone would take you away from the
iphone as your main device that's a good
question tick away from the iphone is
going to be tough i really i have to
have a capacitive screen I think
resistive screens are awful not
responsive I would need multi-touch I've
gotten so used to pinching zooming
scrolling that would be a requirement I
have to have a really stellar web
browser I do a lot of work actually
online for my phone so if I had a great
web experience you know I would consider
it multitasking would be something that
would be a feature that I couldn't get
on the iphone that I would definitely
like I perhaps a device with a full
qwerty keyboard would you know really be
something that we're taking you away
also I would want it to be on a tMT's
network since that's my current carrier
and I wouldn't want to have to carry two
phones around all the time miss text
messages i can forward phone calls from
whatever to another but you can't
forward text but it least meet with the
it would at least need to be GS
unlocked hope that helps you so the next
question is from so own mern what advice
would you give to a 17 year old boy who
wants to break into YouTube market the V
log show my advice would be very similar
to the advice that I gave forgetting
notice first stick with it if you're 17
years old that means you're still in
school focus on your studies first the
best advice I can give to anybody is
getting education you know they might
not ask you being a tech reviewer how to
you know do geometry problems or physics
or biology but doing that work and
learning it's going to help shape the
way to think in the future so education
to be the first thing i would say for
still in school the great al de Blasio
once told me and until we tell some of
his audience if you're in school and are
not an A student you have no business
being at tech review or in the first
place study learn way you need to learn
and then when you're achieving that
level of academic success you know then
start trying to achieve some technology
reviewing success but assuming that you
are doing that assuming that you are in
a student and learning everything you
can the advice that I would give to
really get notice would be funny looking
at determines or that separate yourself
from the pack for a lot of people that
just talk to a camera give kind of
verbatim what's on a package and don't
really offer anything unique but
something unique that you can offer you
know maybe infuse some comedy maybe
infuse costumes whatever it might be you
need a hook it's a very crowded
marketplace right now so that would
really be my short-term advice for you
the next question comes from a flam a ph
IL am if you're the option to get a palm
pre or an iPhone which would you get
well I had a palm pre and i have an
iphone and i gotta tell you if the pre
was gsm i would have been really hard
pressed to get rid of it i loved having
multi-touch on it I love being able to
multitask I love the physical keyboard I
like the way the phone Felton
hand it was fun to use it was enjoyable
call quality was fantastic you know my
advice to for you guys is I think they
really are really on an even playing
field and you know how much above the
iphone so that's high praise for the pre
I think it's only going to get better as
the software and the operating system
matures so I would say see what you get
better coverage if you have better ATT
coverage go with the iphone better
sprint coverage go at the pre you get
the same coverage really going to come
down to personal preference I don't
think you can go wrong with either if
apps are important to you than the
iphone is probably a better way to go
since the app store or the app catalog
on the pre even fully developed yet and
it's still in beta short answer hope it
helped next question comes from blue 42
rich man Michael Sherlock can you give
us some more information on
technobuffalo you guys may have seen
technobuffalo on my phone you may have
heard me mention it in live streams I
will tell you this it's a new project
that I'm working on and I promise you
that more information is coming within
the week really everything that there is
to know about technobuffalo calm will be
out there and I think that you guys are
really going to enjoy it least I hope
you were next question comes from kayak
kid 613 what were some of your childhood
nicknames man childhood nicknames all
through middle school and high school I
was called Ferris from like Ferris
Bueller's Day Off I was very fast
talking to my teachers and I was always
trying to pull something I guess so i
had that nickname that kind of carried
through with me even through college was
the biggest one that i had you know
because my name is jon rettinger i was
called junior or because of rettinger i
was called red you know i was called a
lot of other nicknames to that i
probably can't say on camera but those
were the big ones and the last question
comes from stock sage out of the
netherlands question you get to keep all
the profit all the products company
sends you
because it seems like you have 635
phones well the answer is no I do not
get keep all the products some I do most
of the phones i keep roza phones that I
get to review I keep for two weeks three
weeks and then I send back to the
carrier's they're primarily just demo
units something other products I do get
a keep I've already view them if the
product i particularly like I'm I asked
to give it something that I have no
interest in then generally i will send
it back so guys hope this answered some
of your questions I could have answered
many many many more but in the interest
of brevity and a kind of cut it so
please keep something you know stuff
over to Twitter I love to talk to you
guys my username is twitter.com / john

sidebar which is probably one of these
directions and I guys for exclusive
