first center here technobuffalo and I
wanted to talk to you guys for a second
about some stuff we've got a bunch of it
we sell a lot of it over it
TechnoBuffalo deals there's a couple of
cool things I think you guys might want
to check out there on sale you can get
this Bluetooth speaker you can get a
nifty travel charger that's got all
kinds of plugs in it you didn't get a
pair of thirty dollar bluetooth wireless
earbuds most excitingly you can get
yourself one of these this this here's
the drone they're super easy to use you
can even shoot video with them so check
it out here's the controller I'm gonna
look how easy and easy it is to use it
works really well there we go no up okay
I think we lost a propeller there but
that is because of my ineptitude not
because of the drone itself can do all
kinds of other things that that when you
guys aren't around and you're not paying
attention you're asking yourself where
can I get one of those while you're in
luck I'm gonna tell you right now you
can head over TechnoBuffalo deals get 20
bucks off of that drone so like I said
they're really easy to use here we go
nope okay that's fine that's fine</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
