i've know it from technobuffalo died
upon a motorola xoom the new google
android 30 powered tablet from motorola
and verizon and i'm on an Apple iPad the
first iOS powered tablet from apple at
this and this is tablet wars
alright so on the Left we've got the
motorola xoom for verizon just released
and let's get me off of that video off
they're already set up so the motorola
xoom for verizon on the right the apple
ipad again it's mentioned at the top
we're all expecting a new ipad to be
unveiled at the event on March second
which is just about a day and a half
from now so you know we're going to
we're going to talk about things as they
are kind of mentioned a few things will
expect from the new iPad but basically
the big difference is you know obviously
the first main differences you got the
operating system google android 3.0
honeycomb has the first tablet-optimized
operating system but based off of
android and so the things that you know
and love or no one hate or don't know
about android all the widgets and the
notifications and the multiple home
screens and the ability to you know get
notifications down there at the bottom
that pop up when things are going on and
your ability to connect with all the
Google services and here you can add the
shortcuts and the widgets and the live
wallpapers and all that kind of stuff
and then all the Google services
built-in as mentioned you know the voice
search and the maps functionality and
you know all that good business the
integration with Google accounts email
you know Gmail system and calendars and
contacts and everything and then on the
iPad you've got the apple iOS I'm
probably going to see a new version of
iOS coming at the event later this week
as well but are basically kind of a more
simplified way of doing things you have
the multiple home screens but you're
limited just to two icons and folders no
widgets no live wallpapers and I that
kind of stuff the notification system is
really you know just the same as on
iphone you've got that that dialog box
that will pop up and sort of stopped
everything you don't have a little
pop-up widgets on the bottom or the
notifiers and the the bottom status bar
there then let you know when you have
you no new messages and that kind of
thing you'll get you know if you have a
new new mail or a new you know app store
up there something that you'll get a
little number will struggle the number
that's about it beyond the you know the
operating system differences which you
know we could and people have
at length and fought over as though it
was the spanish civil war or something
you know we're not going to go to end up
with that right now but those are the
basic differences Google honeycomb three
that oh and iOS running here on the iPad
physically you've got a 10.1 inch
widescreen form factor screen so a 16-9
aspect ratio 1200 x 800 resolution gives
you about a hundred and sixty dots per
inch and then on the ipad you've got a
9.7 inch display 1024 x 768 so it's a
four by three resolution not report by
three aspect ratio not widescreen like
the zoom and that's good for about 132
pixels per inch so a larger higher res
and higher pixel density display on the
zoom am I using I've had the zoom for
only about four days now so don't think
this is a full-on you know total review
but I thought long enough to have a
pretty good sense of what I think about
it and my am I using it i prefer the
zooms form factor i prefer the
widescreen aspect ratio but i think the
iPhone the iPhone the iPad actually has
a better screen and the touchscreen is
more sensitive iPads been out for a
while the operating system has been
refined a little bit they both work
pretty well but I've just found that the
ipad just is more sensitive and the
screen just pops a little bit more we'll
get into that a little more in a minute
here both you know both phones both
phones both tablets work in both
landscape and horizontal orientation and
I find out with the form factors the zoo
is actually a little bit better both
when you when you're looking at it in
portrait mode it's better for both two
handed typing and also for ebook reading
it's a little little large for ebook
reading in terms of you know one-handed
use or you have holding it for a long
period of time but for 2 2 thumb typing
a little bit easier here and I'll show
you the virtual keyboards in a minute
the iPad a little more awkward with the
four by three standard aspect ratio form
factor a little bit more awkward to do
to you know a little wide 42 Thun typing
and not really wide enough in landscape
mode for me to do kind of full-on touch
typing I found myself hunting and
pecking with two index fingers instead
of regular touch typing
zooms a little bit better for that but
again I'm going to stop myself because
I'm not talking about the keywords just
yet we'll show you those in a minute but
for factor wise i prefer the zoom build
quality wise the ipad for sure it is
heavier one thing that's nice about the
zoom a little bit later but the
materials in the ipad are just nicer
it's better balanced it feels like a
more luxurious object like I said the
display is higher quality the
touchscreen is more sensitive and
accurate to me and then kind of a weird
thing with the zune with the zoom
depending on how you're holding it even
though it is it is you know kind of a
symmetrical design here with the kind of
similar to the ipad with the curved back
panel kind of wider in the middle and
then it tapers out towards the ends
because the zoom has this separate panel
up top where the camera and the speakers
aren't everything it actually it feels a
little odd to me sometimes when I hold
it this way because I've got you know
one one hand my left hand the fingers
are resting on that seem right there
where the seam is not perfectly flush
and then also the you know kind of
affects the the taper and the materials
are slightly different whereas on the
iPad you know it's continuous it's that
one piece metal back and it's pretty
much perfectly symmetrical no matter
which way you hold it so I just a little
bit sometimes when I'm holding the zoom
in you know the the portrait mode it
just feels a little bit odd to be on the
back it's not at all deal-breaker just
something I've noticed but you know if
build quality again overall the ipad to
me has the advantage but the zoom is
actually i think a better form factor
and then also for widescreen video
watching your natively in 10 9 mode here
or 16 9 mode rather so I if I go back to
this video you know this is a high def
video to a 720p and so it naturally
fills the screen whereas on the ipad i
go into videos here go back to this
video
no we don't need to hear me again but
naturally we're not filling it naturally
you've got letterboxing at the top and
bottom and then you can stretch but
you're stretching and so your cropping
outs in the side content so you know
apple kind of explain why they did what
they did but still kind of you know it's
uh I don't know I just for both high def
video watching and for holding the phone
the long way the phone I keep saying the
phone the tablet a long way I think an
advantage to the zoom in terms of form
factor ah we mentioned her i showed you
briefly this back panel where the
cameras are you know one thing the zooms
are going for is that I've had doesn't
no cameras on the current iPad the zoom
has a front facing camera and then also
a rear 5-megapixel camera dual LED flash
and HD video capture not the greatest
cameras in the world on the zoom
honestly Motorola their cameras are
always kind of you know okay but not
amazing and you know similar story here
with the zoom but you can use it you
know right out of the box you can use it
for gchat google chat with video gtalk
rather google talk with video which is
great now we're anticipating that the
new ipad will have at least a front
facing camera for face time if not a
rear facing camera as well but at least
for the next day or two you know
advantage to the zoom for sure when it
comes to cameras i don't personally
think that a lot of people are going to
be using this as a camera a lot because
it's kind of unwieldy to hold this thing
up to your face and take pictures you
know with the rear camera but it's cool
that it has it the front-facing camera i
think more important because i think
video chat could just become a killer
app in the next year or so and tablets
are perfect for video chat and then you
know if you are kind of on the go and
you're in a pinch you have a camera with
you and it's always nice to have that as
opposed to not being able to capture the
shot also what i really like seeing as i
do so much video work for a living is
that there's a video app built in you
know right out of the box with the zoom
hopefully something that apple will
counter the average version of imovie
for ipad i'm fully expecting that with
the new ipad myself we'll see but i
built right in we've got this movie
studio app and pretty easy i did kind of
a goofy video there the other day but
pretty easy
to let's go new project now whoops we'll
go back new project untitled is fine
anchor and will import some footage and
here's that movie I shot earlier Oh Ron
file format oh well so we'll go back and
this old one that I did the other day
and you've got you know you've got a
video editor built right in pretty basic
but it works really well its got like a
virtual you know these controls Google's
metaphors a little bit different than
apples but you know you can edit you can
add I don't think I have any music on
the device here something came with it
so we'll put in hidden put a b.o.b
they're going back a couple of years
does it have to render out yet as to
render out before let me do it but
anyway there's a camera shot we'll use
that one I can only do one thing at a
time but you've got the ability to edit
video on the fly which is really kind of
cool at least you know in there we go
and there I made a terrible movie but
again you know just kind of neat that it
has it because video editing you know
for me personally something I do a lot
something I can't do on an iPad so at
least not yet so those kind of neat to
see otherwise get back to specs for a
minute we've got a 1 gigahertz Tegra 2
dual core processor in the zoom Tegra 2
all over the place at CES and Mobile
World Congress all these dual core
phones and tablets running Android and
then Android throated oh honey comb
optimized for tegra 2 so you know not a
lot out of the box except for the the 3d
elements on the UI some graphic
acceleration in the UI that kind of
thing we'll show you google maps real
quick because google maps on zoom is
pretty neat search for Empire State
Building
and so you've got ot building what well
I don't know whatever to the mayor
and the new 3d view kind of neat o on
the zoom you know how much are you
really going to use it I don't know but
it's kind of cool and again with Google
you know these technologies you never
know where they're going to wind up I
have to get kind of used to Peter you
can you can kind of pan and tilt and
stuff and so a few things you know that
take advantage of the dual core
processor now I saw some gaming demos at
mo world congress of games that were
optimized for the tegra two chip running
on a zoom actually that looks very
impressive so we should see some stuff
coming soon that takes advantage more
advantage of the dual core processor and
then you've got you know the iPad it's a
single core 1 gigahertz processor we're
expecting the next iPad to have you know
to to get a bump right now it's the
single core apple a4 rumors kicking
around about a possible dual core a9 and
the ipad 2 nobody knows for sure yet but
you know again I advantage hardware wise
to the zoom right now we'll see what
Apple does to you know kind of bump
things up in the next iPad it's
obviously not all about spec so if one
again expects a little bit more 1
gigabyte of RAM in the zoom 256 Meg's in
the iPad video playback on the zoom it
can do 1080p the tegra chip can do 1080p
on the iPad you're limited to 720p video
out you can get the dock adapter for the
ipad vga out whereas the zoom has a mini
HDMI built right in or micro HDMI
whatever they call it you have to have a
special cable which is kind of annoying
to an input a foolish in my cable on
there but you know that that's just kind
of how these things go i guess and then
you've also got mazal mention with the
porch you've got a USB to a tow port and
then you've got a microSD port or SD
card slot but the slot is disabled right
now which is kind of weak on the iPad
you know typical apple you have nothing
besides that one dock connector you can
get the camera connection kit that lets
you use an SD card you just got an SD
card reader to import videos and photos
but not you know straight up USB
connectivity</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
