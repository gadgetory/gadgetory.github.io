and TechnoBuffalo Here I am taking a
look at the brand new iPad pro this
thing is big and beautiful
so what you're looking at is a brand new
twelve point nine inch screen with a
really upped resolution of 2732 by 2048
gives it 266 PPI so there's a lot new
here about it the first thing you'll see
is those little three dock connectors
keep it a little sneak preview and talk
about in just a second that's a new
accessory dock all the way around the
tablet looking at the bottom of course
we've got the new second-generation
touch ID found right there for faster
fingerprint recognition that's being
powered by a new a 9 X processor which
is going to be one point eight times
faster than the 8 8 X that it's
replacing a graphic moment should also
do double pier as well and eppela say
this is faster 80% of the portable pcs
that shipped in the past eight months so
despite pushing a lot of pixels are
still going to get about 10 hours of
battery life on here though it's one of
the new things about it see the 2
speaker grilles on the top there are
also two speaker grilles on the bottom
you've got a brand new for speaker right
here our Chapel says should create a
really immersive sound talked a lot
about how speakers are sealed in and it
seemed to be pretty impressive this
thing is almost as thin as the current
generation iPad air is at six point nine
millimeters thin it weighs almost the
same at one point five pounds you pick
this up affect it to be on the heavier
side but it's certainly very manageable
available in silver space grey or goals
we're holding out for a rose gold model
you're not going to be able to get one
here
Mison can arrange in $7.99 to just a
little bit under $1,100 it's going to be
shipping in November so accessories are
going to come with this you're going to
get Apple Smart keyboard right here
which has a really very nice tactile
feel very similar to the keyboard on the
new MacBook that's because it's got the
same switch keys as the MacBook it's
covered in a woven fabric you can't even
tell that it's woven it feels like a
typical mechanical keyboard also of
course is the Apple pencil apple's new
stylus input device is going to be
available with this as well this will
not be shipping with the pencil that'll
be an additional
so multitasking is really big here on
the iPad for Microsoft a ten states
actually show some the cool things they
could do with in office we've got a word
document open here you go ahead and open
a web browser have full ensure bug or
pictures I've been able to do some
really nice multitasking it's built into
iOS 9 and with the 12 point 9 inch
screen built into the iPad pro it serve
as a very nice look and feel and then if
you want to dock it and go ahead and use
a smart keyboard and takes advantage of
that new 3 dot magnetic latch you go in
and type is like it would if you were on
a typical laptop take advantage of
multitasking switch between apps very
very simply and easily to interrupt this
video to let you know that John did not
record a sign-off so from all of us here
