go further what's up everyone jon
rettinger from TechnoBuffalo here we are
live from CES 2013 there's been a ton of
stuff that's been announced from 4k TVs
too crazy laptops and tablets but
chances are all that stuff is not going
to make its way into your house because
it's too expensive some of the stuff
that actually you might see into your
home from the show floor it's actually
right here we're with RCA and they are
showing some pretty interesting wall
adapters believe it or not that actually
I think we may end up picking up my name
is Ian guys I'm senior vice president of
product and marketing for box
accessories corporation and I think you
guys will really like these products
that we have to offer last year we
introduced this product which is a USB
wall plate nice easy plug-and-play
design it has two USB ports one of which
is 2.1 for tablets works really great
but most importantly is it's nice and
clean and simple how you plug it in and
then you leave it there so even if you
take out cables and you want to charge
your products later no problem but at
least it looks nice and clean on the
wall we've also introduced two new
models this year which we're very
excited about this one same
functionality is the first product but
what we've added here is an LED night
light below so it makes it really easy
to maybe navigate around a dark house
dark office and be able to find your
device really simply and then finally
the third product we have here is a
4-port USB wall plate so we have four
ports included four of which are full
one app capability to be able to charge
let's say for iPhones at once the second
thing though that we've added is two of
the port's have 2.1 capability so you're
able to charge tablets iPads Erie ders
etc all at full power or fast charge
your phone with 2.1 amps and finally one
of the things that we also added to this
product was a patented switch to be able
to toggle between all the different
charging circuitries that new phones may
present so whether it's blackberry or
it's samsung vs apple a lot of these
companies make changes from different
generations of phones and we've made it
very simple for the consumer to be able
to charge all those different devices
excellent thank you very much appreciate
the time you're welcome take care thank
you very much sync applink puts you in
command of some of your favorite apps
while on the go
sync applink allows you to stay in the
know with NPR's award-winning news app
navigate songs and stations on pandora
access slacker radio Steve's list of
stations or even keep up with your
favorite baseball team via the MLB at
bat app better yet you can launch and
control all of these apps with simple
voice commands sync applink is just
another example of forged commitment to
keeping you connected while on the go
