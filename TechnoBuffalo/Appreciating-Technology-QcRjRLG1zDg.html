to you by godaddy what's up everyone
welcome back there pisode of rettinger
drifts to show her i can just talk about
anything on my mind and I love have a
platform to do that so Morial day
weekend in the US just end it was a nice
three-day weekends is relaxing had a
chance to hang out and it kind of dawned
on me the age of technology that we live
in so obviously on technobuffalo we take
a look at some of the best electronics
in the world we take a look at android
iOS windows phones tablets computers
video game consoles and absolutely
everything we can come very
short-sighted i'm talking about the
folks that maybe get inflamed about
what's better apple or android lose
track of what these phones can do so
here's my story at home I've got a kevo
lock you don't know what that is made by
the folks at kwikset cinch it uses
Bluetooth low-energy Bluetooth 4.0 to
interact my lock didn't take out a key
on my pocket to unlock it i can just tap
it and the phone unlocks i got it for my
wife is usually walk into the door
holding bags and holding a baby and
fumbling with her keys in her purse was
hard they actually just tap the lock and
she can go on into the house and it
makes life a lot easier so we're leaving
the house I was able to lock the door to
my house I was able to unlock my car
remotely see if it's her on the air
conditioning to my car without having to
take out any device having picked out
keys or anything and just don√≠t
immediately this is incredibly cool time
we live in you know if we are on the
cusp of the Internet of Things on home
automation it sort of the internet
taking over everything from toasters the
cell phones it's a really cool time if
we get sidetracked on what you like
better iOS or Android which one handles
multitasking better which one's got
better we just realize what you have in
your pocket is the entire breadth of
information in the world with just a few
clicks or even just your voice you can
have access to anything that is going on
if you want to know what the GDP of
Brunei is you can ask your phone with
the GDP of Brunei as and know that
information within 20 seconds or less
even it is crazy what we have access to
right now and you know I'm guilty of it
too I look at a phone oh my gods only
720p that phone sucks are like oh it's
only got a low clock quad-core chip when
two gigs are am come on please that's
nothing and now you're looking at these
with these phones me the devices can do
these tablets can control your house you
can get access to anything you want it
can be your game console you can watch
TV on it movies you could stream that
movies to your television it is
mind-boggling I had sort of a step back
moment a moment of clarity I looked at
and I appreciate it what all these
things can do we regardless with operon
stood there running I think everybody
can't recognize highs advice changed our
lives I mean even just in that Ted
tagging took me to lock my house and try
their fishing to my card it was super
hot I don't
the maybe into a car that was probably
like 400 degrees in there it just sort
of dawned on me that we live in a really
incredible time where things are getting
faster and faster a quad HD phone was
just announced not going to be that long
before we have 16 core phones with eight
gigs of ram and two terabyte microSD
cards are coming it is just incredible
to be alive now and to see these things
so before you go yelling at people
before you go screaming that androids
better iOS is better call someone sheep
or a fanboy or Windows Phone fan or
whatever it might be just think about
these devices can do we put a little bit
perspective we take a minute from
talking about the wonders of the world
