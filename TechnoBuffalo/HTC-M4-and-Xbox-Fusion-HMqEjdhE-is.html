to you by Netflix welcome back to the
episode of rumor roundup I'm your host
John brand Jeff the title of the show
wasn't telling enough this is a show
where we round up all the tech rumors
from the week Galaxy Note 3 might have
an octa-core processor we're hearing
rumors of the HTC m4 it's gonna look
like a baby HTC One and iPhone 6
expected to pack a larger screen in 2014
Xbox fusion domains point to possible
names for the next-generation console
this rumor roundup let's go ahead get
started according to a trusted source
that spoke with Sam mobile the Galaxy
Note 3 won't only support nakta core
Exynos 5 processor but also ear
redonkulous octo-core mali 450 GPU with
eight cores
additionally the latest member of
Samsung's fabless family is set to sport
a Super AMOLED display 1080p three gigs
are amp I'll be writing the latest
iteration of Android whatever that's
gonna be at the time so whether it's 4.3
or 5.0 we will see soon enough currently
it is believed the Galaxy Note 3
introduced in September at IFA in Berlin
which makes super sense and that's where
the note 2 the original note made their
grand debuts I would use it as my next
phone can't get too big I want the
Galaxy mega I just want to feel like an
iPad up to my head and be just like
hello Dan we've heard plenty of chatter
in the past by HTC sm 4 and the latest
leaks suggest that it might actually be
some form of HTC One mini the device
looks pretty similar albeit smaller and
has lower specs but it's certainly a
good looking phone gadget is saying the
device is going to pack a 4.3 inch
display smaller than the 4.7 inch on the
HTC One it'll drop the resolution from
1080p to 720p we don't know what kind of
camera it's gonna have all those seven
leagues do suggest it's going to toss in
a 13 megapixel shooter well some others
are saying it might have the same four
ultrapixel camera HDC 1 HDC hasn't
confirmed the m4 even exist yet but
media and pundits and rumor hounds alike
a point to release sometime this quarter
iPhone 6th and I'm not talking iPhone 5s
here suppose Ian's gonna pack a larger
screen in 2014 even though Tim Cook said
oh no it's not gonna happen
but despite comments from the firm CEO
Jeffery's research analyst Peter misc
still believes the iPhone 6 will have a
larger screen in the iPhone 5 and the
iPhone 5s still low the sweet spot for
the iPhone has been that 4-inch arena
and if Apple does move to a bigger
display we imagine it won't be as large
as its competitors wondering what a
larger screen iPhones gonna look like
though check out these amazing renders
published last month looks pretty
gorgeous I think it makes sense that
we're gonna see a larger screen iPhone
eventually certainly Apple's got to keep
up with the competition but how big and
when has yet to be seen I would love a
5-inch iPhone it could be absolutely
perfect but I'm not cold my breath works
my face is gonna go super blue we don't
know much about the next-generation Xbox
but we might have a hint about what it's
going to be called so a brand new domain
registration ticket shows that Microsoft
has added the potential moniker it's
veneration Xbox so maybe we can stop
calling it the Xbox 720 now no probably
not yet this is still just a big fatty
juicy succulent rumor fusable a site
that essentially uses domain
registrations that piece together news
and rumors has discovered that
Microsoft's recently registered the
domain of Xbox fusion com thus the
rumors nose running crazy say next Xbox
going to be called the Xbox fusion of
course there are folks like our own Joey
Davidson who hopes this points to a
brand new Fuzion Frenzy game does that
game was awesome of course it's
obviously a rumor until now but well
know what Microsoft is gonna be calling
the next-generation console at the May
21st reveal that was previously
announced what do you want the
next-generation console to have last
week's we talked about what I thought it
might have in it so I want to hear what
you think what do you think the
next-generation Xbox is going to have
