TechnoBuffalo here's an unboxing no but
I think it's one of the best-looking
Android wear watches on the market this
is the far away watch the packaging
looks like a traditional watch more than
say like a phone box something it's
square and it's large
it's got some soft touch feel to it
let's go ahead and pull this top part
off there's a lot to talk about about
this watch and again this looks like
more of a typical watch box safe typical
electronics box I think it's what
they're trying to go for it's like this
opens up and we were presented with the
Koala watch there's a variety of
configurations for this guy ranging from
350 all the way up to 800 bucks the
stainless steel version is gonna be
priced at 350 but if you opt for a
leather strap while the metal bracelet
will bring the option up to about 400
bucks I'll have a choice of either steel
links or stainless steel mesh bracelet
you could also opt for a black coated
steel version which looks really nice
with the metal band for 450 and also
just English steel plated with rose gold
we're just gonna set you back 700 bucks
if you want a leather strap on that guy
be prepared to shell out $800 so get
them pull this off which went through
the pricing and it says inside a
timeless design smart within so that's
nice
and it looks hat tie down there there we
go I've got it off it's a little hallway
branded pillow and here is the hallway
watch looking for an upgrade from my
current watches I'm wearing this is the
watch or bane so this guy is going to
find a spot on my wrist put that down
quick sexy also got to have inside the
box
I think that's not where the accessories
are maybe over here is where they are
going to live so all the way bared
anything got a little pull strap we've
got some booklets really it's a high-end
experience opening us up you can really
tell that this is not really tell us is
a premium product swatch information and
some getting started guides we've got to
be charging puck in the watch just sits
right on top of that I'm so happy that
God and the Android wear date spell
units are plug in and adapter and plug
cords that daphnej just sort of drop it
on the puck and you're good to go
that's got USB on the other end and then
we've got
European charger I believe that's what
that is in here but of course you buy us
and I booked us adapter the folks at
qual way let us know this coming with
that I wanted to get it to us as quickly
as possible
let's go ahead and turn the watch on I'm
greeted by the hallway logo on the
screen I want to mention it as made of
two layer sapphire crystal so it should
be relatively scratch resistant
obviously not scratch proof but if you
run up against the wall or hit a side of
a table you should be pretty good a
diameter the entire watch casing is 42
millimeters which is the size at a
larger Apple watch it's a little bit
thicker at eleven point three versus ten
point five millimeters of case you for
cross drop it into because this will
that work with iOS as well as Android
you also can find traditional watch
elementary to really like including a
crown of frame and lugs the watch bands
here interchangeable and hallway offers
several options including stainless
steel and genuine leather and if you
really just want to do your own thing
and you want to put your own band on you
can slap on any band to lug with of
eighteen millimeters so they made it
pretty standard which is really nice
there's a little quick-release right
there if you want to just slide that out
you put in a watch band and here really
really easily the casing itself I
mentioned earlier come in three
different colors either gold silver and
black accommodate whatever taste you're
feeling like here the screen tie right
off the bat looks really nice specs
we've seen are pretty similar to other
Android wear but this circular full
circular screen no flat tire there as a
400 by 400 pixel resolution which is one
of the highest we've seen on any Android
wear watch one point four inches it's
emma LED display should be really extra
sharp it's going to have a really high
for watches 20 86 ppi pyrin this guy is
a Qualcomm 1.2 gigahertz Snapdragon 400
and includes 512 megabytes of RAM four
gigs of internal storage and a
relatively beefy for a watch 300 million
by hour battery the battery is rated for
two days but I assume that's only gonna
be with the always-on turned off but
getting through a full day is really all
that I would want to watch to I can
charge it at night I can't be checked at
80 percent them as well as 45 minutes
100% in 75 minutes between clew use that
included magnetic cable which is long
way to charge anyway let's go ahead and
pull this
sucker off and you can see the sensors
on the back heart rate monitor and the
charging dock and that's just it's
magnetic and see the pins there and the
pins there slap that sucker on and
you're good to go
I enjoyed you watch your vein but your
time is over
it's hallway watch time take you off my
wrist probably for the last time and see
the new gen do the new hotness is like
we have this deal with the leather band
it's kind of a more classic watch look I
really like it put it on it's it looks
like on a normal person's wrist which
which is mine I'm a normal person so it
looks nice it's a little bits on the on
the thicker side looking at it straight
on it looks like a typical watch and I
can tell you the screen here looks
really sharp and really crisp versus
really any other Android wear watch I've
used and I've used most of them I'm
excited to give this guy a shot it looks
really nice thank always got a winner on
their hands but of course you know that
could change as we do our full review
any questions you want to know what the
hallway watch I leave in the comments
down below I'll get it all set up and
working and I'll see what I can do until
next time jad range from TechnoBuffalo
