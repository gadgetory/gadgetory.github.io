a TechnoBuffalo we've already spent
hours fiddling with lighting
post-production making sure the sets in
the shots look absolutely beautiful
for the iPad pro we want to take a
different approach this past week I had
a very cool opportunity to travel to
Munich to test drive some of the latest
BMWs and what better chance to test
apples Pro device and actually use it on
the road so for this trip or nearly I
would have brought a laptop with me
respond to emails and run the business
instead the iPad pro became my only
computing the majority of my gave
whether I'm travelling or not is just
replying emails so I to make sure that
the iPad pro got handle that for the
trip I brought with me
the optional smart keyboard so I just
sat there and reply to emails typing at
first felt very unnatural on the
keyboard the keither was fine but felt a
little bit cramped and I could not
figure out why there isn't a home button
on the keyboard I would've loved
something like the BlackBerry pretty
I'll scrolling on the keys but it worked
didn't works well enough will do a ton
more coverage o on the keyboard
accessories
ever since Steve Jobs passing it's
become commonplace to wave the flag and
say Steve Jobs would have never done
this and to the best of my knowledge I
have never said that until I saw what
the keyboard case looked like will fold
it back I can say unequivocally and with
almost no doubt at all Steve Jobs would
have never put out a product that looks
like that from LA to Munich it's about a
12-hour flight so I loaded up the iPad
pro with TV shows and movies everything
that I've been wanting to watch but
haven't had a chance to just sitting
back relaxing and watching a movie on
that beautiful twelve point nine inches
blaze where the iPad pro shined it was a
great way to just catch up on everything
I've wanted to see that is until a food
came and then try to find a place to
store a twelve point nine inch tablet
somewhere what you've got a tray in
front of you I end up having to do
so balancing tablet on my lap while
leaning back on the table I was able to
work but it was not a comfortable
experience
just imagine try to catch up on agents
of shield while you're eating a pretzel
roll it's not easy or slowly enjoying an
airline salad this is kind of the
general experience the iPad pro screen
looks great but it's so big it becomes
unwieldy when you're out in public
spaces for the entire 12 hour flight the
iPad pro was the only entertainment
device I brought with me I was a bit
worried about battery life I charged it
up a hundred percent before I got on
that plane
my time I got off the plane after
watching for TV episodes in two and a
half movies sold over 60 percent left so
you're lying on this device to give you
great battery life it worked pretty well
and I had to brightness it up about 70
percent
as soon as Ron and I landed we were
filming an hour to half so after a long
day this wanted to relax and then catch
up on some videos to finish the movie I
started on airplane warning though
excessive chest hair head the iPad pro
is a bit too big to watch in bed it's a
little bit too heavy to hold over your
head like you put an iPad Mini or an
iPad air and when you're using the smart
Keyboard there is actually a comfortable
way to stand the thing up without having
it sort of rock and roll I ended up
swapping the smart Keyboard for the
additional Smart Cover please find
another way to prop it up and watch my
movie when you are watching a movie or
TV show or maybe a video on
TechnoBuffalo the new speakers sound
great there's four of them so demo sound
twice is good the next day was our only
full day of filming so Ron and I got up
early heading on over to BMW world which
looks like a museum to the cars and is
located right next to their headquarters
so figure is a good time to make our
shot list so we busted out the pencil
which there's no convenient place to put
it but it did work really well we're
able to create our shot list we would
highlight the pressure sensitivity
worked really well which for $1000 plus
and worked like a pen and paper so again
not sure why you wouldn't just use a pen
and paper
of course it's digital so you can email
a lot easier but I guess you could save
a couple bucks and just take a picture
of the pad that you just wrote on but if
you do want to splurge for the Apple
pencil it does work well so apples
positioning this is kind of a pro device
a device that can sort of replace a
laptop so that's what I tried to do in
my hotel room replying to emails and
running the site it was okay but a bit
cumbersome and sort of highlights I
think the shortcomings of iOS the iPad /
also highlights the best parts of iOS
multitasking worked as advertised I was
able to edit a Word document while
checking some articles on TechnoBuffalo
without any issue at all Apple packed a
ton of horsepower into the iPad pro the
a9x was really fast I was able to
multitask much better than I could on my
retina MacBook even the iPad pro isn't a
lot of ways limited by iOS I kind of get
the feeling it wasn't made for iOS 9
so what's coming next in iOS 10 so yeah
it would have been easier if I brought a
laptop with me or maybe I brought a
surface pro 4 but it wouldn't have been
close to as much fun it was cool to take
this device out in the field to use it
to test it like you guys would if you
wanted to drop close to $1,000 or more
for a spa fully SPECT Pro device and
speaking of that last word Pro I'm still
not sure what's Pro here and the
question that I always try to answer all
my reviews would I buy this I don't
think I would is it eventually going to
mature into a pro device I don't know it
could but I think your best bet is to
wait till gen 2 and see what happens so
let us know what you guys think did you
pick up an iPad pro have you liked it if
you not like did you return it I want to
know what your experience have been with
this device thank you guys for watching
until next time
I'm John R Ettinger from TechnoBuffalo
I'll see you next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
