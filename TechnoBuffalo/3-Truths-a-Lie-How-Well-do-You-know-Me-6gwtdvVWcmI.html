technology related or had a text wink I
thought I'd change it up a little bit
and play a little game with you guys
most you have been watching my videos
for a little while and I feel like you
know I've gotten to know you and maybe
you guys have gotten to know me a little
bit better so there's some videos going
around that tell you three truths and a
lie need to try and guess which one is
the lie so what I'm going to do is
pretty self-explanatory tell you four
things about me three much are going to
be true one's going to be false and you
have to guess which is which and to make
this more fun for everybody else post a
video response to this and make your own
three truths and a lie game so let me go
ahead and get started so the first one
is back after college so back in 2003 I
initially auditioned to be a sports
announcer that's what I always wanted to
do I really wanted to be involved in
sports and I thought amount it would be
a fun way to do it so the next thing is
as I come actually come from a very big
family I come from a family of six I
have two older sisters and one younger
brother the next thing is I used to do
stand-up comedy actually I did it all
through college and continued a little
bit out of college but worked and other
projects had caught up in a way and I
didn't have much time to do it anymore
and the next and final thing is I've
been with the same girl now for seven
years in june it'll be so a little over
six and a half years we met during my
last year of college and during her
second year of college she's two years
younger than me so been together for
quite a long time so those are four
things about me one of them are fake the
rest are true you guys to go ahead and
pick which one they'll make a video next
couple days or so telling you guys which
one is which or male do a video response
some way I'll let you guys know anyway I
hope you'll enjoy be sure to follow me
on twitter at twitter.com / john for
lakers i'll post the answer there first
before i do anything on youtube so if
you're not following me be sure to do it
there to get your answer and also don't
forget to leave your video responses
making your own three cheers and a lie
