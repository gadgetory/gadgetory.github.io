to you by atlassian what's good on
everyone jon rettinger whoa quack the
episode of ask the buffalos i'm sitting
here with video surgeon himself Ron
period off and we got a ton of questions
to run through one question we've gotten
quite a bit from twitter and youtube
comments about the s7 or the s7 edge I
review the s7 run to the s7 edge dude I
did so we're qualified to answer the
question yep the comparison between
these two it's I mean I think it's
different case by case really like you
have a couple variables your price you
have the edge itself your battery
capacity and then like to the look the
sweet looks yeah I I'm leaning more to
the s7 edge I mean you pay the little
bit of extra money you get bigger
battery capacity to the point where you
don't even so worried about charging and
really that often I think it looks
better than it has that sort of x factor
yeah devices hang it would get the edge
at speed asks are we getting new MacBook
Pros this year should I wait it out yes
wait yes we're getting a macbook pros
the design and that Pro has been around
since if memory serves 2012 two older
design due for an upgrade the 15 inches
two generations behind a processor 13
inches one generation behind skylake
chips are out and becoming readily
available or get better battery life
better performance you think they don't
change a design wait I'm gonna actually
go a little bit of a different answer
than that not only wait for others but
also take a look at what some of us have
razors doing I know it's completely
different OS but razors been killing and
coming up with some really interesting
innovative products Apple on the other
hand is uh foreshadowing to another
question so I'll leave it that just
check out razor at wash burgers 000
asked do you think it'll be worth it to
upgrade to the 9.7 inch iPad pro if you
already have the ipad air 2 well if one
were hit no I mean that's all you can
say right I don't know it got got
multitasking it's very clear as to why
yeah could you sideways the same device
unless you like oh I have to have the
pencil yeah that's what the keyboard
doesn't make sense to you use bluetooth
keyboard for third parties but it
doesn't make sense don't do it don't our
friend at Carlos mcse
asks his Apple lost its mojo yes I don't
want to jump to conclusions or anything
like that but honestly if you guys seen
my Apple rant video will link it above
or something like that I they're not
they've nothing to hit it on a good path
you can make feel a a shift in
perception of the company recently about
how people view Apple I mean it's very
noticeable there hasn't been a new
product line I guess say it for the
watch that sort of blown the tech world
out of the water in years like Apple
used to do similarly year after year
even the watch wasn't anything like
super newer ins anymore so just been
trying to catch up with the rest of the
industry has done and it wasn't executed
that well which is normally what Apple
sort of you know really does well on the
execution of devices so the apples lost
the groove but i'm confident they can
pull it Stella I'll get it how Stella
got her groove back the movie Oh at nah
man 3 where's the Buffalo there at n xu
baldeep 24 asks especially for Ron in
one word describe the joy of shooting
videos like cohesive is probably the
word like it's not there's another word
for that to explain it but the gist of
it is that when i get to do on camera
and the shooting and the editing of the
video and picking the music and it's
sort of this all-inclusive project it
gives me a lot of opportunity to sort of
be more creative and play around with
what i want to do because i don't have
to explain the idea to anybody else or
you know and and there's nothing wrong
with that but there's always going to be
something that's lost in the
communication when you communicate
creative ideas to somebody so I'm lucky
I'm in a very fortunate position where I
can keep a video all inclusive to myself
and that allows me to just kind of take
risk and I know what I'm capable of on
camera off of camera so I can play to my
strengths more it's just having that
whole package is the most enjoyable part
to me so cohesive is probably the word I
would choose and for me it's worth the
communication sign I love having a
platform to share opinion so being able
to have that opportunity to talk about
the stuff that I love and am passionate
about is the coolest part and how it
gets communicated in the way it's shot
just add to that message for me at Sasha
and Liam underscore asks would have been
both your favorite parts of being part
of and CEO of technobuffalo um one of my
favorite parts of being part of
technobuffalo has a lot of parts has
been
so what I just explained I love this
this recent sort of shift is really
being able to take over videos from
beginning to end and that's been like a
blast for me so that's been super fun
and my favorite part is just seeing a
dream become a reality yeah like a dream
that's like in a while the kid had to
like make a thing that became a thing is
uh it's really cool at rishabh pincher
asks how did you get into the team of
technobuffalo we've been over the store
a couple times now um I just cold email
john off the off the cuff and i was like
hey like yesterday automotive videos at
the time and I was like hey I do
automotive commercial work I want to I
want to try and see if we can do
something together drove up to have down
to irvine we dispatched shoot went well
and we're sort of in talks and
negotiations and then probably about a
year later almost yeah actually sort of
came on board in two and a half now I'm
here for two years yeah look I was three
years ago when we first spoke probably
child you were child I was a child I was
little I was 18 as a little 18 an old
man now so that was it for those
questions guys feel free to hit us up on
Twitter with any questions you have we
usually come with a good answer
sometimes not so good answers but we try
our best thank so much I'm run pretty
protective buffalo jon rettinger also
from the same place yep and we'll see
you guys next video thanks watching bye
hey Ron Ron well I guess you don't want
to meet your team's potential with
atlassian collaboration software but if
you do let me tell you about it you
could assign track and manage tasks for
any products no matter how complex and I
know you love complex projects Ron you
create and share content organized
results and bring team members up to
speed so when Andrew niven start
slacking you can just speed those
suckers up they got instant message or
video chat with your folks so you can
talk to them to know they're in the same
room they use hipchat so it's all going
to be integrated and look pretty cool
they're open teams from every industry
from startup to enterprise and they make
great ideas get real Ron if you decide
to come back and you want to maybe just
get some collaboration happening good
