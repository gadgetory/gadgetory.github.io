to you by the all-new G flex 2 from LG
life's good hey what's up everyone this
is Todd Hazleton from TechnoBuffalo I'm
here at CES 2015 checking out the 360
fly it's an action cam but it's sort of
unlike any action cam we've seen before
you might be familiar with GoPro or
Sony's this one shoots 360 degree video
with a 260 degree horizon so what is
that good for for all of your oculus
headsets or any kind of virtual reality
out there let's say you put look at what
this is like so the 360 fly features a
single lens and it shoots in the
resolution at slightly higher than HD
we're told of course full 360 degree
recording so if you're going down the
river and a kayak you can just record as
you go along and then when you get back
you can upload it to your Android or iOS
device to the web shared on social
networks and then view that video and
actually
around pan around that whole 360-degree
landscape to see the entire clip okay so
now when you have it up on your iPhone
you can just kind of hand around and
you'll see it's like going at 360
degrees so another cool way to use this
is actually instead of just panning
around yourself you can move your phone
in different directions to see what's
going on in the specific screen this is
sort of how it works with the oculus and
other virtual reality things because
you're moving your device in 360 degree
view as the video is playing in here
I'll just pan it a little bit myself so
we can change it okay so now I'm going
to see what it's like doing footage
recorded with 360 fly on a racetrack
through an oculus okay so that was a
quick look at the 360 flies toddies of
you guys for watching our coverage of
CES 2015 if you want to see all the rest
of the videos you can be coming out
