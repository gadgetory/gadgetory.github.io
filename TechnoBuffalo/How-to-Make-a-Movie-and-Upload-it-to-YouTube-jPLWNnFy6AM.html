you're at I'm sitting here writing
essays for business school and I kind of
needed to brake figure I make myself a
video to help you so one of the most
common questions that I get is how do I
upload a video to YouTube but how do I
make a video I just got this new Mac I
don't know how to do it
so what I'm going to do here is walk you
guys through the steps to upload a video
to YouTube using iMovie in this case I'm
using iMovie HD which is my preferred
version it's pretty simple pretty
simplistic it's just a general overview
of how to do it there's certainly more
details you can get into make them more
complex but this is all I really ever
use to upload videos and hopefully
they'll help you guys don't know how to
do it hopefully it'll spur you to create
your own YouTube account and start
making your own videos anyway guys enjoy
alright guys so the first thing you're
going to want to do is open up your
version of iMovie
I prefer iMovie HD but you can certainly
use iMovie o 8 as well if that's more
your flavor so we'll go ahead and open
that right up here you're going to want
to hit create new project and then it
pulls up a dialog box to name your
project so I'll name it capture video
showing how to capture it upload a video
now they create and again those little
red dots that shoot out when I hit a
button or from my screen capture
programs premium now it's loading the
video now it pulls up a main main screen
here and this is where your dual to your
work and iMovie HD move it to the middle
so I'm going to use my built-in iSight
and you can use an additional digital
camera if you have an they prefer if I
go right down here to that little icon
it looks like a camera to switch to
camera mode I'll click that I'm going to
hit built-in iSight if I had another
camera connected it would show up there
click it and there I am hello guys so
now you make sure your lighting is good
my lighting looks a little bit dark so
go ahead and you know you can turn a
light on or do it ever you want and now
you guys get the option here to record
with eyesight so I'm going to go ahead
and record a video that I would want to
upload to YouTube so I'll do a demo for
you guys here hey guys john here hope
you're doing well wherever you're at
something something something something
something something here's something
what do you think about something okay
so now I'm done recording my video I'm
hit this button again it's a record with
eyesight and that's it so now the video
is recorded and the clip see record show
up here on clips if you want to record a
new one you can just hit record I said
again and a new clip will show up right
here so now I want to take this clip I'm
going to drag it right down here where
it says drag Clips here to begin your
project
so that's not going clip I have right
now and it that with my whole video that
would be the whole video clip next I'll
go here to editing and again a whole
bunch of options for titles transitions
video effects and audio effects so for
titles you can pick a ton of them the
one I usually use for the Jean for
Lakers production is subtitles subtitle
stripes you can give a little example of
what they all look like pops up right
there can you straight subtitles torille
um and you can pick all kinds of stuff
and you're like actually I kind of like
that one so we'll stick with that one
for this video so in all I do is I just
hit add down here and again you if you
have an option to set your speed and
length in hit add there it is now it
shows up but now if you notice between
these two scenes right here there's no
transition so I want to add a transition
so from black to my video I'll go right
up here to transitions and I'll pick one
that I like let's pick ripple is kind of
cool so I'll take a ripple and I want to
be a transition between Clips so I'll
drag it right in between now it's going
to render alright so now it's there and
again this just a very simplistic
overview of how to make a video
obviously you can do a lot more in
detail you have more video effects that
you can add we've got a lot of audio
effects you can add sound but I'm just
going to try to give a real quick
overview for the novice user who wants
to just upload a video using their Mac
so now I've got this video mate I'm
going to have to go ahead and save it so
I'll hit file and then export and what
that'll do is it'll take it from the
iMovie format and it'll convert it to a
file that I can upload to iTunes or I'm
just giving me - to youtube so compress
this movie this is where a lot of people
get get in trouble compress this movie
for web and what that will do is will
shrink it down to a size that YouTube
will allow you to upload it to so press
the web I'm going to hit share now what
I want to call it
again I'll just call it capture video
and I'll show up as I believe a dot MOV
so it's compressing it should take a
couple minutes depending on how long
your video is it's not too bad I make
sure you know what you save it to so
I'll go ahead and let this finish
loading we'll do it all in real time all
right so I can go ahead and just
minimize this and here's my new capture
video capture video mov drag it right to
the middle so you guys can see it I
shall leave right here and I want to
upload that to YouTube so what I'll do
is I'll go to Firefox or Safari whatever
browser browser you use and go to your
YouTube account and so here's my YouTube
account sure the page you guys are all
familiar with and they'll go right up to
the top to hit upload now you enter the
title of your video so screencap
description type in whatever you want
video category you can choose from
myriad of categories I usually to
science technology type your tags Apple
pick one Apple MacBook iPhone computers
all right then I hit upload video and
since I'm a partner of an option to
submit this video for revenue sharing I
hit browse and I just go and find the
video it canceled here and just hit
upload and that's it it'll show up right
on my page so guys it really is very
easy to upload a video to YouTube that's
a real quick overview of how to do it I
hope it was helpful and I'll see you
guys in my next video talk to you guys
soon bye alright guys I hope that was
helpful be sure to check out wwg on for
Lakers comm again are always looking for
new writers so if you like to contribute
