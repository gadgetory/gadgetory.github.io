going to talk about the t-mobile keynote
today John Legere the CEO says he wants
to redefine a stupid broken arrogant
industry so did he so the t-mobile event
was held today in New York City it just
ended and a lot of interesting things
coming out of there I've got some
numbers available LTE is now across a
hundred and sixteen markets and covers
or reaches 157 million people so that's
pretty good definitely a faster rollout
than we've seen from the likes of say
sprint which actually t-mobile kind of
was going for the jugular on sprint
there they were a lot harder on sprint
than the other two major carriers and
then they went on to talk about two-year
upgrades so the big news out of this
keynote or this event was that they are
starting what they're calling the jump
program it allows anybody on tmobile
with a paid plan to pay ten dollars a
month instead of the eight for current
insurance and this ten dollars a month
would then enable you to every six
months upgrade your device because this
ten dollars a month covers insurance now
you will have to pay a deductible
whatever that is for your device before
you're able to upgrade so let's say in
six months you drop your beautiful
iphone 5 and the screen cracks but you
want a new iphone 5s anyway so you bring
it in you got to pay the deductible on
that phone and then you would pay the
ninety nine dollars or one hundred
ninety nine dollars or the two hundred
ninety dollars depending on what model
and what hard drive size that you wanted
for your iphone if that makes any sense
I know team will be like say these
things are simple but they rarely are
especially in the US carrier industry so
we'll try to explain this as best as I
can now let's just say that you've had a
phone for five months and you go gosh I
have this iphone 5 I just got it and six
months later know the iPhone 5s is out I
want to upgrade it but there's nothing
wrong with my device you can do that you
can now walk into a tmobile store and if
you've been a member of the jump program
for six months you can trade in your
iphone 5 and get a 5s or you can
upgrade to any phone at subsidy price so
you can't just trade so you bring it in
and then you would pay let's say ninety
nine dollars for an iphone 5s for 16 gig
iphone 5s you'd be able to do that so
they want people to know that they will
pay the same amount as a new customer
would so if you consider it that way
it's not a bad idea I think it's
interesting I think there's a lot to be
said for the quickness of phone releases
compared to our upgrade cycles which are
crazy slow I will agree with CEO John
Legere on that nobody wants to wait two
years to get a new cell phone and a lot
of times things happen to your phone you
lose it it gets stolen you drop it in
water all these things happen and you
have to deal with kind of a broken phone
for a really long time if you don't have
the money to pay for an unsubsidized
device so this is a very interesting
thing that t-mobile is doing on the
subject of phones t-mobile talked about
exclusivity and the Sony Xperia Z so
it's a really interesting device if you
want to check it out we have an unboxing
on the site and before the event they
also announced that the Nokia Lumia 925
the variant of the 920 that is available
on t-mobile will be going on sale for
4999 if you're a new customer or if you
have a paid off device and want to
upgrade so really interesting stuff
happening over at t-mobile really
excited to see what they do in the next
coming months I want to say that
obviously we're going to have more LTE
rollout hopefully and I'm really excited
about the jump plan are you are you
going to use this is this something they
are interested in I personally think
these 24 month upgrade plans are crazy I
feel even worse for you guys in Canada I
have to sign three-year contracts that
is nuts so hopefully this will change
the game I'm not sure if it's going to
change the way consumers deal with
carriers or the way carriers deal with
consumers that kind of remains to be
seen but at the end of the day at least
somebody's trying to change the industry
so kudos to tmobile for that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
