TechnoBuffalo and in this video we're
going to take a look at the internet
browsing experience of the iPod Touch
3rd generation compared to the new Zune
HD so let's launch the internet browsers
on both on the Zune HD it's simply
called Internet on a tap on that and go
to Safari on the iPod Touch now what
you're going to notice right off the bat
is that the Zune HD actually makes a
really good use of screen space so the
only buttons that occur happen on the
bottom strip so we have a favourites
button that allow you to go to a variety
of favourites or add a new favorite we
have a back button that's dimmed out
right now we can search although it only
uses Bing to search you can't change
your search provider and then we can tap
on the little strip to bring up the
address bar and we can use the really
interesting keyboard here and we're
going to go through that in a second to
type a URL whereas on the iPod touch you
have a lot more screen space being used
by system elements such as the
notification bar at the top and the
address bar in the top of Safari and the
whole button bar along the bottom when
you're on a mobile device screen space
is at a premium and I really like how
the Zune HD has made really good use of
the limited screen space that it has ok
so let's see which which web browser is
faster in loading Engadget so here we go
one two three looks like the iPod Touch
is almost done and here comes the Zune
HD the iPod Touch is finished the Zune
HD is not done yet the Zune HD is a
little bit slower it's still not done
I'm actually surprised at how long it's
taking but let's see how it is rendered
various elements on the page I know it's
tough to see here but the the OLED
screen on the Zune HD makes for a very
very sharp and clear picture and the
colors are just super vivid let's take a
look at screen rotation speed well zoom
out a little bit to do that screen
rotation speed on the Zune HD is rocket
fast much faster than the iPod touch
and you get the point let's take a look
at how these devices resize columns when
you double tap to zoom in so I see some
text underneath of this picture of a
phone and I'm going to do likewise over
here so double tap okay resized it quite
well double tap resized it quite well
although it's much easier to read on the
ipod touch still flick down to see how
fast it redraws the screen redraws the
screen a little bit faster on the ipod
touch although I think that's because
the flick is taking it down not as far
the Zune HD lets you go a little bit
further there about pretty much equal of
course the Zune HD has a capacitive
screen so it has multi-touch you can
zoom in like so and of course you can do
that with the iPod touch and let's click
on something else thank you
looks like the soon HD didn't even
register that screen press there goes
and it's almost done it looks like it's
still loading but we can use the page
now so double tap to zoom in double tap
to zoom in again the text on the iPod
Touch is more readable
I think that's attributed to it having a
wider resolution 320 across vs. 272
pixels across so let's take a look at
how it renders another webpage
let's do Amazon so go down here Amazon
go into the favorites list and here I'm
gonna do at the same time here we go the
ipod touch finished about two seconds
before the Zune HD the Zune HD actually
remembered where I was last time on the
page I was actually on this page earlier
and I was in the upper left corner view
these in landscape
now something that the Zune HD can't do
that the iPod Touch can do is have
multiple screens multiple tabs open at
one time so obviously with the iPod
Touch you can add a new page and go to a
different website you can't do that on
the Zune HD they want you to look at one
web page at a time which kind of makes
sense it's a very multi media centric
device it's not trying to be an awesome
amazing internet browsing device so
let's see what it's like to enter a URL
upon these in HD let's talk about the
keyboard so let's say we want to go to
is modem so GI z mo do very easy to use
keyboard unfortunately it does not work
in landscape now unfortunately by
default the Zune HD loads the mobile
version the watered-down version of web
sites and a lot of websites these days
have mobile versions they're basically
like RSS feeds they just give you the
headline sometimes a little bit of text
you don't get the full experience there
is no way to turn this off unfortunately
except for finding where it says click
here to view the classic Gizmodo most
mobile web sites have a link right to
that to the desktop version of the site
and here Gizmodo is coming through quite
slow so HD doesn't have flash support
just like the iPod Touch so you're not
gonna be able to watch hulu movies or
even youtube and it's about done loading
here
something I found really annoying about
the Zune HD - problems of the internet
browser one when you go back into the
internet browser it has to reload the
page completely it doesn't store it in
memory like the iPod Touch and show you
the last website you were looking at
number two getting out of the web
browser is slow not sure it's gonna do
it here but I'm gonna go to the home
screen and we get a blank screen for a
good four five seconds which is kind of
a long time to get out of a program
hopefully in future ROM updates this
will get a little bit faster and finally
there are some settings for the web
browser let's go down to settings not
that many though go to Internet we can
delete history if you don't want people
to know where you've been you can have
cookies enabled and script enabled or
disabled I'm I'm assuming that turning
it off would make the browser a little
bit faster
so overall the Zune HD s web browser is
quite good
it features extremely fast screen
rotation really good rendering fidelity
with multi-touch and the screen makes
the colors really pop the OLED screen
that also is a very minimal interface
that helps to really make good use of
the limited screen space that is
characteristic of a mobile device that
said it's not as fast as the iPod Touch
in terms of loading the page it doesn't
let you have multiple tabs open at one
time and also the shutdown and the time
it takes to turn on the web browser open
the web browser is a bit too long
hopefully we'll see refinements on these
issues in future roms and future
versions of the Zune for now it's pretty
darn good to start that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
