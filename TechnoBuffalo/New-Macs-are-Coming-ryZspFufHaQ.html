technobuffalo here it's that time of
year again for updated macrumors so sit
down relax and I'll run through what to
expect John Gruber from daring fireball
has got a fantastic track wicked or
predicting new Mac hardware saying that
as early as tomorrow we can finally see
updated imax mac pro cinema displays
into new accessories so let me go ahead
and run down what we're going to see or
possibly see the lower end of the imac
family is using a core two duo chip it's
widely expected that this lower end will
adopt Intel's newer faster core i3 trip
currently the faster i5 and i7 s are
available in the imax but again the
lower end using the core 2 duo
presumably will also see updates to the
i5 and i7 so pretty much every imac
through the line will get a spec bump i
don't think we're going to see any sort
of touchscreen like being paired river
in the path I'm we're going to see in
your redesigned cases probably just an
internal spec bump which is fantastic
next we may finally see an update for
the very long in the tooth what's
supposed to be a flagship desktop the
mac pro it seems like this is the
forgotten child of the Apple lineup
listening has been sitting stagnant for
many many many days without an update
while Apple still charging the same
price form so hopefully those power
users out there will finally get
something new and some decent value for
their computer dollar additionally there
are rumors and this is sort of probably
less substantiate that we may also see
the introduction of apple's magic
trackpad me give it like the glass
trackpad which is multi-touch capable
that you see in the macbook and macbook
pros just externally for desktops and
perhaps laptops as well you have us a
bit more control over what you're doing
perhaps leaving use some sort of pen
input for graphic designers certainly
ologist are sort of a speculation at
this point also we're thinking that
there may be a new cinema display a
27-inch variety with the 16 by 9 aspect
ratio so why train cinema displays look
gorgeous they're beautiful but they are
not inexpensive they are very very very
expensive for what they do but if you
were in the mark
for a new monitor and you have the money
to spend certainly a new 27 inch monitor
would be quite nice presumably it will
look very similar to what the new IMAX
look like so look for that as well so
are you been waiting for a new imac a
new Mac Pro a pneumatic trackpad or a
new cinema display on hear from you what
you think about these presumed updates
are you excited not excited can you not
care less and you're sick of all the
apple news I just want to know what you
guys have to say i'm jon rettinger from
TechnoBuffalo stay in the next video bye
bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
