TechnoBuffalo here it's been about a
month since we reviewed the BlackBerry
z10 I've had much more time to play with
it get a chance to know the phone even
better than I did after the few weeks
before we did our review so I want to
share my thoughts and opinions as you
decide whether or not the BlackBerry z10
should be right for you on the dawn of
its debut on the US carriers let's go
ahead and get started all right so here
is of course a blackberry z10
and as a refresher it is the first phone
the BlackBerry has released running a
new operating system and that is
BlackBerry 10 and that's still a lot of
the story here so I talked about the
review there are a lot of things I like
about the phone a few things I didn't
like and for the most part those still
hold true I really do like the screen
still a 4.2 inch screen is beautiful
resolution webpages load great text
looks beautiful a surprisingly nice
screen what I didn't notice when I did
the first review was viewing angle on
the side is not as sharp as been on
other phones and viewing in direct
sunlight is absolutely abysmal you can
see the glare here so if you are outside
you're gonna have to try and really
adjust the brightness find a level it's
going to work
to see what's on in the screen so I
still really like the gestures it took
me about four days is to get used to the
home button that's essentially that
swipe up and I really got used to it I'm
really expecting most phone
manufacturers to ditch physical home
buttons it Altima LIGO the sort of
gesture route but I think blackberry
here absolutely nailed it
blackberry peak is still one of my
favorite features as you go ahead and
take your finger and scroll up you can
see notifications for what you've got
and if you pull your finger over to the
left you can see all of your information
in your BlackBerry hub which we'll talk
about in just a minute that's still one
of the best things about the device
continuing the user interface become
more intuitive as I've used it I've
learned where things are a little better
had some muscle memory I used to keep
always sort of scrolling and looking for
different settings now I can remember I
can pull this down and I can go and
access the settings right from there I
like keep thinking notification should
show up there perhaps from all my time
I've spent with Android built quality
here is still been very outstanding I
like the way the phone feels it is
plastic but a few
extremely solid the back which is
removable sits flush with the batteries
I don't have any sort of gap that could
make a plastic phone feel of less
quality this volume control button sir
in the middle which does some muting has
been really hard to push a minor coil
but one to notice the volume controls I
really like the placement of them the
power and lock button in the middle of
the phone has been a bit of an annoyance
I keep maybe it's personal thing from
having tested so many phones but I'm
used to it either being here or up top
on the right-hand side the middle takes
a lot of getting used to again small
complaint but something to bear in mind
when the biggest issues I had with the
phone was the lack of applications
that's still the case now a month later
mostly apps I use are here but some of
the ones that I really rely on including
Instagram are not actually lack of
Instagram is why I switched away from
using the z10 other applications will be
coming for example whatsapp which you
see right there was not purchased from
or downloaded from blackberry stores
side-loaded
via the Android installer so something
to keep in mind it's stored or works not
a hundred percent so apps like that
should be coming hopefully sometime soon
I mentioned in my review the calendar
that sometimes we crashed I tried to add
a new item and that still is true about
fifty percent of time when I try and add
a new item here it'll work the other 50
percent of the time it's going to crash
I got to reopen it back up again the
browser here is still as impressive as
it was when I first tested things load
really quickly the HTML tests on it show
it's actually one of the faster browsers
out there and I've had no issues with it
at all and that's a big compliment what
Blackbird is done because the previous
browsers were absolutely visible most
using this I really noticed no
difference between browse the internet
on iOS or Android it's just that good
we'll go ahead and go home
I love the multitasking I love these
panes that sort of show new things so I
had the calendar application open you'll
see that it's created almost a live tile
and telling me it 45 minutes I've got a
revision three status update call if you
want to close those I still wish you
could swipe them off the screen if you
got hit that little tiny X which can be
sometimes hard to hit I thought the
keyboard is awesome at first of the
review I am now absolutely in love with
the keyboard is outstanding from the
placement of the frets to the learning
what you want to type to be able to
swipe words right up on the screen is
solutely incredible this is hands down
the best on-screen keyboard I have ever
used and it gets more enjoyable as you
use it there's a heat sensor below the
screen actually will sense your contact
point so if you always type I would mean
to type you it will learn where you're
going and it will adjust it accordingly
and it works really well and it learns
very fast so from a keyboard standpoint
I did expect for pretty much all
BlackBerry's they hit this sucker out of
the park overall I've really still been
enjoying using the phone a lack of
applications is still my biggest
complaint a battery life that started
off outstanding during this review has
degraded a little bit when I comes time
to end of the day now I'm generally
below that 20% mark so that's where it
gets to be a little bit nervous time but
I definitely use the phone more than
most so if you're not a heavy user
something you're going to want to keep
in mind email here still absolutely
outstanding it comes through almost
immediately quicker on my blackberry
than it ever was on a desktop
application so pretty cool for there as
well I'll go ahead and go home I still
really like the BlackBerry hub as well
you can browse through all of your
inboxes they're opening up that API to
other third-party applications it just
works well it's a great way to see a
unified inbox so that has still been
very impressive to use and I said it was
the best first generation operating
system that I've ever used and that's a
huge compliment this is a polished OS
this is a modern OS this is an OS that
is scalable and has a tremendous amount
of potential it's still suffering though
from sort of new operating system woes
and that's developer support and I think
the success and ultimate success of
blackberry and BlackBerry 10 is gonna be
the hands of developers and I still
think that blackberry world can get up
and running and get the applications
that the other operating systems have
the future is gonna be very bright for
blackberry this is a great phone that
works very well however I still have a
hard time recommending it I just don't
know if I trust blackberry to be around
in two years continue to supporting the
phone I would wait probably about four
months to see what blackberry comes out
what they said they won't release up to
twelve new devices here throughout the
course 2013 so see what comes
I check out the q10 see how the company
is doing I would be very wary to pick up
a device that I didn't know was
and be supported over the duration of a
contract now that being said if you want
to pick one of these up unlocked and use
it for over long you want to use it this
is going to be a great phone to try out
there are plenty of places to buy them
the prices are dropping on it it's a
really enjoyable phone but it's hard to
recommend it over iOS or Android it's
not better than either of those I would
say it's close to on par but loses
points again from that app support
something to keep in mind I'll take you
guys thoughts on blackberry 10 if you
picked one up if you've used a z10 Oh
without you agree or disagree what your
favorite features are I love to hear
