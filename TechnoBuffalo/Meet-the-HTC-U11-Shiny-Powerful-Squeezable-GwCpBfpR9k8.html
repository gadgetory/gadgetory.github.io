they get cranked up to 11 meet the
latest from HTC this is the U 11 but one
seem to be going longer in thinner with
like a two by one a sec ratio or like a
two point seven six five by 1.2 it's
like to see just a normal aspect ratio
phone it is a big phone though it's not
for for tiny baby hands or for just
normal adult hands but is a 5.5 inch
quad HD screen
it's got Corning Gorilla Glass 5 all
over it so should be pretty protective
but if you plan on getting it wet or or
dusty no this only has IP 67 so
obviously this is a very design centric
phone it is extremely glossy in fact if
you want to use it like a mirror like
the old palm trees back in the days with
this thing around pretty much any color
save for the white which looks beautiful
but not coming to the US you can use
just as a reflection or like to blind
somebody usually comes along with really
glossy backs fingerprint D so you don't
want to keep a microfiber cloth with you
HTC did pack a lot on the software and
the specs side so it is Android 7.1
which is really nice and it's HTC Sense
that's not the only sense that's in here
the big stories that you 11 is the edge
sense such as you can squeeze the phone
you can almost use it like two separate
buttons a short press can be anything
you want to launch the camera you can
launch a web browser they made it really
customizable and a long squeeze can
watch something else so you essentially
get two separate buttons so having to
find and locate two separate buttons on
the film in our testing it works really
well it's kind of fun to set up don't
know how useful it's going to be on a
daily basis but if you want extra
buttons you find yourself looking for
shortcuts it's a really ingenious way to
do an HTC did a nice job putting it
together it also packs pretty much the
latest specs it's got a snapdragon 835
in there it's got 4 gigs of ram 64 gigs
of storage is the only storage option of
course you can up that with a microSD
card outside of the u.s. though you're
going to get a different version if you
want you get 6 gigs ram or 128 gigs of
storage the people who have had like a
mixed feeling towards HTC's cameras
they've done some cool stuff ultra
pickles in the past and they've kind of
reverted back but the camera looks to be
really nice and our initial camera test
the pictures it was pretty good it's a
12 megapixel ultra pixel 3 sensor
the latest camera stuff they'd expect
safe detection self-timer
dual LED flash f1 points of an aperture
HDR boost 4k video recording the front
camera really packs megapixels it's a 16
megapixel sensor it's got a live make up
feature auto selfie voice selfie we've
got a self timer for 10 seconds HDR
boost selfie panorama and full 1080p
video recording so a really nice selfie
camera before I talk about sound um
should get this one out of the way
no that's phone Jack know what going in
we love it or hate it I create a plug
your headphones in unless they are USB
see but HD does do a lot with sound it's
high-res certified hecu sonic with
active noise cancellation HTC boomsound
hi Fayed ition so got the extra 5 you
know it's going to sound pretty good HTC
has done a really awesome job of audio
fidelity in the past so I expect even
better performance from you 11 on the
battery side its 3000 milliamp hours I
feel kind of the same way I do about
that as I do about the lack of a
headphone jack
HTC claims we get about 24 and a half
hours or so of talktime and up to 14
days of standby time and of course all
the other Qualcomm quick charge stuff it
expected here like quick charge 3.0 you
also added extreme power saving mode so
this is the HTC new 11 it's glossy it's
shiny it's big bold and is hopefully
HTC's come back I'm gonna reserve
judgment so I get a chance to actually
play with it we only got some hands-on
for real few minutes the screen looks
bright the camera looks pretty solid how
it all comes together in a package you
use on a daily basis you have to be
determined to being able to squeeze the
phone and something very new got to
retrain your brain to the grip and grab
when you are gripping and grabbing the
phone does feel really nice in the hand
HGT spent a lot of time clearly trying
to make the screen to the back view
almost bezel listen to feel like you
can't find a theme with your finger and
you can't the build quality a typical
HTC fashion is awesome
whether or not just the phone for you I
can't answer yet I want to get one
though and technical buffle offices will
test it and will let you know what we
think if you wanted to test anything in
particular
leave in the comments down below if you
want to see that full review is a video
a thumbs up to let us know you want a
review of the HTC EU 11 so next time and
John Ranger some TechnoBuffalo
