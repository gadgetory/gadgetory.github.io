another pre feature video this time it's
tweed a new twitter client for the pre
and this is a free download from palms
app catalog let's go ahead and open it
up so there it is tweed this is actually
a relatively full-featured application
I've been quite happy with it let me
give you a demonstration so you get a
splash screen the first thing you'll see
is a search all tweets you can search by
people or topic it really is almost like
a universal search for Twitter you'll
see two icons on the left and right on
the left one that is to create a new
tweet and that is present throughout all
the menu options and all different
screens in Tweed and the right one is to
refresh so let's go ahead look at this
home button right there and you have a
whole bunch of options to where you can
go home trending topics favorites direct
messages Pat replies my tweets bookmarks
and public is kind of neat it takes you
to see all the tweets in the
Twitterverse I know a lot of mobile
twitter clients have this but it's
always fun to see what other people
maybe don't know are up to me if you
could see somebody good that you'd like
to follow let me show you one of these
screens here they're all pretty
self-explanatory we'll hit my at replies
quick second refresh and there you are
at a knack reply you notice that it says
right up top where you are so now it
says I am at the replies if you hit it
again you can go back anywhere you want
and we can go to trending topics so I go
back to home and it's a very smooth
scrolling now let's say there's a tweet
you want to open so here's one for from
Brandon minimun so we click it you can
choose to favorite it I just did you can
add reply you can retweet or since my
name was in it it pulls up the at
replied so you can send a message to
that person or it will open up a web
browser because there was a link in that
tweet as well if you go to one that
wasn't a retweet and there's just a
straight message like here's one from
Andrea Tunes you get a smaller message
you can favorite at reply or just simply
retweet and we'll go back here and
that's really all there is to tweet it's
very simple nice application
we've got a few settings and preferences
you can choose whether or not you want
messages to display on this little menu
bar across the bottom the notifications
otherwise that's really it it's nice and
easy it's simple and it works most
importantly and we guys just another
palm pre feature video this time tweed
Twitter client for the pre hope you
enjoyed for exclusive content we should
have follow me on twitter twitter.com /
