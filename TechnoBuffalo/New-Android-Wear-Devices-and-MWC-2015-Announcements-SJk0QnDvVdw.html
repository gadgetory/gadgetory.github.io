brought to you by domain.com what's up
everyone what back there pisode of acid
buffalo i'm your host jon rettinger and
i am actually on vacation this week but
that does not mean our questions to be
answered actually i'm on vacation with
my whole family so we've got five kids
going with us three kids under 3 so we
can play a game if i look more rested or
less rested when i get back in a week
probably less rested but enough about me
let's talk about you our first question
comes from at manish checks who s at
john for lakers what a 4.5 inch iphone
the same resolution as the six have been
better any chance we'll see one been
better I assume you're talking about
been better than the iphone 6 maybe i
would say that is not going to happen i
would file that under the nah nope rumor
ain't gonna happen apple just reported
quarterly earnings and they sold all the
iphones not just like an exaggeration
they sold all the iphones they blew away
earnings they have very little reason to
now offer a lower cost phone to offer a
third form factor to have to fragment
the OS any more than they already have i
would say chance of that happening are
between this and this which side of me
looking like a towel mean 0 next one
comes from at MTG 2016 who asked at john
for lakers what are you looking forward
to most during Mobile World Congress so
two things that I think we know about
rumors at this point the HTC One m9 are
calling it and the galaxy s6 the two
phone looking most forward to we've seen
a lot of leaks on the m9 I've loved
HTC's design hoping that they serve tea
to evolve that looks like they're gonna
have two different versions HTC m9 and M
9 plus 2 plus having a fingerprint
sensor and probably being a little bit
larger beyond that what sense is going
to look like with lollipops going to get
a complete rehal or if it's going to be
less 7 cm more sure android and of
course what Samsung's going to do if
we're crazy rumors about the galaxy s6
things rainy friends gonna have two
curved screens to the back is going to
have some weird plug where you can
actually put in back panels that do
different things like an e-ink back
panel
back panel to check your blood glucose
level if you're diabetic a back panel
that you put on other lenses on the
camera all kinds of stuff and I want to
put those rumors to rest I'm excited to
see what those two guys have to offer as
well as surprise that couldn't come from
out of it things may be lenovo's got
something LG announcements and other
manufacturers next one comes from Ed
Brendan Quinn to who asked at John for
lakers you're going to a new design from
the galaxy s6 is going to have Android L
well I kind of touching that a little
bit yes it will have Android L yes it'll
be a new design Samsung's been talking
about starting from scratch or doing the
designs but until I see it actually
released I'm very reticent to bleep it
the designs have been very evolutionary
flick at the orig original galaxy s
phone to the current one you clearly see
a clear design language so I'd say what
we're going to see is going to be an
evolution of that if I will have that
oval home by the fingerprint sensor
probably made a little more premium
materials are probably thinner but aside
from that I'm not weighted you're gonna
be a huge difference I don't think we're
gonna say two curved edge screens on the
Galaxy s6 you might see it on a new line
of curved phones but for those part but
to look pretty much the same Sydney you
guys love it let me just stop the video
just super fast thank our peeps at
domain com its place to go and your next
big idea is going to hate you listen we
