Hazleton the TechnoBuffalo checking up
the Galaxy Note 3 here this has one of
the accessories on it it's falling out
of my hand you get the brilliant 5.7
inch display here under the hood you've
got three gigs of ram and get the
Snapdragon 800 processor I believe my
children's popped a cat freaked my left
hand sighs I got the phone controls the
3.5 millimeter headphone jack up top
looks like an IR blaster Jews on the
right-hand side you've got the power
button and then this brilliant home
screen here and I really want to show
you real quick last class we saw the
gear apps it's for their gear apster
that's for the galaxy gear smartwatch
good line my fitness path runtastic trip
their pocket everything else there swipe
up from the bottom let's get into the
new news feeds to the my magazine
feature here turns it on and off yeah
which also includes personal pictures
like whatever that guy took a picture up
here in now content linking accounts to
social networks and more so Knox is one
of those other features that also
included Galaxy gear is connected and
that's on a watch we haven't has been
working here now so you go through the
menus here and pick them up in any point
so use s finder to search around your
device
use the pen window which is allowing you
to draw windows I'll show you that in a
second screen right for drawing on
screen scrapbooker and action on the
sill go see action memo will bring up a
screen where you can see what's up so
and create a memo you can get rid of it
so now we have Air Command open in
another application so we can go to
scrapbooker click that and say hey like
we want to save that for later
slowly but surely it saves that you do a
scrapbook for revisiting at another time
let's try another example here we bring
it up let's go to screen right that'll
allow us just takes a screenshot we can
draw all over the screen to a little
closer it's probably better if you have
like a map or something like that where
you want to circle an address let's try
to get hard to bring up that menu right
now we have it open for s fonder so s
finder brings up the option to search
through anything so you're kind of seven
days you know it's your handwriting
anything like that which we've already
saved so that's kind of you want to do
that let's go back and check out the
last option of this action menu music
honestly a pain to bring up here yeah
be nice
and the last ones pen window and this is
really cool so any point you can just
draw the window you want and then choose
an application that will launch inside
that window so we have YouTube
calculator clock contacts hangouts the
browser so we'll do the cup calculator
and then it creates it populates that
rectangle we had with the option there
that we already selected we'll try it
again for fun
it's not it opens up YouTube you can
then use inside any application here
recent notes here this is a new feature
Samsung hub of course that's where all
of the multimedia comes from Flipboard
we've seen that in the past walking me
group play seeing all of these on the
galaxy s4 devices so overall what we
really like about is at this screen it
has a really small bezel device doesn't
feel that big I mean it's pretty big and
all right now with the 5.7 inch screen
and the smaller bezels it's not terrible
on the back this unit you've got the 13
megapixel camera and this leather case
angel all the devices don't actually
have but it does have sort of a leather
feel around it which I'm sure you've
seen in our shorter hands-on video
I mean anyway that's a quick look here
