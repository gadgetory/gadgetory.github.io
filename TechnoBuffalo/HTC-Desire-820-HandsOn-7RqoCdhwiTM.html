from TechnoBuffalo and originally going
to do an unboxing of this guy the HTC
Desire 820 well this is the box it came
in and it's in box so since this didn't
really come in its retail packaging we
thought we could give you guys a
hands-on and first impression video so
let's get started so this is HTC Desire
820 it's HTC's low-end to mid-range
device and from the get-go it looks like
a typical HTC device you've got your
dual front-facing speakers here as well
as the front-facing camera on the upper
left
now HTC is one of those companies that
really receive complaints as far the
design aspect of their devices go and
that should continue with the Desire 820
as well the Desire 820 comes in a slew
of different colors and to me it's very
reminiscent of the iPhone 5c due to its
polycarbonate shell and unibody design
think of it as a bigger 5c that's
running Android
so the Desire 820 may not sport the
premium design and build quality of its
cousin the One m8 but the two-tone
design looks really good at my opinion
and believe it or not I actually prefer
the polycarbonate body over the one that
made so in terms of specs you're getting
a 5.5 inch IPS LCD display with the
resolution of 1280 by 720 and the
display itself is decent
now the Desire 820 is also equipped with
HTC's boomsound speakers which I think
absolutely sounds incredible and under
the hood it features an octa-core
Snapdragon 615 with 64-bit support and
big.little architecture which we will
talk about a little bit later in a video
as LTE support which is great and cat
for LTE for those network that support
this kind of LTE it also has 2 gigabytes
of RAM on board and backed by the
audrina 405 GPU it also sports a
somewhat decent 2600 milliamp
non-removable battery and you get 16
gigabyte of expandable storage via
microSD card it's running Android 4.4.4
out of the box of course with HTC Sense
6 on top of it and in terms of cameras
it features a 13 megapixel camera in the
back with an F 2.2 aperture which is
similar to what the desire 816 featured
in an 8 megapixel front-facing camera
which is great for taking selfies now
coming back to its processor essentially
what that big little architecture means
is that those 8 cores inside this phone
will
into two groups one is running at 1.5
gigahertz for more intense tasks and the
other one is running at 1 gigahertz for
things that doesn't really require as
much power of course with all of these
performance improvements it'll be more
noticeable once a Desire 820 is upgraded
to Android lollipop so after playing
with the Desire 820 for a few hours I
came to realize that this is a pretty
decent phone even though it's only
sporting mid-range specs
it's a device I think a lot of people
will appreciate as a solid alternative
to HTC's more expensive flagship devices
