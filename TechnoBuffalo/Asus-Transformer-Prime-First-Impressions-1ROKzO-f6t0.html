technobuffalo here we've had the asus
eee pad transformer prime in our offices
for just about a day well not enough
time to run it through a for review and
put it through the gamut of tests that
we'd like we have had just the right
amount of time to put together some
first impressions what it's like to have
quad-core how that translates to
operating system improvements what it's
like to the end-user how video looks how
text looks and all that kind of things
that come together to make a whole
tablet package so as you evaluate
whether or not you're going to jump up
to a Tegra 3 quad-core tablet hopefully
this video will help you decide let's go
ahead and take a first look at the asus
eee pad transformer prime
alright so first let me run through
specs of this guy and it's highlighted
by what's under the hood Nvidia's Tegra
3 processor which is actually quad-core
and it does have a fifth companion court
in there that does a lot of the
background processing at a lower clock
speed so you get improved battery life
so from a pricing standpoint we're
looking at 499 for 32 gig or 599 for 64
gig no word yet on us 3g pricing or if a
3g model will be available it is running
as you can see here android 3.2
honeycomb asus head says that ice cream
sandwich will be coming on it so from a
dimension standpoint it's 263 by 180
point 8 by a very thin 8.3 millimeters
you can see just how thin that device is
right there and how responsive the
accelerometers as I try and show you the
thinness and all this is going to weigh
568 grams you're looking at a 10.1 inch
super IPS plus display it's LED backlit
with a resolution of 1280 by 800 and
it's got guerrilla glass 12 hours
battery of course that Tegra 3 chip we
talked about gig of ram on again in a 32
or 64 gigabyte capacities we're going to
talk a lot about the camera but it's got
an 8 megapixel shooter on the back but
that's not the only camera that lives
here it's got a 1.2 megapixel shooter up
front I like singing shooter for camera
makes me feel fancy alright so let's go
ahead and talk about the tablet let's go
ahead and start with build quality when
i first reviewed the asus eee pad
transformer the his father cousin of
this guy talked about how it was one of
the best android tablets that are used
but to build quality a little bit
plasticky not so with the asus eee pad
transformer prime the build quality here
is outstanding while the back is still
plastic it does have that brushed metal
look and feel to it and it's an
extremely thin tablet as you're using
this you're really not cognizant of any
of the seams the borders here that go
from screen to back are very smooth I
haven't seen any gaps in there something
not gonna get dust that's going to get
trapped underneath here which is always
nice their problem that I've had with
tablets build quality here at least
initially appears to be absolutely
outstanding the designers at Asus
clearly spent a long time making sure
that every design aspect of this tablet
was accounted for right down to the
almost hidden speaker grills or that
lived there on the left-hand side it's
got a bit of that taper look to it and
it's it's very nicely on the desk
without having any of that tapered sort
of wobble that some tablets can have
especially the vice like the iPad one
had a little bit of that wall bull air
this guy sits very very very nicely
alright so first question I have my took
this guy of the box with speed it's got
a Tegra 3 chip in it how fat is it going
to be we're still running a full test of
benchmark so stay tuned attacking a
buffalo to see what those scores are but
that is the speed translate to everyday
use very well this is hands down the
fastest tablet not just respect
standpoint but from a usage standpoint
that I have ever used so this device has
been a completely restarted nothing has
been opened in the background it's
extremely fast to scroll through here
opening applications are an absolute
breeze I haven't had any issue
multitasking things just opening very
very very quickly and as I go through
and sort of show you the speed of the
tablet it's one of those things that you
have to actually use yourself you can
take my word for it that it's fast but
this thing is absolutely blistering so
let's go and take a look at the browser
will show you a little bit of the speed
here in the processor so we'll go ahead
it's going to load up asus com or
connected just to Wi-Fi and even just
from a pinch to zoom standpoint it's
very fast and one of the cool things
asus is done we'll talk a little bit
about some two aces tweaks here you can
see as I'm scrolling there's this little
bit of a bar here and it lets you scroll
a little bit easier if you don't feel
like flicking so this experience at
least thus far from for the first day
has been very very fast apps load
extremely quickly whether or not I'm
loading you know really pretty intensive
game or whether or not I'm learning book
so the browser things just work very
quickly as you'd expect
from a device that's this powerful
there's the issue a little bit of the
software not being fully optimized for
quad core things are optimized for quad
core absolutely hull and things that are
optimized only for dual core also
absolutely hall which is great for the
end user experience which is ultimately
of utmost importance all right so it's a
tablet it's mostly a big screen with a
lot of big specs so how does this screen
look well let me go ahead and show you
let's go ahead and jump on into the
gallery the resolution here is 1280 x
800 again so let's go ahead and start
with photos and show you what photos
look like and obviously a little bit as
lost in translation from the tablet to
being recorded to upload YouTube to
whatever connection or data speed you
have why are watching this and what
resolution but images here are
absolutely beautiful the screen on the
original epad tranformed was great the
screen here sort of keeps up with that
really beautiful i took this thing
outside and direct sunlight and i had no
problem with direct sunlight visibility
and i'll show you why when we get to
some of the easiest weeks in here but
the screen is absolutely beautiful you
also have an incredible amount of
viewing angle here as you look at this i
really don't have any sort of wash out
that you get from some other tablets
really regardless the angle that you're
looking at regardless of the lights that
i have here i'm using while I'm filming
the screen is just absolutely vibrant
and extremely beautiful here as you go
through and take a look at some the
images but let me just aren't the only
thing you're going to want to do on your
tablet what about videos let me go and
show you what some videos look like here
folks today's just preloaded a few on
here and while i was viewing youtube
videos or videos that i took myself
things work very nicely let's go ahead
and look at videos and we'll open up a
nvidia tegra 3 video and it's going to
go ahead and talk about Tegra 3 and you
can see just how nicely things look here
if you want to rent a movie from the
android market or put a movie on that
you you know bought yourself it is an
incredible video experience it really
looks nicely it looks nice 1280 by 800
is not the highest resolution screen out
there but it does look you know very
nice to the end user experience
notice the any sort of pixilation at all
especially when you're dealing with fast
motion like if you're watching you know
sporting events or sports highlights or
things that have a lot of quick movement
to it the refresh rate seems to be
extremely high so let's go and talk a
little bit about texts go ahead and look
at google books when the apps i opened
earlier let's go ahead and read Lewis
Carroll's Alice in Wonderland you can
see what text is going to look like on
here and of course you can adjust the
backlight to sort of suit your needs and
it's that google book experience that
we've seen and things look you know
pretty nice you don't have any sort of
pixilation here at all as you're going
through and looking at text in books
you've got a little bit of ice cream
sandwich esque things here the menu
buttons at the bottom sort of disappear
those three dots you have to know where
they are you go ahead and hit home you
can jump back let me show you the text
on some website where you can zoom all
the way in let's go ahead and launch
technobuffalo and this is probably a
pretty good time to also talk about the
keyboard that asus has chosen to include
this is not my favorite keyboard whether
on android or whether it's on an ipad or
any other tablet operating system or any
other mobile operating system it's a
little bit awkwardly designed i do
occasionally like having that phone
number row but i didn't find a keyboard
to be overly responsive but when the
nice things about android is that you
can tweak the keyboard and you can
customize a keyboard to find one that
suits your needs the best so let's go
ahead and kick up technobuffalo here
there we go and we'll go ahead and take
a look at an article and we'll see what
some texts look like so we've got to
pick something interesting breaking news
gamepro magazine is no more too sad i
used to read that magazine all the time
as a kid so go ahead and scroll down a
little bit to hear some text and we'll
do a little bit of zooming in and as we
zoom all the way in these Farnes going
to let us go we're not having any
pixilation at all the text is very crisp
and the text is very very very clear so
don't have to worry about that much at
all and as I'm going through using this
tablet you notice that my fingers are on
here as well and I got pretty clean
hands I just watched on my washroom
several times a day so they're not the
dirtiest I don't have greasy pizza
fingers but the screen was just clean
before I started filming and it is
already just littered with fingerprints
now it's going to be true with a lot of
tablets this one seems to just suck in
fingerprints I wondered why they include
the cleaning cloths with it now I know
why you're going to want to keep a shirt
handy or some sort of cleaning cloth
with you as you're using this tablet
something to keep in mind all right so
let's talk about games this is one of
the things that I was most looking
forward to with the transformer prime
there's one of the things that ACS was
really touting during some of the press
demos was how this thing is going to
handle games and this is one of the
examples where you can see software
that's optimized for quad core so let's
go ahead and take a look at one of the
games that takes the most advantage of
it and of course we'll go ahead and take
a look at rip tide I say of course like
you knew i was going to select Riptide
there are a lot of choices here I can
download a ton of optimized games from
the TegraZone when this is going to be
released so go ahead and touch the start
and you can see some of the will go
ahead and click erase and jump right in
here alpha city tiger shark so this is a
fun game for forget seeing you can serve
as see the detail in the water here it's
going to tell me to race you control
with the accelerometer but you can see
sort of the amount of background detail
that's here in the prosthetic be done
I'm going to crash into the wall but
it's really an impressive experience
probably the most impressive game though
that we played is shadowgun and this is
a game that we actually hooked up via
the hdmi port out on the side to an HD
television in the office and with
playing on a big screen TV while using a
wireless controller and we'll talk about
that in the full review in a gaming
overview that we're going to do but it
is something that this is capable of
doing especially with the bigger
horsepower so let me show you what this
looks like it's very Gears of War esque
so it's going to go ahead and load on
the graphics here just really impressive
oh it's most exciting about this is what
developers are going to be able to do as
they get
hold of the hardware make it to take
advantage of everything that quad core
is going to be capable of of course the
Tegra 3 is going to be capable of you
know the future is supposed to be very
bright and I expect it to be very bright
you know we're probably looking at a
paradigm-shifting tablet here as we sort
of change from battery drain dual-core
to really battery sipping quad core so
you can go ahead and see what things
look like and see the graphics here you
know it is I'd say last generation
console quality so you know oh it looks
very close to you know ps2 original xbox
here things are just really beautiful
and this is an early game you know as
developers get better chance you're
really going to see an improved
experience again go ahead and output
this via HDMI out which lives right
there to an age television you can gain
get it right on the tablet or you can
pick up you know a variety of wireless
controllers to get your game on of
course this one is sort of ps3 esque or
playstation ask let's go ahead and exit
out of this game kind of despite how
much i want to play it go ahead and
rotate this back into landscape and
let's continue our first impressions
alright so this is running honeycomb but
there are a lot of nvidia little tweaks
in here and some of the best tweaks
actually these widgets widgets in
honeycomb some people love them some
people don't I really like what asus has
done with them they don't take up a lot
of space you can still see the
background it's sort of hover there as
you can see my location the amount of
emails I've got this is really handy for
battery there's a ton of others as well
so let's go ahead and show you what they
are so you can see aces email the Aces
time and you've got sort of your stock
honeycomb ones and gets now stock ice
cream sandwich they've got on the Galaxy
Nexus they're all very similar but the
east is tweaks here are really nice but
they extend far past widgets I'm gonna
go ahead and show you some of them here
so jump into settings take a look at
Asus customized settings and here's
screw or things kind of get interesting
so I mentioned earlier that's got great
outdoor visibility super IPS outdoor
mode so the screen brightness is set to
a high level consumes more battery power
so you can sort of
determine whether or not your indoor or
outdoor i'll just adjust the brightness
for you here screenshot so you can
capture screenshots by holding the
recent apps key which is kind of a nice
thing you can choose what file format
you want whether or not it's going to be
jpg or PNG for a little bit of improved
quality here this is a probably one of
the most interesting tweaks assistant
performance so normal mode is going to
give you the most optimal performance
it's going to use those quad core
whenever possible and I use that
companion core the least balance modal
obviously find a balance between the two
of them there and power saving mode is
what quite obviously go into power-save
for you and ill use that companion core
the low voltage or low processor low
clock speed companion court as often as
I can it's nice sort of have these
options dot having to go through and
tweak or do any hacking to control
things here a notification panel asus
quick settings and touchpad pointer
style so mouse cursor mode if you want
it'll sort of give you a cursor as you
use it and then you've got some settings
for the optional keyboard dock which
we'll talk about in the full review and
you can see the unboxing of over on
technobuffalo alright so let me go ahead
and show you some other cool things here
and I'll run through the stuff very
quickly the cameras got the 8 megapixel
camera takes pretty decent pictures
least it appears to but what's really
cool is the video side of things I
scroll into video we take a look at some
of the settings this is one of the areas
where you'll start seeing the advantages
of quad core so I'll go ahead and take a
look at something options here
particularly that one right down below
and get the glare out of the way you've
got time-lapse interval so actually this
can take and process time-lapse video
for this you can speed things up really
quickly and it works very nicely and
I'll do full demonstrations again in the
full review so in conclusion first
impressions this is honeycomb better
than you've ever seen it if you've
experienced honeycomb on another tablet
and you've had a nice experience or
maybe it less than nice experience you
have an experience honeycomb until
you've seen it on the transformer prime
which makes them even more
excited about ice cream sandwich on this
I was a bit skeptical and dubious that
this was going to launch without ice
cream sandwich the software wasn't
always necessarily written for quad core
but this is extremely fast from the end
user experience this is a tablet I could
very easily use every day but again this
is just my impressions after 24 hours
this may change as we run it through
benchmarks and tests and sort of see
what else it's capable of doing but it
appears to be a very quick very capable
tablet which really deserves a top spot
on your tablet wish lists so guys do any
questions or things you want to see us
covered in upcoming videos or to mention
in our full review leave your comments
down below and for all your coverage of
the asus eee pad transformer prime be
