known from TechnoBuffalo this is the
Apple iPhone 4 this is the HTC
Thunderbolt both phones are available on
Verizon although this is the III AT&amp;amp;T
version of the iPhone 4 the Thunderbolt
is the biggest baddest new kid on the
block it's got LTE it's got an 8
megapixel camera on the back 1.3
megapixel camera on the front it's got
Android it's got HTC Sense it's got a
kickstand the iPhone 4 still perhaps the
most popular smartphone in America maybe
in the world if you're looking at
individual model still it's not the
whole platform either way it's still the
one people want to know well that's
missing the Thunderbolt is it better
than the iPhone let's find out I'm gonna
get you
you
pardon the pun but it really is apples
and oranges here you know it's it's
Android 2.2 its iOS version for right
now and HTC cents on the on the
thunderbolt there are some pre-installed
verizon apps and and they're not
removable out of the box which is too
bad it's always nice to have the option
to remove everything and also there's no
4G on/off switch there's no toggle
switch for the LTE network on the the
Thunder will have the box you can you
know if you're if you're so inclined to
know what you're doing you can download
a third-party one and that's about as
well because it's nice to have that
manual control toggle LTE off if you're
not wanting to use it but both devices
have Wi-Fi built in they have optional
mobile hotspot capabilities the
Thunderbolt supports a few more devices
you can support up to eight devices on
the thunderbolts mobile Wi-Fi mobile
Wi-Fi mobile hotspot app whereas iPhone
is limited to five devices and then of
course the LTE network versus this is a
3G only device in AT&amp;amp;T we'll get into
that a little more in just a second but
otherwise you know it's really a matter
of do you prefer androids approach or
Apple's approach so with Android you've
got the widgets you've got all the
customization you ready you've got HTC
Sense on here with some of the built-in
stuff friends Stream and their new
scenes thing or you can easily
personalize you know everything all at
once or you can go feature by feature
that kind of thing you've got the
ability to add widgets to your home
screens and add more widgets you can use
live wallpapers you know all that stuff
that Android users know and love and
like to poke in the eyes of their iPhone
toting friends or frenemies as it were
you've got some stuff built in here
slacker radios built in too and Wiki
there's some other stuff built in out of
the box here on the Thunderbolt and then
the the iPhone you know with the iPhone
you've just got that that grid of icons
design
you know you can you can do folders now
which you couldn't do before you know
but that's several months old now at
this point anyway so basically you know
it's just a very different approach to
how you want to how you want to do your
computing or your mobile computing I
should say your smartphone experience
and then of course the ecosystems you
know Apple we don't need to get into
that here but iTunes and all that stuff
on the Apple side and then with the
Android it's a little more kind of
piecemeal in terms of you know do you
want to get your music from Amazon or
where are you getting it and how are you
dealing with syncing your medias but you
know using doubleTwist or something like
that there's no official sync app for
Android all that kind of stuff but that
gets into the the platforms and the
ecosystems and you know it's too much to
compare right here but but obviously you
know the big difference Android users
some of the interests may stay away from
Thunderbolt because it is an HTC Sense
device and not you know stock Android
but again you know it's kind of to you I
personally am a fan of HTC Sense I
really like what they've done I think it
makes it a little bit more elegant and
easy to use but that's just me and a lot
of that is you know aesthetics and
personal taste so to talk about the
network's for a brief second you can see
in here the the 4G LTE icon lit up and
the testing on this device has been been
really fast if you saw my unboxing video
I tried running speed test on the
Thunderbolt and since that I found out
that speed test the developers have a
fix on the way because it just can't
handle the way the Thunderbolt does data
buffering and the results were basically
useless but the device is very very fast
on Verizon's LTE network I'm entering a
URL on Android on the on the thunderbolt
rather you've got the HTC keyboard we've
also got other options the keyboard
replacements you can install the swipe
system which is become very popular
recently that sort of thing on the
iPhone you've got the Apple keyboard and
that's it unless you want to get into
jailbreaking which we're not really
going to cover here both keyboards work
well HCC's keyboard has generally been
my favorite of the Android keyboards but
I haven't been you know I haven't
especially in the last couple months
tried out all of the keyboard
replacements that are out there but
generally speaking I like the HTC
keyboard I also like the the big the big
4.3
display for typing and when you turn the
phones and into wide screen mode to type
with two thumbs you know as I as I often
like to in this way you really get a lot
of room here on the thunderbolt which is
nice again you know iPhone certainly
works well millions of users you know
wouldn't use it otherwise unless you
know you're an Android fanboy calling
yeah that what they're sheep but anyway
you know it certainly it works fine but
this is a case where that extra real
estate I mean you can see just how much
physically larger you know the the
keyboard on Thunderbolt you know
vertically takes up you know would take
up two-thirds of the iPhone screen there
so and then you've got the predictive
text system HTC spirit of predictive
Texas text system which I have always
really liked I don't think that
TechnoBuffalo is in is in the dictionary
hair off to customize that I'll have to
learn how to type it's hard to type with
one finger one I'm camera so let's go
TechnoBuffalo calm and then I'm gonna go
ahead and also type in TechnoBuffalo
calm on the iPhone now both of these
phones right now are connected to Wi-Fi
it's the same Wi-Fi network so this is
kind of a rough a rough test of how
quickly the devices can load and render
the page not scientific at all but let's
try it one two three go so a little bit
faster there on the thunderbolt except
the yeah that doesn't count will see do
another another test because the iPhone
was loading up the full version of the
page not the mobile version so let's try
this again
alright so here's a mistake a little
test this is very unscientific but I'm
gonna load up the same website on both
devices true hope calm I'm not using
TechnoBuffalo because technical buffalo
has a mobile theme that I was
automatically loading on one device and
not the other so that's not fair
but both devices connected to Wi-Fi it's
the same Wi-Fi network they're both
loaded up to go to true hope calm and
it's just gonna be kind of an
unscientific test of how quickly the
devices can load and render the same
webpage
you've got the Apple crust
a for processor in the iPhone 4 you've
got a qualcomm it's a single core but
it's the newer generation of qualcomm
single core processors in the
Thunderbolt so here we go on the
scientific test one two three go so
loading up and the Thunderbolt got the
early lead
see they're rendering the page is a
little bit differently kind of
interesting its neck and neck here
Thunderbolt is the winner again
unscientific but the iPhone now they
haven't done so the Thunderbolt rendered
the page out faster than the iPhone did
roughly the same page a different a
different ad loaded up I'm also curious
to see yep
so Thunderbolt also loaded up the the
flash based media player there to watch
that video and same video here on the
iPhone used to have an empty space
that's like one of those one of those
ads right so we'll hit play and we'll
see if it actually plays yep and I can
go fullscreen can go full sprinter no
whoops oh wow
so unscientifically then the Thunderbolt
rented out that that same the true hoop
comm blog faster on Thunderbolt than on
the iPhone 4 that was over the same
Wi-Fi network in terms of data cut
cellular data Thunderbolt Just Blaze
it's the the Verizon LTE network if you
follow TechnoBuffalo you don't want to
hear me talk about this again probably
but out here in the San Francisco area
and Oakland and the surrounding area
where it's turned on and everywhere else
I've heard reports from Nordstrom not
it's just very very very fast
that being said been having some issues
actually over the past couple of days
with the the network dropping out not
sure if it first showed up and the the
mobile hotspot app was not just kind of
stopped working on the Thunderbolt and
then noticing it yesterday I also have a
Rison pantech USB 4G modem that I was
using at my laptop notice some issues
with that been hearing some complaints
from people down at CTIA in Orlando this
week that the the network not working
well down there either
so you know we'll have to see what the
deal is with that but when it when it's
been working the LTE network network
literally added some head-to-head tests
and it was like five times as fast as
the inspire 4G on 80 which is AT&amp;amp;T s
so-called 4G phone very similar to the
Thunderbolt in fact so there you go so
if you're you know if you're in an LTE
area assuming they get whatever these
little bugs are worked out the
Thunderbolt just blows doors off just
very very fast again you know kind of
head-to-head it really it just boils
down to what you want if you're looking
for raw specs you know except for the
display resolution Thunderbolt you know
seemingly faster with that web render
test the cameras are higher resolution
the network is faster if you're in LTE
area it's got more memory pre-installed
it's got a kickstand but experience wise
it really boils down to to what you
prefer both are high quality devices
they both work very well in general you
know do you want Android do you want i
phone buying advice wise if you're in
the market for an iPhone if you can wait
wait a few months till June when
everybody expects iPhone 5 to be
announced I think it'll be worth the
wait I personally think we're gonna see
4G version an LTE version for Verizon
and some sort of 4G for AT&amp;amp;T but we'll
see if you're on Verizon and you want an
Android phone if you're in an LTE market
this is the way to go even if you're not
it's a quality device Droid Bionic with
a dual core chipset coming out soon you
know and then some rumors about some new
HTC's although I don't know if you're
gonna head to Verizon right away with
the qHD super high res display but
otherwise I mean this thing's a beast it
works really well again just these these
issues being worked out with the LTE
network or something in the device
apparently because I was having that at
that hotspot problem but there you go
both you know both really good I
personally prefer the I don't know why I
turn it that way I personally prefer the
way
that I Oh s works so I would go with
iPhone myself but that's just subjective
I also like the smaller form factor but
you know if it's hard to argue with the
4G man it is blazing fast when it's
working right so there you go
hope that helps it's kind of a throwdown
it's kind of a buffalo fight can we call
it that I don't know whatever you wanna
call it head-to-head the Thunderbolt the
iPhone 4 which would you choose that's
really what matters right much much more
on both these devices everything coming
out of CTA this week and whatever is
next 4G 5g AT&amp;amp;T buying t-mobile what
Sprint going to do what's Verizon gonna
do all that stuff we got you covered on
TechnoBuffalo comm so next time my name
is Noah thanks for watching we'll see
you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
