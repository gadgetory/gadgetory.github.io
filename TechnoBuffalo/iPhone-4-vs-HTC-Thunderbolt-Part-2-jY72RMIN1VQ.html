known from TechnoBuffalo this is the
Apple iPhone 4 this is the HTC
Thunderbolt both phones are available on
verizon although this is the iat version
of the iphone for the Thunderbolt is the
biggest baddest new kid on the block
it's got LTE it's got an 8 megapixel
camera on the back 1.3 megapixel camera
on the front it's got android it's got
HTC Sense it's got a kickstand the
iphone four still perhaps the most
popular smartphone in America maybe in
the world if you're looking at
individual model stills not the whole
platform either way it's still the one
people want to know well that's missing
the Thunderbolt is it better than the
iphone let's find out I'm gonna get you
you
pardon the pun but it really is apples
and oranges here you know it's it's
android 2.2 its iOS version for right
now and HTC Sense on the on the
Thunderbolt there are some preinstalled
verizon apps and they're not removable
out of the box which is too bad it's
always nice to have the option to remove
everything and also there's no 4g on/off
switch there's no toggle switch for the
LTE network on the Thunder will add the
box you can you know if you're if you're
so inclined to know what you're doing
you can download a third-party one and
that's do it as well because it's nice
to have that manual control toggle LTE
off if you're not wanting to use it but
both devices have Wi-Fi built in they
have optional mobile hotspot
capabilities the Thunderbolt supports a
few more devices you can support up to
eight devices on the Thunderbolts mobile
Wi-Fi mobile Wi-Fi mobile hotspot app
whereas iphone is limited to five
devices and then of course the LTE
network versus this is a 3g only device
on ATT we'll get into that a little more
in just a second but otherwise you know
it's really a matter of do you prefer
androids approach or Apple's approach so
with Android you've got the widgets
you've got all the customization you
ready you've got HTC Sense on here with
some of the built-in stuff friend stream
and their new scenes thing where you can
easily personalize you know everything
all at once or you can go feature by
feature that kind of thing you've got
the ability to add widgets to your home
screens and add more widgets you can use
live wallpapers you know all that stuff
that Android users know and love and
like to poke in the eyes of their iPhone
toting friends or frenemies as it were
you've got some stuff built in here
slacker radios built-in tunewiki there's
some other stuff built in out of the box
here on the Thunderbolt and then the the
iphone you know with the iphone you've
just got that that grid of icons
designed and you know you can you can do
folders
which you couldn't do before you know
but that's several months old now at
this point anyway so basically you know
it's just a very different approach to
how you want it how you want to do your
computing or your mobile computing i
should say your smartphone experience
and then of course the ecosystems you
know Apple that we don't need to get
into that here but itunes and all that
stuff on the Apple side and then with
the Android it's a little more kind of
piecemeal in terms of you know do you
want to get your music from amazon or
were you getting it and how are you
dealing with syncing your medias but you
know using doubletwist or something like
that there's no official sync app for
Android all that kind of stuff but that
gets into the the platforms and the
ecosystems and you know it's too much to
compare right here but but obviously you
know the big difference android users
some of the android purists may stay
away from Thunderbolt because it is an
HTC Sense device and not you know stock
Android but again you know it's kind of
to you I personally am a fan of HTC
Center I really like what they've done I
think it makes it a little bit more
elegant and easy to use but that's just
me and a lot of that is you know
aesthetics and personal taste so to talk
about the network's for a brief second
you can see in here the the 4g LTE icon
lit up and the testing on this device
has been been really fast if you saw my
unboxing video i tried running speed
tests on the Thunderbolt and since that
i found out that speed test the
developers have a fix on the way because
just can't handle the way the
Thunderbolt does data buffering and the
results for basically useless but the
device is very very fast on verizon's
LTE network entering a URL on Android on
the on the Thunderbolt rather you've got
the HTC keyboard we've also got other
options the keyboard replacements you
can install the swype system which has
become very popular recently that sort
of thing on the iPhone you've got the
apple keyboard and that's it unless you
want to get into jailbreaking which
we're not really going to cover here
both keyboards work well HCC's keyboard
has generally been my favorite of the
Android keyboards but I haven't been you
know I haven't especially in the last
couple months tried out all the keyboard
replacements that are out there but
generally speaking I like the HTC
keyboard I also like the the big the big
4.3 inch display for
anything and when you turn the phones in
into widescreen mode to type with two
thumbs you know as I as I often like to
in this way you really get a lot of room
here on the thunderbolt which is nice
again you know iPhone certainly works
well millions of users you know I
wouldn't use it otherwise unless you
know you're an android fanboy calling
the other what their sheep but anyway
you know it certainly works fine but
this is a case where that extra real
estate I mean you can see just how much
physically larger you know the the
keyboard on Thunderbolt you know
vertically takes up you know would take
up two-thirds of the iphone screen there
so and then you've got the predictive
text system HTC spirit of predictive
texts text system which I have always
really liked I don't think that
TechnoBuffalo is in is in the dictionary
hair off to customize that I'll have to
learn how to type it's hard to type with
one finger one I'm camera so let's go
technobuffalo calm and then I'm going to
go ahead and also type in technobuffalo
calm on the iphone now both of these
phones right now are connected to Wi-Fi
it's the same Wi-Fi network so this is
kind of a rough a rough test of how
quickly the devices can load and render
the page not scientific at all but let's
try it one two three go so a little bit
faster there on the Thunderbolt except
the yeah that doesn't count will see do
another another test because the iphone
was loading up the full version of the
page not the mobile version so let's try
this again alright so here's a mistake a
little test this is very unscientific
but I'm gonna load up the same website
on both devices true hoop calm i'm not
using technobuffalo because technical
buffalo has a mobile theme that i was
automatically loading on one device and
not the other so that's not fair but
both devices connected to Wi-Fi it's the
same Wi-Fi network they're both loaded
up to go to true hoop calm and it's just
going to be kind of an unscientific test
of how quickly the devices can load and
render the same web pitch you've got the
apple custom a4 processor and the
iphone 4 you've got a Qualcomm it's a
single core but it's the newer
generation of Qualcomm single core
processors in the Thunderbolt so here we
go on the scientific test one two three
go so loading up and the Thunderbolt got
the early lead see their rendering the
pages a little bit differently kind of
interesting its neck and neck here
Thunderbolt is the winner again
unscientific but the iphone now they
have ins done so the Thunderbolt
rendered the page out faster than the
iphone did roughly the same page a
different a different ad loaded up I'm
also curious to see yep so Thunderbolt
also loaded up the flash based media
player there to watch that video and
same video here on the iPhone you used
to have an empty space that's like one
of those one of those ads right so we'll
hit play and we'll see if it actually
plays yep and I can go full spread go
full sprinter in other words no whoops
oh well so unscientifically then the
Thunderbolt rented out that that same
the true hoop com blog faster I'm
Thunderbolt then on the iphone 4 that
was over the same Wi-Fi network in terms
of data cut cellular data Thunderbolt
just blaze's the the verizon LTE network
if you follow technobuffalo you don't
want to hear me talk about this again
probably but out here in the San
Francisco area and oakland and the
surrounding area where it's turned on
and everywhere else i've heard reports
from word store none it's just very very
very fast that being said then having
some issues actually over the past
couple of days with the the network
dropping out not sure if it is first
showed up in the the mobile hotspot app
was not just kind of stopped working on
the Thunderbolt and then noticing it
yesterday i also have a verizon pantech
us be four
modem that I was using at my laptop
little some issues with that and hearing
some complaints from people down at CTA
in orlando this week that the the
network not working well down there
either so you know we'll have to see
what the deal is with that but when it
wasn't been working the LTE network
network literally added some
head-to-head test and it was like five
times as fast as the inspire 4G on 80
which is AT&amp;amp;T s so-called 4g phone very
similar to the Thunderbolt in fact so
there you go so if you're you know if
you're in an LTE area assuming they get
whatever these little bugs are worked
out the Thunderbolt just blows doors off
just very very fast again you know kind
of head-to-head it really it just boils
down to what you want if you're looking
for raw specs you know except for the
display resolution Thunderbolt you know
seemingly faster with that web render
test the cameras are higher resolution
the network is faster if you're in LTE
area it's got more memory pre-installed
that's got a kick stand but experience
wise it really boils down to to what you
prefer both are high quality devices
they both work very well in general you
know do you want android do you want
iphone buying advice wise if you're in
the market for an iphone if you can wait
wait a few months till june when
everybody expects iphone 5 to be
announced I think it'll be worth the
wait i personally think we're going to
see 4G version an LTE version for
verizon and some sort of 4g for AT&amp;amp;T but
we'll see if you're on verizon and you
want an android phone if you're in an
LTE market this is the way to go even if
you're not it's a quality device droid
bionic with a dual core chipset coming
out soon you know and then some rumors
about some new HTC's although i don't
know if you're going to head to verizon
right away with the qhd super high res
display but otherwise I mean this
thing's a beast it works really well
again just these these issues being
worked out with the LTE network or
something in the device apparently
because I was having that at that
hotspot problem but there you go both
you know both really good I personally
prefer the I don't know why I turn it
that way I personally prefer the way
iOS works so i would go with iphone
myself but that's just subjective i also
like the smaller form factor but you
know if it's hard to argue with the 4g
man it is blazing fast when it's working
right so there you go hope that helps
it's kind of a throwdown it's kind of a
buffalo fight can we call it that I
don't know whatever you wanna call it
head-to-head the Thunderbolt the iphone
4 which would you choose that's really
what matters right much much more on
both these devices everything coming out
of CTA this week and whatever is next
for g5g AT&amp;amp;T buying t-mobile what sprint
going to do what Verizon going to do all
that stuff we got you covered on
TechnoBuffalo com so next time my name
is Noah thanks for watching we'll see
you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
