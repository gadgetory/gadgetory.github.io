Sangin from technobuffalo and on today's
episode of rumor roundup we'll be
talking about the galaxy note5 and s6
edge+ the iphone 6s and apples plan for
the Apple watch and I'm at this is rumor
roundup let's go ahead and get started
Apple will apparently launch new iMacs
and Apple watch color options this fall
according to ming-chi kuo of KGI
securities quo anticipates that sales
could be boosted somewhat by additional
color options coming later this year the
expects Apple to introduce both yellow
and rose gold Apple watch sport variants
in silver and Space Gray are the only
two colors currently available for this
model will also expects Apple to
announce new iMacs is fall to sustain
Mac demand shipments for last quarter
are expected to reach around 5.3 million
units while Co predicts that mac
shipments for this quarter will rise
over 5.8 million as sales increase over
the back to school period hopefully
we'll see these two new products very
soon now I personally wouldn't mind
seeing new color options for the Apple
watch sport I think it'd be cool to see
a gold variant in Apple sport lineup now
the only real question is how much
moving on good more apple rumors now a
new rumor claimed that the iphone 6s and
iPhone 6s plus could solve one of the
most annoying things about the current
iPhone according to Chinese site m.i.c
gadget apple's new smartphone will start
at 32 gigabytes of storage instead of
the usual 16 gigabytes the reports cites
several Foxconn insiders who claim Apple
is assembling new phones with 32
gigabytes of internal storage now of
course you'd also be able to pay extra
for 64 gigabytes or 128 gigabytes of
storage if you'd like we'd love to
believe that these new rumors are true
though 925 max mark Gurman noted that
the base iphone 6s model will still
start at 16 gigabytes sticking with
iphone 6s news earlier this week an
image of an iphone 6s front panel leaked
and the images appear to come straight
from the factory floor ready to be
attached to the rear shells we saw back
in June in typical apple fashion we're
expecting the S upgrades who mostly
concern the devices guts not the
physical design probably the biggest
feature that will see from Apple's s
lineup is Apple's new force touch
technology however the source who shared
the photos apparently couldn't verify
whether or not the next iPhone will
include this technology despite multiple
rumors claiming it will in additions for
such we're expecting Apple to include an
a 9 processor 12 megapixel camera
improved touch ID support and 2
gigabytes of RAM hopefully we'll learn
more soon earlier this month a report
out of Korea suggested that Sampson was
gearing up to launch the galaxy note5
and s6 edge+ a month early in August in
an effort to beat apple's new flagship
iphones to the market business korea
said wednesday that samsung plans to
host an event in new york on august 13 2
in vail both devices the note 5 is
expected to feature a 5.7 inch qhd
display an XE no 7422 processor
expandable memory and a new S Pen the
galaxy s6 edge+ on the other hand will
reportedly lack the S Pen and expandable
storage support but feature an exynos
7420 chip and the edge display we saw on
the Galaxy s6 edge business korea again
reiterates that Samsung we release the
phone sometime in August but doesn't
provide an exact date and that's about
it for this episode of rumor roundup
