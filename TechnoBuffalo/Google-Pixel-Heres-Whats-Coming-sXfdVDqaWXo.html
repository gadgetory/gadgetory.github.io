new Nexus phones are about to be
announced you're just waiting with
anticipation kind of got a little bit
dashed rest in peace Nexus line but
welcome the pixel line coming October
fourth TechnoBuffalo is going to be at
the event where Google is going to
unveil two new phones that are going to
be the pixel and the pixel XL I've been
hearing about these phones for months
they were codenamed marlin and sailfish
but now thanks to the folks at Android
Police we know what the phones are going
to look like and pretty much all the
specs so let me tell you what's going to
happen October fourth and I can I can
see the future so first we're going to
see a new launcher used to be at the
Google now launcher was the launcher
that came on stock android nexus phones
subsequently looks to be like google
wants more control over the software the
hardware is not going to made by google
team going to be made by HTC for both
phones you see this launcher leak for a
while app drawers redone it looks a
little cleaner icons are around nothing
giant it's a different way to interact
with android the specs of the phones are
going to be two phones one is going to
be a 5-inch phone this is one that was
previously named sailfish we are looking
at again a 5-inch screen 1920 x 1080 a
27 70 million power battery four gigs of
ram 12-egg pixel camera on the back
eight megapixel on the front and
headphone jack Oh mounted on top and a
fingerprint sensor living on the back we
don't have found a confirmation of the
processor presumably it'll be the
Snapdragon 820 family now we also don't
know if it's going to be sort of
waterproofing IP 67 or 68 on board but
will be of HTC so it'll probably be
metal which means you can probably say
goodbye to wireless charging on the
bigger front the phone formerly named
marlon is going to be the pixel x el
specs are gonna be relatively similar
except for the screen it's going to be
bumped up to 5.5 inches and QA g and the
battery below the bigger to at 3450 but
the same totally pixel camera on the
back and ate manna fix on the front will
be on where the phone should look like a
bigger and smaller version of exact
the same phones how is it going to be
better than the outgoing Nexus 6p I
don't know it's really an improvement
over what we have with the lg-made 5x
but new android phones of course you're
going to get stock nougat I really gotta
stop saying Nutella stock nougat out of
the box and I do want us to throw myself
a little bit of a shout out back in
December 2015 i did a video on my top 5
android predictions for 2016 and my
number one prediction was pixel phones
so and the sooth suits their i'm saying
saying mad sooth so what do you guys
think you excited about the pixel phones
you now pretty much know everything
about these phones are clean what
they're gonna look like I'm excited
anytime I've got stock google phones i'm
generally jazz to see them leave a
comment down below and let us know give
you a thumbs up if you want stock
android i should also mention pricings
gonna be a little bit more expensive
this generation looking into starts for
the pixel at about six hundred fifty
bucks means the XL is probably gonna be
about a hundred dollars more so that's
one hundred fifty dollars for the phones
both which should start by about 32 gigs
of storage so a bit of a bummer there
but okay that rumors wrong and we'll see
the XL bumped up to 64 until next time
john render from TechnoBuffalo stuff you
guys next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
