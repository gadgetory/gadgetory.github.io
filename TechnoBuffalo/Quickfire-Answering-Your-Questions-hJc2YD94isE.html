Jonna for lakers calm here and I'm
looking at myself from the camera and my
beard looks red weird it's not red
anyway by popular demand I've been
getting a lot of questions on a keyboard
about the AT&amp;amp;T quickfire I posted an
unboxing and review about a week ago and
really questions have kind of been
rolling in about it so I'm going to try
and answer that at least answer the most
popular ones that I've been getting
first off let me show you the keyboard
one more time or what it looks like so
it slides up just like so keyboard right
up top so there's not much room when
you're typing the keys are relatively
flush to the bottom of the phone so
there's not much lift or much give there
because it thing has to slide right back
down on top of it so that being said and
as I mentioned in my review it is very
easy to type on and I got used to the
keyboard really quickly some people have
asking questions about these two humps
on either side I'm really not it's hard
to get your hands over them and say
that's really not your thumb actually
rests on them pretty nicely I'm pretty
easily so it's not an impediment at all
a few other questions have been about
the responsiveness of the screen and as
I said in the review the screen can be a
little less than ideally responsive
meaning it sometimes takes one or two
hits to really get it to go but once you
do get it you know it's it's not so bad
you have to get used to it you really
have to hit right in the middle of icons
and hit right in the middle of some of
the pictures that being said the screen
is incredibly responsive when it comes
to dial pad can actually come to dial
it's probably little bright you can't
see that but you do come to dial it
really is nice and easy it's just going
through the menus a little bit difficult
people asked about flick scrolling the
phone does not have flick scrolling you
have to scroll using a little scroll bar
on the sides you have to take your
finger and go up and down think some
old-school windows mobile styles you
have to take that scroll bar and kind of
roll it up and down on the context so
when you do scroll up and down it does
pull up a letters for you so ABCDE so
you can see a little bit easier where
you guys want to go
they let this help answer some of the
most pressing questions you guys had
about the Quickfire I have to send it
back to AT&amp;amp;T but I have to keep it a
little while longer so I can answer
these questions for you and one
clarification here this button here that
thought was a video recording is
actually a voice dialing so it does have
full functional voice dialing I didn't
mention that in my first review that was
a mistake on my part this want to make
sure you guys are aware of that anyway
again this is the ATT quickfire it's a
3g messaging phone available on a tts
network for ninety-nine dollars after
rebates you guys hope you enjoyed check
