TechnoBuffalo here at a full review for
you of the iPad Mini with Retina display
this guy packs a ton of power and a
gorgeous high-res screen to a 7-inch
package but is it worth your tablet
buying dollars put it through its paces
and find out I'm making this review as I
do all my reviews I use the iPad Mini
with Retina display as my only tablet
for 8 days and I use it really very very
very heavily I use it for checking email
I use it for social networking I use it
for watching video pretty much anything
you can do on a tablet I use the mini
phone isn't just for my tests I use the
iPad Mini and I use a previous
generation as my only tablet least in
conjunction with a surface pro for all
my things that I do at home so it got a
really thorough test so I'm not going to
do this review and run through
benchmarks and give you scores or tell
you how long it lasted when I ran a
video on loupe I'm gonna give you
real-world experience with the iPad
mains retinas why I'm just gonna call it
the iPad Mini could just going to be
easier so first thing you're gonna
notice is the screen the screen is
absolutely beautiful at 7.9 inch screen
with 256 by 1536 PPI looks absolutely
stunning it looks gorgeous you'd expect
it to look gorgeous it's not as jarring
though as it was when I first saw it
from the iPad 2 to the iPad 3 it does
look really good you notice it more when
you're looking at text text looks really
really crisp and clear not that it
looked bad on the previous generation by
any stretch of the imagination but it
looks much clearer on the new iPad Mini
with Retina spoi just looks gorgeous
video of course pops as well the blacks
look really black has been some display
issues people have had but I've had
nothing to spy on this one's been
absolutely perfect and looks gorgeous
the next thing is performance it's got
the a7 chip the four-time CPU
performance supposed to be pretty
awesome it's been faster so I will admit
with the older iPad Mini I did run into
memory issues would start to slow down I
had a lot of apps open and occasionally
maybe once a month I'd have to go
through and close all my apps to get
things to work also the older generation
iPad Mini at home I've got one of
Apple's new airport extremes a tall ones
with 802 11 AC I always had issues with
my iPad Mini not
picking up the Wi-Fi connection but
really coming a fast connection when I
would do a speed test from my laptop or
a desktop it'd be very very quick when I
run it from the iPad Mini to be really
slow so slow the fact that it came
really hard to watch even YouTube videos
on there the iPad me is ready display
ups that game it surprisingly does not
have 802 11 AC but it does have MIMO
technology which really is helped with
Wi-Fi an idea I'm getting connection
speeds as fast on this as I am getting
on a laptop or desktop so that's really
really appreciated that's made a huge
difference for me even more than having
the you know crazy screen or better
performance so that's really been one
thing that I've noticed
design-wise you're looking at an iPad
maybe it looks pretty much exactly the
same as last generation iPad me at least
with the screen off it's a tad bit
thicker and a tad bit heavier but you're
not going to notice it Apple isn't it
kind of a nice thing now it's a respect
for speck almost exactly the same say
for a tiny bit of clock speed difference
with the iPad air so you can choose you
want a little or iPad or a bigger iPad I
prefer mine to be a bit smaller you know
we've got that option without
sacrificing any performance the last
generation iPad Mini was essentially a
diminutive iPad 2 and that is really
really slow leased by today's standards
if you're just browsing the web or
something that's going to work great but
applications that are being designed for
faster process especially now 64-bit
processors which this does have so I'd
imagine over the next two three four
five six months it over so take
advantage of what the 64-bit processor
can do in conjunction with the new m7
chip in here so I love that Apple put
this spec for spec you know right up
with the iPad air the big knock on it
for me those its price I've got a bit of
a price jump it's now starting $399 you
compare that to the awesomely priced
Nexus 7 and then you run into a bit of a
quandary as to what to purchase they can
go up for a higher storage with the iPad
air is going up 228 here they only go 16
or 32 with the Nexus 7 but you're still
getting a gorgeous high restoration XSL
you're getting a really capable
operating system I get a little bit of a
different form factor not the four by
three to sixteen by nine with the tablet
that works really well it's probably one
of our favorite tablets of the year so
ask yourself what's more important to
you do you want to be inside of Apple's
ecosystem I will still think now that
the App Store the quality of the
applications are still better than when
you see on Google Play so if that's
important to you it's a good reason to
get
the iPad Mini I love using it it's going
to be my iPad I take with me when I
travel to don't I take with me you know
I'm on the couch watching videos I
really enjoy the smaller screen size
I've enjoyed everything about the iPad
Mini it works quickly I've noticed
really no difference in battery life as
well it's about on par with what the
last generation was an apple claims 10
hours but for me I charged about every
three days and that's true all I need if
I can get through three solid days and
I'm pretty happy after one solid day of
use that's probably about 45 minutes an
hour of video watching jacking some
fantasy sports on there applying to some
emails generally I had about maybe 40%
loss of battery 40 to 30% I don't keep
my screen brightness on auto I keep it
up at 80% so I like a nice bright screen
I think that's probably a big Dre pull
that down you probably get much more
even probably double the battery life
another on a mission for me is we don't
have touch ID that seems a bit strange
you know it's in spec for spec on what
the same was the iPhone 5s but no touch
ID on this guy perhaps Apple had to save
something for the next generation iPads
overall though I really enjoyed using
this the camera honestly I never even
used I very rarely use a camera on a
tablet and you shouldn't either unless
you're doing you know FaceTime or Skype
or something
but looks fine you know pictures look
decent I saw it'll click on the iPad air
I've done FaceTime calls at least on
this and quality looks you know pretty
average it does have much faster charge
on notice though that might be due to
perhaps a higher voltage wall work but
did charge markedly faster and the pro
tip if you want to charge your tablet or
phone faster turn off all data put an
airplane mode but I charge it about
twice as quickly as you would otherwise
I really enjoyed using this tablets
probably one of the best tablets on the
market right now assume anyone's gonna
be in my bag all the time this gets a
really solid 9 I wish it was a less
expensive I wish it had 82 11 AC and I
wish it had touch ID but if you don't
care about any of those things you just
want an Apple tablets gonna work well
gonna fit in your bag or fit in a purse
look no farther than the iPad Mini with
Retina display guess watching hope you
