technobuffalo here taking a look at
arguably the best smartphone in
existence right now this is the samsung
galaxy s2 in white which I have not seen
before yet now that are giving us a real
quick overview of the galaxy s2 run
through the specs again and show you
what this head looks like it's pretty
beautiful phone in white so from aspect
standpoint you've got a 4.3 inch it's a
beautiful super amoled plus display
being powered by a 1.2 gig dual-core
processors that's 1.2 on each pork
Android Gingerbread 8 megapixel
autofocus camera on the back that can
shoot full 1080p video I'm playback at
30 frames per second samsung for hubs
got Wi-Fi a/b/g/n i'll stuff you'd
expect let's like a real quick look at
the device it's going to be hard to
translate from here to camera to youtube
but the screen is absolutely beautiful
just pop and look wonderful so let's go
and take a look at photos for example
all right on jump into it they looks in
the background so you can see some of
the new additions to samsung touchwiz
jump into wallpapers go ahead and pick
what's in the gallery go and check it
out do some the 3d effects Adam saw in
an Android let's see what gingerbread
that make sense so
see what a new background image looks
like stay any moment
Aereo thing just looked really nice and
do problem it's a very thin device as
well addressing design is post some
other Samsung devices volume rocker here
lives on the left on the right your
power and lock button top 3.5 millimeter
headset jack and microphone back is that
camera we talk about it is plastic no
soft touch hear anything completely of
elastics back and we got through that
little of a little bit about hump or
processor and radios down there and then
the micro USB charging port it's an
absolutely beautiful bone I think you
have to hold to experience it's coming
to all major US carrier detection of
verizon but allegedly they've got
something similar been stored Samsung's
do a three button layout here the passer
but these are backlit but as you can see
they're a little bit hard to see on a
white bat so you don't bear that in mind
if you're trying to poke around on your
phone and movie theater or somewhere or
maybe you don't get that back light
going on they way i'm jon rettinger
