technobuffalo here's an unboxing of the
latest mini tablet from apple it is the
ipad mini now all dolled up with Retina
display let's go ahead take a first look
so here's the box for the new iPad Mini
with Retina Display oh I'm just going to
call it iPad Mini because with retina
display is two minute words looks very
familiar almost the same box as the
outgoing mini effect on the side it just
says iPad Mini only spot you'll find
with the retina display is actually down
here or I'll say with retina display
we've got the 16 gig model here in space
gray or silver rather it's also
available in space grave and I can go up
to 128 gigs price is going to range from
3 99 to all the way up to 830 and I'm
bringing in for special unboxing a
special old friend the obligatory big ol
unboxing I'm so go ahead and cut the
plastic hopefully not sliced any fingers
in the process this is available today
shipping from Apple is about one to
three days as of filming for the lower
capacity Wi-Fi model is about 5 to 10
days for the higher capacity Wi-Fi
models or anyone's with LTE so go ahead
and slide this off I use my iPad Mini
quite a bit and I always thought it was
lacking the retina display so I'm really
excited to take a look at this guy and
here is the tablet and feels almost
identical to the way the outgoing then
you felt and push it off the SIA for a
quick second I've got a very familiar
friends in here we've got your wall work
designed by Apple in California see
what's in there just for fun ipad mini
info and some stickers in the back and
then just your lightning cable and that
is it push all that off to the side
let's take a look at our friend here is
the ipad mini with retina display I will
pull this off first quick set and will
run through all the specs before I do
that one we take a look at what the
outgoing iPad Mini looked like go ahead
and pull this right here and they look
almost identical from the bezel size to
the top size to everything if you hold
them all upside down you really can't
tell difference other than my old ones a
little bit on the scratch side
so from a design standpoint pretty much
identical so let's go ahead and power
the sucker on we'll run through all the
specs so you've got that same as 7.9
inch screen but now it's 2048 x 1536 PPI
giving it a ppi of 320 420 cure soup
that looks like on the smaller screen
got the a7 chip in it now in 64-bit
architecture and the m7 motion
coprocessor so essentially spec for spec
the same as the iPhone 5s and the ipad
air although it is that a 1.1 a
gigahertz lower clock speed than we saw
with the iPad everything its 1.3 versus
1.4 no external storage option but i
geti golly up to 128 starting at 16 5
megapixel camera on the back I've got a
FaceTime HD camera living right there
802 11 ABG and n well oddly AC is
missing same through grapes I had with
the air and no touch ID here Bluetooth
4.0 as well and it weighs 331 and grams
me go ahead and power it on go a little
setup process will come back here in
just a minute so we've got this all
booted up and it's a subtle difference
you don't notice it as big as I thought
I did from the ipad 2 to the ipad 3
things look a little bit crisper but on
a scroll smaller screen it's not as sort
of noticeable as it was with that larger
generation but let me bring in the older
ipad mini and let's compare at least
some text we've got technobuffalo cued
up on each the brightness is set to the
same on both as you can see what text
looks like and it does look definitely
crisper on the iPad Mini with Retina
Display assume we'll see a big
difference so we're playing games or
watching videos probably where the
retina display is really going to shine
but at least side by side you can see
what they look like we'll pull this one
off the side here for just a quick
second for design comparison purposes
let me bring in an ipad air and the air
looks like a bigger iPad Mini now which
I really like the design of the mini so
I think apple is smart to do the same
thing with the air and if you stack them
you can see the thickness of each
they're both are really thin very very
like tablets in their own regard so
we'll do a full review of the ipad means
Retina Display run it through all its
test full paces or anything I don't you
guys know if it's worth your tablet doll
or anything you guys want to see
particular they leave in the comments
