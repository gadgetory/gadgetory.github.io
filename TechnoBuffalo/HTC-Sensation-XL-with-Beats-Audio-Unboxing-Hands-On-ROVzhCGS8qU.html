from TechnoBuffalo heareth and unboxing
for you of one of my favorite phones
from this year's CTIA this is the HTC
built sensation Excel there's a lot of
phone to like about this guy when I saw
the screen during a hands-on demo I was
probably one of the most impressive
screens I've ever seen the resolution is
not the best out there but the way the
screen actually looks and the way it
appears to your eyes whether you've got
glasses or indirect sunlight was really
impressive so I'm excited to go ahead
dig in and see if this guy that's
packing Beats Audio is as good as I
remember so first let me say this phone
has not been picked up by a carrier in
the US if you want to buy it
you can pick it up unlocked from our
friends at Negra electronics who sent
this guy over so you've got a picture of
the device on the front we've got some
beats headphone so it should be included
in the box so we'll talk about that a
bit more as we go through the phone
we've got some white stuff it's white
and shiny and sealed some specs on the
phone but don't bother reading that
we're gonna talk about it some
highlights here bundled with beats by
dr. dre your beats in-ear headphones are
the phones that come rockin here so I
don't have my obligatory big ol knife
with me so I thought I'd do something
else we're gonna start a new tradition
with the unnecessary hammer unboxing I'm
not gonna bash it no that would be
probably a fun way to unbox we're gonna
use the nail removal site I'm sure it's
got a technical name to it I'm gonna
call it the nail removal side to go
ahead and break this packaging or at
least break the seal
so go ahead it worked boom and it wasn't
much danger of me chopping off a finger
like we had with these big ol knife so
go ahead and peel off the packaging boom
and there we go alright so let's slide
this sucker out a little bit of a
cardboard sheath
and we've got another sticker of course
if we want to get their stickers we
gotta have something to get the room
with so we're gonna use the hammer yet
again which works surprisingly well
actually uh usually with the knife
I didn't recommend you try it at home
because you could slice your finger open
the hammer seems a little bit safer so
if you want to give that guy a whirl you
can do so
alright so HTC on the front and there is
it the sensation Excel pretty cool
packaging with the beats your beats
headphones right there go ahead and pull
this phone out the HTC packaging that
we've seen before place as far as the
protective stuff goes it's pretty nice
you got the Beats Audio logo there
very typical HTC people that you love or
don't love or prefer black the white I
like a white phone so it's sort of nice
to have push it off to the side see what
else we're gonna have we've got the
urbeats
here beats certainly gonna have this
phone for just about day and I don't
like to do phone reviews when I can't
give it sort of my full impressions so
there's not gonna be a full review this
guy I'm gonna do a very thorough
hands-on though of it as we walk through
so you got a carrying case beats by dre
monster of course are the partners
you've got some ear tips inside and a
little clip to clip it close by magnets
some more into information some books
charging cable and data sync that's of
course the micro USB variety and this is
a European phone it's got the UK and
other adapter with it you're gonna need
to bring your own adapted it alright so
I'll push the headphones off to the side
let's take a look at this guy there's a
lot to like and a lot to talk about here
with the sensation XL so I'll go ahead
and peel all this stuff off and I'll
start talking about the specs boom a
decent amount of weight to it alright so
let's make them powered on well
sometimes these phones have something
hidden in the battery compartment to
prevent you from turning it on by
accident so I'll go and try and pull
this off
and then I'll come back and tell you
what this better alright so the entire
back of the phone comes right off we've
seen this before with other HTC devices
go ahead and put this back slide the top
in and snap into place let's go and hit
power and now I think we're ready to
talk about the specs so this has a
charge in it and it does alright so this
is called a sensation XL for a reason
it's cuz it's got an XL screen which is
4.7 inches that's gonna be measured
diagonally with the resolution of 480 by
800 that's 199 ppi pixel density I don't
get caught up on the screen resolution
so much as to how it's actually gonna
look when it's in your hand on the
screen here really look impressive I've
seen just about every phone that's been
released over the past now almost four
years and this screen really rivals any
other phone I've had the privilege of
checking out alright so this phone
weighs 162 grams so it's by no means a
light phone and slide that up sim card
area I'll go through all the start-up
stuff not a sim card in there 16 gigs of
storage 768 megabytes of RAM does not
have an external SD card slot
unfortunately which is disappointing
especially considering its own music
centric so we'll go ahead and skip all
this stuff well hit next well it's it
next we'll skip internet set up I just
want to show you what the phone looks
like great so many things so many ways
to track me except skip finish even
though I'm American ah bad joke ok so it
is capable of HSPA+ potentially 14 4
megabytes down or HSUPA on the upside
for potentially 5.76 on the upside it
does have support for AT&amp;amp;T 850 band so
you should be able to get 3G speeds
anywhere you are despite this phone not
being released or really any intention
to be coming to the US on the back we've
got an 8 megapixel camera which can
shoot video at 720p that's not the only
cameras guys rockin also has look I turn
the camera on totally by accident
that looked awesome no like I meant to
do it um we've got a 1.3 megapixel
camera on the front it's running android
version 2.3 it's being powered by a 1.5
gigahertz scorpion processor and that's
a single core processor with the audrina
205 GPU and if you're keeping track at
home it's the Qualcomm MSM 8 to 5 v
chipset and as geeky as I am I am do
have to read that I didn't have that one
memorized the battery is 1600 milliamp
hours going to give you about 360 hours
of standby time on 2g or up to 11 hours
50 minutes on the top time side so we
could be able to get a lot of talking
done here alright so let's take a look
the phone we've seen mostly everything
here 1.5 gigahertz processor no no dual
core action going on here so let's take
a quick tour of the phone so you've got
your typical Android buttons I should
say your typical HTC Sense buttons they
do look a little bit different
we've got your home button which is
going to launch your pick a home screen
menu back and search stuff we've seen
proximity sensor and microphones in
their appropriate places on the left
hand side it's where your charging port
in syncing ports going to be on the
right you've got your volume rocker up
and down top power and lock button I
love it when it's on the upper right 3.5
millimeter headset jack a secondary
microphone there's that camera dual LED
flash got that sort of middle back to it
with the plastic on the bottom with the
beats logo right there and a ton of
little speakers and microphones littered
around hopefully a speakerphone on this
guy will be quite loud unable to connect
I know phone you don't have a SIM card
in you alright so this is a beats by
audio phone and that does a couple
things so first you can use any
headphone that you want here you can go
ahead and pop in whatever special
headphones you have if you have another
pair of Beats headphones you can use
those too they do come with the sort of
inappropriately dangling out of the box
your Beats headphones let me go and take
these guys out and show you what they
can do
so they do have on them full controls
for back forward play pause and
answering a phone call there's a
microphone built-in there too
they'll go ahead and plug these in and
you're gonna get a bit of a unique
experience and you should see if my
memory serves me correctly you should
see a Beats Audio logo up here when I
plug this thing in at least maybe when I
play some music I go ahead and do that
logo no logo looks like we have to go in
and do some music here let's go ahead
and open that up and see if they got any
songs and they do so I don't know what
any of these bands are or artists Wow um
here I had a girlfriend in high school
named Polina so we'll go ahead and pick
that songs and let's hit play there we
go and there's that Beats Audio logo and
that's gonna give you I'm by no means an
audiophile
to me sound this kind of sound but when
I did listen to this unfortunately I
can't really show you or let you listen
to it over YouTube and the camera when
you listen to music with beats
headphones versus without beats
headphones you definitely hear a
difference you hear deeper richer sounds
it just sounded better and that may be
totally arbitrary and it might be kind
of made up and psychosomatic but the
audio definitely sounded better
HTC really put together a nice package
in combination with monster Beats Audio
and probably dr. Dre was involved in
there somewhere
oh the audio just sounds very good if
you plug in headphones aren't Beats
Audio yeah I can get that little red be
up there at the top you can see them
there's the red beef so we'll go ahead
and close out of that hit home and let's
go ahead and take a look at some of the
other stuff they're gonna get let's go
ahead and jump into settings scroll on
down to the bottom about phone and you
can see your other kind of stuff we've
gotten here let's go ahead and take a
look at hardware information 6 software
information alright so Android 2.3.5 HTC
Sense 3.5 we already knew about and then
there's the software for
want to check the baseband kernel that
kind of stuff there you go go ahead and
at home let's see what kind of apps
we're gonna get out of the box
shouldn't be any carrier stuff in your
since obviously carry on Brandon's hair
getting sort of standard I'm gonna like
to say stock HTC stuff so you got
Dropbox added in there what else new
browser icon your standard Android stuff
the very underrated built-in navigation
that comes into Android that's what the
killer features for me they can get sort
of free turn-by-turn directions this
one's always kind of funny there's a
mirror application which all it does is
pretty much activate your front-facing
camera but it's funny that they call it
mirror so you can see yourself and
there's my finger you can see it
adjusting for the light as I move my
hand over it different hopefully you can
see maybe I was blocking it you can see
it sort of adjusting itself
I know it's always funny if there was an
app for that music Polaris Office you
can create Word docs tango for video
calling equips you can use whatever you
like SoundHound usage monitor Wi-Fi
hotspot nice that's bundled in there and
that's gonna be it of course you can
create frequents or check all your
downloaded stuff they've gone you're
gonna want to download a lot of stuff if
you're in the market for a larger screen
phone especially from the four point
seven inches this is gonna be a pretty
nice choice I will say that for someone
like me whose eyesight seems to be
getting progressively worse and as
resolutions on screens get better and
better screens get harder and harder to
read and I know I kept using those words
over and over again so for me having the
screen resolution be as high as possible
isn't the most ideal thing in the world
I like the larger screen the little
lower resolution but that's just me some
people certainly prefer the highest
resolution and the highest pixel density
possible so definitely know yourself and
know how you look at phones if you are
like me and you want something that's
looks pretty sharp but also gives you
the ability to read it without having to
squint or put on your glasses this is
gonna be a pretty good phone for you
some of the negatives though the lack of
external storage you're gonna be stuck
with 16 gigs so you're gonna bring a ton
of music with you May
be not the best choice if you want to
get your Spotify on or streaming music
this may be a phone to look at if screen
brightness it's hard to sort of say what
it is about this screen that looks so
nice and I've seen just so many screens
on so many phones and very rarely do I
get impressed anymore
I'll put the screen on this guy just
really is a quite nice 720p video and
megapixel camera it's all pretty
standard HEC stuff nothing overly
exciting there you can see some of the
control that you're gonna get it's a
pretty nice choice so if you want to
pick it up be sure to check out our
friends at Negri electronics this is
going to be as in-depth as we're going
to get to the phone since again we don't
have it for a long period of time and I
feel like it would be lying and cheating
if I did a review of a phone that I only
had for a day some other sites I'm not
gonna mention do do that we don't so
this has been a hands-on and at first
look you know first impressions of these
sensation Excel fingers crossed this is
going to come to a carrier in the US but
if it doesn't you can go ahead and pick
it up today it is available I'm John
Rhett endure from TechnoBuffalo we
should check us out for all your tech
news for unboxings for hands-on for
others stuff that has to do with
technology TechnoBuffalo comm is the
place to go I'll see you guys next video
