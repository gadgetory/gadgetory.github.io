TechnoBuffalo here and today February
7th spreads took the wraps off what they
promised to be an industry-first
they're much hyped industry exclusive
events and they unveiled the Kyocera
echo stick around and let's see if this
device is going to resonate with
consumers all right so I'll edit Oriole
eyes a bit at the end let me go ahead
and run through the specs of Kyocera
echo is it is a dual screen Android
smartphone you can see some pictures of
what this guy looks like but it is to
fullscreen it's kind of interesting and
lets you do two things at once or use it
as one big screen in tablet mode it's a
sprint exclusive it'll be available to
spring for $199 see we look down this
time looking at some notes the
conference and just ended here it looks
like a normal phone in regular mode sort
of slate phone that we become I used to
seeing it is running Android 2.2 not 2.3
presumably that's because there was a
lot of customization that needed to be
done to Android to make this dual screen
functionality work perhaps hidden have
enough lead time with the gingerbread of
course it's version 2.3
I just featured two 3.5 inch WVGA LCD
screens which is kind of unique and
those are really nice size screens
effective two of them make it even
better you're not gonna get a 7-inch
screen these things are put together in
tablet mode now she's gonna get a 4.7
inch screen when these two are next to
each other in tablet mode at the
resolution of 960 by 800 now certainly
there is a hinge and is going to be a
little bit of a gap in the middle but
the gap the middle is not very large and
could use this pretty easily as a you
know a tablet device I suppose
potentially even as a tiny little
ereader uh one thing to note this is not
a 4G device does not have WiMAX its 3G
only it has a reader five megapixel
camera no front-facing camera on it
although will shoot video at 720p all
right so those are the facts of the
Kyocera echo let me go ahead and out
editorialize for just a little bit
let me say also that we are covering the
event live while the ton of footage and
hands-on opinions of the Kyocera echo
coming soon
I think the echo is probably an
appropriate name so I was probably the
noise that they were hearing when they
were announcing this phone first the
mission of 4G is tremendous
especially for a halo product and halo
beings for the top of the food chain if
you live in a 4G area and you're staring
at an Evo 4G or this dual screen Kyocera
chances are you're gonna go towards the
4G device it's definitely a unique form
factor and I give Sprint credit for
taking a risk they're definitely trying
something new can certainly be needed a
bit of a refresh partnership with Q is
there's have been interesting and not
necessarily what you've thought of as a
premium hands that manufacture in the
past a spread the sort of taking a break
from Kyocera and now the reintroducing
them to the marketplace it's a novel
idea I like the fact you can do this
sort of simulcasting thing you can
actually run two applications
side-by-side so for instance reading
email you can use the bottom as a
preview pane almost like you would do an
Outlook or Thunderbird depending
whatever you use for your desktop email
client so there are a lot of sort of
cool functionality you can queue up
YouTube videos on one screen and watch
them on the bottom use it as a big
tablet there really are a lot of
positive advice what the negatives are
really glaring on I think most notably
is the 4G emission and go along with
that the front-facing camera for video
chatting so I don't know if this would
be a device designed to run out to go
grab right away as a consumer I
certainly has a tech reviewer I'm
curious to get my hands on and perhaps
my opinions will change when I see in
the flesh my initial concerns would be
battery life running one 3.5 inch screen
with Android is gonna be a battery suck
anyway let alone having to run to and
this sort of unique and it makes it not
the most attractive
devices in the world but it is
pocketable and you get a 4.7 inch screen
this thing is in tablet mode which is
pretty cool so I wonder what you guys
think about the Kyocera echo does it
resonate with you or you interest and
not interested are you super excited
about what Sprint's is bringing out I
love to hear your thoughts and feedback
hey guys I'm John retinue from
TechnoBuffalo see
