checking out the Asus Transformer Pad
this is the newest model this is one
they announced this week the tf701t a
10.1 inch screen ridiculous screen
resolution you're looking at 2560 by
1600 it's an IPS display it is crystal
clear you guys I wish I could just show
this thing to all of you so that you
could see how amazingly beautiful this
screen is in person because it is really
stunning it's also running on quad core
it's taker for this is a Tegra 4 chipset
quad core processor 2 gigs of RAM what I
really like about this is in the dock
this is really cool there is a u.s. full
USB port and then also a full SD card
slot so you can expand that doc but if
you decide to tonight use the dock which
a lot of people do use the dock if you
decide not to use it
never fear there is a microSD port on
the side of the device that you can use
micro HDMI headphone jack of course that
beautiful asus finish that we all know
and love it is gorgeous here's one of
your speakers right here when you turn
it back around we get a 1 point 2
megapixel front facing camera and you
don't have to use the keyboard dog with
this like I said you have it right up
let's check out it's pretty standard
Android so you're looking at hollow just
like you normally would of course it is
in fact running Android 4.2 point2 you
go all the way down to about you can see
it's already pulled up android 4 points
were going to right there boom I'm going
to be honest guys I was a skeptic when
the original transformer pad launched
back in 2011 and now here in Berlin
looking at this I am a convert I'm a
believer I think this is a great device
it's amazing to me that this is the same
SOC used in Nvidia shield you can get
hands on this device it looks like in
2014 hopefully earlier rather than later
and no price point yet of course but you
can keep up with the Asus Transformer
Pad over on TechnoBuffalo com of course
as it gets closer and closer to launch
we're going to be bringing you more
stuff from fifa here in Berlin and
that's it for this one this is the Asus
Transformer Pad and we will see in the
next video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
