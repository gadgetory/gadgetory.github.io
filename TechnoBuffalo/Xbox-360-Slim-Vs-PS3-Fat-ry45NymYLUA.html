John Retton Jeffrey TechnoBuffalo here
ever since Microsoft announced their
redesigned Xbox 360 there were immediate
comparisons being made in assets to the
original PlayStation 3 thought it could
be fun to sort of take a look at these
two consoles and see how they stack up
we're doing another video sort of a more
moderate however two Hardware comparing
the Xbox 360 the new version to the new
ps3 slim of the matte finish so both
consoles of both manufacturers
specifically went in very divergent
directions when doing their redesigns
Sony for example got rid of this room
shiny piano black with touch sensitive
buttons and went for a slimmer matte
version with actually physical buttons
Microsoft went through the opposite way
and they got rid of their matte console
with physical buttons added a shiny
glossy console with touch sensitive
buttons so let me go ahead and talk
about some mr. Parris's here so here
we've got the PlayStation 3 it's got
touch sensitive eject and touch
sensitive power
the place then the Xbox the other hand
has touch sensitive power button right
there though it still looks like a
physical button doesn't actually get
press and a touch sensitive eject button
clearly both have a sort of shiny dust
magnet fingerprint magnet
Guam's furniture they both actually look
very nice I rather preferred the look of
the original PlayStation 3 to the
redesigned slim so from a port
standpoint let's talk about those well
I'll upload both these in you can hear
it sort of the noise comparisons of of
each now recognize this is not a new
hardware against new hardware we are to
be doing a comparison again between the
new Xbox 360 to play edition slim which
month will sort of put these tubes or
head-to-head so you can see them next to
each other so let's look at size and
we'll look at some ports those sort of
stack up next to each other the
PlayStation 3 packs a lot of power and
still does but all the power and blu-ray
nits takes up of these amount of space
the PlayStation 3 the original version
so significantly larger than the
redesigned Xbox 360 so from a features
import standpoint your course you're
getting blu-ray here a standard DVD here
although you are getting
802 11 and wireless here just getting B
and G so from a pork standpoint we've
got two USB ports on the front here of
the Xbox we go ahead and kick the sucker
around we've got a few more ports to
discuss we've got three more USB ports
we've got a Internet Ethernet in LAN
port does your Zilla report it's going
to be four connect HDMI prior to EAB
board optical audio out and power and if
we turn the playstation three shiny
shiny one back on its caboose we can see
report already there as well so we have
on the PlayStation 3 go ahead and sort
of tilt it up just a little bit Dietary
audio/video port optical audio EMI
Ethernet and the power cord I should
mention that the PlayStation 3 has an
internal power source so there's no
power brick immediate PlayStation 3
certainly the same is not true with the
Xbox you guys saw during the unboxing
it's got a very significant brick to it
so let's go ahead and turn these back
around
I'm going to plug each of them in so you
can hear the noise I will tell you that
the Xbox is becoming lighter though then
the PlayStation 3 shiny shiny shiny
version let's go ahead and plug these
suckers in and see how they sound all
right we've got both consoles rehook tup
and plugins go ahead and check out the
noise and then we have disks in each I'm
going to go ahead and turn on your
Playstation 3 and we'll see how it
sounds so it's all when you can hear the
disk spinning and other than an initial
sort of spitting disc it's a very quiet
console let's go ahead and turn on the
Xbox from 62 to get that same of
whooshing this sound although I will say
that when both consoles are on and
Weavin from the disk of the PlayStation
is a bit quieter than the new Xbox if
noise is important to you then I guys
wanted a few sort of a fun comparison
the two consoles I know it's not modern
hardware Ian's walking hardware we will
again be doing the PlayStation slim
against the Xbox men but the comparisons
as far as aesthetics were inevitable
with these two consoles that it would be
fine sort of put them next to each other
anyway I'm John Rhett enger' from
TechnoBuffalo and I'll see you in the
next video bye-bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
