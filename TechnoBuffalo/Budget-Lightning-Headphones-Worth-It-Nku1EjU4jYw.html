from TechnoBuffalo and if you saw our
video a couple days earlier we got an
iPhone 7 dummy unit and one of the
rumors that's been floating around has
been taking off the 3.5 millimeter
headphone jack now people are feeling
all types of ways about this I'm not
really gonna express my emotions about
it but more importantly lightning
headphones have been popping up all over
the place and in general they've been
pretty expensive but we wanted to find
was an affordable pair of lightning
headphones or more affordable and
reviewed them and let you guys know what
we thought so let's go ahead and get
started so the pair we're looking at
today are the bright tech Apple MFI
approved pure Lightning earphones very
long name you can get them for about 50
dollars on Amazon so they're not the
cheapest headphones in the world but
they are cheaper compared to other
Lightning headphones so out of the box
with build quality I can't really
complain about these headphones that
come to flatten on tangled cables so
that's good the headphones themselves
fit pretty nicely in your years however
they're not that great for running or
something because they will fall out if
you move too much I did notice however
the control talk was rather large but
that's because that's where the DAC is
going to be one of the advantages of
having lightning over 3.5 millimeter
audio now in terms of actually listening
to music my experience was pretty varied
and very interesting with these
headphones I first started off using
title to get high 500 and it sounded
horrible it sounded incredibly tinny
there was no bass I don't know why but
once we switched to Apple music and
Spotify the headphone sounded way better
and they sounded how I expected them to
sound much fuller with a good frequency
response still not that much kick on the
low-end but much better than when we
first listened to them as we continue to
test the headphones I just came to
realize that it had nothing to do with
title it just had to do with the
headphones themselves they were super
inconsistent with their sound profile
sometimes it would have bass sometimes
it would have none it would be super
tinny another weird quirk and knock
against these headphones is that when
you plug in the Lightning port it
doesn't always work meaning that you'll
be playing music and sometimes the music
will just play out loud it takes a
couple times of plugging it unplugging
it flipping the lightning cable around
upside down back and forth before it
actually starts working super annoying
to deal with and that's really it for
these headphones guys unfortunately very
disappointing given that they didn't
work half the time for various reasons
whether it was audio playback or just
the lightning cable itself not firing
audio through it
let me know what you guys think in the
comments down below
very curious to hear what you guys have
to say give us a thumbs up if you like
this video and I'll see you guys in the
next one thank you so much for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
