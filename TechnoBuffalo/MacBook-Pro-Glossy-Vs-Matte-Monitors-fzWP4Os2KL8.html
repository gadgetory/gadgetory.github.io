everybody for asking questions in the
questions video this is the first one in
response to that this is gonna discuss
Matt vs. glassy on the MacBook Pro as
many of you know or many movie may not
know I chose the glossy option and I'll
tell you why I chose glossy I spent a
lot of time probably more than I should
have on the store comparing both and the
color really just popped out on the
glossy some of the knocks I've heard on
glossy is that there's some eye strain
it reflects light and it looks sort of
washed out in sunlight I can't speak for
all glossy in general I can only speak
for what Apple put on the new MacBook
Pros but I have no I trained at all I'm
necessarily even have the best eyesight
and all the picture I my desk you guys
can't see but it's right over a lamp and
the Sun is right behind me and I've
gotten no no glare whatsoever I don't
see myself from the screens black and
I'm watching a movie I mean it looks it
looks gorgeous as far as being outside
I've taking the laptop outside and I'm
not experiencing anything washed out at
all maybe I just got lucky or or
something but to me the screens gorgeous
people are saying that they prefer matte
and certainly a mess a personal choice
really depends on what what you like
Matt is nice I here for being outside I
guess the picture maybe looks a little
bit a little bit better and there's no
glare at all but the color doesn't look
as rich on the mat you have a choice on
the Mac Pro whether to go Matt or not
Matt it's not an option on the Mac books
Apple only included a glossy option for
that hope just helps to answer some of
your questions on the glossy or not
glossy like I said I love mine I
wouldn't trade it for for anything but
again it's a personal preference this is
the first response some of the questions
that you guys had I look for more videos
the coming days
answering some more I hope this is
helpful you guys thanks for watching
thanks for subscribing and enjoy the
rest of your days wherever you are
bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
