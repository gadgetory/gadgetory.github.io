to you by State Farm helping you get to
a better State everyone from
TechnoBuffalo here we are at e3 2013 in
the Sony booth taking a look at one of
the main attractions here at the show it
is right down here here is the
PlayStation 4 in all its glory so I'm
going to show you what the console looks
like I'll show you the controller take a
little bit of a look at some gameplay as
well so here we've got the console that
looks like a three-ring binder to me up
close it's got dual layers planted to
add a bit of an angle it's a little bit
larger than the outgoing slim last
generation ps3 but it is much
better-looking in person than at least
it looked online so let's take a look at
the new Dual Shock controller there is a
lot of things that are different here
first I'll say the controller feels so
much more ergonomic in the hand the r2
button has a nice clear angle to it
makes that controller fit much more
nicely there's a decent amount of weight
to it as well on each side so different
here the main difference you now have a
touchpad here down below which we don't
be able to test that out yet in games
but you can see how it works and as you
go ahead and move your fingers around
it's actually at a very natural place
also if you can click it so you can use
a button you can use that as well for
touching we've got a blue right light
there right now the comp is gonna use
with the PlayStation Eye kind of format
so we can track to control the motion of
where you are in a six axis format I
will say though that the analog sticks
and the button throw really feel solid
and of course you got the new
PlayStation and the share buttons there
as well our controller feels really nice
in the hand I usually get most of my
gaming on the Xbox for six I like to
wear the controller felt versus the last
generation Dual Shock I'll say this
feels really really good as good as the
Xbox 360 controller feels so if you were
debating what console is gonna be right
for you this one might be a great way to
go especially at $100 less than the Xbox
360 let's take a look at some gameplay
here as well so this is the ps4 and we
are looking at
one of the most exciting games is gonna
be coming to the PlayStation 4 pinball
arcade I have never seen pinball look at
this real all rights a pinball game
clearly not the best representation of
graphics but it is what Sony is showing
here that looks beautiful looks nice
it's a pinball game you know if you want
to play pinball you're better off going
to a real-life Park Canada can still
find one get as opposed to doing it here
but you can see the gameplay it looks
like it's very pretty looks gorgeous
obviously probably one tenth of one
percent of what the ps4 is actually
capable of but overall I've been really
impressed with the controller how the
console will sit hopefully will be
impressed the graphics and the launch
lineup it looks really good hope you

ps4 I'm John brennick and TechnoBuffalo
