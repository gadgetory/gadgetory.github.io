to you by netflix what's up everyone
walk back the pursuit of renter's rants
i miss John renders to show where I get
mad about something going on on the
internet and rants by definition I think
are a little bit of rational this one
I'm kind of irrationally upset about
email email etiquette man much like
normal etiquette is totally going away
it's been pissing me off this week's
that's right your aunts I'm going to
tell you how to be a normal considerate
person when sending an email I'm gonna
start the first one that really was the
impetus behind this whole video don't
make stupid excuses if you didn't reply
to an email for like a week and then a
reply was sorry I've been so swamped
with like a one-sentence response you
are lying you sent a one-sentence
response you have not been that swamp
that you could reply to an email don't
say oh I've been so busy own it Nick I'm
sorry i didn't reply to you my bad
that's totally fine but don't make
stupid stupid excuses friday and send an
email if you don't want to reply don't
reply you can even say you forgot if
it's honest just do it just don't make
excuses that are clearly just excuses
and make you look like a jerk whole
second one it is CES time for us that
are in the tech industry that means we
get a ton of emails know the difference
between CC and BCC CC stands for carbon
copy that means everybody who gets that
email can see all the email addresses
ccer met when you want someone to read
an email but not necessarily supposed to
go to them it's not they're not the
topic of it you're asking a particular
questions you want them to be aware of
what's going on PCC stands for blind
carbon copy which means people cannot
see anybody else that email was sent to
you if your say sending out a mass email
you probably want to use bcc use and
everybody sees the bajillion people that
you sent that email to and get the kind
of information but also don't feel very
special that you're not asking you
individually to do that booth door so
keep that in mind bcc vs CC holy big
difference this one is one that i get a
lot of its professional email be
professional a lot of people will send
me messages asking for for jobs or
unions on things and they are litter
with things that would never tolerate if
someone were to send me an actual letter
smiley faces LOL silly abbreviations you
want to send a professional email to
anyone whether it's obviously not
necessarily to me but anyone that is in
a quasi professional environment always
err on the side of professional always
always always it's like going to a job
interview always wear a suit if worst
case scenario they'll say wow that guy
is overdressed but if you go the other
way it'll be well that guy does not care
at all you showed up the interview in
sandals and you know shorts there's
always be professional always read your
emails over again before you send it
it's just a good way to go this is a big
one NSA and snooping and all kinds of
other stuff spin news recently remember
email isn't private especially relevant
if you work for a company the company if
it's company email address they own that
email so tell your jerky friends from
college to not send you dirty pictures
or sent to your jokes to your work email
because people will see it and the
chances are you might get in trouble for
it even if you don't you know they could
always go through and look you're even
looking for reason to fire to you we're
looking for way to justify laying you
off it just better just remember email
is not private at all you to put your
own personal email but especially a work
email this one probably is more relevant
to some of the older folks out there but
younger folks will take heed do not send
viruses you might not know you're
standing aligners if you get something
that says dot exe did you not send it
obviously it only works on the pc side
of things that macs are playing viruses
that they can still get just be careful
what you're sending people what your
wording speaking a forwarding things
stop sending chain letters please please
please stop and especially stop sending
with crazy caveat if you don't forward
this to 40,000 people um monkey living
in South America is going to die for
monkey pox whatever just cut it out
nobody cares just stop it I hate chain
letters cut it out next remember tone
doesn't always translate an email so if
you think you're being funny Vinick
you're being sarcastic think you're
being cute the person is reading that
email could totally not get that from
how they are reading an email tone very
early isn't translating you can
oftentimes lead to crazy
miscommunications that happened to me a
ton of time to now it's err on the side
of like total caution when sending email
so be aware of that and please the
biggest rule of all just
have some common courtesy emails this
one for communication when you're
communicating with anyone no matter
digitally or in person just be courteous
it is a good rule for humans in general
just don't be a jerk don't make excuses
or whatever's going on be professional
and be nice and the world would be a
much happier smiley place we exhale from
