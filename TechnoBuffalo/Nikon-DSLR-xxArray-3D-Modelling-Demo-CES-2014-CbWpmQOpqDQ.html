to you by Toyota what's up everyone John
render from TechnoBuffalo so much
technology at CES is all passive you
look at things to check things out but
very rarely you get a chance to be in
the technology here we are at the Nikon
booth they have this incredible 68 DSLR
camera array it takes a 3d image of you
and puts you inside of the game I just
went and did it and I sort of had my
rock star moment when 68 flash bulbs
went off at once and they take your 3d
model and they literally put you inside
of a game this was done really in about
2 hour turnaround they didn't do any
touch up on it just to show how quickly
it could be done but imagine with a loop
10-15 minutes of touching up artifacting
this looks absolutely incredible and you
and I'm talking to you can literally be
in the game it's so longer just a fun
slogan also you put yourself into a
mobile game you can see a tablet quick
yourself breakdance if you've always
wanted the opportunity to crush goombahs
and get invincible stars nikon can
actually help you do that it's a really
cool technology to actually see
something that really only read about us
to make science fiction even just about
a year ago but Nikon's got it it seems
like it was so far away from years from
now but is actually here today and if
you're at CES of course checked out at
the nikon booth hope you guys enjoyed
let me know what you think what would
you do with your own 3d image of you
what would you put yourself in keep it
clean leave in the comments right down
below special thank you to Toyota for
sponsoring all of our CES coverage</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
