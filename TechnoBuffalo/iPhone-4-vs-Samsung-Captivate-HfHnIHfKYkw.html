from TechnoBuffalo here you know that we
love smartphones smackdowns and in this
edition of our vs. series we've got the
two kings of a team cheese pill in one
corner we have Apple's iPhone 4 and the
other we have Samsung's captivate a
variants of their Galaxy S series of
phones they're gonna put these two
suckers head-to-head in a ten round
series and see who really is the king so
in this ten round series we are going to
cover call quality battery speed browser
screen signal strength design camera
text entry and offerings of them
obviously are many other category
covered by the interest of brevity sort
of encapsulating everything that's most
important to the average smartphone user
these ten rounds should do a pretty
decent job
let's go ahead and jump right in and
talk about call qualities these these
are phones first and foremost the call
is not gonna sound good it's not going
to be much used to let's start with the
iPhone 4 of call quality is actually
much better than I experienced on the
3GS addition of an extra microphone way
this helped with noise canceling we
tested this in quiet environments and
out of the street with cars driving by
people on the other ends it reported
very little background noise there was
no popping or hissing and we were to
apply it environment there was no
background noise whatsoever when we were
on the other end of the phone call it
sounded very good to us as well held on
the signal strength pretty well assuming
you weren't holding a particular way I
really tended to work quite well we'll
talk about signal strength when we get
to that round so next let's jump over to
the Samsung Captivate which also has
very very solid call quality I was crisp
it was clear there was no white noise
and both of our Texas industries and
indoors you're going to get a very good
calling experience from either of these
devices if you're very happy to report
we'd like to give high marks when Sony
deserve it and both of these actually
have very good call Claudia to me your
go getting app signal wherever you are
app and both of these were on ECGs 3G
network so round 1 is going to be a time
let's go ahead and jump right on into
batter
these things are going to suck a lot of
juice 3.5 inch screen of the iPhone or
the 4-inch screen on the captivate
shouldn't you're going to use a lot of
battery power so you want to make sure
that you're gonna have something that
can get you through a full day so the
battery on the iPhone you're going to
get 14 hours of top 10 it were just
about eight hundred and forty minutes
and 300 hours of standby time on the
captivate you're going to get five point
eight three hours of talk time or 350
minutes of top time and 340 hours of
standby time so when it comes to actual
talking usage the iPhone more than
double the battery life of the captivate
calculates gonna have about 40 hours
extra standby 300 versus 340 button
actually usage and daily usage I can get
through a full day of heavy internet
heavy email on the iPhone for about 40
percent battery left end of the day on
the captivate I was just pushing maybe
five percent so it's a real little test
you can come easy difference between the
batteries here so unless you have a car
charger or you can charge at your desk
while you're at work you're gonna have a
difficult time getting through a full
day's use with the captivate assume
you're gonna use it to its fullest
potential so the battery round
definitely has to go to the iPhone
fourth is a really great job of getting
through a full day so the iPhone 4 is
going to take battery alright so next
let's talk about speed both these are
running almost identical 1 gigahertz
processor you may have heard the word
hummingbird throwing around Santa
prostitutes Samsung is using here in the
galaxy s devices which is very very very
similar to the a4 chip found in the
iPhone 4 also clocked at 1 gigahertz
it's been reported that the hummingbird
chip is actually much faster than the
Qualcomm built Snapdragon chips that
we've seen we're going to put that to
the test in future videos but I will say
that this thing is a screamer as is the
iPhone 4 let's go ahead and check speed
so first let me show you that all
afternoon to close in the background
sure to make this a little bit fair I
turned off the Y wallpapers here on the
Android device to go ahead and use a
task killer program and make sure
everything's closed up will kill all
selected apps I'm do the same thing here
on the iPhone 4 to make sure things are
closed although I know it isn't really
true back rounding I want to make sure
that at least we're
apples to apples and make sure that all
the available memory is free for these
tests so go ahead and close everything I
can see I've got a lot of things open
here on the iPhone 4 I think we're
slowly getting to the end of the open
programs least I hope so and there we
are okay so let's go ahead and see how
these things compare in the speed
Department will do a full browser
comparisons later let's see how they
load web sites so we cut into the same
Wi-Fi network and these are pages that
have been loaded on both devices before
so consider this a test of sites that
you visit on a regular basis let's go
ahead and open up Safari got
TechnoBuffalo getting queued up there
look should have TechnoBuffalo I'm
getting ready to queue it up here as
well all right so we have TechnoBuffalo
queued up on each of these advices I'm
gonna zoom in a little bit so you can
get a better sense of how these are
going to work i'ma go and just hit a
simple refresh on each you will check
the browser speed and again both of them
are on the same Wi-Fi network so I've
got it ready to go here I'll do a quick
refresh here as well and we'll see which
one is indeed faster all right and they
are off and they are hit and almost
exactly the same time which is actually
harder to do than you think and almost
all the speed tests that we've run on
the iPhone 4 versus of the Droid X Evo
4G the incredible and early no no
surprise here Android has been much
faster in browsing tests it actually has
been noticeably faster on general speed
test well see if that's what it keeps
true so in the browser test least for
this website
clearly the captivate was much quicker
let's go ahead and try another website
we'll try the YouTube channel
youtube.com slash John Ford Lakers
alright so next we are going to try and
refresh the YouTube channel which is
youtube.com slash John for lickers you
can see it queued up right here we'll go
ahead and see if we can sort of get any
sort of semblance of speed and see who
is faster so it go here go here as well
and we are off and we'll see which one
loads I should mention if there is some
Flash content here I'll talk about that
in the browser which is probably going
to make the iPhone 4 page load a little
bit faster than we're going
see on the captive a since it does have
full Flash content I generally takes a
little bit longer to load so go ahead
and just give it one more second to sort
of queue up here there it goes
and it is done so definitely there was a
little bit of lag here we'll talk about
why in the browser you can see the video
was actually already starting to play
using it's sort of ingrown flash player
hoping to sort of keep in mind so from
and I will tell you that in general
browsing doing these certain tests
head-to-head the captivate in turn on
flash pages was noticeably faster than
other flash pages and that sort of been
true with all Android devices so if
served from a browser speed standpoint
the captivate is definitely faster but
browser not the only sort of speed test
that we have let's check applications
I think there's any sort of speed
difference here as well so go ahead and
close out go ahead hit the home button
there and we'll close out this and I'll
go ahead and close everything here will
kill all selected apps I'll do the same
thing here at one cuz that was running
flash and that can take up a bit of
resources so let's try opening up
there's some similar applications
everything's been closed let's go and
open up the browser from cool and sort
of see which one's quicker and you get a
sensor of how fast is hummingbird
processor and a4 processor really are
that wasn't so fair I hit it a little
bit later but you can still see that
even the delay that I hit it there's
still a bit of a difference but they're
opening up different web pages let's go
ahead and try something a bit more
similar to and open up let's say
calendars on each so go ahead and go to
applications you can get a little bit of
a sense to what the calendar system the
applications look like here on the
captivating so a little bit faster on
the captivate let's go ahead and open up
the camera applications on you can see
danger a difference there so we got the
camera ready there let's try it on both
devices now I do know that this is sort
of different different operating systems
have different speeds this isn't the
most scientific text just sort of way to
get to see how quickly or how slowly
general things are going to work on
devices so in a lot of these general
usage in the nuances in the speed of the
phone are hard to sort of translate on
video I want to get to things like
transitions from screen to screen
applications running in the background
generally what I found is that the
captivate is a bit quicker out in the
iPhone for when everything is closed
they're generally pretty even but we
have applications running in the
background
I found the captivate to really excel
ever had any slowdown with multiple
applications running even just in the
browser test as well we saw from normal
web page normal web pay about Flash
content the captivate is noticeably
faster so we are going to give speed to
the Android handset here yet again which
has been the theme the captivate is
going to take the speed round and since
we're just talking about browsers now
would be a very good time to jump in and
talk about each browser so let's start
here with the iPhone and this is
probably a great page to look at the
YouTube channel the browser on the Apple
products has been outstanding here
everybody knows that's been the
benchmark for us for a lot of the other
manufacturers how they can implement a
successful browser
you've got very smooth flick scrolling
you've got double tap to zoom pinch and
zoom works very well as fluid the
physics engine meeting how quickly you
scroll works very well you will notice
however there is a big gap right there
nothing was playing on the YouTube
channel that's because this does not
support flash but quite obviously Apple
is sort of back see html5 course which a
lot of sites are adopting however a lot
of websites still relying very heavily
on Flash content and if we're going to
have the option to use that on the
iPhone 4 I will say that I'm an iPhone 4
user and I use it because I really
enjoyed the browser it's been a great
experience for me that's far let's go
ahead and take a look at the browser
here on the Samsung Captivate
let's go ahead and jump back to the
YouTube account I think it's a really
good place to place to start so you know
wallet as low name will tell you that it
works very similar to what we saw on
Apple's device do you get this where the
pinch to zoom and the scrolling which I
can show you right here so scrolling is
pretty smooth it's not as smooth it's a
bit jittery but again we have some flash
content right here I'll talk about you
can do a double tap to zoom you have to
pinch to zoom there as well
you can also see now that this video is
actually playing inside of the browser
and that is because the captivate does
support flash you can play a flash game
from like flash to for seven other sort
of flash game websites and it works very
well
now while the scrolling may not be as
smooth as what we see on the Apple
products be able to have flash actually
have flash work really well this is
probably one of the best implementations
I've seen a flash on a mobile product
I've tested a lot of flash capable
Android devices
the captivate just does a really nice
job you can sort of see if they're
playing I got the volume turned down and
it works really really well so when it
comes to browser I'm very happy to give
up maybe a little bit of smooth
scrolling have the ability to view
almost any website on the Internet
so browsing is sort of very tough but
this round also has to go to the
captivate as well the addition of Flash
really makes it exciting you can see the
video there I was actually playing very
smoothly and surprisingly the audio is
synced up to that as well
so browser is going to the captivate all
right so go ahead and close out of these
we're gonna talk a bit about screens and
this is going to be a quick round touch
I made a video comparing the screens on
each so the iPhone 4 I'll put a link to
that video right now I can take a look
that and sort of get a full almost 10
minute overview on the screen
technologies but very briefly the iPhone
has a 3.5 inch capacitive screen
something I was calling a Retina display
essentially means a 640 by 960
resolution I can show over 16 million
colors the cafe on the other hand has a
four inch capacitive Super AMOLED screen
to talk about a bit earlier the touch
technology is actually built into the
glass itself so you're going to get sort
of darker blacks two richer colors and a
higher contrast ratio then you get on
other phones you also gonna get better
visibility in the sunlight it's got a
resolution of 480 by 800
I sort of compared both of these and the
overall conclusion was that they were
very very very evenly matched I was one
conference because that the other one
the captivate has a bit of a grayish you
to the color where the iPhone 4 does not
color saturation is very bright on the
can't debate and a little bit darker on
the iPhone 4 however you can sort of see
us pixels nicer when the screen
resolution came into play this one
really is a personal preference Brown
going to watch that video for a full
overview but this one is definitely a
tie and really it's a fantastic time you
can't go wrong either way both of them
just work very very very well so it's
either whichever one you decide to go
with you're going to get a fantastic
spring all right let's go away to talk
about signaling you guys may have seen
in another video that I did comparing
the iPhone death grip on seven other
devices clearly the iPhone four suffers
from this the signal derogation when you
hold it the captivate actually does
almost worse than the iPhone 4 go and
check that video the antenna must run on
the right-hand side and the phone is
held out at the right hand like this as
far as drop very very very quickly so
this one is also a tie but it's
unfortunate tied because both of the hem
suffer from severe antenna issues
certain the iPhone fours and a lot
talked about it a lot of phones sort of
have this although Apple seems to put a
big bullseye on there if you know push
here to kind of lose reception but
captivates mostly on the right-hand side
so this one is a very sort of
unfortunate I to have because neither
one of them really shines as far as
antenna and sort of death grip
degradation and the can't debate it
really isn't even have to grip it very
tightly you can still sort of hold it in
your hand you will have that signal
strength drop out so unfortunately this
one is also going to be a time so let's
talk next a bit about the design
certainly only you want to feel a good
point on a smart phone status is always
sort of a little bit associated with
these sort of devices let Sarah talk
about how each of them look the iPhone
has a bit of a premium feel to it it's
got glass on the front and certainly it
has a glass on the back as well it's got
stainless steel bandage running around
the side here in here and it's got a
very nice weight to the phone and feel
like it's made of very high premium
materials the captivate has this
gorgeous four inch screen which is just
big enough to be usable and not big
enough there
putting into your pocket the back is
made of a plastic and metal combination
the plastic here metal here no LED flash
in the back we'll talk about a little
bit later a captivate does feel very
nice in the hand it does feel a bit
lighter than the iPhone 4 and the
plastic does make you feel a little bit
cheaper so from a design standpoint
certainly you're gonna get a removal
back on the Galaxy S and it's taste
goodbut captivate we're not going to
remove the battery on the iPhone for
sure of a design that's an example I
think the iPhone serve a classic look
and this round is going to go to the
iPhone that can be here the comments
going crazy but I prefer the way that
the iPhone 4 looks at it calculate both
are very good-looking devices however if
I had to choose one the picking just
based on aesthetics alone I would have
to go to the iPhone 4 alright so next
let's talk about camera both feature Phi
and megapixel cameras and I'll show you
guys some sampling pictures a video of
what you look like so there's some
differences here we've got the 5
megapixel sensor on the back of the
iPhone and the 5 megapixel sensor here
on the back of the captivate however
you'll notice that the iPhone has an LED
flash or captivate does not the iPhone
also features a front-facing VGA camera
for a video chat which the captivate
does not so I'll put the videos and
pictures up right now you guys go ahead
and take a quick look to see what that
looks like
so you saw that video Claudia picture
quality were very similar there one
exception being a low light during where
the LED flash would come into play so
just based on that alone of the iPhone
we definitely have to wing around just
based on the flash
how are the inclusions our front-facing
camera I really sort of push it over the
edge when I come to camera quality the
iPhone 4 is going to sort of take this
although one sort of bit of notice for
the captivated thicknesses interest to
you is the option that you're going to
have with the camera you're going to get
a bit more option wise and you can with
the iPhone 4 let me show you very
quickly what this looks like so you can
go ahead and pick your different
shooting modes beauty continuous vintage
is her almost like filters that go on
top you can go ahead and pick your scene
mode whichever your taking pictures out
and they're a ton of choices you can go
ahead and almost pick your exposure
value as well then you've got some
visibility settings here so you get a
bit more customization with what you can
do with the captivate when it comes to
actual quality I prefer having LED flash
in the front facing camera over a few
more fixture options generally I just
take camera and shoot so camera quality
wise the iPhone 4 is going to take this
edge so now let's go ahead talk about
text entry both these are called slate
devices meaning they almost all they
look like a slate no physical keyboard
on each so how are you going to input
text certainly you can't rely on a non
physical on-screen kortnee keyboard the
kodesh a look both knees looks like so
let's go ahead and start with the iPhone
we've seen this many times before and
you've got two options for text
centering you've got a portrait and
landscape both of which actually work
very well you can see through what that
looks like we both have fantastic auto
correction devices as well Android and
Apple let me show you real quickly about
what this looks like I'll do a real
quick test well it's right this is a
test of the keyboard
so one quick error but at two ears
actually I'm go ahead and move this over
entice one more time on portrait and
then one problem that I do have with the
iPhone keyboard as I always end up I'm
trying to hit spacebar or try and hit a
it ends up hitting sort of the shift
button of being a capital letter not
what I'm looking for
although I will say keyboard entry on
the iPhone is very good it's certainly
not perfect but it's Auto park features
make it a very nice addition and the
built-in spell checker in me is a nice
help let's go ahead and talk about text
entry on the Samsung Captivate which is
a lot about talking about text entry in
general on Android devices oh there's
sort of a custom keyboard option here
okay and try a new message let me get
started the same landscape or portrait
modes now there are many ways you can
type text you I'm gonna go ahead and
show you each of them and first I will
say the Android has an awesome
autocorrect if you've not used an
Android device you're really not leasing
out on some fantastic sort of keyboard
options so I'll go ahead and do the same
test here and go ahead and start type
so this is a test of the keyboard sort
of one very small error there and this
is a device that I haven't been using
for months and months like I have about
the iPhone certain the iPhone 4 just
came out but abusing the 3GS and before
that you can see how very quickly I pick
this up using this for just a few weeks
I've gotten very very quick at it you
can also certainly type in landscape
which works quite well as well so this
is a test you can see I had to make one
quick error there but with Android they
actually are other ways that you can
input text and some things that I really
like about the Android operating system
so let's take a look at sort of what
that is and sort of how it works you are
going to have the option for using
voice-to-text
which is a fantastic sort of way you go
ahead and talk through that what you
wanted to say and Android actually put
it in for you and it works just very
very very well demonstrated many times
in the past another sort of keep we're
up you're gonna have on the captivate is
also something called swipe we're gonna
let you serve drag your fingers to and
from on different keyboards noting that
I've gotten used to but it's another way
to input text and people's tend to
generally like it so keyboard the
keyboard it seems evenly matched but the
addition of the voice to text and swipe
really make the captivate a very
compelling way to input text and just
work really really well so if you have
to pick one that definitely has to go to
the captivate as far as text enter just
because there are ton of options bigger
screen makes for a more spacious
keyboard so the captivate is going to
take this round alright so next let's
talk about operating system which is
sort of the biggest difference between
the two so the iPhone 4 is running iOS 4
actually for 4.01
the captivate is running Android 2.1
with Samsung's TouchWiz 3.0 on top of it
I which does add a lot of functionality
for the big issue of the debate whether
you're an Apple fan or an Android fan
you know what you're getting with each
Apple you're getting a static interface
with folders and with icons that are the
same size you can navigate throughout
you have to live with an
sort of walled garden Vikings surveyed
the content even from a lot of people
are very comfortable with andrey has a
bit of a more open approach you really
customize the opera Testim any way you
like and a lot of cool tweets and sam
some actually put in what their TouchWiz
interface you got almost a doc across
the bottom and one of the best features
I think Samsung did is actually in the
pull down Minh so right up here you
actually have Wi-Fi Bluetooth silent and
vibration all right in that top menu
which really make for a fantastic really
great way to access your future
certainly there are widgets that could
do that but they're having adding to
pull down I really think is a really
nice addition to the operating system
Samsung also brought sort of a ton of
other sort of Handy widgets to it like
we've seen with HTC in their sense I
nothing revolutionary here but it is
aimed rate done very well by Android 2.1
John the Android 2.2 is a very capable
and really nice operating system
although this one is going to be
personal preference so which one you
prefer certainly a lot of people
obviously flock to iOS and just as many
as you can be flocking to Android so
this one is going to go to a tie yet
again if you guys can see these are two
very very very uh evenly matched phones
alright so for everybody keeping traffic
home here's how the ten wrath smackdown
shook out first round call quality was a
time battery went to the iPhone speed
went to the Samsung Captivate so did
browser screen was at I signal was at I
design went to the iPhone camera went to
the iPhone text entry went the other way
to the captivate in operating system was
a Thai giving us a total of iPhone for
three rounds Samsung Captivate three
rallies Thai four rounds I was truly is
very representative of both of these
handsets they are fantastic in their
respective rights I can very easily use
the iPhone 4 as my d-league phone and be
very satisfied I'm very happy I could
just as easily use the captivate and be
very very very satisfied with the phone
they are fantastic for the consumer for
the professional everyone in between or
they're not you prefer Apple's iOS 4 or
Google's Android operates
with samsung's tweaks to it it's really
going to be a matter of personal
preference whether or not you want a
smaller 3.7 inch screen the larger
4-inch screen whether the resolution is
more important to you or outdoor
visibility with the Super AMOLED screen
how to calculate it really in the truest
sense the word is personal preference
and you can't go wrong with either
hopefully this be something that you
like in this video that's gonna sway you
one way or another whether camera is
important to you or battery or speed or
browser of this video the goal lists or
push you in one direction hopefully you
saw one that was sort of more true the
direction that's going to push you in I
can't tell you hopefully there's
something in here though that helped to
make your decision a big easier really
you again can't go wrong because of
these devices so today guys I am John
render from TechnoBuffalo I'm here to
check out the website for all your tech
news and for exclusive content checking
