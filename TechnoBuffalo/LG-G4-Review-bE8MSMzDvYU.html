from TechnoBuffalo here it's a full
review for you of LG's latest flagship
says it right there this is the g4 let
me give my disclaimer to usually do with
all of my phones I use this for five
full days we are testing International
Edition so bear that in mind as you can
tell no leather back we've got all
plastic here Brandon did our written
review it's got some different opinions
on stuff too a lot of more detail and
things are going to talk about so if you
want to see that I'd also see full
camera sample pictures hit the link down
below it's also gonna be in our
lightning review format so I'm gonna
jump from point to point kind of quickly
does it get to all the questions that I
had about the phone hopefully the things
that you want to know alright let's
start with screen since it's got one
that's why you're gonna be doing most of
your stuff on so the g3 was one of the
first qHD phones hit the mass market it
packed all damn beautiful pixels but
it's punch was a little weak it was it
was probably more for Pacquiao
Mayweather the g4 though has a 5.5 inch
same screen size same resolution q HD
2560 by 1440 but that's about where the
similarities end a colors here look way
more accurate definitely brighter
I got darker darks and whiter whites and
also surprisingly good visibility
outdoors and direct sunlight which I
don't get chance to see very often
overall the screen is just beauti nice
to look at if you thought the g3 screen
looked little washed out the g4 screen
looks gorgeous so performance you might
be worried about the Snapdragon 808 this
has versus say the 810 and the G flex 2
but don't worry about it it is still
super fast augmented with 3 gigs of RAM
anything you want to open opens fast
games play quickly always associate the
processor worried vs. TV shopping you've
got two TV sets in front of you one
might look better on the wall next to
the other one but very rarely do you see
both TV sets side-by-side this is very
fast very capable and also is not going
to get on the hot side just saying time
dragon 810 and some rumors but it's also
gonna be very battery efficient so it
comes up to the 808 so I don't put much
stock in some of the standard tests that
you can run on mobile devices but I
don't you guys like to know what they
are so quadrants core xx 4858
and
- - using 5.7 was forty nine thousand
nine hundred fifty one and of course
testing it with sixty four-bit alright
let's talk about that camera that's a
really big story about the g4 I'm
guessing it's gonna be huge push behind
LG's upcoming advertising campaign is a
big upgrade not just like this big like
this giant big upgrade so a new sensor
onboard in the g4 it's a 16 megapixel
sensor with a really bright f1 point in
aperture lens its rounded out with that
family's out of focus that we saw in the
g3 notice it also a secondary sensor
which is gonna give you better white
balance and color it's also rocking a
brand new or optical image stabilization
that LG claims is two times better than
the competition so what's the moral here
hot damn that cameras good it's the best
camera I've used on a phone period but
beyond that not just good for a phone
it's great for any camera the pictures
just look kick-ass here in normal light
color representation is accurate but
late performance is solid but there is a
little bit of noise on there I feel like
the way the photos look though you can
always just friggin shoot in raw and
tweak them out ever you want LG also has
a new manual mode here which is pretty
sweet to use but you really got to know
how to tweak all the settings so if
you'd like to get into DSLR you're gonna
love manual mode here this your
autofocus still takes a little bit of
time to find its focal point and
sometimes doesn't always find it it's a
small quibble but for the most part it
works great this is a really solid
camera option but it's not great with
your DSLR don't any marketing language
fool you but if you want some of the
best camera forints you can get on a
phone you're gonna love this alright so
what about that design the g4 does have
a slight curve to it
it's not as drastic as like the G flex 2
obviously but it's there and it's subtle
it makes holding the phone up to your
ear feel a little bit more natural and
also if you care you're put on your back
pocket it's got a nice butt curve to it
the big story here though I think is the
materials that LG used so while Samsung
the ones plastic stalwart I went upscale
with glass and aluminum for their s6 and
s6 edge LG stuck their burrial guns here
and went with plastic plastic all the
way around obvious caveat
leather options are available
for the back but the phone just doesn't
have that premium feel to competition
and if LG is offering a plastic option
I'm saying to you friends at LG why not
use the pretty cool self-healing option
you get on the G flex 2 while the
plastic is a compromise it definitely
comes with a very valuable trade off and
you know what it's gonna be a removable
battery and microSD card support up to
just a ridiculous 2 terabytes if you
watched the unveiling of Samsung's
Galaxy s6 you're looking at the iPhone
and you thought I eat a removable
storage I need to have that something
that I have to have with me if you
yelled at me in the comments section and
saying you wanted to carry a secret with
you yelled at me saying I want two
removable batteries and put your money
where your mouth is
because the LG g4 offers that and that's
a big differentiating factor it's hard
to do now in the smartphone world so I
wanna give credit where credit's due on
the software side LG is shipping the g4
with android 5.1 out of the box so if
you're worried about upgrades you're
gonna be set for a little while I'm kind
of mad on what LG's done from the
software standpoint here they did to do
a lot of things to try and reduce
duplicate apps MRAM which I appreciated
but the way it just looks I wasn't a fan
of so in all candor for most this review
I was running Nova Launcher on here it
does offer a pretty useful multi window
support and a host of other Handy
features like I think one of the most
badass features just the knock to unlock
features well it's four codes but double
tapping the unlock is really nice it
also means you pretty much avoid the
buttons on the back whether you like him
or don't like him it takes a while to
get used to they have kind of ambivalent
to them in general a big a mission for
me is also lack of a fingerprint scanner
for both security and payments also no
wireless charging out of the box that's
annoying to me you got to buy a separate
back to make the sync charge without
wires all right so what about battery
our international unit has 3000 milliamp
hours us France a little bit on the
lower side it's a really solid my
average usage is off the charger around
7:00 7:30 connected to Wi-Fi networks at
home or at work so pretty much all the
time about two hours of calling two
emails being pulled down pretty much all
the time a lot more social media than I
should we should be doing even when I'm
home my wife's giving me this look
that's the put your phone down look a
battery was very good
icons get too full
days out of it at one full day though
when I would go to bed around 10:30 to
love and I generally had about 55 60
percent of battery life left so a really
solid there is a conclusion here on the
g4 it's tough to make a phone stand out
and seem unique and a slew of really
good competition but LG has done that by
keeping features their phones have
traditionally always hat and that is of
course movable battery and expandable
storage if that's important to you look
no farther than the g4 and you get a
really solid phone you're gonna get a
good camera you're going to get a nice
screen that cool curve to it you're
gonna get a lot of great features packed
in some emissions here which had a
fingerprint sensor on the back I wish
the speakers were beast on the bottom or
front-facing but it's a very solid phone
when I can actually recommend this gets
a very solid eight point five on the
TechnoBuffalo scale I mean I think do
you agree disagree do you want to just
yell at me more in the comments or do
you want to come to my defense love to
hear from you too I'll give IDEO a
thumbs up to always appreciate it of
course it's a big subscribe button for
the latest TechnoBuffalo news until next
time I'm John render for TechnoBuffalo
