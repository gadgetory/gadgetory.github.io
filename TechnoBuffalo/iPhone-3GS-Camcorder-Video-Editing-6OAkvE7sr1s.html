here and i want to give you a
demonstration of the surprisingly good
camcorder on the iphone 3gs i'm going to
show you not only how to record a video
but also how to edit it and upload it to
youtube let's go ahead and get started
so you hit the camera button and i
should also mention that this is only
going to work on an iphone 3gs this
won't work on a 3g so there's a little
switch in the bottom right-hand corner
push it over to camcorder and here is
the iphone 3gs box we will use to record
so very simply and quite obviously hit
the record button and there we go now
we're recording the 3gs box can say you
can move it around outside give a little
spin just a short quick video there we
go it will hit stop so now what you'll
get is a thumbnail in the bottom
left-hand corner just like you would
with pictures if you hit that it'll
actually pull up the video you just made
so let's turn it in landscape will be
easier for editing and you'll see right
across the top you get a timeline just
like you do in iMovie 08 and iMovie 09
they actually use that timeline to edit
it's quite neat so let me show you how
that works so we'll tap this grain first
you can move the scroll bar and pick
play anywhere you want but on the far
left and far right-hand sides are little
sort of a two vertical bar that if you
hit those you get that little yellow
scrubber and you can actually trim the
video now anywhere you want so let's say
I want to just trim it right there I go
ahead and hit that trim button in the
upper right hand corner and I shouldn't
mention it when you do that you're going
to lose the full unedited video it
doesn't save two versions it overrides
the previous video and only saves your
trimmed version so let's go ahead and
trim this what trim those are that it's
trim in the movie and now our movie is
trimmed now we're left with just this
bit that we just add locks so now let's
say you want to upload this to youtube
but you can do this really on 3g or
Wi-Fi so just like you would if you
wanted to email a picture or
our someday send an mms if you're on
AT&amp;amp;T email video or send to youtube so
we'll hit sent to youtube obviously and
see right there it's compressing the
video which is quite neat actually
compresses it for youtube you go ahead
and sign them to username and password
and that's it your video gets uploaded
to youtube and they'll show up on your
channel you're the ability to put in
your title your tags really is
relatively simple i'll put the video
that we just filmed and edited at the
end of this in case you want to see
another demonstration of the video
quality of the 3gs i did put up a full
video yesterday showing how it looks
outside and actually does look really
nice so if you enjoy it for exclusive
content be sure to follow me on twitter
twitter com / John for lakers i'll see
you guys in next video bye bye ugs box
can say can move it around outside a
little spin just a short quick video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
