to you by Gamefly welcome back to the
episode of ask the buffalos to show you
could ask me John renter any question
you might have from the wide why were
the technology don't know what phone to
get can't make sense of all these crazy
driving cars coming at you whatever it
might be this is the show you can ask
every Tuesday on TechnoBuffalo comment
put up a call for questions you can
leave your question down below in the
comments or if you prefer social media
extended to us a Twitter either me at
John Ford Lakers or send it to
TechnoBuffalo at TechnoBuffalo - be sure
to use hashtag ask the be up this week
we're gonna talk about Google glass when
talk about some iPhone and Android what
happens behind the scenes of some
TechnoBuffalo staff and all kinds of
other tech goodness this is asked to
Buffalo
let's get ask the Buffalo e so our first
question comes from Twitter it comes
from Tom underscore rich who asks at
John four Lakers do you think that
Google glass will impact the worlds in a
mainly positive or negative manner
that's a great question I think it's
gonna impact the world positively or
negatively I think the world is gonna
keep spinning and go on like normal but
I think the question you're asking about
that it's going to sort of change the
way we do things and I kind of think
it's going to even if Google glass ends
up being the next Segway it's really
might create a new generation of
wearable technology a whole new genre of
tech I think it's kind of neat that
we're moving that direction whether you
like it or don't like it is a totally
other discussion but certainly it's an
option you don't have to where there's
crazy screen mounted glasses but I think
it's gonna be very neat especially when
it gets integrated augmented reality
you're walking down a street you could
see Yelp scores for restaurants or
doctor reviews ever might be there a lot
of really practical uses so I'm excited
to see the battery technology get better
be able to see it do much more have its
own connectivity and perhaps up the
specs but I think it's a really cool
thing and I give Google a lot of credit
for developing out in the open it's ok
it helped end your question alright so
our next question comes from Kyle Judd
and this one makes you think he asks
Dear John
Apple put Android on an iPhone do you
think Apple fans would still bash
Android or you think they would love it
simply because Apple made it thanks that
one's a thinker that's like a if a tree
falls in the woods
it really make a sound type questions or
what's the sound of one hand clapping
which coincidentally is just this
philosophy aside man has a tough one so
if that were to happen hypothetically
that would mean that iOS was no longer
viable so Apple fans would probably be
happy to still have Apple hardware but
then they'd be running Android which
most them are sworn to hate as enemies I
don't know maybe like the Lannisters and
the Starks getting tea together and just
hanging out
it's a crazy question um I think that
they would like it I don't know what do
you guys think if you were an Apple fan
and Apple said hey we're gonna put
Android now on our devices no more iOS
would you be excited or GB all but me TF
Apple rocky L brownie who asked at John
four Lakers asides from the build
quality of HTC One which phone has the
best software the Galaxy s4 or the HTC
One well the Galaxy s4 is running the
most recent version of Android running
4.2.2 with HTC One is currently running
for point one point two so from a raw
Android standpoint certainly the galaxy
s4 has it beat if your question is
asking about the skins which guess are
really not called skins anymore the more
custom operating systems but TouchWiz
versus Shenzhen it's personal preference
I think both are equally good for me
though I prefer sentence I think it's
less heavy gets out of its way a little
bit more than TouchWiz I don't need all
the crazy camera stuff the TouchWiz has
something I just like the way it sense
looks I like the widgets like the mail
application everything about it just
works for me but then again that's just
me which one do you guys prefer love to
hear your thoughts on it we get a whole
comparison video to comparing big Alex
gives for the HTC One so you should
check that sucked out as well Antonio
