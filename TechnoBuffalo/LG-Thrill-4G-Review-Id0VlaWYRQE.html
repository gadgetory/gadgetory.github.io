technobuffalo here they full review for
you of the LG thrill for AT&amp;amp;T Wireless
let's go ahead and see if it's as
exciting as the name implies alright so
this is a full review of the LG Thrill
coming soon for AT&amp;amp;T wireless as I do
with all of my phone reviews let's go
ahead and start by talking about the
call quality because doesn't make good
phone calls it's not going to be of much
use to you I'm phone calls on the LG
Thrill we're just about average with
most AT&amp;amp;T phones on my 20 call tests I
had one dropped call but I did have a
pretty strong circle signal strength
wherever I went I was blanketed in hspa+
this is of course a 4g device so it'll
be able to pull down 14.4 megabits per
second on the high end at least as fast
as that can possibly do it was decent
call quality was average people didn't
hear any white noise or popping on their
end I didn't hear it on my end
speakerphone was about we'd expect for a
phone nowadays nothing stuck out as
awful here but nothing jumped out as
being outstanding just about an average
phone for call quality so it works all
right so let me go ahead run through the
specs because there's a lot of stuff
packed into this small package first 4.3
inch screen the resolution of 480 x 800
a little lower resolution than some top
and super phones we're going to talk
about that resolution in just a few
minutes it's got a 1,500 milliamp hour
battery live in it underneath its soft
touch plastic back that hspa+
connectivity which AT&amp;amp;T is calling for g
is in there it also has on the back and
sort of a robot looking face thought
that look like a two eyes is a camera
and of course that is a stereoscopic 3d
camera button addition to shooting 3d it
can shoot 1080p video so that's 1920 x
1080 at 24 frames per second or if
that's not your cup of tea you can also
shoot 720p at 30 frames per second kinda
awesome and the 3d that it shoots will
be shot in 1280 by 720 which is pretty
decent for stereoscopic 3d
512 megabytes of ram a gigabytes
internal android 2.2 they have said that
froyo will be coming at least LG has
said so hopefully we're gonna see froyo
when LG demonstrated this device to me
personally a gingerbread rather was what
they said was coming it's coming will be
coming soon device hasn't launched yet
so maybe by the time it hits ATT it'll
have gingerbread at least at a review
units that we have this thing's pack in
some cold Froyo it's got a dual cortex
instruments omap processor clocked in at
one gigahertz on each core so it's a
pretty powerful phone where you turn
they beat the top and the most carriers
lineups one of the great things about
the LG throw is its price AT&amp;amp;T is going
to sell it for ninety-nine dollars so
for under 100 bucks you're getting a
pretty nice deal with a lot of stuff in
it let's go ahead and talk about all of
that stuff alright first let's talk
about what everybody is curious about
the 3d stereoscopic 3d essentially that
means 3d without glasses I always equate
it to that old baseball card technology
favor saab the baseball cards and move
them around any sort of saw the batter
swing it's very similar here
stereoscopic 3d so unfortunately you're
not gonna see 3d here it's probably
gonna look a little blurry out-of-focus
to you i have tried a few three devices
certainly the evo 3d a nintendo 3ds uh
and i thought they were very gimmicky
and gave me a headache after just a few
minutes that might be my bad eyes but
certainly reports of that have been
running rampant this is probably the
best implementation of stereoscopic 3d
though that I've ever seen that's due to
that lower screen resolution remember
the resolution is 480 x 800 so you've
got pixels are a little bit bigger so
the effect seems to be a little bit
better here on the screen so you got a
ton of 3d ish stuff you can do so got a
3d guide I walk you through some of the
3d stuff but you're not seeing 3d so
that's not overly exciting for you I'll
go ahead and jump back there's a few
unique things here in here so you're
gonna have some 3d games and apps it's
gonna come pre-loaded here with some 3d
games ago and show what they are asked
fault Nova let's golf in Gulliver's
Travels they are games that are in 3d
pretty standard games up 3d camera we'll
go ahead and talk about that in just a
min
3d gallery will show all the 3d pictures
you took with the camera on the back and
YouTube 3 is actually unique thing to LG
if you want to upload videos to YouTube
3d you can do it directly from the phone
as with other three devices gotta upload
it to your computer then from your
computer you can upload it to YouTube 3d
do it directly here from phone and you
can view of course YouTube 3d videos let
me go ahead and check out that camera
boom camera and there's a 3d button
there right there on top of the phone
which will activate that 3d camera as
well so go ahead and let it do its 3d
thing and I'll move something here take
a picture of here is a blackberry torch
you can't see it I can it looks like
it's in 3d but pull my cloth off to the
side that's no good so it looks like
it's 3d can go ahead and snap your
picture you can also shoot video it does
work pretty well um I was able to view
3d content for a bit longer than I could
on other phones i still had that
headache but ganas able to look at a
little bit longer before I felt like I
wanted to bash my head against the wall
3d here is an addition to the package
it's certainly not the reason at least
in my opinion to buy the phone sometimes
it's fun to look at 3d content something
wouldn't want to look at three pictures
all the time probably to have the option
to have 3d on here whether that you
choose to use it is your call alright so
this is running again android 2.2 froyo
it's got LG is 3d you I on it which on
the surface is very you I heavy but
below the surface they left Android
pretty much alone let me show you some
of the stuff that it does first ray pull
daddy go ahead and adjust all that stuff
right there I love that so if you go
ahead and go to one the Home screen tap
let's go to blank home screen so it
arranged everything here in grid so you
can sort of see where the icons would go
widgets shortcuts and folders you
control how to create it right from here
so here's all the widgets some are LG
specific some are just Android widgets
that we've seen shortcuts folders
wallpapers play with me wallpapers go
ahead and go back so there's one of the
neat additions here to go in go to
applications sort of listed a very
similar to actually what we've seen with
HTC Sense you want
minimize this you can just do that and
you can jump into what you want apps or
downloads apps there we go go ahead and
exit out there are a few other niceties
I suppose in here if you jump into the
browser for example go and rotate this
I'm gonna talk about the browser of
course in a minute I've got your
controls on the bottom that are sort of
always there your back button your
forward buttons go ahead and open tabs
or open new tabs and then you got your
Settings button right there so that's
sort of a quick overview of the LG 3d
you I it's there and it works well
alright so now let's talk about speed
it's a dual core phone if you're looking
to buy a dual core phone chances are you
are into speed and you're into
benchmarking and you want to know what
your phone can do well the quadrant test
that Iran of course on the shipping rom
pre modified obviously was a score of
2460 so whether or not you use quadrant
as the benchmark for processor or system
prowess that's up to you but it's what I
use in all of my videos sleep you can
benchmark it against previously reviewed
phones so it's a pretty high score it's
not rocket high other dual-core phone
certainly up scored higher assuming you
want to go in and do some OS tweaking
let's say I'm guess you can get that
score so you can get to get me higher
but if you don't want to go in and do
you're tweaking how's the phone going to
perform for you normally well things are
pretty fast applications open quickly
let's go and check out some of those
applications books hey look google books
open I didn't notice anything like
blistering fast but it was pretty quick
browser for example scrolling even with
flash enabled you don't get any that
checkerboard in which I really really
like you can see flash is working and
not any checker boarding while scrolling
as fast as you can with flash enabled is
definitely a dual core thing alright so
now that we're talking about browser
let's go ahead and talk a bit more about
that pinch to zoom in here obviously
works very well it's pretty fluid as you
expect from a modern phone here text on
the screen it's crisp it's not the best
I've seen it's not the worst uh it's
average pretty much like the rest of
this phone it's unremarkable but it's
not bad so if you want to read websites
like techno
buffalo or whatever you want to check
out you know the screen is going to be
okay for you pictures again as you can
see images here look oh right the phone
is though relatively quick it did
everything I needed without having to
shut down programs the background 512
megabytes of RAM certainly did a nice
job with that this is whole thing here
with dual channel and dual channel ram
it works well sort of the layman's
explanation for it you're going to have
very good memory management here with
the phone alright so now that we sort of
talked about what the phone can do and
all that stuff how does it affect the
battery we are looking at a battery of
just about 1,500 milliamp hours which is
going to live here in the back of this
very thick phone as expected you're not
going to get outstanding battery life
certainly with dual core and even using
3d lightly battery life is not going to
be great I was however able to get
through a full day of use while pulling
in email every 30 minutes from two gmail
accounts about two hours of phone calls
a day it's pretty heavy web browsing um
I was barely able to scoot in from about
an eight to midnight day like just about
ten percent battery left so if you use
it judiciously and you're more careful
and I was about managing applications
you probably will get through a full day
all this business so it comes in a
pretty stocky package here 168 grams is
by no means a supermodel phone but it
does do a lot of stuff so let's do a
quick tour of the device we've got two
doors door doors two doors here on the
left and I hate these doors a lot of
phone manufacturers do them try and
charge the device you gotta get your
finger in there and prop this thing up
oftentimes end up just pulling them off
so you come here I don't have like you
know no I just in fingernails but
they're not great there we go so if you
want to charge it gotta pull that back
next to that doer is an hdmi port HDMI
out rather so go ahead and pull that out
and hdmi cord is actually included in
the box of this phone so that's nice so
that's all you're going to have on the
left we got microphones here on the
bottom little lever suppose to pull off
that soft touch back Torin up again here
on the right kind of hard to see but you
have so you can see right there
volume rocker up and down on the top and
the upper right that's where your power
and lock button 3.5 millimeter headset
jack is there's that little robot face
stereoscopic 3d cameras got a
front-facing camera on the back lower
resolution of course letting you know
it's stereoscopic 3d got some texture
field as it is soft touch feels pretty
nice and there is your speaker grille so
this has been a review of the LG Thrill
if this phone was 199 or 149 or 299
whatever it was I'd say well it's okay
maybe you want to see what else is going
to come out but this phone come in at
$99 out of the door makes it an
extremely good value um you are getting
a dual core phone you're getting 3d
capabilities you're not getting
gingerbread but that will come I are
getting all the latest and greatest
niceties of the mobile world for a
really reasonable price so if you're
watching your budget and you still want
to have the latest out there this is
going to be really solid choice for you
on i can definitely recommend it for the
ninety nine dollar price point so it's
gonna get jon rettinger 'he's two thumbs
up i have weird big thumbs but it's
gonna get two thumbs up so there you go
LG Thrill i'm jon rettinger from
TechnoBuffalo and i'll see you guys in
