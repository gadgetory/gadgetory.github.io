from TechnoBuffalo here a full review
for you of the LG thrill for AT&amp;amp;T
Wireless let's go ahead and see if it's
as exciting as the name implies alright
so this is a full review of the LG
thrill coming soon for AT&amp;amp;T Wireless as
I do with all of my phone reviews let's
go ahead and start by talking about the
call quality because doesn't make good
phone calls it's not gonna be of much
use to you I'm phone calls on the lg
thrill we're just about average with
most AT&amp;amp;T phones on my 20 call tests I
had one dropped call but I did have a
pretty strong circle signal strength
wherever I went I was blanketed in HSPA+
this is of course a 4G device so it'll
be able to pull down fourteen point four
megabits per second on the high end at
least as fast as that can possibly do it
was decent call quality was average
people didn't hear any white noise or
popping on their end I didn't hear it on
my end
speakerphone was about we'd expect for a
phone nowadays nothing stuck out as
awful here but nothing jumped out as
being outstanding with just about an
average phone for call quality so it
works alright so let me go ahead run
through the specs cuz there's a lot of
stuff packed into this small package
first 4.3 inch screen the resolution of
480 by 800 a little lower resolution
than some top-end super phones we're
gonna talk about that resolution in just
a few minutes it's got a fifteen hundred
milli amp hour battery
live in it underneath its soft touch
plastic back that HSPA+ connectivity
which AT&amp;amp;T is calling for G is in there
it also has on the back and sort of a
robot looking face I thought that looked
like a two eyes is a camera and of
course that is a stereoscopic 3d camera
button addition to shooting 3d it can
shoot 1080p video so that's 1920 by 1080
at 24 frames per second or if that's not
your cup of tea you can also shoot 720p
at 30 frames per second kind of 'some
and the 3d that it shoots will be shot
in 1280 by 720 which is pretty decent
for stereoscopic 3d
512 megabytes of RAM a gigabyte internal
Android 2.2 they have said that Froyo
will be coming at least LG has said so
hopefully we're gonna see Froyo
when LG demonstrated this device to me
personally Gingerbread rather was what
they said it was coming it's coming will
be coming soon device hasn't launched
yet so maybe by the time it hits AT&amp;amp;T
it'll have gingerbread and at least in a
review units that we have this thing's
packed in some cold Froyo it's got a
dual cortex Instruments OMAP processor
clocked in at 1 gigahertz on each core
so it's a pretty powerful phone
certainly beat the top end of most
carriers line ups one of the great
things about the LG throw though is its
price AT&amp;amp;T is going to sell it for $99
so for under 100 bucks you're getting a
pretty nice deal with a lot of stuff in
it let's go ahead and talk about all of
that stuff alright first let's talk
about what everybody's curious about the
3d is a stereoscopic 3d essentially that
means 3d without glasses I always equate
it to that old baseball card technology
if you ever saw baseball cards and move
them around and you sort of saw the
batter swing it's very similar here
stereoscopic 3d so unfortunately you're
not gonna see 3d here it's probably
gonna look a little blurry out-of-focus
to you I have tried a few 3d devices
certainly the evo 3d a Nintendo 3ds and
I thought they were very gimmicky and
gave me a headache after just a few
minutes that might be my bad eyes but
certainly reports of that have been
running rampant this is probably the
best implementation of stereoscopic 3d
though that I've ever seen that's due to
that lower screen resolution remember
the resolution is 480 by 800 so you've
got pixels are a little bit bigger so
the effect seems to be a little bit
better here on the screen so you've got
a ton of 3d ish stuff you can do so I
got a 3d guide I'll walk you through
some of the 3d stuff but you're not
seeing 3d so that's not overly exciting
for you I'll go ahead and jump back
there's a few unique things here in here
so you're gonna have some 3d games and
apps it's gonna come pre-loaded here
with some 3d games I'll go and show what
they are asked fault Nova lets golf in
Gulliver's Travels they are games that
are in 3d
pretty standard games up 3d camera we'll
go ahead and talk about that in just a
minute
three galleries I'll show all the 3d
pictures you took with the camera on the
back and YouTube three it's actually a
unique thing to LG if you want to upload
videos to YouTube 3d you can do it
directly from the phone
as with other 3d devices gotta upload it
to your computer then from your computer
you can upload it to YouTube 3d do it
directly here from the phone and you can
view of course YouTube 3d videos let me
go ahead and check out that camera boom
camera and there's a 3d button there
right there on top of the phone which
will activate that 3d camera as well so
go ahead and let it do its the ridi
thing and I'll move something here take
a picture of here is a blackberry torch
you can't see it I can it looks like
it's in 3d but pull my cloth off to the
side that's no good so it looks like
it's 3d can go ahead and snap your
picture you can also shoot video it
doesn't work pretty well um I was able
to view 3d content for a bit longer than
I could on other phones I still had that
headache but again I was able to look at
a little bit longer before I felt like I
wanted to bash my head against the wall
3d here is an addition to the package
it's certainly not the reason at least
in my opinion to buy the phone sometimes
it's fun to look at 3d content something
wouldn't want to look at 3d pictures all
the time probably to have the option to
have 3d on here whether or not you
choose to use it is your call
alright so this is running again Android
2.2 Froyo
it's got LG is 3d UI on it which on the
surface is very UI heavy but below the
surface they left Android pretty much
alone let me show you some of the stuff
that it does first ray pull daddy go
ahead and adjust all that stuff right
there
I love that so if you go ahead and go to
one the home screens tap let's go to
blank home screen so it arranged
everything here in grid so you can sort
of see where the icons would go widgets
shortcuts and folders you control how to
create them right from here so here's
all the widgets some rld specific some
are just Android widgets that we've seen
shortcuts folders wallpapers play with
me wallpapers go ahead and go back so
there's one of the neat additions here
to go in go to applications sort of
listed very similar to actually what we
seen with HTC Sense you want
minimize this you can just do that and
you can jump into what you want apps or
downloads apps there we go go ahead and
exit out there are a few other niceties
I suppose in here if you jump into the
browser for example rotate this I'm
gonna talk about the browser of course
in a minute
I've got your controls on the bottom
that are sort of always there your back
button your forward buttons go ahead and
open tabs or open new tabs and then you
got your Settings button right there so
that's sort of a quick overview of the
LG 3d UI it's there and it works well
all right so now let's talk about speed
it's a dual core phone and if you're
looking to buy a dual core phone chances
are you are into speed and you're into
benchmarking and you want to know what
your phone can do well the quadrant
tested I ran of course on the shipping
rom pre modified obviously was a score
of two thousand four hundred and sixty
so whether or not you use quadrant as
the benchmark for this processor or
system prowess that's up to you but it's
what I use in all of my videos so if you
can benchmark it against previously
reviewed phones so it's a pretty high
score it's not rocket high other
dual-core phone certainly have scored
higher assuming you want to go in and do
some OS tweaking let's say I'm guess you
can get that score so you can get to get
me higher but if you don't want to go in
and do your tweaking how's the phone
gonna perform for you normally well
things are pretty fast applications open
quickly let's go ahead and check out
some of those applications books Hey
look google books open I didn't notice
anything like blistering fast but it was
pretty quick browser for example
scrolling even with flash enabled you
don't get any that checkerboarding which
I really really like and you can see
flash is working and not any
checkerboarding while scrolling as fast
as you can with flash enabled is
definitely a dual core thing alright so
now that we're talking about browser
let's go ahead and talk a bit more about
that pinch to zoom in here obviously it
works very well it's pretty fluid as you
expect from a modern phone here text on
the screen it's crisp it's not the best
I've seen it's not the worst it's
average pretty much like the rest of
this phone it's unremarkable but it's
not bad so if you want to read websites
like techno
Buffalo or whatever you want to check
out you know the screen is gonna be okay
for you pictures again as you can see
images here look alright
the phone is though relatively quick it
did everything I needed without having
to shut down programs in the background
512 megabytes of RAM certainly did a
nice job with that this whole thing here
with dual channel and dual channel Ram
it works well sort of the layman's
explanation for it
you're gonna have very good memory
management here with the phone alright
so now that we sort of talked about what
the phone can do and all that stuff how
does it affect the battery we are
looking at a battery of just about 1500
milliamp hours which is gonna live here
in the back of this very thick phone as
expected you're not going to get
outstanding battery life certainly with
dual core and even using 3d lightly
battery life is not going could be great
I was however able to get through a full
day of use while pulling in email every
30 minutes from two gmail accounts about
two hours of phone calls a day it's
pretty heavy web browsing I was barely
able to scoot in from about an eight to
midnight day like just about 10% battery
left so if you use it judiciously and
you're more careful and I was about
managing applications you probably will
get through a full day all this business
so comes in a pretty stocky package here
168 grams is by no means a super model
phone but it does do a lot of stuff so
let's do a quick tour of the device
we've got two doors door doors two doors
here on the left and I hate these doors
a lot of phone manufacturers do them try
and charge the device you gotta get your
finger in there and prop this thing up
oftentimes end up just pulling them off
so you come here I don't have like you
know and I just didn't think ur nails
but they're not great there we go so if
you want to charge you gotta pull that
back next to that doer is an HDMI port
HDMI out rather so go ahead and pull
that out and HDMI cord is actually
included in the box of this phone so
that's nice so that's all you're gonna
have on the left we've got microphones
here on the bottom little lever suppose
to pull off that soft touch back touring
up again here on the right kind of hard
to see but you have so you can see right
there
volume rocker up and down on the top and
the upper right that's where your power
and lock button 3.5 millimeter headset
jack is there's that little robot face
stereoscopic 3d cameras got a
front-facing camera on the back lower
resolution of course letting you know
it's stereoscopic 3d got some texture
feel to this it is soft touch feels
pretty nice and there is your speaker
grille
so this has been a review of the LG
thrill if this phone was 199 or 149 or
299 whatever it was I'd say well it's
okay maybe you want to see what else is
gonna come out but this phone come in at
99 dollars out of the door makes it an
extremely good value um you are getting
a dual-core phone you're getting 3d
capabilities you're not getting
Gingerbread but that will come you're
getting all the latest and greatest
niceties of the mobile world for a
really reasonable price so if you're
watching your budget and you still want
to have the latest out there this is
going to be really solid choice for you
and I can definitely recommend it for
the $99 price point so it's gonna get
John Retton Jers two thumbs up I have
weird big thumbs but it's gonna get two
thumbs up so there you go LG thrill I'm
John Rhett enger' from TechnoBuffalo and
I'll see you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
