from TechnoBuffalo I've got a barnes &amp;amp;
noble nook color e-reader android-based
tablet I've got an 8 gigabyte microSD
card class 6 and I've got a cup of
espresso to drink while I'm waiting in
the background you can't see but I've
got a computer with an internet
connection that's all I need to get a
little SDK preview port style android 30
honeycomb action going on on the nuke
reader let's do it
alright so the disk image is burnt it
copied for Google Google billion jillion
bytes in 1523 seconds which I is I think
1800 seconds would be half an hour so it
took you know I don't know 20 25 minutes
or something but it's done so let's quit
out of terminal let's go back to finder
and will eject the microSD card all
right so here's the nut color
handy-dandy microSD slot under that
little flap their up the card in boot it
up and we'll see what happens so you get
the loading screen but then instead of
getting the nook splash screen that says
touch the future of reading we should go
yep so now we get the android load
screen and fingers crossed this work
yesterday with the build version one but
with build version 2 will see here yep
here we go
so it feels like it's taking ever so
slightly longer to boot up than it did
with the first build but hard to tell
because that was coming off the heels
yesterday that was coming for the heels
of me spending a long time trying to get
it to load with my SD card that was too
small so we'll unlock and I think I just
heard sound there was no sound in the
previous version seller ometer works a
little janky you know because the screen
has to resize and stuff but um you know
this is not an official build by any
means so we'll go home we're at home I
can long press and get the menu now to
set up my my home screens so can move
around here their apps shortcuts i can
add so i can grab let's grab the
messaging shortcut and we'll put this on
the main home screen and now if i go
back to the main home screen oops those
are wallpapers are there any live
wallpapers installed here at night back
to wallpapers and now i've got my little
messaging icon I can move it around and
if I go to apps go to music I don't
think there's any music loaded on here
nope no music so I think I can access
the the card though now in the previous
version that connects us to the SD card
for storage but I should be able to
access the partition now for storage the
home button works which is cool Wi-Fi
not connected but will connect ok and so
now I'm connected to Wi-Fi so let's go
to the browser I can swipe through my
home screens and it's actually pretty
responsive who have reported this didn't
I whoever I dev D Purdy
for dev Raphael did a nice job so let's
will let up Google here so the Wi-Fi is
working and it's the iGoogle homepage
interesting so if i tap get the keyboard
or the page is still letting up here
we'll look for a techno Buffalo and so
instant wasn't on Oh instant is on here
though so I should be able to go to a
little bit of funkiness you know in
terms of the cursor and some of the
touch screen responsiveness things like
that but it is you know more or less
usable console yep so there's instant
working so i can go to console wars and
what i want to do is I want to pull up a
video and see if it works because yeah
yesterday when i was playing around with
the the build before this I was getting
it was pretty funny I was getting a
missing plugin flash the missing plugin
icon for flash which is ironic on an
Android device and then YouTube videos
wouldn't play but I believe some YouTube
videos now play so okay i'm getting the
mobile version right okay so let's go to
holding up the molars detector buff
let's go to youtube and see what happens
so we'll go to the mobile YouTube site
because my understanding is that the
mobile YouTube site some videos will
work some won't so
looks like it is loading video yep I got
sound oh I had sound but no video try
van yeah nope not going to play let's go
back tears out of the frame there let's
try this VW commercial which i posted
about today this is an awesome
commercial nope not going to play all
right if I take it out of HQ let make a
difference will do and let me yeah so
that ok so not HQ anyway i'm not going
to show this whole ad but you know baby
steps this is not you know you're not
gonna at this point pick up a nuk
install this port and be running around
town like oh it's like a zoom but i paid
less and i have it now you know it's not
it's not like that but you know there is
some functionality i wasn't able to get
onto actually if we go back to let's go
back to the web for a second so we've
got this little uh there's a little bit
of the touchscreen calibrations a little
funny if we go back here to the browser
get that nice little nice little menu of
your open apps so we'll go back to the
browser and let's go back to
go to technobuffalo and we don't want
the mobile version we want the full
version because i want to show you
multi-touch pinch and zoom that kind of
stuff so go back and here let's uh let's
kick the accelerometer in oh it's still
loading and want the mobile version I
want the regular version mobile version
off no but it's still kicking me to that
hello because pinching and zooming isn't
going to work here I was able yesterday
we will go to picasa and see if we can
do some load up a photo here sorry for
the scant you're probably getting bad
scan lines on the M there we go so
pensions and that's pretty responsive
but getting bad scan lines in the video
apologize for that but there you go so a
first look kind of first hands-on here
playing around with a port of the
android 30 honeycomb sdk that was ported
to nut color by an enterprising
developer i'll credit to you Raphael
hope I'm not pronouncing your name too
too poorly but there you go i'm going to
play around with this see if i can get
the hack working to get access to the
android market see what are the goodies
i can find load some music onto the SD
card see if i knew some with that but it
does work and it is a way if you've got
a nut color it's a way to get some free
you know sort of hands-on time with
whoops with a you know functional sort
of semi complete build of three dot zero
before it's available in consumers hands
so there you go much much more on
Android 30 all the tablets coming out
all that stuff over on technobuffalo
calm and then just about a week starting
on Sunday februari 13th i'll be in
barcelona spain covering Mobile World
Congress where we will see lots and lots
and lots of honeycomb in action so stay
tuned for that till next time my name is
Noah thanks for watching we'll see
you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
