from technobuffalo here with the
hands-on unboxings and first look at two
phones that I am really excited about
we've got the Moto Z and the Moto G
Force we've had a ton of phones come out
over the past 6 12 month and all that
have been relatively similar we've got
modularity with youth is why i'm so
excited i think it's modularity done
right no removing backs or battery to
swap in modules this is all hot
swappable stuff so really cool to check
these things out there are some
differences with the Z and as he forced
differences are in battery size in
megapixel edge and in a shatterproof
screen all the benefits going to the Z
Force alright so aside from being
modules are few differences here with
these phones no 3.5 millimeter headset
jack which might be a theme of the rest
of the year realized only on us BCS
let's start with the droid moto Z this
thing is just I mean incredibly thin one
of the thinnest smartphones I have held
you can see those pins there that is
where the mods are going to clip onto so
a few other things we've got in the box
we've got moto style shell as you can
customize look your phone that's really
what this device is all about is
customizing it so pop that off this
snaps on the back if you want to use the
modules you have to take your style show
off and what this is going to do is get
rid of that camera hump on the back end
it is a significant a hump and now I've
got a wood phone putting this guy up
there is the Z Force a little bit
thicker but by no means a fat phone
expected to be a little bit thicker it's
got a bigger battery about 900 million
power is bigger actually exactly alright
so let's talk first about these moto
style mods they are really thick and
feel pretty sturdy there's a single
magnetic connection point and on the
back of these phones where the mods are
going to hook up there is a single
magnetic connection points and put these
things on it's really just simple
magnets just snaps right on and that's
it i doesn't feel like it's gonna pop
off though if you dropped it maybe it
would this makes a phone feel about as
thick as the force but it does get rid
of that pretty significant camera hum so
if you're not a fan of dem humps pull
these guys on and you'll be
to go let's start with the JBL sound
boost speaker and supposing we connect
all of these mods for the first time to
get a little tutorial that will pop up
on your phone but we shall see so
definitely a different way to do
modularity than what LG has done they
really look like the at least in theory
the way this works since you don't have
to remove a battery getting to have to
turn the phone off it's big big and
thick got an integrated kickstand here
too to listen to your tunes let's go
ahead pop this thing on and see how it
works I mean that's pretty simple it
just pops on an ID get notification on
here alright so we're rocking to each of
videos it's pretty loud volume should be
controlled by our entrance for a really
affordable price the one pulls to the
without your disappointment I don't know
that's gonna come through from the
microphone button it all sounds really
loud the ship we turn that off extremely
loud if you're at the beach or just
rocking out some friends make a really
good option to have the insta share
projector this is kind of cool this one
motorola made themselves let's see what
this guy looks like and it's a the name
should be pretty obvious what it does
it's a projector built in this is really
thin to has a built-in fully adjustable
kickstand whoo he's projecting and let's
look at the last module they teamed up
with a few third parties for battery
packs this one is the to me mod and it
adds 2200 milliamp hours to your phone
so whether you pick up the zia dizzy for
some you can conceivably have upwards of
50 500 million hours of battery at your
disposal which is pretty cool and it
shows up here you're ready to go got it
pull us down and it's charging the
battery now to ninety-two percent and it
is charging from the battery pack so I
was a little bit on the fence about
modular phone specially with the LG g5 I
thought it represented a really cool
future but it was a future and certainly
not the present i looks like i might be
changing my tune though with a motorola
and lenovo have done here with the Z and
the Z Force it might not be the most
attracting to look at those pins if I
will take those pins any day of the week
so not to swap out a battery to put in
any extra modules really
cool way to do them surprised how easy
and hot swappable everything was but it
was just first impressions we're going
to view these phones let you know what
we think anything you guys want us to
test in particular the modules are the
phones even the comments down below and
please give the video a thumbs up we
always appreciate it until next time jon
