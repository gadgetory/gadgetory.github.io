to you by shutterstock.com so up this
week on rumor roundup apple TV is making
a comeback we got a Retina Display ready
Photoshop cs6 come and hopefully soon
Foxconn lands in order to build
Microsoft and Amazon smartphones and his
tmobile finally I'm lying to get the
freaking iphone this is rumor roundup
jon rettinger let's go and get started
let's start with the Apple TV this guy
has been rumored for quite a while this
is not the little apple TV box we've had
a free few years is the giant freakin
set that Apple has been rumored to had
in the labs for many many moons it looks
like we might actually be having it
relatively soon if the main media
companies can get together to agree on
some sort of content syndication but it
looks like Tim Cook and company won't
have to worry about time warner their
CEO hopes for an apple TV time war CEO
Jeff Bewkes told an audience on
Wednesday that he would really like to
see an Apple TV come to market saying
and I quote I hope they do I think apple
is a great device company Luke's
particularly believed at Apple TV could
help improve the TV experience with
better interface and navigation skills
least according to him would you pay a
couple thousand bucks for Apple TV would
you really want to upgrade a TV
certainly it's not like a phone or a
tough League upgrade every few years buy
a TV usually stays on your wallet stays
on your stand for 5 6 plus years
certainly Apple would be looking at a
very slow adoption rate for TVs if any
cup you can pull it off it's probably a
 Cupertino so are you a photo
editor and you've got one of the brand
new Retina Display 13 or 15 inch macbook
pros but you're stuck in a non-retina
world well evidently Photoshop cs6 with
the retina is going to be coming on
December 11 so dopey hasn't come out and
said it's coming yet they did publish a
teaser video for its create now live
event to take place on that day and
shows the what's next for photoshop in
that video as cs6 users working in
photoshop while on a Retina Display
MacBook Pro just noted by 9to5 mac which
clearly suggests the company is playing
to support that in the near future so
hopefully high resolution coming to
adobe photoshop sex we've been hearing
rumors of a microsoft built smartphone
certainly sir
gain some steam after Microsoft built
their own tablets of course became the
surface and Amazon after their kindle
fire lines been flying off the shelves
looks like those two have actually
contracted fox com the makers of all the
apple products to build their own
smartphones so according to the rumor
mill Foxconn subsidiary Foxconn
international holdings where f IH has
apparently inked deals with Microsoft
and Amazon to build smart phones for
both firms the Vice are expected to ship
in early in the middle of next year
according to digitimes which admittedly
has a super shaky track record reporting
on tech news tech pundits have long
expected Amazon will eventually build a
self branded smartphone and Steve
Ballmer from microsoft recently hinted
on his own that a company might plan to
do the same so would you want to see
smartphones built by these manufacturers
you want to see a Microsoft flagship
Windows Phone device would be kind of
cool to see although wonder what
happened to pour nokia like I'll paid
them a cool Billy to get behind Windows
Phone I'm sure that'd be a smack in the
face then a smacker on the other side
and smack and they turn around again
amazon certainly makes sense it's a way
for them to sell you content i say in
the Amazon ecosystem we actually did
some mock-ups a while back of a Kindle
Fire smartphone I think Amazon could
actually make a phone that would work
really well certainly built on Android
and Amazon's app store I'll probably be
a perfect fit for smartphone world to
Microsoft they got a lot of money they
can put it all behind hardware and get a
tremendous job with the surface hardware
good see that same awesome build quality
with a phone if you live in the United
States and you are on Sprint AT&amp;amp;T or
Verizon you've had the opp to pick up an
iphone if you're on t-mobile
unfortunately you have not had the
option to walk into a store and pick one
up they've been trying to lure fans over
with a bring your own iphone unlocked
campaign but people aren't really doing
that in droves and they are losing
subscribers quarter-over-quarter but it
looks like the long Iowa's drought for
tmobile might be coming to an end
t-mobile had repeatedly said that it
would like to offer the iphone and it
may amount smay an ounce of intentions
to do so as early as next week merrill
lynch analyst scott Craig recently sent
the note to investors that said
speculation is heightening at the
company's parent firm Deutsche Telekom
will reveal its iPhone intentions during
analyst meetings that kick off on
december six so maybe your patience will
pay off your t-mobile customer you might
actually be getting the iphone which
version the iphone we've yet to be
determined of course expected to be
iphone 5 e mobile has been shutting
around their HSPA networks to work on
the existing bands at the iphone 5 in
previous versions iphone support so
should be getting some pretty fast it
just PA plus speeds if it does come to
t-mobile let me take a break from all
