to you by domain.com what's up everyone
john render from TechnoBuffalo here and
and I'm guessing you can tell what we
are unboxing today it is the latest
SmartWatch from Samsung it is the round
gear s2 and I imagine it'll look
something like that on my wrist this is
one smart watched I've been really
looking forward to ever since Samsung
announced it I used the original gear s
and I really liked it but it was limited
to only Samsung devices this guy is not
it can now be used with any Android
phones let's go ahead and open it up and
take a first look I have not seen this
yet in person so I'm looking forward to
it and just because we do things
unnecessarily here let's just you bring
in the new senior stabby me liquid
diamond and let's just cut that tiny
piece of plastic and we should be good
to go there's another one on the side we
will cut that one as well
OOP and let's see what we've got inside
push that office I'm totally gonna start
bleeding and they're sitting right on
top is the now more conventional
SmartWatch looking dearest to the
original gear s was larger and much more
in charge pull that out
rubber bands only available right now
it'll be a classic fan that should be
available as soon it's a grey rubber I
feels very similar to other SmartWatch
rubber bands in case you are rendering
wandering inside of that we have things
we've got a charging dock this looks
very similar to what we have with the
Moto 360 it'll just sit right there and
charge wirelessly assuming you have one
wire at least plugged in but no more a
little plastic thing you got attached to
the back to charge it that's flimsy I'm
going to break digging into the rest of
the box we've got a micro USB charging
cable
we've got smaller watch band I think it
comes with a large one installed but got
a smaller option here it'll ask what you
know it's smaller we've got some quick
reference stuff and what is this
this I'm guessing is it won't work just
a wall work with the USB port and that
is it so let's take a look at the watch
everybody wants to start a website my
grandmother has two of her own and
trying to figure out where you go to
start the website can be tough
domain.com is a place to go in that next
just brilliant idea just lightning bolts
into your head it's one-stop shopping
for everything you need for your domain
from web hosting and email and
everything in between also there are the
200 plus domain name extensions that are
happening now like dot ninja for example
dot NYC dot website and all kinds of
other stuff so if you had the idea for
the next crazy like dot ninja website go
check out the main comm and save 20% on
domain names and web hosting we just use
the coupon code TechnoBuffalo all one
word at domain.com check out when you
think domain names think domain.com it's
in the name alright so here is the gear
s2 and it looks really nice let me run
through the specs on it because this
actually packs a lot of horsepower
especially for a watch you are looking
at a full 360-degree display it's AMOLED
at 360 by 360 resolution and a 302 PPI
is so definitely one of the higher
resolution smartwatches out there it's
being powered by a dual-core one
gigahertz processor weighs just 47 grams
so relative light 512 megabytes of RAM
and four gigs of internal storage on
this guy it's got a 250 million power
battery that Samsung says is gonna last
in two to three days but we'll test that
it is running Tizen so no Android wear
here which means you're gonna have to
deal with a secondary app store which as
of this filming is not yet very robust
but hopefully we'll see more apps filter
its way through it it's compatible with
any Android smartphone running 4.4
higher they can watch well make sure
it's not gonna get damaged if you happen
to wash your hands while wearing it
IP 68 it's a certified dust and water
resistant and the retail price on this
guy is just shy of $300 and by just shy
I mean 1 cent
it's $299.99 so the big deal this guy is
navigation so it's really kind of cool
this dial is actually how you control
things you can go ahead and turn it go
access all of your apps and you can keep
going and see
all of your step counts whether heart
rate control your music and all kinds of
other things as you go through each time
you turn it little dot in the upper
right hand corner let you know what
screen you are at but it is a touch
screen as well so after that first
little click can go ahead and see what
your apps your going to be you control
them as well by doing a little turn they
get a white dot that's going to move you
can see next page on one or the previous
page on the other you also have two
physical buttons here as well to help
you with navigation so either back or
selecting you can jump right into
settings just a really nice looking
display and are really easy intuitively
so it appears to be you I but I will
test it I'll evaluate it and I will be
the judge I think you guys want to see
particular as we review this guy let me
know until next time from John render
from TechnoBuffalo talk to you guys next
