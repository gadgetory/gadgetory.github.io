TechnoBuffalo and today we're going to
give you guys a quick look at touch Pal
for iOS 8 it's still in its alpha build
so not everything is working like it
should be but we just wanted to show you
how it looks and operates on iphone 5s
running iOS 8 beta 5 as of now touch
panel is relying on an invite-only
system for its alpha beta builds but
hopefully in the coming weeks we'll be
able to show you guys a first official
public build for touch pal when iOS 8 is
publicly release first things first when
you install the app there is really
nothing there it just has an About
section inside the apps so let's skip
that and head on over to the Settings
app you'll have to go to general scroll
down a bit and hit keyboard and
keyboards and add a new keyboard inside
here there's going to be a new section
for third-party keyboards and that's
where you can finally add touch pal so
once you enable touch pal go to
whichever app you want to use with a new
keyboard for example in the Notes app
just hold down the little globe icon and
enable touch pal and it'll take a few
seconds to refresh your keyboard then
there you have it with touch pal you
have the ability to swipe to type and
swipe to erase and touch POW also offers
next word prediction like the stock iOS
a keyboard which is kind of cool but
doesn't work as well as Apple's quick
type touch palette is very similar to
what you'll find in majority of the
keyboards available for Android and if
you have been using iOS 8 for the past
few months then this keyboard won't be
all that different other than addition
of swipe gesture typing there's
obviously a few things that still needs
to be fixed like keyboard sounds and
weird bugs that will make the keyboard
disappear and swiping the type is
probably the major one here you won't be
able to see what you type on your
keyboard until after you either tap on
the predictive words or continue swiping
it's not like other swipe gestured
keyboards found on Android wear it
immediately shows you the word you just
type but I'm sure this issue will be
fixed in the next alpha or beta build
one of the best parts of iOS 8 is that
Apple's opening of software the
third-party keyboards and this is just a
small taste of what will be available in
the coming months we'll be able to see
keyboards from other third-party
developers too such as swipe SwiftKey
and flus key and we can't wait to try
them out and show you guys and that's
pretty much it
if you guys have any questions just let
us know in the comments down below and
as always a m√§rklin sang it from
TechnoBuffalo
i'll see you guys in the next video
