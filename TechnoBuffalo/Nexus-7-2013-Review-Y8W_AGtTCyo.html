technobuffalo here at the full review
for you of this guy the brand new 2013
Nexus 7 it brings a ton of Android
hotness in its little 7 inch form factor
let's go ahead break it down see if it's
worth your tablet behind buck
as I'd like to do with all my reviews
let me give you a disclaimer I use this
as my daily tablet for six days and in
conjunction with an ipad mini for two
more so make this video very simple my
break it out into two parts what I liked
and what I didn't like first thing that
I loved about this tablet is that
gorgeous gorgeous screen it's a 7.2 inch
1920 x 1200 screen little extra there
for those on-screen buttons everything
looks absolutely beautiful on it it's
got bright rich colors video looked
absolutely incredible as a pleasure to
watch video whether it was YouTube or HD
content that i downloaded from the
google play store it was incredible
pictures and text looked absolutely
awesome as well there was no sort of
pixilation as you zoomed all the way and
as you'd expect it just looked really
good too what that was a really white
the black clothes were really black
everything about this screen was
absolutely awesome in fact I'd say it's
probably one of the best screens I've
ever used next thing I liked is the
design it's not the thinnest tab on the
world two point four three inches it's
not the lightest at 10.2 three ounces
but it feels razor thin and the weight
is really evenly distributed the tablets
got sort of a beveled edge to the side
so it feels really thing when you hold
it if ever held one of the HTC 8x phones
the 8xt you'll know what I'm talking
about it feels just really incredibly
thin I really appreciated the thin
bezels on the side in portrait mode as
well even as you hold it there's just
enough room for your thumbs on the
outside but other than that everything
else was pretty solid from design
standpoint I like that as a camera it's
a 5 megapixel sensor on the back and a
1.2 on the front not for taking pictures
at events or much but I likes I can
video chat on a nap want to take a
picture for Instagram or Facebook I've
got the option through that's the
inclusion of cameras regardless of
quality I was really nice next is the
processor the s4 pro is really fast I
went to the two gigs of ram and made
Android run buttery smooth I never felt
I had to worry about memory management
or maybe out if I was playing up you
know memory intensive game or processor
intensive game was going to slow down no
issues at all with that it ran Android
really really really quickly as I'd
expect it's a reference device for
Android 4.3 and it just absolutely hall
so if you play heavy games you want to
watch HD video have no worries or qualms
about picking up the Nexus 7
someday I don't really talk about that
much of a tablet I talk a lot about it
with phones and that is the audio the
built-in speakers on this sound really
really really good like almost sounds
like I had some big speaker plug into it
a very impressive audio next in that
sort of one or easy pickup Nexus device
it's pure naked unadulterated Android I
loved I loved making Android my own I
love downloading the widgets that I like
downloading you know HD widgets or
anything else that makes a tablet my own
really I just anything that's naked
Android I love gets me the ability to
customize and it's one of the best
benefits of Android and of course big a
Nexus device it's got that in spades
lastly wireless charging something that
I don't think that much about but I
really found myself using I have a ton
of Qi standard chargers I just do the
tablet right on since I found the right
area to charge just started charging was
really a very handy thing to have so
wireless charging definitely a thumbs up
but I hope every device moving forward I
can take advantage of that standard so
it's clearly a lot to like about the
tablet but there's also quite a few not
to like about it the big one for me is
Wi-Fi I had similar issues with the
original Nexus 7 the radio had a really
hard time picking up signals I tested at
four different locations at my home at
the office at my wife's parents home and
then at my own parents home and each
time I had a really tough time grabbing
on to Wi-Fi I know real issues when i
was browsing the web or downloading
emails but i noticed it especially when
i was trying to watch a video i made it
a real chore doubt streaming video on
here and if i took it next to a
comparable ipad mini I close all the
applications i tried to load a beta
exactly the same time in the same
youtube app it was almost twice as fast
on the ipad mini I ran speedtest and
showed the speed tests were fine for
some reason the Wi-Fi just would cut out
and the signal strength was not pulling
anything that expect so I was really
disappointed out with the Wi-Fi now
obviously the caveat that might have
just been my one review device we did
not have time to get to device into test
but when we get other devices in if this
is a problem with justice one device
i'll be sure to update it so in the
likes comment i mentioned a lot of
things about the design but it's far
from perfect i loved how they did these
bezels on the side but i did not like
these big fat chunky bezels on the top
and bottom they are absolutely
humongous on really seemed totally
unnecessary it makes a tablet just in
really really long the next thing from
design standpoint I didn't like is this
here power button it feels almost
totally flush to the body and heart
differentiation the power button and the
volume up and down it didn't feel
natural trying to find it and push it so
I really would wish there was more
pronounced hard but or different
locations so I knew always that was
power next is the big issue for me is
battery it's got a three thousand nine
hundred fifty million power battery
which you figure should be great someone
take a little bit about my tablet usage
it's connected to Wi-Fi obviously all
the time is to make them find a Wi-Fi
signal and it's my something to do with
the battery issue because it kept trying
to search for Wi-Fi it's pulling in to
accountants checking emails every five
minutes you just like I do some pretty
heavy video viewing and not at watch a
lot of YouTube video I'd say probably
about an hour after two hours of video
viewing the about 20 to 30 minutes of
light web browsing other than that I
just pretty much leave it on its own i
do keep the brightness up quite it but i
like a bright tablet it's usually around
80 h % at the end of the day with the
nexus 7 i had about fifty percent
battery life we're under percent charge
it's an ipad mini in the same usage i
had about 75% of battery life so twenty
five percent difference was really
discouraging i obviously get through a
full debut expect that with the tablet
trying to get through two or three days
might definitely be a struggle now with
the nexus 7 so if you want to pick up
this device definitely be mindful of the
power i turn the brightness down i was
able to get much longer battery life you
might have to sort of change how you use
the tablet i'm hopeful though that ass
off for update you know might fix the
Wi-Fi issue and i subsequently fixed the
battery issue so what is this nexus 7
tablet get i really wanted to like it i
love naked android i'm really big
connected devices but at the end the
Wi-Fi and battery were huge huge issues
for me so got a final score of an eight
if the Wi-Fi issue gets fixed and the
battery becomes better this easily could
have been a nine nine and a half tablet
is absolutely incredible i love
everything about it but it became really
hard to use without Wi-Fi I got a
consistent why I find Wi-Fi could rely
on and if I'm traveling I don't have to
be using my tablet all the time I eat
doesn't it I know is always going to
work and I wouldn't feel comfortable
taking this with me now again I'm
hopeful it was just as this unit and if
something happens I can get another hand
my hand
another one relatively student I can
test it I'll be sure to update the
review and let you guys know but least
for right now I got to give this an 8
which is still a very very solid score
what do you guys think do you agree i
disagree i'd love to hear your thoughts
if you have a nexus owed you had similar
Wi-Fi issues leave them in the comments
