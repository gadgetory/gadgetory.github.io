from TechnoBuffalo and today we'll be
giving you guys our full review on the
Moto X second-generation we've been
using the phone for about two weeks now
and I think it's time for us to share
our final thoughts just over a year ago
motorola introduced original moto x a
different kind of smartphone than
anything before it you could customize
it to your heart's desire through
motorola's moto maker and it was packed
with innovative and user-friendly
features that a lot of people really
enjoyed even though it didn't pack the
beefy aspects it provided a really nice
experience that still holds up to this
day the new Moto X has the same name as
last year's phone and carries over a lot
what made the previous Moto X great when
it comes to the hardware the new Moto X
features a 5.2 inch 1080p AMOLED screen
that looks absolutely gorgeous above and
below that are dual front-facing
speakers it sounds incredible it's
packing a 2.5 gigahertz quad-core
Snapdragon 801 processor 2 gigabytes of
RAM and comes in either 16 gigabytes or
32 gigabyte of internal storage it
doesn't offer expandable storage which
isn't a big deal to me but it may be to
some it's running android 4.4 at launch
it will be upgraded to android down when
it's available and it also has a
slightly better 13 megapixel shooter on
the back that can film 4k videos it also
packs a slightly bigger 2,300 milliamp
battery and comes in either black or
white with numerous customizable back
panels and accents now our review unit
came in black with a black leather
backing I'll be honest I hated it
leather at first but after about a week
or so it definitely grew on me so I'm
going to break this review down into two
sections what I like about the phone and
what I don't like so much about the
phone so let's start off with what I
like about the phone the new 5.2 inch
screen is gorgeous it's sharper brighter
and just nicer to look at when compared
to the last year's model it's got great
viewing angles and can be seen in bright
sunlight without any issues the build
quality is great to the metal frame and
buttons that surround the new Moto X
feels great and the new leather material
makes a new Moto X a much more premium
phone than ever and I'm glad that
Motorola tried to keep the phone's
footprint as little as possible like
last year's model for context it's just
a tad bigger than the nexus 5 which we
consider to be the perfect form factor
Motorola also included a splash guard
coating to protect your phone from water
but it's not waterproof by any means
the dual front-facing speakers are loud
and sounds great though it's not as
filling as something like the HTC one's
dual front-facing stereo speakers now
the four new IR sensors on the phone
which activates moto display and
supports gestures like moto action is
also a really cool feature that I'm sure
a lot of people enjoy just wave your
hand over your phone and it'll show you
the time and or any notifications you
have waiting for you unfortunately moto
display only shows three notifications
at a time which isn't all that great but
definitely much better than just having
one notification displayed just like
last year's Moto X for example now with
moto action you can silent an incoming
call or alarm by just waving your hand
over your phone it works but not as
accurate as we thought it would be moto
asus is still present here it'll
basically change your phone's behavior
based on the time of day whether you're
in a meeting or going to bed and there's
also the new motive voice which I really
like a lot this is a really new to
Motorola fans or Android in general but
this year Motorola made it much more
customizable so you could say something
like hey dude and it'll activate your
voice control right away and you can set
alarms reminders send messages or even
status updates to facebook now all of
these moda features you can tweak to
your liking and Motorola made everything
simpler by just putting all these
features into one app another thing I
like just like last year was that it
comes with an almost stock Android
experience of course but a few of
motorola's app built in now everything
about the phone is fast it's much
smoother and much more responsive than
ever now let's talk about what i don't
like about the phone first let's talk
about battery life battery life is
probably the most important one to me
especially coming from using a one plus
one where the battery lasts for an
entire day or two the Moto X
second-generation lasts about a full
workday and I know that may be adequate
for some people but a wish motorola
would have spent more time improving the
Moto X's battery life which is inferior
to devices like the HTC One Galaxy s5
and the LG g3 the second one on my list
would have to be the camera I wouldn't
say that the camera is bad by any means
but it's not a whole lot better than
last year's model it's really fast
almost as fast as my iphone 5s which is
great but images are still grainy and
blurry and medium to low light in broad
daylight on the other hand shots were
crisp saturated and punchy but it's
still lacking overall focusing is also a
bit unreliable which can be pretty
annoying and the new ring flash around
the Moto X's camera isn't all that great
either it looks cool but not any better
or any different than any other
smartphone flashes we've already seen so
to wrap things up for you guys and given
the new Moto X a technobuffalo score of
9 out of 10 there's really not much to
complain about this phone its fastest
specs are top notch and the overall
build quality and form factor is perfect
the camera is good but we wish it was
much better and battery life should be
more than enough for the average Joe
anyways that's it for this video guys if
