today is the twenty-eighth of june we
are almost in July and we have a lot of
fun stuff happen today in the world of
technology that I want to share with you
mr. green glowing camera that i am
pointing at so let's go ahead and get
started got a lot of stuff up on
technobuffalo first Sean brought us
movie pass that brings you unlimited
movie theater visits think of it like
Netflix you pay one fee you could watch
as many movies as you can cram into a 24
hour day same thing here with movie past
available for a month only available in
the San Francisco Bay Area but kind of
neat would you guys use it the pricing
teams have been interesting give it a
read I'm kind of curious something that
you would use verizon LTE pantses 4g
competitors in the speed test just pulls
them down in gym class verizon's LTE is
awesome up talked about its awesomeness
it is very very very fast lightning fast
I was actually out just working at a
coffee shop so I'm yup you like that and
i was using enough 4G LTE Wi-Fi and it
was fast and it was awesome I was happy
like this BioShock Infinite a word been
invested Joe for EE as 2011 that one's
pretty self-explanatory ah the life of a
Facebook photo is the kind of
interesting that when you upload a photo
to Facebook attack what's a click on I
sort of shows all the cool stuff that
happens to it we upload a photo who
looks at it where it gets plucked out on
a mobile devices with an ipad with
another kind of tablet sort of need so
go ahead and give that guy a little bit
of a gander he got a few minutes you're
sitting in class get phone out go ahead
and take a look uh Android head honcho
Andy Rubin said there are 500,000
android activations each day dems a lot
of phones so we can talk about that
Apple caves issues refund for Final Cut
Pro 10 I have Final Cut Pro 10 I like it
people are complaining it's more of like
iMovie pro but at least for me that's a
good after
I wanted more features in an interface I
know how to use I'm certainly not making
movies if I was making movies probably
wouldn't want this but at least for
someone like me who just makes videos to
chat say hi I've been a big fan of Final
Cut Pro 10 0 google+ Google's try and
social networking yet again talked about
this quite a bit go ahead a couple
videos in there give it a watch would
you guys use Google+ kind of interesting
myspace might sell for as little as 30
million this week um that's just sad
poor Tom now has no friends left Tom had
so many friends I even had a shirt that
said tom is my friend but he's not
anymore mark is my friend um no it did a
live show today symbian is not dead it's
pretty much dead a little sec left you
with some malware malware malware mall
where I'm going malware Microsoft ads
connecting Windows Phone together kind
of exciting book to tmobile took the
wraps off a phone we all knew was coming
the mytouch 4g slide this thing is
actually a prospective beef dual-core
processor it's got one of the most
advanced camera sensors in there so if
you're a shutterbug loading phone guy
you're going to want to look at this and
I'm pointing at it but you can't see it
but that's what I'm pointing it tribe is
to send gameplay trailer free to play so
that happened um I'll just use a groupon
with rusev brights the latest album you
guys can see some of the cool stories
here that we've had one of the things
that we've been running for the past
week which I kind of like and I don't
have actually been writing so probably
why I like it top five phones for each
of the major carriers in the US
yesterday we did verizon last degree at
AT&amp;amp;T so that leaves us with t-mobile and
Sprint coming up so if you are looking
for a phone or interested in phones and
you are in the US you want to give these
a read and see if you agree or disagree
with my list I know taking some flack
for including the HTC trophy here I had
the blackberry torch as my number five
phone on AT&amp;amp;T and I got to dump for that
too but that's cool you're like a
challenging you're allowed to call me a
fanboy you're allowed
say I don't know what I'm talking about
that's the beauty the Internet I would
love to hear what your list is if you
agree with mine and great if you
disagree tell me what your top phones
are kind of interesting to to hear you
can see there's a ton of comic is a
pretty big discussion going on so you
can check that out eighteen t articles
there you will have sprint and tmobile
coming later and if you're wondering why
I just pull the black brand in my pocket
um cuz im using blackberry is my
dedicated oh now there'll be a video I'm
going to film something talking about
why I'm using a blackberry I've got a
palm pre plus that I'm thinking about
using again um anyway we'll talk about
all that business some just rambling out
