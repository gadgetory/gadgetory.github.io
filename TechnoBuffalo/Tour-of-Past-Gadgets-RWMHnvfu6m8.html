lakers calm here some of you who follow
me on twitter may know that i am moving
in two weeks to a new place about two
miles away but of course with moving
comes packing and finding a whole bunch
of old stuff so as i was unpacking and
packing new boxes i found some
electronics gizmos back from early 2000
some stuff when i was in college and i
graduated college in 2003 and even
before then so i thought i'd be cool to
do a walk-through of technology and john
for lakers past so let me go ahead and
walk you guys through some of the cool
stuff I found so the first thing I'm
going to show you guys right here is my
first digital camera so first look how
big that cases so before I take it out
guess what you think the megapixel is
for my first digital camera i think this
was probably back in 2001 so tiny little
LCD screen here right there 1.3
megapixel i remember a olympus commedia
i remember having this thing and
thinking it was so cool i take pictures
digitally it connected with USB and
which was still kind of a new technology
at the time it had a zoom I mean it
really was an impressive thing at the
time and I was so happy and proud to
have it I think I mean it was just so
cool and now my phone have as a better
camera than this thing and just look how
big it is and this was a pocketable
camera for the day you opened it up I
remember flash popped out right there
put that back yet actually pushed the
flash back in kind of Cohen came in this
big case I remember walking around this
case in my pocket so I was way too cool
to put it on my belt and there's me just
huge back in the day when pants were
about eight times x is too big and super
baggy so pretty cool my old digital
camera so the next thing I'm a big cell
phone guys you guys are coming to
realize here's one of my old cell phones
that I found when I was with sprint I
was in college at the time I believe I
was a junior in college that puts this
at 2002 I remember begging begging to
get this phone was a flip phone was so
well I remember it had internet on it
just so I could check sport scores I
mean it was so advanced for its time
you're looking at it now it still
doesn't look super outdated I guess it's
really thick it was thinner it would
still just look like probably a cheap
free pay-as-you-go cell phone but it is
really big it was a nice phone I
remember getting great reception I was
always very happy with sprint had to
pull out antenna which you don't really
see any more push that back in I
remember being just a very nice phone
see how big the battery was this is
before any of the 3g stuff see if it
says how big the battery is 3.6 volts
which is milliamp hour at hours on nope
portable dual-band phone old so I'll put
that aside got plenty more stuff here
while we're on the phone track here's
another old phone i had this one's not
as old this one probably is 2004
actually back when 18t was singular a UH
nokia phone with just a bizarre keyboard
zoom into guys can see that i wasn't
that just just a strange keyboard the
circles right there i remember always
messing up calls it had a really cool
feature though you can actually record
calls when you're on him faison's record
friends all the time fly it back just
kind of as a joke so that was actually
really quick phone i remember i tried to
start a company when i was in college i
member using this as a business phone i
was making websites i think mostly I was
converting these VHS to DVD is what I
was doing it was kind of cool so this
will give an old cingular sim card in
there let's take that up battery on this
thing three point 6 volts again so let's
see what the old cingular sim card look
like so you can get that out I even had
a reception booster in there because in
my old place I got awful reception if
you can see that right there it's like a
little sticker you stuck in man didn't
do anything and it was super expensive
we did that sim card there we go so here
is an old cingular wireless sim card
this was before Singler became AT&amp;amp;T 32k
wow that is a not much storage on there
so kind of cool I think go ahead put
that back throw the battery back in
there all right put that off to the side
so I'm getting to some other cool stuff
that maybe is a little more interesting
but I want to show you some of the other
stuff here this is a mini disc player
some of the younger younger guys may not
even know what this is this was really
before I was even a mini disc in there
this was before mp3 players really took
off mini disc was a technology that Sony
pioneered you can actually hold so much
information on it so it's better than
tapes at the time you can just put all
the songs when you want that you can
record over it so here's one it was my
study mix when I was studying when I was
in school Mozart and Beethoven and that
kind of stuff you just put it in close
it had a little display you could
program what it said and what the songs
were on it actually was really cool
connected to your computer via a little
port right there and just plugged in it
was not the best quality but it was
really neat at the time it was very
portable took double-a batteries i
really liked it so I had that just some
other mini discs I have some green day
stuff on it here she had three green day
albums so to back in the day to get
three albums on one disc like this is
actually really impressive next thing I
have right here and I'm sure you guys
puddle and remember this is a zip disk
so this is back from computer select
floppy disk drives and CD drives were
just kind of not so popular yet zip 100
I think this is just like a hundred
megabyte disk and it was a big old dry
it was like a big floppy drive you put
it in you could sir all your stuff on it
this is my word back up files he was
probably filled up with probably 10 or
12 we have hundred megabytes so not that
many Word documents and really filled it
up I remember going to having to get
this so i was running out of storage on
my Flavius there was 100 megabytes and I
distinctly remember thinking that's so
big who's ever going to fill up a
hundred megabytes so while we're talking
about storage I have a storage cart here
that I want to show you guys this
predates SD and is bigger than SD but
there's something kind of cool about it
take it out here not throw it on the
floor so pretty big storage guy
relatively thin take a guess about how
much storage you niggas on this
it was for Olympus so it was for my
digital camera that I just showed you
guys look at that eight megabytes eight
megabyte card for a 1.3 megapixel camera
unbelievable look how big this thing is
the standard has gone out so long ago
but still kind of cool so the next thing
I think you guys maybe might want to see
the most is right here the first
generation ipod this one actually still
has the click wheel that moved around
actually might be the second generation
ipod had the click wheel that kind of
moved around the menu buttons use
firewire or was it there's a firewire
port to charge i'll show you guys right
there on the charger is firewire though
apples chargers are still say the same
over the years and i remember having
this and thinking oh my god so cool I
got all my music right here it shows me
what it is probably still works yeah
firewire port you pulled that off I mean
but look how thick this is now I mean
compared to two most devices here in
this if I remember memory correctly here
I believe was ten gigabytes of storage
and 10 gigabytes the time was so
impressive I'm it's crazy to think that
now I have 16 gigabytes right on my
phone here's a generation shot still
pretty cool to think how far technology
has come so another cool thing that I
had and actually it came with this case
two ipods don't come with real cases
anymore is a belt clip of is actually
really nice so while i was cleaning up i
also found the original box that the
ipod came in so we actually had can only
get a windows or a mac ipod there wasn't
one for both he had actually requested
which was kind of strategy became and
just use monster boxes so i'm going to
do a sort of unboxing i don't know
what's left in here haven't opened it up
since i found it so let's will walk you
guys through him show you what it looks
like nothing on top it's got two little
boxes right there so it's a break
there's a picture of the ipod black and
white at the apple logo and this was
kind of just the beginning of apple's
resurgence so the ipod in the case and i
don't think it came with a little
clicker to control songs and volume that
may have been something i was added
later or he had to buy it separately
showing the profile on the side and they
were showing next they were so proud of
how thin it was and now you know years
later enjoying that thing is huge but at
the time is still pretty cool so i pod
windows 16 gigabytes let's see what we
got in here I remember buying it from
bestbuy when I was in college just
thinking wow how cool I've got an ipod I
remember wake up all my music apple logo
respect some features on the side here
holds over 2,000 songs at near CD
quality on a 10 gigabyte hard drive at
the time that was just so incredible up
to 10 hours of meeting you is playback
it's actually still really nice super
portable at six point five ounces and
only point seven two inches thick plays
mp3 wav files high-resolution backlit
display requires a pc with a FireWire
port remember i had to buy an external
firewire card and plug it in I know
includes an ipod remote so it did come
with remote designed by Apple in
California assembled in Taiwan shows you
how far things have come now everything
is assembled in china alright so let's
see what we still have left in here open
it up apple ipod or two boxes there's
still stuff in here Wow um still the
original CD though I kept I'm pretty
meticulous about keeping things I'm as
far as I was back in the day original
apple CDs warranty information ipod at a
glance let's my ipod it advances turn it
on turn it off light it up find out more
it's really not that much here i guess
it is truly at a glance go ahead and
close that up let's see it also we got
inside so evidently i had another
charger so here's a another firewire
ipod charger what's in here I don't know
what was in there it's time but I think
it's just a cover the ipod came in this
little bag which is actually kind of
cool is an i-search hobbies maybe still
use this for something but that's what
was in there this was the important box
with all this stuff see what's in the
other one this one that just says app
pod Wow
headphone maybe ipod was in here we're
doing headphones and little soft things
for the ears these are the original ipod
headphones let's eat these look like cuz
I'm curious you know these are probably
the same ones that were still shipping
up until a few years ago nothing
terribly fancy just your same here buds
close this all back up and I guys this
is some stuff I found I thought it would
be cool to share with you I was really
interested in it I don't know if you
guys were but I hope you enjoyed this
