TechnoBuffalo and I've been up here in
Seattle for the past couple days at an
Intel conference but I got a chance to
go out to dinner last night with some of
the folks from HTC and they brought
along some goodies for us to play with
while we ate our sushi this is the radar
4g a windows phone 7.5 mango device for
t-mobile this has been officially
announced but there's no ship date no
price all t-mobile said was it'll be out
in time for the holidays but you can see
it's real um it's running windows up
phone 7.5 it's a nice device it's got an
aluminum unibody construction so it's
really solid feeling feels really good
i'm not a huge fan of the sort of kind
of chin double chin effect at the bottom
there with the metallic strife than the
white underneath it I don't I made the
phone look a little thicker than it
really is to me for some reason but that
being said it's a nice device it's got
4g on an HP s hspa+ 14 for windows phone
mango as we said it's a 3.8 inch WVGA
display windows phone can only go up to
wvga so it's wvga 3.8 inch one gigahertz
qualcomm snapdragon processor you can
see the camera does 720p video capture 5
megapixel camera with LED fat LED flash
720p video it's got a front-facing vga
cam eight gigs of on-board storage and
all new windows phone 7.5 goodies so
whenever it comes out we'll get a final
model of shipping model do a review for
you but first impressions very good nice
feeling phone seemed pretty responsive
excited for this one to get finalized
and get a ship date and a price it's the
radar 4g from HTC much much more on
TechnoBuffalo calm</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
