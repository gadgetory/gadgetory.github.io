fields feel good it's good to say that
and we got the big three the Trinity
phone rumors we've got some note eight
we got some iPhone eight and we got some
pixel to rumors of any three of those
phones or things you're interested in or
want to know when to buy it
stick around first let's start with the
note 8 August 23rd give me today that
all will be revealed but hopefully
you'll know everything about it
come the 23rd 20 years a rolling quaint
thing we're going to see a brand new
color deep blue kind of a darker almost
navy blue version the phone it's going
to launch alongside the midnight black
and Orchard gray you're getting real
excited about picking one of those
phones up you might want to send a tweet
at efflux who claims it's going to cost
you 1,100 bucks if you live outside of
South Korea which is not going to be a
cheap phone your hard for Samsung I
think to justify that price you would
suspect that we're going to talk about
well you can't expect from an $1,100
phone that dragon age 35 improve RAM
from the s8 so from 4 to 6 gigs of RAM a
thirty three hundred million power
battery which like I shouldn't have to
say it but just in case it'll be it'll
be non removable I think the camera is
going to be a big selling point Invictus
anthem is going to push with the know
date it should have not one with two
sensors the first one should be a 12
megapixel telephoto sensor with a three
time zoom it should also have a 13
megapixel sensor for a wide-angle shot
so the first time we've seen that dual
sensor setup on a flagship Samsung phone
of course the s10 four 4s penny type
thing the only way I can see Samsung
getting away at 1100 price point is if
the fingerprint reader is built into the
screen all the renders all the leaks all
the cases showing on the back and the
same really uncomfortable placement that
we saw on the s8 they can put that thing
in the screen I would happily view like
here take my money let's jump to
Google's own flagship V pixel 2 lives we
can call theta spade I love the pixel on
phones but the design the phone itself
the big chin it's not like the most
pretty phone to look at and look
like that should be rectified come
October when we see the pixel - it
should look damn gorgeous new color
option should come and it should have
the power to match the beauty it might
be the first phone to actually ship with
qualcomm latest chip the Snapdragon
eight
six which should be about ten percent
faster than eight thirty five and if you
remember back from the pixels first
announced that shipped with an eight
twenty one chip inside we should also
see much thinner bezel almost that sort
of edge to edge thing that we're trying
to expect now from flagship phones no
word on wireless charging built-in but
it's going to be metal not going to be
there it's going to be LG made but sort
of eight features in HTC you eleven the
squeezy side hopefully will be
customizable but allegedly it'll just
launch Google so if you Apple faithful
last but definitely not least iPhone
eight Forbes unleashed a ton of news
let's our notifications which ordinarily
would be that exciting Apple is
allegedly going to move them from the
top to the bottom and almost a touch ID
type area depending on what after using
it'll interact with you and the phone
that could be kind of cool and I've
lamented on the little kind of cutout at
the top of the screen the speaker is
going to be supposedly it's not going to
be where the screen is going to extend
up to it'll show things like signal
strength and date and tie on the screen
will start below that cut out leaving my
fears and perhaps your design fears as
well there's been a lot made about touch
ID with the new iPhone and where it's
going to be Justin talk it's going to be
so on the bottom talk can be built to
the screen on the back and the Apple
logo but here's a new one on the side
with a power and lock button it's
similar what Sonja's done with some of
their phones
there's the talk applicant ditch it all
together use some crazy facial
recognition type feature my money's
probably on at least for the time being
moving to the back they can't get the in
screen reader working but again that is
just again and if you're a fan of apples
white color you are you are out of luck
it's not about the square in there but I
I pulled it back suppose our there won't
be a white color option at least at
launch perhaps a few months later we'll
see the white color launch similar like
how product red hit with the iPhone 7
and you have to wait probably a little
longer to pick one of these suckers up
limited quantity allegedly not shipping
until October so there was a lot of
allegedly a lot of supposedly that's
nice rumor roundup these are all these
are all rumors so you've got no date
coming soon got a better looking pixel
to you got an iPhone 8 with some
fingerprint technology perhaps is built
in hitting sometime in October what are
the three are you most excited about I
love the original pixel I think if they
can fix the design going to be a killer
phone they put Samsung does that their
screen is absolutely incredible
and I'm excited for Apple to bring a new
design to the table with the iPhone
eight so consider me jazz for all three
consider my wallet not jazz four for all
three because it was not going to be
cheap phone they had to pick one though
which phone would you get are you
finally going to make the switch to
Android or going to go back to I owe a
you're going to stick with one the other
leave in the comments down below and let
me know if you guys like uber roundup
you're glad it's back to the video a
thumbs up to let us know we will do more
of these so next time I'm John Ranger
Detective Buffalo
