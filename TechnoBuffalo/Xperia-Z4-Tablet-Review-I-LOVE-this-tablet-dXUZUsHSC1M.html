TechnoBuffalo here's a review for you of
this guy this is the Xperia z4 tablet
mine FB Xperia z4 you're hoping for but
one you absolutely should consider
before I jump at the review let me give
a disclaimer first I bought this one
myself I really just wanted to try it
didn't come from any PR firm or from
Sony I just really was curious to see
how it performed Todd went to Mobile
World Congress that is one of his
favorite things that he saw there back
in March so I figured I would give it a
shots on the market for a new tablet
anyway and I use this for about two and
a half weeks before filming this review
this is going to be in our lightning
review format meaning I'm just going to
get right to the point to talk about all
the stuff that I want them about the
tablet I think things that you want to
know so let's jump right in and get this
out of the way early let's talk about
the Snapdragon 810 does it overheat
there's a big misconception that having
a Snapdragon 810 means your phone or
tablet's can just blow up second turn it
on I didn't have any overheating issues
at all I ran just as cool as any other
tablet I've used before included a nexus
9 and the Dell Venue I had no issue with
heat at all and also the Snapdragon 810
it was crazy fast through gigs of ram on
here as well didn't hurt it so
performance overall was incredible the
a-10 I've had pretty good experience
with so if you might be basing your
experiences on what you've heard others
say but try it for yourself it's been
pretty solid for me alright next let's
talk about that sweet design this thing
is six point one and millimeters thin
and it feels like Sony forgot to put the
whole battery in at just under 380 grams
the cool thing here is that there's no
sacrifices at all the 6000 William power
battery is great I charge about once a
week which is about the same ones I did
on the Nexus 9 and the iPads that I used
before that I've usually shied away from
larger tablets opting for like the 7 to
8 inch range instead but I was really
curious about the qHD display that sony
had the figured I would give it a shot
and I'm glad I did it is gorgeous it's
in the conversation from the best tablet
screens I have ever used religions in
the conversation and not absolutely is
the screen doesn't get that bright which
is nice and nice so use like you most of
my tablet viewing with the lights off so
I'm blowing my eyes out I gotta turn the
brightness almost up all the way
whenever you're outside so bear that in
mind
and also despite being crazy thin light
having LTE connectivity a killer display
a micro SD card it's also freakin
waterproof and dust tight with IP 65 and
68 and on top of that the ports are open
they're not closed and hidden under
flaps here 3.5 millimeter headset jack
and micro SD port look like any other
port on any other tablet you don't
expected to be waterproof of fact I
totally freaked my wife out first day I
brought it home I want to bring that guy
was gonna show her something on it like
oh no I got smudges on it I turned on
the sink and hit water hit it she
freaked out it is incredible the tablet
that looks this good is this light it's
also waterproof it's an incredible feat
by Sony look at devices like the galaxy
s6 active it certainly offers more
protection and when four drops but also
get to make compromises from design to
get that waterproofing in there no
compromises here at all granthi you
don't get that same protection from
drops but you can take this to the beach
take it in the shower taking the tub and
not have to worry from a software
standpoint the Sony skin is pretty light
it's based on Android 5.0 - I do like
the ability to run small apps top of
others and the double tap to wake up is
really nice the first thing I did when I
booted this thing up was install Google
now like immediately but hey you can
also stream your ps4 games to it with
the DualShock paired so straight to ps4
games you can Dick's upstairs not have
to bother your mom or your wife or
girlfriend or boyfriend or husband so I
very rarely talk about cameras and
tablets but this one is actually pretty
decent 8.1 megapixels but holy moly they
went crazy the augmented reality here
look there's spider-man hey they're
dinosaurs and now here I am is a
different race a woman and an animal
they just did it did it because they
could so I think people get way too cut
off in the OS Wars if you want a tablet
that you want to consume media on you
want to watch netflix on a watch Hulu
you want to browse the internet watch
YouTube send tweets up fake facebook
which is what most people do the tablet
things from it's not going to matter
whether they use an Android or an iOS
people think they really get caught up
on what OS they have to have ones better
ones worse this is just a really good
tablet overall that anybody could enjoy
regardless of os preference if you're
and iOS fan you've always used iPhone
you should still look at this tablet
it's an incredible experience it's
really light then it's waterproof if
you're an Android fan certainly look at
this as well
it's one of the best tablets I have ever
tested when the best devices ever tested
period I wish it would come to the US
though to import this thing here cost
run 800 bucks but if you don't mind the
cost you live in an area where it
already sells I can almost guarantee you
you will not be disappointed it gets an
incredibly solid 9.5 losing away at
small half a point from being perfect I
didn't like the power button on the left
hand side front visiting speakers could
have been a little bit louder but I mean
I'm just nitpicking here at this point I
love this thing yeah I have to pry it
out of my hands I'm glad that I bought
it it's not to send it back to any PR
from rebecca soni it's not to love and
keep the name Fred so whatta guys think
would you consider the Sony Xperia z4
tablet have you thought about it before
maybe something was even on your radar
because you know it's not available in
the US really not available in your
country really like to hear your
thoughts on it if you haven't seen one a
person try and find one hold it use it
look at that screen I think you had a
very different perspective than what you
can get even just watching a youtube
video on it anyway leave your comments
down below hope you guys enjoyed if you
want to see the unboxing video the
Xperia z4 tablet here you go check it
out until next time I am John render
