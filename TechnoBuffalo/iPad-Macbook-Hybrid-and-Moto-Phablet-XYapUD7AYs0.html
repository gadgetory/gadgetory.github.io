to you by netflix what's going on
everyone welcome back through pisode of
rumor roundup I am your rumour maitre d
for the afternoon evening or day jon
rettinger and i'm going to walk you
through all the tech rumors that you
need to know so you know what could be
coming out what might be coming out what
is potential to possibly be coming out
what unnamed product that's ever been
announced is already delayed and what
some crazy analyst thinks is probably
definitely going to happen this rumor
roundup but start just rounding up those
rumors let's start with apple looks not
just a juicy surprisingly refreshing
fruit as also one of the kings of the
rumor mill supposedly Apple is planning
some sort of dr. Moreau style macbook
air ipad hybrid alongside the company's
more typical macbook air and macbook pro
that we've seen for a while the rumor
originates out of we phone from a
foreign poster that has provided pre
accurate information in the past lending
kind a bit of credibility to this report
so the supposed weird monstrosity device
is supposed to sport a 12 inch Retina
display and come with some key
differences compared with apples device
currently out right now so according to
the forum poster sources the device was
reportedly going to feature a redesign
trackpad without a mechanical button so
the whole track pads not going to click
and instead feature tactile feedback to
simulate a click we don't know if Apple
is going to vary the size the trackpad
at all but in a 12-inch form factor
chances ours still it's going to closely
mirror what's available in 11 inch
macbook air since two are about that
different in size in addition to the new
trackpad and perhaps the biggest part of
the new device will be the lack of a fan
suggesting the form factor will be a lot
like current ipad devices so the 12 inch
notebook is probably and still going to
run OS 10 meeting will finally see
apple's fabled kind of ipad pro device
hit the market last year KGI securities
analyst ming-chi co predicted apple
release such advice with the retina
display and the market flat device is
looking pretty satiated no proposed
timeline is mentioned in the report so
it could be awhile before anything like
this even turn
up not only will out potentially
introduce a new big redesign to its
iPhone it could also releases crazy new
12 inch device and other notebook
refreshes and also wearables all before
the year is up it's almost the end of
March as of this filming and Apple
stills and held a single nouncement yet
so perhaps all the big guns let out to
the second half of the year big big guns
you shut up don't make jokes from the
big a let's jump to the Big M sort of
doing a my own nerdy YMCA Motorola is
gearing up to launch a phablet later
this year according to a new report
posted the Chinese site Sina Weibo the
source doesn't offer much information
beyond the launch window which is
sometime during q3 of 2014 which is 30
months but at the same person who
actually provided details ahead of the
Moto X and moto G launched last year
rumors of a moto phablet called x-play
have surfaced last October adding
tinting to a 6.3 and successor to the
droid ultra which is really really big
early this year another room were posted
on Weibo claiming they wouldn't see the
device until 2015 along with a Moto X
equal and a SmartWatch however with the
Moto 360 set to launch the summer it
looks like we may finally see the
rumored x-play announcement at around
the same time it's so unclear at motor
roads phablet will offer beyond just a
bigger display the device would probably
feature the same tricks using the Moto X
including touchless control which I love
active display and assist so it's also
possible the new handset launch will go
alongside the Moto 360 is a
complementary device similar what
Samsung did with the gear and the note 3
but Motorola has already confirmed the
SmartWatch will work on all android
phones running 4.3 or higher so probably
not going to happen other soon they'll
guarantee a motor that was on the way at
all on the leak doesn't refer to it as
the x play suggesting the name they have
changed company has hinted a few
upcoming devices bezar only confirmed
any new smartphone their 2014 and really
any detail at all so I'm provide a
launch window for this phablet let's say
sometime during q1 of 2014 and q4 of
2015 we will probably most definitely
for sure almost going to see a motorola

that motorola phablet is going to be
running android you makes android google
and they are already testing the next
version of android kitkat according to
tweet posted by at a lab to fer who is
accurately report on the mobile industry
in the past the updates android 4.4
point 3 allegedly carries the very sexy
build number of que tu 72b and may fix a
number of things but were poorly focused
on the camera bug in the nexus 5 which
we may use the next 5 definitely knows
about the phone has been constantly
knock for have a mediocre camera and
earlier updates have tried to fix the
issue with very limited success in fact
way back in December at Google lunch
android 4.4 point was supposed to clean
up the Nexus 5 camera and it still
hasn't slowed just not up to snuff
compared to other Android devices
earliest month of Google promised an
update would fix the camera yet again so
maybe this is going to be it we think
it's also possible Google could issue
just an update for that specific phone
instead of dedicating an entire Android
release for a single device that's
possible there are other performance
enhancements and tweaks coming under the
hood we just don't know about yet so far
it sounds like android 4.4 point 3 is
relatively minor Zeke's back from a
point update which means you won't have
to fret if you're in picking up a new
flash which might not receive the update
for many many many months next major
update probably won't come until June
when Google may introduce it in during
its annual IO Developers Conference

it so what you guys think Motorola
