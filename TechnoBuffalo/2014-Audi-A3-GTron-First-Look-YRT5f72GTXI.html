TechnoBuffalo here and we are at the
2014 Geneva Motor Show we're at the Audi
booth and I gotta tell you there are
more Tron's here than a Saturday morning
cartoon behind us is the g-tron if you
follow out it you'll know if they're
going electric with their each Ron line
the G here stands for natural gas so
what you're looking at here is obviously
an a3 variant it's got 110 horsepower
1.4 liter TFSI engine good for a hundred
and forty eight foot pounds of torque so
probably think of natural gas a little
bit on the crazy side this car is kind
of cool it can use natural gas and
regular gasoline at the same time it's
got 12 less horsepower than the standard
1.4 liter a3 it's gonna leisurely get
you up to 60 miles an hour at 11 seconds
with 118 miles per hour for a top speed
from the look so it looks like a
standard eighth usually no way to tell
other than of course uses natural gas so
it's really part of outies big push to
reduce co2 emissions especially in
Europe so when you're using an
alternative fuel like natural gas that's
sort of hard to do the math to see how
far you can go
so 7.7 pounds of natural gas is gonna
get you equivalent of 62 miles that's
about a quarter of the two tanks total
capacity so if we do the math the
arrange on total natural compressed gas
is about 230 to 250 ish miles but you
can also use gas after that for 560
additional miles but you can go $750 800
miles depending on how you drive really
really really crazy long distances here
the two tanks are located below the
cargo floor supposedly very safe doing
something like natural gas of course you
have to deal with explosions and
compressions naturally been one of the
knocks on if you forget that regular
gasoline is powered by explosions anyway
so it's just another way for a sort of
explosion to propel a motor this will be
coming to market not sure when not gonna
see it probably in the US but it will
make its way to European shores and it
looks kind of its kind of the best of
both worlds you get gas if you want it
natural gas and you can find it it can
go almost 800
miles of Motoring before you have to
worry about refueling hi guys what do
you think g-tron would you get a natural
gas car if you could as some of you can
you fill it somewhere nearby and if you
don't use it you know maybe just use gas
let's hear your thoughts leave in the
comments down below until next time I'm
