from TechnoBuffalo and it was the new
year now in full swing a couple weeks in
or depending on when you're watching
this maybe more than a couple weeks and
I wanted to hit you guys up with a list
of a couple new apps that I've been
using these are not apps that have come
out recently necessarily but they're
apps that I've begun enjoying recently
two may have flown under your radar that
I would love to share with you guys in
case you want to enjoy them let's go
ahead and get started
first we have David Attenborough's story
of life if you guys are anything like me
and fanatics about nature and animal
documentaries this app is going to be
your best friend
David Attenborough narrates a lot of
very famous nature documentaries and
this app is sort of his all-inclusive
idea of a media experience he's on
camera talking you through certain
chapters and certain topics about deep
ocean exploration and then you're
cutting to footage that he's talking
over it's a really really awesome app
the content is amazing and that's really
what this app is all about the content
the interface is also very pleasurable
to use overall this app is a great
experience you'll really really enjoy it
if you're a fan of this type of stuff
the next app is called Prisma now you
guys may have heard of this have got an
app of the year from both Apple and
Google but I pretty much just started
using it and I'm having a blast with it
in short it's a photofiltre app but it's
on steroids it's not like Instagram
filters that'll do a slight color grade
for you or give you a vintage film look
Prizmo will completely transform the
photo you take into any style of photo
that you guys would like from comics to
classical art pieces watercolor type
stuff anything and everything in between
they have insane numbers of filters and
you can put them on to varying degrees
what I like about Prisma is that they
know what they are and so you don't even
have to have an account or anything you
can purely just open up the app put a
photo through and then upload it to
Instagram but they do have a social
media side of their app as well I don't
know how many people are using this I
personally was mainly using it just to
get photos to Instagram and Facebook
even if that's the case I think you'll
really still enjoy it it's a really cool
way to differentiate your photos in a
world where everybody has the same
filters and personal really is doing
something different next we have an app
that I didn't really think I needed
until I actually started using it
Google trips and it is what it sounds
like it plans your trips for you it'll
take a location based on that location
you can
in reservation things to do they used
the same format and interfaces something
like Google now does so it's very
organized very straightforward and very
useful it'll not only help you organize
the things you're going to do but also
give you recommendations for things to
do in certain cities in certain areas
and probably the most convenient feature
of this app is that you can download
certain trips and so you can have them
offline which is exactly what you want
when traveling because most people who
travel know that you rarely have good
signal so having everything available
offline is a perfect tool to have a
successful trip next we have an app
that's gonna help you achieve all your
New Year's resolutions or maybe at least
help you along the way it's an app
called coach dot mean and it's more than
an app it's a service but the app itself
is awesome it helps you build new habits
so for me something I've wanted to do is
meditate recently a lot and so it'll
tell me for a certain number of days in
order to build this habit it'll remind
me every single day to go ahead and
stick with meditating for ten minutes
you can do this with working out with
eating healthy but what's cool about
coach dot means that they also have a
social aspect to it
so you can actually work with trainers
you can pay money and do live
consultations and talk with them you can
join groups and be part of the social
experiment of everyone learning a habit
together there's a lot of options that
it should help you overall just be a
better person if that's what you want to
do and last but definitely not least we
have an app called dark sky and it's a
weather app and you might be wondering
why do I need a weather app my weather
app works fine well dark sky is a
hyperlocal weather app it's extremely
precise and is very very information
dense you can go through how the rest of
today is going to look you can go to the
globe and the map and you can see what's
gonna be coming up over the next couple
of days with a really really cool
animated earth you can get all sorts of
information like precipitation
percentage wind humidity UV index and
you can get an hour-by-hour just the way
everything is laid out is extremely
informational but not complex and very
approachable at the same time there's
one of the best weather apps that I
personally use and I really wanted to
put it on
list and so that's pretty much it for
this video guys let me know what you
think in the comments down below of
these apps are you gonna be trying any
of them out what more do you guys want
to see from us in terms of content my
name is Ron Frieda and I hope you have
an awesome 2017</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
