TechnoBuffalo here at they for review
for you of the latest flagship phone
from Samsung I can't say their biggest
phone because the mega exists this is
the Galaxy Note 3 ok I put it through
its paces see if it's worthy of taking
up a very large spot in your pockets
with all my phone reviews let me give my
disclaimer I use this as my daily driver
for five days in conjunction with the
galaxy s4 for three more days on top of
that did the review testing both AT&amp;amp;T
and Sprint models let's go ahead and
jump right and talk about Hardware in
design so first I put a lot of stock how
a phone feels in my hand I've been
really particular about that and I've
given Samsung pretty much plenty of
grief for the plastic rounded corners
that made their premium devices feel
super low range but just like an
criticize I can also give credit where
it's due and the subtle change toward a
flatter textured edge makes a huge
difference on the note 3 it's probably
the best feeling Sami device I've tested
yet so hats off to Samsung more
importantly though it's a sign that
Samsung is looking to change its build
so I'm taking it as a very positive sign
for their future devices hopefully maybe
an s5 will come with a similar design
structure so hardware wise this thing is
pretty much a beast it's packed to the
gills with the latest awesome tech stuff
the flagship here the heart of the phone
is a 2.3 gigahertz Snapdragon 800 chip
that as expected is just crazy fast the
old way of doing reviews where I would
see how fast apps open to that kind of
stuff just doesn't work anymore
this phone is blazing fast apps open
fast performance and gaming is awesome
everything just feels really really
really quick I don't know if three gigs
of ram is overkill but i never had to
worry about doing any app management at
all usually two gigs which seems crazy
anyways comes standard for flagship
Android devices three just seems like
extra icing that delicious cake you
should never have to worry about any app
management at all things are just
buttery smooth and scrolled perfectly no
issue at all when it came to ram
attended anything on the phones gonna
use three gigs of ram but it's kind of
nice to have it right it's like having a
v12 how chance some chances you get to
actually open that thing up but it's
kind of nice thing you got it let's talk
about this ginormous glorious bee
beautifully seductive Super AMOLED
screen that's now a full 1080p which
means 1920 by 1080 and it looks awesome
pictures pop with really bright colors
darks look really dark videos look
pretty baller it's not even so awful in
direct sunlight which means you can
still kind of see the screen but don't
plan on reading any sort of log messages
at all so a cool thing here is samsung
added point 2 inches to the phone
without really making the device much
bigger at all so hats off to those
engineers it's almost the same footprint
as a Galaxy Note 2 of the bigger screen
which was pretty surprising they're able
to do that so obviously bezels got a
little thinner and the Vice is kind of
matured so the back of the phone it
looks like a leather went down to the
stitches on the side but it is most
definitely not it's the same plastic
back Samsung has been using for years
just textured and perhaps it's
psychosomatic but it really does feel
better maybe it's just that texture
device I think it's leather but it still
is that same plastic back so for a
device at this price earlier with
Samsung I'm just include wireless
charging right out of the box and not
make us pay extra for a backplate it's
not even widely available yet I love
wireless charging Samsung give it to me
in the box please and lastly with the
hard works I know you want to know the
quadrants cord listen I know it's not
the most scientific way to benchmark
Android apps but I do use it in every
single Android phone I review fleece
it's sort of a sense of how fast or slow
a device might perform in hypothetical
set of circumstances the quadrants core
of the Galaxy Note 3 was a pretty
whopping 21300 so boom so I'm Hardware
it let's talk about software with
Samsung devices there's usually a lot to
talk about the software it seems like
Samsung's offers philosophy is just
throw more and more and more in there
and maybe the user will find one or two
features that they really like I do like
the shortcuts in the pull down and the
eye tracking is kind of neat but for
every awesome feature that they added
here is one that really makes a scratch
your head like Samsung what like s-voice
why have that when Google searches
arguably the best digital assistant
around and don't an app they just ignore
if you just hold the button or double
tap it you get s voice and it pops up
and it makes you use it even further if
you want to get a Galaxy gear which only
works with the note 3 right I have to
rely on s voice for any sort of voice
and that just didn't make
a sense to me so despite being so UI
heavy there's really zero slowdown at
all this phone feels as fast they stock
Nexus device that's what the testament
to the insanely awesome processor and
RAM combo as well as the software
engineers at Samsung are usually with
previous you know totally skinned device
you can feel a little bit of lag but
zero lag here at all three gigs of RAM
and that awesome Snapdragon under this
thing is an absolute beast so I know a
lot of you buy note devices for the S
Pen and I just want to be honest not a
lot of state I don't really use it I
tried it enough to know what it does and
it's meat just not my cup of tea but you
might not be like me and if you are one
of the people that like the s-pen
there's a lot to like about it this is
the best iteration around first it's
reversible which is kind of nice and
it's now chalked with way more features
you can do a ton of stuff here at the
s-pen so as soon as you pull it right
out of its little S Pen holster you're
greeted with five menu options you're
kind of neat you can access and without
ever really having to touch the screen
to see what they are so first you've got
action memo I which let you sort of
write a phone number or write down an
equation they'll sort of convert it
something you can actually use if write
down a number you can dial the number
right from there it's very handy a nexus
scrapbooker if you like to sort of keep
scrapbooks or draw sort of certain
things i'll great please keep all that
stored a nexus screen right that one's
pretty obvious i found that actually
really handy with mac's take a picture
of google maps right where you want to
go and you can save it you can do s
finder which is kind of me you could
search for all kinds of stuff and just
write it out it shows up there and kind
of the weirdest one for me is pen window
if you select that I just draw a box on
the screen you get shortcuts to
different things which are kind of neat
but certainly the steps it would take to
pull the S Pen out select that draw a
box then select the icon you want to
make it quicker to just open up the app
drawer and select the application there
but it's kind of neat did find myself
sometimes using it just to scroll
through the homepage or scroll through
web page without use my fingers kind of
neat again though I'm not really a big S
Pen guy but if you're a person that
likes that like to draw on their phone
this is hands down the best iteration of
it
so battery you got a big phone with a
big HD screen is three two hundred
million power battery is much like the
phone itself pretty awesome I was able
to get the end of day with about forty
percent let me tell you a little bit
about my usage they take the phone off
the charger around 7:00 7:30 depending
today pretty heavy phone usage maybe
four ish hours on the phone it's on
Wi-Fi most the day when I'm at home or
at the office some web browsing it's
pulling in emails about every five
minutes got two separate accounts a lot
of social media going on I don't take it
easy on my phones at all I keep my
brightness usually around 75% I don't
keep it on auto so pretty big testament
to that thirty two hundred million power
battery you won't have any trouble
getting through a full day if you do
some management probably two days but I
always recommend charging it every night
let's jump into the camera so Samsung
hasn't really talked about it a lot but
there's a 13 megapixel camera on the
note 3 that actually shoots 4k UHD video
let me just say that again this little
guy right here she's freaking 4k video
it properly defaults to 1920 by 1080 in
the settings but he visit the settings
option there you can up its to 3840 by
2160 the resolution that can be
displayed on 4k screens which is just
wacky obviously though you can't play
the 4k back and 4k call it on the note 3
I didn't have access to a 4k screen so I
couldn't really test it for you but it's
kind of a nice feature proofing and if
you have a 4k screen you want to take
the best quality video you know you can
definitely do that here with the note 3
which is kind of cool
I love note that you can't capture
photos at the same time recording a
video in that mode just a friendly
heads-up a 13 megapixel sensor on the
back though when it's not shooting crazy
high res video pretty much the same as
at one of the Galaxy s4 so as far as we
can tell pictures look about the same we
have noticed though it does have some
issues with motion blur a lot of the
time and there's a lot of noise and
low-light shots but we generally like
the camera if you guys want to see a
full gallery of pictures and what they
look like hit the link down below to go
to the written review you can see a full
set of how the pictures look like on the
Galaxy Note 3 so what's the verdict on
the Galaxy Note 3 I love this phone I
love the original version I love the
sequel and I love the trilogy this is
the best version of that line to give it
to the best endorsement I can I'm going
to use this as my daily driver
TouchWiz is heavy but doesn't slow the
phone down at all it works very well
like ignore the features that I don't
want to use I wish I wireless charging
right out of the box that is a very very
very small gripe they made the phone
feel better they improve the screen
everything about it it makes it a great
quality phone the phone gets a really
solid 9 it's one
best phones on the market to get that
nine half and ten everything has to be
perfect on we're just shy of perfection
but bringing right next perfect about as
best as I can give a phone you're really
not going to regret picking up a Galaxy
Note 3 is probably my favorite device so
far the past few months definitely be
gracing my pocket for the foreseeable
future so what'd you guys think do you
agree disagree I want to hear your
