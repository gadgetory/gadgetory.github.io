to you by netflix what's up everyone
welcome back to episode of rumor roundup
I'm your host John rende just to show
where I take all the tech rumors from
the week and I smash them and condense
them into one tech rumored show so you
know what's coming what could be coming
was potential to possibly definitely
come sometime in the next days weeks
months or maybe even years up this week
the old stalwart iPhone 6 and the galaxy
s5 even though it's already been
announced makes a triumphant return to
rumor roundup let's get started the
galaxy s5 makes a triumphant return to
rumor roundup this week because it's
camera module may cause a delay or
supply constraints so you better just
get in line right now if you're gonna
want a galaxy s5 like right now stop the
video and just go camp out according to
ET news setting industry sources the
chinese site is claiming samsung's lend
yield for the Galaxy s5 camera are just
20 to 30 percent which can potentially
lead to delays in galaxy s5 production
and even its launch was expected to
occur around the globe sometime in April
etn News adds that mass production of
the 16 megapixel camera was initially
supposed to start last month has already
been delayed thanks to the complex
process required to produce a camera
module so in an effort to keep the
galaxy s5 production on track Samsung's
purchasing officers are reportedly
literally camping out at lens supplier
factories however the company expected
production to pick up in the near future
despite this early speed bump however we
will be able to increase the yield
within a short period of time and
anonymous Samsung insider told etn news
so Samsung still hasn't announced an
official release date for the galaxy s5
in the US if you remember all they said
was it's gonna be available in all major
carriers sometime in April if the rumor
this week is sure the company might face
a super tough choice do they delay the
launch until late April or into May or
release a limited number of units which
will quickly sell out neither option is
super great although Samsung should be
able to iron out any manufacturing
issues hopefully quickly
I would wager we'll see a date slip
maybe from early April to middle end of
April and we'll see normal supplies for
Galaxy s5 so maybe don't worry as much I
hacked it up to me
iPhone 6 production is about to get
rolling along if you believe the folks
at China Times they recently said that
Pegatron which always sounds like a bad
transformer to me and Foxconn received
orders for the iPhone 6 and that the
former will start producing the new
iPhone at its new Khun Shan factory
where the company also builds laptop
set-top boxes and other consumer
electronics under ease our reuters also
reportedly cited a report from the
commercial time as that suggested
Pegatron will soon start hiring
additional staff to build the iPhone 6
and it's plants in China in January
another story said that Pegatron would
handle about 50% on the iPhone 6
production suggesting the Apple is
moving more responsibility away from
Foxconn which has struggled in the past
to create enough units to meet demand
and also crazy human health concerns so
we'll see what happens with that the
iPhone 6 expected to offer a larger
screen although reports of screen size
have been scattered at best most pundits
expert the people just seem to be
guessing and to think the iPhone is
gonna be a 4.7 inch screen we've also
heard rumors of 4.5 and fingers-crossed
a 5.5 inch display a new a a processor
is also expected and tsmc and Samsung
have both allegedly received orders to
build the chip yes that samsung
evidently they're just like the
frenemies they just talk nice to each
other and then just top you had each
other's back
once nobody's looking and speaking of
iPhone 6 ESM China claims Apple is going
to outfit the iPhone 6 with more sensors
more sensors equal more better so
specifically the analysts soon Chang Chu
said that Apple is going to add sensors
to monitor outside humidity temperature
and pressure these are probably more
useful for weather data the information
on your health but the report leaves the
door open just a teeny tiny crack for
other centers as well it wouldn't be
totally out of the question I don't
think to add a heart rate monitor for
example and samplings already done it
with the galaxy s5 although before
people jump down my throat to be fair
canard installed a third-party app that
uses the cameras led to monitor your
heart rate on the iPhone - the most
compelling aspect to the whole report
though
least for me is that if true Apple is
working to make the iPhone one heck of a
monitoring tool from the weather to
hopefully even our health so big
disclaimer time we haven't covered in a
report to me SM China before but it is
rumor roundup so it qualifies so you
don't really know how much weight this
rumor holds we do know though that it
seems likely at Apple is putting a new
focus on monitoring our health and the
new sensors on the iPhone really no
matter what they end up doing there'll
be a lot of sensors maybe the sense my
happiness my sadness and I'll turn
colors like those old school mood rings
they'll be pretty sweet me exhale for
