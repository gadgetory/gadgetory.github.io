introduced this the Google cardboard it
was the company's first step into the
world of virtual reality now of course
when it was announced last year we
weren't sure if it was some weird joke
but then we got our hands on it and we
soon realized that Google was on to
something big
while many people are quick to jump on
the oculus bandwagon when it comes to VR
Google was creating an immersive
experience with nothing but a piece of
cardboard and a smartphone in your
pocket it might not be the best-looking
VR headset we've seen but that's not the
point it's meant to be the simplest and
most affordable way to experience VR
Google introduced a new version of its
cardboard hardware with a few key
changes one it's bigger and can support
phones up to six inches - there's a new
button instead of the old magnetic
button that slid up and down the new
buttons made out of this conductive foam
that works as the primary input device
when using cardboard lastly it's much
easier to assemble it's a three-step
process which means you'll be up and
running in a matter of seconds google
also announced a new sdk so developers
can build apps along with a cardboard
app for iOS the overall experience of
using cardboard with an iPhone is
basically the same as Android just do it
make your dreams come true there are
four main demos to choose from including
this awesome kaleidoscope demo but
there's also explore urban height and
exhibit Google said it shipped over a
million cardboard units last year and we
wouldn't be surprised to see Google ship
many more in 2015 in addition to
announcing a new viewer Google also
spent a lot of time talking about a new
education focus initiative called
expeditions it's essentially designed to
allow teachers to lead a classroom of up
to 30 students on a virtual field trip
seems like a low-cost way to prove the
educational possibilities of virtual
reality in general and mobile VR
specifically while it may seem weird to
take students on a virtual field trip
the possibilities of doing so are
limitless students can now go into space
through a volcano deep into a jungle and
more all without leaving their classroom
the new cardboard viewer isn't too
different from last year's version with
exception of the new button and support
for larger devices it's still well
cardboard though that's not a bad thing
what you see is what you get it's not
meant to be the fanciest VR headset but
an affordable headset for you to
actually try VR anyways thank you guys
so much for watching and if you guys
enjoyed this video give this video a
thumbs up and we will
you guys in the next one just do it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
