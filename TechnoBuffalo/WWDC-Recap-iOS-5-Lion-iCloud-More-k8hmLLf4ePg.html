technobuffalo here apple's 2011 WWDC
keynote just ended and i have four pages
of notes in front of me which is about
two and a half pages more than i usually
have during these Apple keynotes there
was a ton of stuff covered so let me go
ahead and walk you through what happened
so we're going to go ahead and do this a
bit differently usually the recaps army
base in this direction talking to the
camera said i'm going to use
technobuffalo is my backdrop here so i
can show you some of the images that
we're talking about see me look down
again because i got a whole bunch of
notes in front of me alright so it began
with talk of OS 10 lion we began with a
little bit of demos they gave some facts
on Macs in general 54 million mac users
lion now has 250 new features in order
to upgrade to lion you are going to have
to have of snow leopard so you can't go
right from leopard to lion you have to
go a leopard snow leopard lion that's a
lot of leopards a lot more multi-touch
gestures here you can see more
information here as well you're going to
have full screen applications which is
really going to be quite handy you're
also going to have a built-in Mac App
Store we obviously have that right now
I'd be able to do in screen or in-app
purchases which would be kind of neat
sort of like those micro purchases you
can do on your mobile phone or iPad
right now you're also going to have
in-app push notifications which we will
talk much more about in just a minute
we've got launchpad they talked about it
sort of looks like iOS type icons they
talked a bit about something called
versions it's going to can see it right
here it's going to create a new version
of a document each time it's opened and
it's just going to record the Delta and
what the Delta manges us to changes
you're not going to be stuck with a ton
of different versions but you're going
to have really one version that has all
the changes in it so you're never going
to be lost without something let's say
you're editing a document let's say
hypothetically a term paper and you
forget to save it you're like crap now
you're going to have that option airdrop
sort of lets you share files between
computers it's a Pete to peer-to-peer
thing kind of neat there's a new version
of mail as well as a ton of new fee
sure is not going to get that much
detail new version of male yay so lion
interestingly enough will only be
available in the mac app store no more
discs it's going to be available to
purchase for 2999 and you can use that
for all of your registered max that
you've got so you'll need to buy it at
one time you can sell on multiple
computers which is kind of neat no
reboots going to be needed to install
which is also interesting it'll be
available in july with a Developer
Preview launching today now let's get to
the meat of these four pages and that is
iOS 5 i'm going to get out of the way
there was no mention of an iphone 5 and
iphone 4s this is strictly iOS 5 which
will work on the same devices that iOS
four fully works on so it'll work on
your iPhone for your iphone 3gs recent
generation ipod touches and of course
first and second generation iPads so
let's go ahead and get started because
there is a lot to talk about here first
200 million iOS devices you can get a
bit of a previous what we're going to
talk about here but 200 million iOS
devices is a lot of iOS devices
considering aren't that many platforms
out there they pay developers 2.5
billion dollars and that's with a be
that is a tremendous thing of friends
amount of money that's a huge especially
when you consider the 30 70 split the
big thing and the one that I was so
excited about is new notifications if
you've ever used android this is going
to be very familiar you swipe down and
you get a huge list in notifications I
talked about how annoying those pop-ups
were so it'll be nice that that's going
to be there um iOS 5 is going to give
you 1,500 new AP is and 200 new features
highlighted I think by its notification
so you swipe it down from top if you've
got like an animation going on in a game
it'll sort of do a little swirly pop-up
thing for you kind of handy it's also
going to have the notifications on the
lock screen so now the lock screen
finally has some use so in young lock
phone you want unlock the phone you can
see notifications and they'll be able to
jump right into what those are very
handy we're going onto page two
newsstand which is essentially I books
for magazines and newspapers pretty easy
Twitter integration there is now a lot
of Twitter integration you can share
with camera photos maps and there's a
single sign in pretty handy right there
Safari there's now something called
Safari reader you can read all this
stuff on technobuffalo if you want to
sort of get rid of all the ads on a site
you just want the word so far every
day's going to do that for you just the
button you hit it you get it reminders
now which is now a fancy way to just
take to do lists so you now have a
built-in to-do list there's a lot of
stuff to talk about to in the next
feature which is reading list it's going
to give you the ability to read articles
later this lot of stuff you want to read
you forget about it eventually you can
set yourself a reading list go back and
check it out a lot of new features in
the camera there's going to be a new
camera button on the lock screen so you
can jump right to it instead of having a
hit the unlock button swipe to unlock go
to camera and take your picture and if
you do want to take a picture you can
now use the volume up button to take one
just kind of nique actually use the hard
buttons on the phone you can pinch to
zoom on the screens icon to zoom in you
could go ahead and do that feature that
should have been there probably from day
one you can reduce red eye right on the
phone now you can do some editing kind
of handy you can also rotate it right
from there let's talk about mail because
a lot of cool stuff in mail you can see
this right here you now have a split
screen keyboard for typing on the iPad
much your alice is going to work if it's
going to be useful or not but it is very
handy so you don't have to just type in
portrait or landscape anymore portrait
you can do a little quicker thumb type
in action kind of handy so updated
keyboard again some updates to mail
something called pc free so when you
ordinarily if you had bought an iphone
gets connected to your pc first no need
to do that anymore um super handy i
suppose the next thing they talked about
is Game Center Oh to back up the pc free
now be able to get your software updates
over the air so yeah
hey just be on Wi-Fi them Game Center 50
million Game Center users in just nine
months they gave a bit of a dig at Xbox
Live saying it took Microsoft they have
only 30 million users and it took them
five years so 20 million extra in a much
much less time theirs is the big one now
I think a big one something called I
message if you've ever used BBM or
blackberry messenger is it's called
that's one of the big selling points
behind a blackberry it's got its
separate SMS or mms protocols built in
there now Apple's got an iMessage system
built right in so you're gonna be able
to send text pics and videos it's going
to work on all iOS devices you're going
to get delivery receipts you know when
people saw it or not you can see if
they're typing in real time so it'll say
typing you're also getting get of course
the new push notification system and a
work cross devices so you can start
typing something on your iPhone switch
on over to your iPad it'll work on Wi-Fi
or 3G if you've ever used BBM that's one
of the things you have to really use to
appreciate how it works when I first
thought of them liquids difference
between just sending a text really handy
thing to have so this is one of the
things that I am actually really really
excited about another cool new feature
is airplay mirroring so we actually can
now mirror your iPad right on your TV
with an apple TV plugged in so not just
sort of pushing the video content
actually mirror the actual iOS right on
your Apple TV before you had a haven't
plugged in with the hdmi cord which will
still work you don't need an apple TV if
you're going to take that route but if
you do have one now you can show all of
your stuff so probably good thing for
teachers need to be handy you also be
able to sync with itunes over Wi-Fi kind
of handy i keep saying that kind of
handy candy and that'll be coming in the
fall to the iphone 3gs ipad ipad 2 in
the third and fourth generation ipod
touches all right now let's jump into
iCloud there's so much to cover about
apple announces iCloud here it is on
TechnoBuffalo and there's a lot to talk
about here in iCloud first it's going to
store all of your content in the cloud
and automatically
upload it to all of your shared devices
it's going to happen automatically it'll
do it with your contacts or calendar
they're going to be no ads and even best
and better it's going to be free icloud
will not cost you a cent it's all the
stuff that you got with mobileme
including the storage you are now going
to be getting for free it's going to do
backups of your device over Wi-Fi kind
of neat there's also going to be I cloud
syncing of pages and keynote and numbers
so if you start document you can edit it
not that fancy something called
photostream so ipad apple TV iphone and
ipod touch will be able to sort of
stream all your photos will be kept in
the cloud for 30 days unless you put in
an album which case will be stored there
for much longer the next big thing is
itunes in the cloud purchase a song on
one device you can download no
additional charge to any other device so
if you think about that if you bought a
song on your iPad you can actually
download that same song for free right
to your desktop or your iPhone or iPod
Touch a handy I suppose there'll be a
new purchase tab and itunes on your
device mobile devices so you can see
what you've bought in the past and you
can read download it again i'll do that
all automatically it'll be in high
quality 256 kilobytes AAC all drm frayed
and i'll do that for up to 10 devices
you're going to get 5 gigabytes of male
storage I cloud is launching to
developers beta today it'll be shipping
with iOS 5 this fall we also now have
itunes in the cloud i talked about
that'll be iOS 4.3 beta available today
as well and the big one more thing that
we've been hearing about for quite a
while is something new called iTunes
Match and what itunes match is first is
going to cost you twenty-five dollars a
year it's pretty much what everybody
been expecting it's going to take all of
your music that you've got on your
computer it'll match it up against
iTunes big library in the sky and
automatically take that music and upload
it to the cloud so you can download it
to any of your devices for free it's
going to do that in that same Twitter 56
kilobytes per second high quality AAC so
if you've got a lower quality version
it'll automatically up convert it for
you and also be done
it's supposedly so go through your whole
library give you the ability download
the songs in just minutes i'll be
twenty-five dollars regardless of how
many songs you have so if you have two
songs or 20 million songs or ever number
of songs itunes has if you have every
one of them has been bought supposedly
legally through itunes you go to get all
of those right there and that was the
gist of it that was more paid as a note
so a lot of stuff happens there's a lot
of things to go through be sure to check
out TechnoBuffalo for all the news also
