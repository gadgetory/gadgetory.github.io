from TechnoBuffalo and I want to
congratulate all my fellow smartphone
geeks out there today is a big day for
both you and I today Google is making
their official release for Android and
also known as Android nougat here's what
you can expect for release times what
devices and features are going to be
coming as part of Android 7.0 it's going
to be coming to devices like the nexus
6p Nexus 5x Nexus 6 Nexus 9 Nexus player
and pixel C devices as well as Android
one devices there's over 250 new
features however let's take a look a
couple of the biggest and most important
ones first you have expanded emojis
there's over 1500 emojis built in the
Android with 72 new ones this time
around so more emojis means more awesome
I'm pretty happy about that
next they've modified quick settings
control very slightly giving you some
more customization options multitasking
has also been taken to the next level
now you can run two apps simultaneously
in two different windows windows can
also be resized so this all just kind of
adds to productivity and versatility
we're also gonna be seeing direct reply
come to other apps now outside of
Google's first party app so you can
respond to notification without ever
having to open up the app so it's a very
welcome feature quick switch is gonna
allow you to switch between your two
most recently used apps so it should be
saving a lot of time in your day-to-day
used to do Griffin we're also going to
be seeing more improvements to those to
just save you more battery life
throughout your day next we're going to
be seeing Vulcan which is their 3d
rendering API which would help games
look better and more awesome as well as
daydream with Google talked about at i/o
earlier this year it's going to be
coming however later this year and if
their VR platform and for our last three
we have seamless updates which is gonna
allow you to get updates in the
background so you won't have to do
dedicated install file based encryption
which would help you better protect your
files which is just more security and
direct boot which will help you boot up
your device much faster minor
improvements for things that worked a
little slower in previous generations
and so that's it for this video guys let
me know what you think in the comments
down below what features are you stoked
about if any for Android and when are
you gonna be switching very curious to
hear give us a thumbs up if you like
this video subscribe for more tech
coverage and content and I'll see you
