Buffalo show i'm i'm here to host for
this week Shaun ani editor-in-chief of
the site and i'm joined by deputy
managing editor Todd Hazleton everybody
are you doing today Todd I'm good it
looks like you and I are gonna be kind
of busy here in two weeks yeah we have
let's see we will this morning we just
found about motor found out about
Motorola's events on was 28th yeah 28 at
9am in New York City and that follows
the 1+1 event that's going to be live
like via virtual reality on the night of
the 27th about ten PM eastern I think
and then the 29th is the windows 10
release date so that's big day so all
kinds of stuff oh I didn't realize that
one was at night that's fun yeah yeah
it's gonna be late so oh joy a a little
bit of personal business real quick
since we've talked about this device so
many times on the show but I am for
those of you listening at home i am now
holding up my ipod classic r.i.p it has
gone to ipod heaven it was a very sad
day when I realized this it no longer
will charge that's the problem I'd I
tried multiple cables multiple chargers
and nothing so it's time to break out
the back up he's even back up classic
right yeah so I have a backup classic
because I knew this day was going to
happen someday but yes on the topic we
talked about the year the ipod yeah I
that it kind of came out of the blue but
not entirely but as I noticed one person
on Twitter say yo just think back just
only a few years ago the ipods deserve
their own event yeah and now it's like
oh we have new colors I mean the ipod
touch got a pretty big update right it
means get the a processor has the 8
megapixel camera now iOS 8.4 obviously
with apple music and the key thing to
keep in mind too is like the shuffle and
nano those over on I
OSU don't get apple music there yeah
scriptures kind of interesting you know
if I was buying an ipod right now I
would definitely go with the one with
that music I mean or the one with iOS
just in general because you can get
spotify too if you wanted or whatever
you want ya know it's it's very odd that
the ipods yeah and the fight thing is yo
apple keeps going all yo sales are down
sales really they're still selling
millions of these things right yeah yeah
i just i always find that funny way oh
you know you hear aimless oh the ipod
sales are down and all that they only
sold nine million last quarter yeah and
it seems like to be excuse me I mean
they didn't upgrade it since what like
October 2012 something exactly like that
the ipod touch so to me they probably
have this inventory of the AAA
processors the camera modules and stuff
like that you know just sitting in there
so they can use them put them in these
he's order by and I'm cheaper now
because it's now a year old EA in fact
the news this morning was at the a9
processor is now production with the
TSMC and Samsung Samsung this year's its
back sorry for the quick tangent but
last year didn't build the AAA that was
just TSMC so that's kind of interesting
but um but yeah so they probably have
all these chips sitting around they're
like oh we should probably update the
ipods announced on cost as much yeah
that's my yeah exactly yeah it was
interesting when you and i were trying
to come up with topics for this week's
episode we were like there's not much
going on all of a sudden boom boom boom
we haven't even gotten to the topics
that we said we were great yeah but uh
heading over into that direction so yes
last week we were off because i was out
in irvine where my ipod went to the
great ipod to heaven in the sky but of
course while i was out there was san
diego comic-con which you know john and
i went down on thursday and then i went
down by myself on saturday and it it was
interesting this year it was for those
that don't know i used to go to
comic-con back in the 90s when I worked
in the comic book industry and I went
from 92 to 96 I returned for the first
last year or so this is my second time
in the new era of comic-con and it's not
what it was for sure it's farm why is it
considered the new era well no problem I
and that's my terminology i would say
it's the new era because comic book
dealers are relegated to one little area
there's maybe 20 of them and that's it
mm-hmm and then you have all these
giants to do booze you have the video
gaming booths you have the booths and
you can literally count the number of
comic dealers you know compared to when
I went in the 90s you know it was comic
dealer upon comic dealer and you could
go through you know all these boxes this
year was the first year i've ever gone
that i had just a list of five books i
was looking for i only found two of them
in the years past if I took a list of
comics I would find multiple copies of
every single one and can have my choice
and play dealers against one another Wow
yeah I and one of the books was only 15
years old the this should have been a
book that there were copies everywhere
not a one that's interesting yeah I
didn't know you could go there and buy
comics too I mean I guess I know the
dealers could but I didn't know that
like a fan could go in there and say hey
I want this oh yeah yeah yeah but that's
always been the main point of this ah
yes Andy it's not so much like a CEO
like the way I have always thought of it
as sort of like a CEO showing what's
coming and you know if you got to see
yes you can't just go to a booth and
bison right right no funky kid that's
kind and it used to be back in the 90s
there actually were two parts of
comic-con there was a retailer only days
for the first two days and then you have
the four days for the public so was a
trade show at one point combined with
the comic-con and and now the trade show
part is gone and it's just the strict
you know for the general populace to
come in and see what's happening but
yeah over the past several years it's
turned into mainly you know hey let's
promote
all these movies that are coming out and
all of our new TV shows and all that
stuff and it's just it's kind of sad to
see that's God so far i mean the
original comic con was hosted in the
basement of a hotel oh wow it's grown a
little bit for as long as I've been
going it's been in the San Diego
Convention Center and San Diego is
actually in danger of losing the show
right now because they keep refusing to
expand the convention center it's now
spilled out into all the surrounding
streets going down side streets and
tests other pixels yeah it's it's nuts
it's taken over the entire gaslamp
district as it's known in that area but
uh yeah it's it's sad to see it change
but you know I guess that's just part of
how the industry is going and actually
such mb hall here asks you know hey sean
how do you feel about sdcc and other
kind of convention is becoming more
about comic book movies rather than the
comic books as compared to years past
and I understand that's where the money
is right now for all these companies
because these movies have taken off like
crazy and just as a lifelong comic book
fan i would like to still see this
source material be respected right yeah
i mean now it's sort of like it's it's
more like what like the the future of
comics like what comics have become con
it's not so much about the books about
its exactly anyway exactly the the glory
days of yo going through quarter boxes
and finding you know rare gems and you
know dealers having you know every
dealer the room having a copy of the
book you wanted i had a friend once that
sent me with a list of like 80 books and
she's like I don't know how many of
these you'll find I came back with all
80 books why did she was like I have no
idea how long it's going to take me to
repay you for this because that was
something neither of us had considered
that I would find every single book at
reasonable prices but that was
definitely not the way
things are anymore and it's just you
know it's kind of sad and it's another
thing that's really turned into is all
the companies making exclusive products
for the show and there are hundreds of
different you know products you can only
get at comic-con be it your repainted
figure or you know some other little
change oh really and yeah well and this
is where it gets nuts this is where a
lot of people started to call it line
con and the reason being is that so you
always hear about you like the Suicide
Squad panel or the game of thrones panel
those are all held in a room called Hall
age right hello it holds 6502 7,000
people I keep hearing different number
most people line up the night before to
get in till haulage now let's say you
want to get an exclusive item from
Hasbro who makes all like the Star Wars
toys transformers and all that you have
to go upstairs stand in a line to get a
wristband that wristband will then allow
you to go stand in the line downstairs
to actually buy your product Wow so we
have apple fans basic you can spend your
entire con just standing in lines and
three yeah it's nuts I just I there's
gotta be a better way to do this because
I know if I was going out there looking
for the exclusive toys and all that I
mean hey i just spent all this money on
a flight and a hotel i'm just gonna
stand here in a line all day yeah to
spend more money yeah it's pretty wild
yeah it's nuts it's absolutely nuts but
i'll still be back next year I can't
help myself but it and now it is
partially work because we do go talk to
the movie studios and all that stuff
about I think you like coverage that
we're going to do and I did make a lot
of new context this year so and we get
one work be done to you right yeah we
saw the HTC vive again which is cool
yeah that I first saw him immoral
Congress and I guess they they develop
the controllers more so they're finally
wireless
when I was in World Congress they were
all wired and I'm like no tangling
myself there was a good a lot better
experience funny story about that before
we I didn't actually go over the HTC
building the John Ralph and Brandon did
but John Ralph and I had gone to a pizza
parlor to just grab some quick lunch and
bran was coming over to meet as well I
was just down the street from HTC well
they had a guy out on the street corner
promoting the m9 and so he was asking
people as they walk by oh hey have you
heard about the HTC m9 what do you know
about they asked brandon this hahahahaha
and you did rm9 review for everybody it
doesn't know that yeah it so he he what
you know he walked by the guy and the
guy goes hey you know what phone do you
use you know have you heard about the
HTC m9 and Brandon goes I know
absolutely everything there is to know
about the HTC m9 really he starts
quizzing Brandon on the specs and the
guy finally goes alright I guess you
could probably teach that guy about the
m9 more than likely it that's pretty
crazy I read I to the guys credit Abby
how could he possibly know that Brandon
would know absolutely everything there
was to know about the m9 true well these
days I mean it's it's almost like it
geek culture right i mean like yeah
all-encompassing in some ways i mean if
you read TechnoBuffalo you get the comic
music 9news sorry about that sorry
they're coming for you Todd yeah they
finally found the dead body uh I tried
to help you guys better you have a sheet
that's I know we moved the body well
moving on to other topics of the week I
do see we have a lot of questions about
San Diego will get to those during the
Q&amp;amp;A section but moving on to the other
topic of the week what is going on with
every company under the Sun deciding
they want to get into the phone market
yeah we were talking about that earlier
this week because whoa first ZTE the
Saxon right
right I believe accent accent not access
ok essen was a was announced this week
and they had promoted it with ads I
think they were even on our site or you
know like all over the place just
calling it like the acts and brands like
kind of moving away from CTE although
now it's official energy to you but it's
it's this flagship model right just like
1 plus did with the one plus one for a
low-cost relatively low cost compared to
you know off-contract galaxy s6 or
something like that so that but that was
like one sort of reprinting that brought
us thinking like what else is going on
here I mean we've seen just this week
Commodore do somebody's going to use the
Commodore brand / a phone right same
idea I think of not 450 bucks or under
that obviously the one plus two is
coming we've seen the alcatel Idol idol
3 the one touch idol 3 I mean so all
these companies and it seems like
they're following the one plus model
maybe because I mean that seems to be
relatively successful every place for
talking about it if you can't or you
don't want a flagship you short sort of
go that way but it's also the whole way
the industry of shifting and you see
motorola doing it with the Moto G sort
of in that mid range moto X high-end not
really that cheap of a phone when it's
new we can get it on sale but i think
it's sort of just this whole industry
moving towards you know it used to be
kind of common just in Europe where you
buy the phone off contract and here in
the States it was always like a two-year
thing you know so I think it's just the
signs of those a sign of the times
changing but whether or not these you
know Commodore phones work because
you're just licensing that brand I don't
know I mean we know nokia is coming back
to in 2016 but it sounds like Foxconn is
going to use that bread well we've got a
question here from such a mahal how do
you guys feel about the commodore pet
smart phone hey i find that hilarious
that you know the Commodore trademark
has been brandied about I mean it's
bounced from I don't know how many
different companies right and now it's
going to be going into smartphones it's
just like how many people even remember
the Commodore a brand name at this point
that's what
I was gonna sit like it wasn't I don't
think it was my age group I mean might
have been just people slightly older
than me but my first system for example
was nes so it would be skewing older and
I don't know you know like how big is
that market yeah for like fans of
unlocked phones and stuff yeah I don't
know that that was just that was such an
odd choice for me and you know I I'm
sure they're thinking oh well lovers of
the Commodore will come over and buy
this smartphone no I don't think so yes
the Commodore 64 and I know we have a
question about this to the Commodore 64
was my first computer Rio I have no
desire to go well I'm going to be brand
loyal after this many years by covered
or her phone right right yeah and then
what I mean sky comes pre-loaded with
two emulators to right that's what I was
confused about I don't know yeah I read
that as well I'm just like what yeah i
mean the Commodore was known for gaming
as well but what I don't know it's very
odd I don't know it's sort of both right
yeah yeah I just uh it's i don't know
but i joined i'll continue I do too i
mean because I companies like 1 plus
have shown that you can have success
without being a major brand name right
and but one plus one about in a very
very smart way I mean they they created
their own demand right exactly yo and
they're doing a great job with you know
the oneplus 2 i'm making sure that yo
it's out there in the media all the time
mm-hmm you know but these other
companies it just feels like they go
here have a phone somebody buy it right
exactly and I think that's where we're
gonna see the difference between brands
it's sort of last and stick around in
the market first as those who don't I
mean like this Commodore I don't think
we're gonna see a you know Commodore pet
to or something like that I mean maybe
we will but i don't think so i think it
has to be played right and then in the
same respect that that Motorola's been
doing i think they do a good job i mean
their distinguishing their phones with
you know color choices and stuff through
moto maker and the rumor is that the
Moto G will have at this time which is
really cool I mean if you can get all
the different colors and stuff in the
past
just sort of been about the cases you
could buy for it but yeah I think you
have to you have to do something
different while also offering a low-cost
handset I think that's that's why these
I mean no Commodore sure I mean it's
different but it's also more just like
the brand ya know I I don't know I I
think you're right though I think for a
phone to succeed there's gotta be
something different about it and one
plus had that you know being based on
signage in mod and so many of these
others though they just think oh well
everyone else is doing we can release an
android phone and just to be clear I'm
not yes I know BlackBerry's going to be
releasing an android phone that that's a
very different situation than just some
random company you know releasing a
android phone right you know because
blackberry does have a brand name
recognition even if it isn't what it
once was but I don't know it's it's a
very odd time in the market and i right
why i always celebrate competition i'm
just not sure what these companies were
thinking right yeah just like where's
the demand for it i mean it reminds me
of that wasn't there an ESPN phone like
verizon sold once i think I don't even
know if it was on verizon but you know
it was like back in the days of the flip
phones we could get like ESPN clips on
it stuff it's just like what the heck is
this you know so they have to do it
right otherwise it's just gonna flop
yeah yeah I all know it it's going to be
interesting to see how this all shakes
out I mean I don't think any of these
companies are going to become the next
samsung but the other thing is I'm not
sure that a lot of these companies are
competing for the US market I think a
lot of them all think that they're going
to go into China where you know there
aren't these strangle holds quite like
what we see over here right but I think
there's even gotta be a point where the
Chinese market goes you know we got
enough phones yeah exactly huh yeah and
then you have to remember that every
major company
you know Samsung and Apple and then
everybody else are are trying to get
that market share you know no matter
what so you're competing against people
with huge pockets ooh it's rough I don't
know it's gonna be interesting me has
shown that it's possible it's with
low-cost phones every time someone says
show me I'm just like wait who oh yeah
Zomi know I know I know I'm in the wrong
ah but I don't care anymore I'm told
well moving on to questions and we have
a ton of them here from brazen Franco i
wish i had bought a Commodore x64 when
they decided to raise the design of the
original Commodore that was one of those
things i wish i had bought two just for
the nostalgia factor I've still got my
Commodore 64 somewhere I just I refuse
to throw it out because it was just too
much fun um okay from saw ho raja what
are the predictions of the for the Moto
360 to it will tell time it'll be based
on Android wear yeah I I really I had
taught of you got any predict no I don't
know how much I mean I hope they get rid
of that you know the little black bar at
the bottom of the screen that was on the
Moto 360 maybe a higher res screen stuff
like that I mean there's got to be
improvements right maybe it's in your
body but I'm not really sure what to
expect but maybe you will learn more
during this event on the twenty-eighth
means Motorola's event they could they
could easily just announced the phones
and that or it could just be you know
like one phone like a moto x are just a
moto G your honor so it's all gonna be a
surprise yeah I so we were fairly sure
it's gonna be the Moto G in the Moto X
how long has it been since the 360 now
it's been a year right yeah yeah then i
would say we're probably gonna get the
360 to there yeah and not the only
thought that I had is like maybe google
has some kind of other event were they I
mean probably not but where they sort of
introduce all them like a bunch of new
models but doesn't seem like it's going
that way right because you see samsung's
new
smartwatch I forget what it's called off
the top of my head but that's probably
coming at etha it sounds like unless
they actually do announce it with the
note 5 at the river August twelfth date
but that's not android wear that's Tizen
so who else do you have on the horizon
you know we could have a son watch two
from a sous again that they're also
rumored to be working on one that's not
android wear so maybe motorola will just
put it all in one of them it would make
sense to me yeah but I don't know it's
gonna be interesting and boy if we got a
lot of things to cover right get in your
busy day yeah it's gonna be a very busy
week I always loved how they all the
stuff in the same week yep they get
stacked yeah I don't know there's 365
days in the year folks 52 weeks yeah
yeah 12 months you can spread them out a
little bit more but no no let's all jump
around top of each other yeah uh from
such Mahal how was your guys Prime day
find any good deals I found lots of
great deals didn't mean i could buy them
yeah right Sean and I were both talking
back and forth all the tables were going
and we noticed as they were coming
online like if you click on the bottom
it showed like you know going live in
six minutes seven minutes ago a long
time line there if you clicked it a lot
of them said like two left in stock
right and then it would magically just
changed you in stock and then oh gee
willikers it sold out in seconds yeah so
that wasn't cool that was not cool at
all i gotta say though i'm happy that
they didn't discount the new kindle
paperwhite because i just bought that
and i'm not returning it i'm really
liking it but that would have been upset
it just came out yeah I the other
Christian I they did discount a lot of
Kendall products I mean the fire TV sold
out and hardly any time at all you know
at least the number that they had
planned to sell it didn't completely
sell out but
it's a it was an interesting day and I
think that a lot of lessons were learned
on both the consumer and Amazon side as
to uh if Amazon promises great sales
don't expect them to have enough stock
yeah I mean that was the one thing it's
like they said you know more sales in
Black Friday and I get it like if you go
to walmart on Black Friday you're not
going to get all the TVs you know like
they're gonna that's why people are
running over each other to get a but
like you're a huge online retailer how
can you have two units in stock like
it's in the local store where they're
like spreading the ins across the entire
country i I did purchase and actually it
arrived just before the show I they had
a deal going where if you bought a
amazon gift cards you got ten dollars
credit in your account you know thinking
hey you're going to send those to
somebody yeah I said myself that's
awesome you know I bought the cheapest
pack I could which was $45 and got ten
dollars credit so I turned forty five
dollars into 50 50 I'll do that all day
long but it seriously oh good gravy uh
from D Norbert's we have so much
competing parent phones but battery tech
didn't advance so much what do you think
about the predictions and near future ah
man I agree with you there battery life
is the biggest problem in phones right
now yeah I feel like we're you know all
these companies you're saying like
powerful processor but better at you
know power management and you no longer
battery life but then you toss on a quad
HD display that's also supposed to be
you know better at power management but
I mean all these things consume a lot of
power and so you get phones like the
galaxy s6 which is a fantastic device
that has a terrible battery but they add
in you know Qi wireless charging in PMA
and they add in the quick charge and so
you know that the thought is at least
Samsung's thought this time around seems
to have been well at least the charges
quickly or or conveniently if you know
because why
charging still isn't very quick but it's
something that bothers me still like I
hate taking a phone and thinking oh this
is going to be dead in a couple hours
and I'm not going to be near an outlet
or what am I going to do and you know so
in the past you look towards devices
like the note right so I'm excited for
the note 5 and I hope that that's it you
know something they put a real focus on
battery life and and you were just
saying you're using the droid turbo now
device it's sort of what advertise the
last two days on a charge and I hope a
new one of those is coming because it
sounds like I mean we've seen the leaks
Moto X moto G droid mini and some kind
of other droid which would go to verizon
links with the droid branding so maybe
you know there's more funds like that
where they're putting the focus on
larger batteries but that seems to be
the solution right now right just larger
batteries and I don't think I mean we
need to do something else and you know
the people are talking about what like
graphene and all these other kinds of
technologies but I don't think I'm gonna
see them I think you know and honestly I
understand that you know the companies
want to keep coming up with iteration so
it looks like they're advancing any oh
they can keep releasing new phones and
keep getting all that sweet release
money but at some point somebody's gonna
have to go okay you know what folks
we're gonna sit back for just a little
bit and work on the battery yeah or like
make the device kind of a little thicker
right like my iPhone's thin enough just
make it a little fatter I don't care
yeah just not too fat cuz like when you
put a mophie on the seat I mean the six
bus it gets huge yeah I yeah John John
had his phone in the battery case under
the way down the comic-con and it took
both of us KITT own half of oh yeah that
was good times but haha yeah I just I
don't know I just I keep hoping yeah I
mean I know all these companies like
Samsung and LG in the universe I mean
every now and then you read about your
university has discovered a way to you
know create some odd day battery life or
year long battery life but then this
isn't something
see tomorrow yeah yeah exactly uh moving
on down the line here uh well I actually
re and through this sentiment he such a
was asking if I had a Commodore 64 or me
guess I had a 64 I want to say I first
got it in 82 I think I think yeah I was
11 so yeah 82 and then I graduated to a
real pc in 86 from sahaja what do you
think about mb mkbhd I never can say his
initials correctly mkbhd getting the 1+2
first somebody had to get it first yeah
that's kind of how it goes i think mmm
you know i don't know if it's it's about
hitting getting your first scherb that's
cool but it's smart on the one plus side
right like give it to to somebody to
sort of tease in this case you tease the
camera you know it's it's like we've
talked about it's good marketing for one
plus they kind of just are teasing each
little feature as we go along leading up
to the 27th so yeah but not we're
friends with mkbhd a bright guy yo good
for him throw not a problem uh moving on
down the line now that being said of
course we will like to have at 12 works
uh from Robert Payton where the fact is
Joey he's the best joey is RAM joey is
as we described before the problem for
joey is that when he reviews a game it
he can't do anything but review the game
because he has to look at the television
screen but we're trying to work it out
so maybe he'll be on like once a month
so we do want Joey around Joey will be
back and got any time I don't have to
work with Todd let me to uh oh I'm sorry
Todd I I didn't know me I'm brazen
Franco technic Buffalo only needs
hardcore tech top its top topics I could
say this word reviews SSD motherboards
DAC Dax amps to fill the void in for me
you know that that's I used to do that
kind of stuff yeah it's it's not that we
don't want to it's a matter of time
we're already in so many directions with
only so many people yeah and you know
when you do it you guys do it right and
you gotta it's a lot of testing um I
think I've talked about before but I was
an intern at maximum pc back in my day
so we did this stuff and we would review
you know water coolers too which is
really fun I love all this that but um
you know in your benchmarking I think
sites like a non-tech do it better and
we'd have to you know hire a whole team
like that and in some cases get
engineered level knowledge on this kind
of stuff and you know stop so yeah it's
not to say that we won't do it someday
but it's just it's not on the the
drawing board at this very moment right
but you never know things change uh
moving on down the line from such and
Bohol hey sean how would you describe
san diego comic-con for those who have
never been and should they go why are
why not I very kind of described it as
for if you should go it totally depends
on what you're looking for you know if
you wanna go stand in lines and get to
know the people and friend behind you
you know for several hours great I think
it totally depends on what you're you're
looking to do I mean if you're into pop
culture it's kind of like the epicenter
the pop culture year I do want bringing
this up for a second so you know there
were all these trailers shown at Comic
Con and Warner Brothers in particular
lost their minds when people leaked out
what was shown on screen okay you're in
a room was 6502 7,000 people in the year
twenty thousand fifteen yet don't think
one's gonna whip out a phone and record
and yes i know that you they stay out
he'll please do put away all recording
devices 6500 geeks in a room somebody's
going to do it yeah ed warner brothers
especially on the Suicide Squad trailer
they were hunting every copy of that
thing down and finally after 48 hours
they went okay we'll let you have it and
they really sit themselves right yeah
which I there's a part of me that goes
was this all planned ah you know it was
this a way to get a whole lot of a media
attention you know but somebody they
released this big long thing about you
know our trust was violated and we don't
know for a show footage in the future
and all this and they took that tweet
and couldn't put it next to the marble
tweet from when the Avengers age of
Ultron trailer leaked which all it said
was dammit Hydra yeah right i remember
that and like come on these are your
biggest fans like people are excited how
can you get you know all upset about I
get it it's a million hundred million
dollar business but yeah I I I just
didn't understand that at all but you
know hey we're all excited for your
movie let us are ya oh oh no we're
excited for your film the horrors from D
Norbert what do you think about the wp
10 the market share is no more than ten
percent max android and iOS is
dominating the market we don't have any
useful apps for WP or any new app is
coming first for iOS and Android or
never what are your expectations for WP
10 definitely more nom yeah so really
what Microsoft strategy is moving
forward some speed over you Microsoft
strategy moving forward is allowing
developers to create their apps that run
on Windows 10 laptops and PCs on tablets
and then on phones and so you can scale
these apps like when you're using
Windows 10 i have it on the netbook but
the Photos app for example you can scale
it down you like drag your cursor and
make it a small window and it looks
exactly how it would you know say you
make it a 4-inch window that's how it
would look on a on a screen a 4-inch
screen on a phone and you pull it out
and it like grows and you get more data
and stuff and so that's their strategy
they think you know Instagram is going
to create this you know app that runs on
Windows 10 pcs for example maybe
instagrams a bad thing but say it's
something like Evernote right so
Evernote creates this app that runs on
Windows 10 pcs and then also because
it's already developed it it's the same
code it'll run just in a smaller window
on Windows 10 phones so that's the whole
strategy and they are using that
strategy in other words using Windows 10
to push apps into mobile because it's
the same code so we'll see if it happens
because you also have to you know like
out my poor example Instagram which
doesn't have a desktop app I mean it has
a web browser but it doesn't have a
desktop out like why are they going to
build a Windows 10 app well Microsoft's
answer to that question would be there
are 1.5 billion Windows users out there
and so if they move to Windows 10 then
Instagram is probably going to want to
cater those 1.5 billion users may be and
then create that app that will also run
on the phone so it's kind of a
convoluted fishing answer and it's it's
complicated but I think the strategy is
better than what Microsoft has tried in
the past where they just had windows
phone and you had to get developers on
board to create apps for Windows Phone
in this case you're creating apps for
Windows 10 that will run on Windows 10
for phones so hopefully it works I I'm
hoping this this formula does work I I
think it only benefits the market if
there's another player hmm but you know
the apps have been the big downfall and
talk about chicken in the egg situation
you know the you know people won't come
if there are no apps developers won't
come
no people but now with this unified
system the people are at least there
yeah because your app will run on you
know understand but it but the problem
has been mobile apps yeah so you know I
don't know I know I I for instance
whenever I travel there's an app I use a
lot called gasbuddy which helps you find
the cheapest gas in the area around you
and so that's a very mobile specific app
a lot of the apps I use are very mobile
specific exactly so I think that's going
to be still a problem for windows
because you know if somebody and just
using guess but he is a type of example
but let's say somebody wants to build a
gas locator app they're not going to
care about the desktop because they know
it's never going to be used there right
you know so i think that's that's the
problem they're going they're going to
have to find apps that appeal to both
mobile and desktop users exactly that's
what yeah that's what i was saying with
you know instagram for example because
like what do they needed us talk about
probably not because you just use a web
browser it's so will they build the
windows 10 app my guess is you know
probably not i don't know maybe they
will I mean they have the beta for
windows phone but that's been in beta
for like two years yeah so but I'm
excited look I mean if you if you see
these Intel Atom powered tablets that
can run full versions of Windows 10 it's
really cool and so you think that you
know Adam is also in phones like can we
get a full desktop experience there I
mean continuum is leading the way with
that where you know you plug the phone
into a TV or something and you get a
full screen version of that app like I
said it just scales it's like you know
it's like our site when you move it
depending on the the screen size it'll
just scale to it so yeah it's neat it's
definitely cool and I'm excited to see
what they do but the new Windows 10 for
phones stuff isn't expected until this
fall so first we got to get to the
Windows 10 launch exactly
from brazen Frankel what will push Deb's
to create apps for Windows 10 and
publish it on the MS marketplace
compared to what they do now where to
set their own website or really on
sourceforge github etc I wasn't aware
they're doing this that could be a lot
of the reason right there why they don't
have users to be very blunt the walk
into McDonald's walk around the the
dining area and ask every person you see
so what have you downloaded from github
lately and most of them will look at you
can go get what a shame with sourceforge
in yes that's great for folks like us a
on those folks that are watching or
listening to the show but your average
person anther has no concept what those
are yeah well that's why they're doing
this the new Windows Store is unified
store so I mean it's just kind of like
the App Store on Mac yeah the idea
exactly exactly it still exists they
have it in windows 8 too but I don't
know if anybody uses it I don't yeah
yeah yeah me either well that is going
