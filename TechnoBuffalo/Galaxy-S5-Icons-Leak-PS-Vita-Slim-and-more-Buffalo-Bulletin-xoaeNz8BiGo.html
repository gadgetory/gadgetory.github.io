buffalo bulletin time hello internet and
welcome to the buffalo bulletin where we
recap stories from our site

friday if you're interested in reading

samsung announced their unpacked event
early last week and today they posted a
teaser image for the event giving us
some hints as to what we can expect on
the twenty-fourth of this month a
three-by-three grid of flat colorful
icons with labels like speed fun and
style is placed next to an unpacked logo
with a to the fifth power on it of
course we're assuming this all points to
the Samsung Galaxy s5 which will lightly
be revealed at the event in Barcelona
but they may also point to a new look
and feel for TouchWiz specifically and
new features we've not yet seen before I
guess we'll have to see in less than two
weeks sprint posted their fourth quarter
2013 earnings report today with a mix of
good and bad news they noted a net loss
of 1 billion dollars during the quarter
but it's actually an improvement over
the 1.3 billion they lost during the
same quarter a year ago their wireless
revenue increased for the 15th
consecutive quarter which is good and
sprint also said it now has a record
number of customers with 50 3.9 million
subscribers at the end of 2013 we'll
have to wait and see if t-mobile's
uncarrier plan puts a dent in those
numbers but for now Sprint's trucking
along over in gaming now that Satya
Nadella has assumed the CEO position at
microsoft the Washington Post is
reporting that a pair of influential
shareholders believe that the future of
Microsoft is solely an enterprise and
that would mean killing off
non-essential product lines specifically
Bing the surface and the Xbox don't
freak out though because your Xbox ones
and 360s are safe as Bill Gates and
Steve Ballmer are still advising
nadella and it's unlikely a company man
like nadella would deviate so far from
what Ballmer Engates bill over the past
20-plus years also in gaming Sony made a
lot of us gamers happy after announcing
the playstation vita slim which is
currently available in japan would be
coming to the states in addition to the
new model hitting retail the PS vita
slim will be bundled with borderlands 2
and six packs of dlc this vita is
fifteen percent later and twenty percent
slimmer than the original vita has an
improved battery life and exchanges the
original vitas oled screen with a five
inch LCD touchscreen there's no release
date set yet for the vita but the
borderlands 2 bundle will cost you 100
99 bucks when it hits retail lastly our
wild card story for today is kind of
unusual north Korea has a homegrown
operating system they call red star OS a
few years ago version 2 of that
operating system looked an awful lot
like Windows 7 now though we're being
traded to new screenshots of version 3
and it's obvious they've taken some cues
this time around from Apple in fact it's
pretty much a carbon copy of OS 10 save
for the red star replacing the apple
logo in the upper left hand corner then
again North Korea is suspected of
creating super dollars or ultra
high-quality counterfeit one hundred
dollar bills so I guess this is kind of
par for the course unless the buffalo
