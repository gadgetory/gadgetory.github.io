TechnoBuffalo here that unboxing to the
sequel of one of my favorite Verizon
phones this is the droid turbo 2 it's
back at the same tricks the original
Droid turbo hat it's a pretty beastly
battery of 37 60 milliamp hours 5.4 inch
qHD screen 3 gigs of ram a pretty
impressive 21 at megapixel camera I mean
powered by the Snapdragon 810 what's new
here though is something that motor roll
is calling shatter shield technology
think that out the Box essentially is
going to make the screen close to shadow
proof it's made up of five separate
layers including a flexible AMOLED panel
anyway here's the box port old Verizon
logo well I know a little check mark
there Verizon the box for the Droid
turbo to go ahead and open it up
eventually oh and I made it look at it
looks brand new
I thought Motorola does it got a tray
that can do micro SD card and your LT
SIM cards that's cool we got the white
model here with 32 gigs of internal
storage let's say it feels really nice I
can see the shadow shield technology
gives it a bit of an odd kind of slope
to it it's got a bit of a strange feel
in the hand they fused Motorola devices
I think it should feel pretty normal to
you so let's do a quick tour of the
device you've got you're really clear on
what care you're using here there's that
verizon logo it's just it's like
Motorola was like a Verizon we got a
great phone and Verizon is like boom
let's put a bird on it and a and a
Verizon logo but the back looks and
feels really nice it's got to the soft
touch texture to it and that same dimple
that we've seen on the new generation of
mobile devices let's go ahead and turn
that on and see what that qHD screen
actually looks like and see if the
shatter shield display is going to take
away from that picture Motorola is
backing up though they're close to
shatterproof with the warranty on its if
you do break it you can go ahead and get
it replaced so pretty familiar button
layout on the right-hand side you got a
power button then you've got your volume
rocker up and down which feels pretty
similar it's what we've seen before
still good still good
silly unboxing side if you are clumsy or
prone to dropping your phone or like me
just really
using cases this is probably gonna be a
pretty good option for you we've dropped
it several times and it looks brand new
so good job motorola we're not one to do
the torture type tests at TechnoBuffalo
we leave that other channels but when
Verizon saying shatter shield it seemed
like we'd be remiss wait I thought it
was coming didn't you figured be remiss
to not you know test it and see how it
performs still still nice to know this
pains me to do this to keep dropping
phones but like in the name of science
and in the name of phones I feel like we
should so we got some Nicks and
scratches on the aluminum but the screen
the screen which is what matters is
intact and looks great and it looks like
any other Q HD screen that we've seen
from Motorola so no real difference in
the screen quality with that chatter
shield display I was worried that maybe
the extra layer of glass and material
over it wouldn't even make a bit of a
tough screen to look at but um no pretty
pretty good job for Motorola I really
got it gotta stop doing that drop your
phone a lot it's looking pretty good
choice I'm John render from
TechnoBuffalo and I don't put excuse me
see the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
