TechnoBuffalo here with a full review of
the first PlayStation Certified phone
this is advice that had been rumored for
almost years let's go ahead take a look
and see if it's worthy of the
PlayStation name so to say Sony's had
maybe a rough few weeks with their
PlayStation name and the PSN network
getting a little bit a hat would
probably be an understatement that
doesn't take away from what the Xperia
Play promises to bring and that is
playstation gaming mobile so let me
remind you of the specs of this guy and
then we'll go ahead and run through all
the phone goodness that it has so it's
got a four inch diagonal display and
that is TFT with the resolution of 480
by 854 it's being powered by a scorpion
arm 1 gigahertz processor and we'll talk
about how the performance is in just a
minute
512 megabytes of RAM and ROM it's got an
Adreno GPU graphics accelerator it's got
a 5 megapixel camera on the back with
autofocus flash and some cool kind of
smile detection business it can shoot
video in 720p so it's 1280 by 720 it's
running Android 2.3 Gingerbread which is
kind of awesome and it's got a pretty
beefy battery here which is going to get
you through most of the day all right
so that's great there the specs let's
first talk about call quality this is a
phone and it's got to make phone calls
this is the unlocked unit which is
available to be purchased from the folks
at clove Co UK it'll work on 18 T's 3G
network if you guys are wondering
Verizon has announced they will be
carrying it in the US it'll be in
storage on the 26th available for
pre-orders on the 19th but if you are on
AT&amp;amp;T or t-mobile and you're looking to
get your hands on this guy I check out
the folks club code at UK link will be
down below gold-coated was just about
average in my 20 called test I had three
dropped calls people on the other end
definitely knew I was on a cell phone
there was some popping in the
call quality was a little bit tinny I
did have Bluetooth connectivity issues
definitely want to check this
compatibility wise with your car's
Bluetooth or your headset if that's what
you use for phone calls something
definitely to keep in mind speakerphone
was quite loud alright so let's talk
about the screen we'll jump pass all
that business how does this thing look
let me show you what some pictures look
like here this is always a good way to
show we'll go ahead and jump into
wallpapers Sony Ericsson wallpapers
let's go and take a look at a red one go
ahead and set it and you can see the
pictures look about average we've got it
set to auto brightness here it doesn't
look bad it doesn't look great I
expected a little brighter images to pop
a little bit more from Sony company
that's really known for for high quality
displays but the real test for me is how
text looks so I'll go ahead and jump
into the browser there we go you can see
on a white background there's a little
bit of a greyish blue tint something
that we saw with the first-generation
AMOLED screens out of Samsung and put
out
nothing giant but it's definitely there
text is crisp you're not gonna have any
trouble reading text on its four inch
screen there's a couple other
interesting things here to note as well
I know you guys are a lot of performance
junkies out there I did run this through
a quadrant test in appleton a pretty
respectable 1392 and this is what the
stock rom there wasn't anything flashed
on here this is just to have so many
Erik's and chips it and speaking of how
Sony Ericsson ships it their Android UI
is to call Timescape it sort of puts
everything together and a big list of
stuff I didn't like it I turned it off I
generally didn't use it but they do give
you some cool functionality nurse' meets
sony ericsson widgets here you can do
your little pinch to zoom thing you can
see all your widgets here splayed out I
wish you could have moved them around
from the screen you can't you can just
see them and jump right to them there
are some to like go and show you very
quickly what some of the sony ericsson
custom widgets are you can see some of
the standard Android ones here than some
of the other ones that Sony goes ahead
and adds for you one of the kind of cool
touches that it does give you are some
animations which I'm sure
just suck battery if I wanted to move an
icon around you can watch what it
doesn't I do it does a little bounce
it's very subtle but it really lets you
know they're using a high quality device
one of the gripes that I had about the
phone is a placement of the buttons here
on the bottom so first I like that there
are physical buttons I do wish it there
was some sort of backlight so if I was
in a dark setting the screen wasn't
providing enough brightness I could see
what the buttons are because they are in
a very strange order that I haven't
really seen on any other Android phones
got the back button home button menu
button in search button whereas if you
look on other Android phones here is say
the Droid Charge for example with the
more standard button layout you've got a
little different setup here with the
back button located down the second to
the right the menu button on the left
it's just a little bit odd I'm not
saying it's bad just wasn't what I was
used to so if you're coming from another
Android device definitely going to have
a little bit of a finger memory learning
curve that's not the big deal with the
Xperia Play what everybody wanted to see
and what I wanted to see was what lives
when you slide this up this is where the
Xperia Play gets its name it's able to
play a pretty decent amount of actually
ps1 games and that's where a lot of
these Xperia Play games come from so let
me give you a quick example of what one
of these games look like so I'll go
ahead and use the buttons that I've got
right here I've got an Android menu
button and when you're gaming also I
have two shoulder buttons that live
right there I'm going to go ahead and go
back home and I've got crash bandicoot
was a game that I was playing was
available to be downloaded and I'll show
you guys in just a minute when you
download these games they actually come
from the Android Marketplace I thought
there was going to be some sort of
custom sony skin store and just a sony
store in the Android Marketplace so you
can see what the graphics look like they
are pretty impressive but there's
nothing better than I haven't seen on
any other Android device really what the
killer thing is here is a game catalog
and the ability to play other us ps1
games which are extremely popular so
because of the size of the phone this
four-way navigation is really really
tight and close together I had a hard
time sort of moving my fingers around
I've got relatively large thumbs making
sure I didn't hit two buttons it took
some getting used to something to bear
in my off time
in a corner and hitting to the four
shape buttons a typical Stoney buttons
here the triangle the X a square in a
circle I like saying that to show I
prove that I know my shapes did work
very well I didn't have any of the same
issues with the arrows for whatever
reason and you got these two I would
feel dirty when I do this there was a
touch buttons here which are used for
some navigation sometimes you need to
control them kind of neat to see you've
got your start and select button games
work well the controls were fun
it didn't kill battery as much as I
would like I was able to get a full day
a while playing some serious games on
here but in all honesty the games that
sony gives you can be a bit expensive in
fact I'll show you what some of those
are in a minute but for me one of the
most appealing things about having a
phone like this is something like this
so assuming that you own the original
cartridges you can download a ton of
emulators for different games so I've
got a Super Nintendo emulator here
and I always go ahead and playing my
Super Mario Brothers which was kind of
awesome and you can map these
controllers for anything you want this
is what made the Xperia Play really cool
and probably wasn't what Sony was aiming
at but it really let me feel I could
take a Super Nintendo with me anywhere
on there emulators available for a ton
of consoles and of course only games
that you own genesis nintendo on really
any other console this can very easily
handle so we'll go ahead and exit out of
this let me go ahead and show you some
of the other options here for purchasing
games so you can see what that might
look like alright so as you guys might
have seen when you open this up you are
going to be taken to the PlayStation
sort of store and you can see there are
a ton of different games let's go ahead
and take a look at hockey nations 2011
this is going to open up right from
Android Marketplace you can see the
price of the games and some of the games
ranged from 11 to 12 bucks down to as
low as $0.99 this particular one here is
399 available in the sports game
category go ahead and hit download and
you can get your game on go ahead and
jump back home so what's the final
conclusion on the Xperia Play to be
honest the benefits that Sony Ericsson
is gaming out here with the PlayStation
Store and the PlayStation Certified
experience is average the game qualities
you saw on crash bandicoot was just okay
I wasn't overly impressed with with game
plan that particular game or the
controls in general what really sells
the Xperia Play for me is the built-in
gamepad for emulators really opens up a
ton of possibilities for this device so
if you do find yourself on a subway on a
train playing a lot of games and touch
only controls aren't doing it for you or
mapping buttons to your QWERTY keyboard
aren't doing it for you this is going to
be a really solid device to look at you
can take really full advantage of an
awesome gaming experience just based on
having this gamepad now certainly you
could probably do this with a Bluetooth
keyboard or a micro USB attachment if
your phone supports it what you probably
make this a bit obsolete generally on
the phone this thick I would want to
have a keyboard however I can really
live with it if you are a gamer and you
want to take your games with you I can
definitely recommend the Xperia Play
performance was solid battery life was
good
screamer's average call quality wasn't
overly impressed with but it did work a
5 to give this sort of a wone at a 5
ranking here I'd probably give it a very
solid three-and-a-half I would have
liked to have seen a little bit of
brighter screen with some crisper images
and some crisper text and I would like
to have seen a more robust PlayStation
Store on here with better quality and
selection of games the Timescape
interface was ok it wasn't overly clunky
you can obviously turn it off or
customize it because it is Android but
it was just alright anyway guys love to
hear you have to say in your thoughts on
the Sony Ericsson Xperia Play I am John
renter from TechnoBuffalo and I'll see
you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
