from TechnoBuffalo and yesterday was a
day the apple will never forget it
introduced two versions of the iPhone
six one with the 4.7 inch display and
one with a 5.5 inch screen they also
introduced Apple watch and a new mobile
payment system called Apple pay now
after the event Apple released a golden
master of iOS 8 to developers a week
before its September 17 launch and we're
here to see what it's all about probably
one of the most noticeable difference
right away in this golden master is that
the passbook icon looks completely
different now that Apple introduced
Apple pay to the world you'll now be
able to add your credit card through
passbook and if you happen to have the
new iPhone 6 + or Apple watch you'll be
able to securely pay via NFC which is
kind of a big deal to iOS users another
minor change is that the clock icon is a
bit bolder now and the second hand is
much longer than before now if we head
over to the Settings app and go to
wallpapers there are a bunch of new
still wallpapers included in iOS 8 and
to be completely honest I love every
single one of them and I think it fits
nicely with iOS 8 and matches the look
of OS 10 Yosemite other than that
there's also a tweak iCloud backup icon
and in terms of performance everything
seems to be running pretty smooth thus
far definitely a lot better than
previous version which is expected for
the GM release I haven't had any
third-party apps crashed at all after
updating either so all the issues we've
had in a previous beta seems to be
ironed out anyways that's it for this
quick video guys we're really excited
for iOS 8 to publicly launch next week
and we can't wait to try out is 8 on the
new iPhone 6 once we have it in our
office if you guys have any questions
just let us know in the comments down
below and as always a Markland Sangam
from TechnoBuffalo
