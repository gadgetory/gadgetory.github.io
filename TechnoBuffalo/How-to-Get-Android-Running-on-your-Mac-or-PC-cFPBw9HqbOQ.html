TechnoBuffalo calm there's been a lot of
hype over these upcoming android
netbooks but I'm saying why wait I'm
going to walk you through how to install
android on your Mac and your PC it's
actually much easier than you would
expect let's go ahead and get started
before we do you're going to need a few
things a blank DVD you're going to need
some sort of virtualization software if
you're using a Mac for example parallels
desktop software and a DVD Drive and
that's about it so you're going to want
to go to code google com / p / live /
android i'll put a link to this in the
sidebars no need to memorize it and
we're going to scroll down to where it
says user guide then you want to select
read me first and I'm going to want to
download an iso file so we'll scroll
down here you can download these files
individually I found it much easier to
use an ISO and you're going to want to
click this rapidshare link and this will
be in the sidebar as well if you've got
a premium account and go ahead and click
premium user otherwise just go ahead and
hit free and hit download and that'll
take depending on internet speed 10 20
30 minutes download while you're waiting
for that to download if you don't have
any sort of virtualization software to
run windows on your mac i recommend
heading over to parallels com and given
that a download leave a free trial you
can use any really virtualization
software you can use VMware parallels
whatever you want to use not going to
problem it's all going to work so next
you're gonna want to do is put in a DVD
to your computer and after you've
downloaded your ISO file you can have a
file right here that says live Android
version 02 is oh so you're going to want
to go to your Applications folder gonna
want to hit utilities scroll down to
disk utility and we're going to burn
that ISO image onto a disk because what
we're going to do is actually run
Android off of a DVD so no need to do a
boot there's no risk to your computer if
you don't like what you're doing eject
the DVD no harm no foul so we're going
to go to file open disk image
and give it just a moment it will launch
a sort of Finder window there it is so I
hit the live Android iso hit open I've
already done it so not good head open
and you'll have a live Android ISO image
right there you want to hit burn and let
your disc burn away all right now you've
got your disc burnt it's time to go
ahead and start running android so i
should also mention that in addition to
having a virtualization software that
just allows you to run windows you're
going to need a full legitimate copy of
windows XP vista or seven if you want to
see how to download windows 7 and get a
free copy to install using the
virtualization software i'll put a link
to that in the sidebar i did a tutorial
of how to get windows seven for free and
install it on your mac so you're going
to want to go ahead and fire up
parallels i've already got mine running
here and here it is windows on a mac
I've got my start menu over there if
you've never seen this before so now
what you're going to want to do since
we're going to be running this off of a
DVD is to enable the DVD Drive in
parallels so I'll go up to your top you
want hit devices CD DVD ROM one anyone
just go to default CD DVD wrong and now
it's going to let windows be able to see
your DVD Drive so now you're going to
want to pop in that DVD that we just
burn go ahead and do that right now and
I'll do this in real time so you can see
how long it will take and what it'll
look like for you go ahead and go to my
computer
and it's loading up and I'll open it up
in just a minute you can see the files
that are in there there it goes go ahead
cancel and open this up and this is just
a bunch of files and it's not going to
work what you need to do right now is
actually restart your computer and if
you're using a PC you can just follow
these steps from right here you're gonna
want to insert your the DVD and simply
just restart your computer so i'm gonna
go ahead and do that right now and
that's all you need to get android
running on your computer so let's show
you what that looks like go ahead and
hit restart restart just as any other
computer would windows is now shutting
down and I'll show you what the boot up
looks like that's actually quite
interesting so here we go so you get
this sort of scary-looking text that
comes across here but don't worry get a
live android logo there and let you know
you did something right so you get the
android boot up logo pretty cool
and that's it you are now working with
Android L it's telling you've got a
little battery but certainly that's not
the case you get a sort of a half square
or a triangle cursor who can hit ok and
I'll just show you that this is working
go ahead and hit the menu I can pull
down status icons let's go ahead and
open up messaging compose a new message
start typing let's go back and if you
want to go back a menu actually afton if
you're on a Mac you need to hit the
command key and that'll take you back to
the home screen let's open something
else i should say browser doesn't work
let me show you some of the settings and
things seem to actually be moving much
quicker now on a second boot let's go to
let's say call settings can see all your
settings right there we'll go back and
there's no easy way to really scroll
back things still work a little bit
differently go to settings again we'll
scroll down let's see what it says for
about phone there's some model numbers
and baseband information colonel stuff
go back one more time take a look at
some of the other programs that we have
here dev tools which is interesting and
things are now running pretty zippy
camera I should show you doesn't
recognize a camera obviously it keeps
asking you for an SD card but certainly
I don't have it's not recognizing my
built-in webcam on my imac let's try
calculator calculator works great you do
five plus six equals eleven as it should
this is more just a kind of a cool proof
of concept then as i mentioned before
the web doesn't quite function yet
contacts can go ahead and see as it
would just on a normal android and then
when you guys are all done using android
what you're going to want to do is eject
your disk and shut down parallel
if you're just using a regular windows
just eject your disc and restart windows
as you normally would you'll never know
yet Android there if you're using
parallels first thing you want to do is
get rid of the mouse from this window so
you want to hit alt and control to
release the mouse go ahead and do that
then you want to go to actions and you
want to go and hit stop and that will
stop the windows from running that you
can go ahead and just quit parallels go
back in your mac side and eject the disk
and next time you boot in two parallels
you will be just in your regular windows
environment and then guys hope you
