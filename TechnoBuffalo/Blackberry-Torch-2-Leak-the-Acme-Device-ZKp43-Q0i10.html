technobuffalo here and today was a very
very very busy day in the world of
technology not only did we get some
hands-on time with the not even released
yet rim blackberry torch but I also got
a haircut I'd owe me realize that I have
a Mike Tyson styled part in my hair and
that's why I feel the need to talk about
my hair in a lot of videos I'm just
happy to have it I guess okay so let me
run through all the goodness i'm gonna
highlight all the big stuff that we had
first exclusive torch to actually
running rims just announced blackberry
OS 7 which was kind of neat we're able
to get some hands-on time with this guy
courtesy of the folks at negri
electronics you can see it right there
it looks identical to the torch one
except it's got a much beefier 1.2 gig
arts processor which is almost double
the processor speed of the original it's
got a much more vibrant screen and it's
got a web browser that's a little bit
more functional so if you are a
blackberry user and you're a fan of the
original torch design but you weren't a
fan of the specs and I know there were a
lot of you this is going to be a really
good one to look forward to and we're
hearing a summer ish release for this
guy's we read a ton of images be sure to
go ahead and check them out the next
post actually we had come out earlier in
the week this one is really interesting
you may have actually heard this around
the web the Acme device this was sort of
behind the verizon iphone veil of
secrecy so certainly the verizon iphone
has been out since about februari but
what went into leading up to
announcement was very interesting we had
a source inside a verizon which were
able to verify that give us some details
on what went into the work before the
verizon iphone was announced so first it
was only referred to as the acme device
good to read the article it's really
interesting i drowned did a fantastic
job writing it up users who had the
phone and our source did have the phone
got it about to be
before they had a sign of four page n da
which is much longer than usual they to
text the pincode in every 12 hours to a
predetermined number to make sure they
still had possession of the phone if the
phone was lost certainly they wouldn't
know a text that number in and eventing
that number was a little bit variable so
it might change so that was a way to
serve protect security really
interesting story go ahead and give it a
read the Acme device and how the worst
kept secret stayed buzz-worthy everybody
knew the verizon iphone was coming
anyway so there was a lot of other
goodness let me give you some of the
highlights we'll go ahead and jump back
to the home screen microsoft looks more
money on Android and Windows Phone 7
kind of interesting Sony they didn't get
hacks today so there's other sony not
getting hacked news a lot of phones
coming out noah unbox the verizon HTC
trophy so it's a first Windows Phone 7
device for verizon he also in box the LG
revolution their third 4G LTE smartphone
so more posts about Sony talk gamers
lesson for privacy few more sony posts
Apple's iCloud whatever you want to call
their cloud music service that's
supposedly going to be down to WWDC kind
of dressing is going to be mere keep
saying that a lot pen interest kinda
interesting kinda interesting to me it's
always risk I'm just a huge nerd alright
supposedly it's going to mirror your
iTunes playlist which should be helpful
we saw a demo of minecraft mobile which
I know Joey loves minecraft if you guys
didn't see he actually made a
TechnoBuffalo logo at minecraft pretty
awesome Mike Perlman one of our newest
members asked what kind of shooter are
you and walks through and talks about
DSLR is in point and shoots really
interesting sony and samsung have a
on-again off-again relationship much
like killing and zack apple
sweet-talking samsung for an amoled ipad
