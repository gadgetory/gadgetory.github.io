technobuffalo unboxing the blackberry
torch 9850 for sprint this is the
all-touch blackberry that I have waited
for quite some time to get my hands on
it is so big to me that is bigger than
two people on a bicycle stay tuned for
my full unboxing coming up after the
break okay we're back in blackberry with
the blackberry torch 9850 this is an
exciting phone particularly because it
has some of the most advanced hardware
Rim has ever implemented in a phone it
also is running blackberry 7 OS so we
have enhancements in the hardware and
the software realms let's start talking
about the processor on this thing it's a
1.2 gig hurts Qualcomm Snapdragon
processor and it has 768 megabytes of
RAM we also have a 3.7 inch TFT
capacitive multi-touch display that has
a resolution of 480 to 800 which is wvga
this phone has a 5 megapixel autofocus
rear camera with an LED flash and it's
capable of 720p HD video recording we
have Wi-Fi b/g/n Bluetooth 2.1 + EDR
there's NFC support on this bad boy as
well this phone has a 1230 milliamp
battery and well rather than me just
spouting off specs and teasing you by
taking the cover off ever so slowly let
me just jump into this bad boy and there
it is in all its glory the blackberry
torch 9850 it is actually a beautiful
looking phone in my opinion and I'm
going to compare that here to my iphone
4 ok let's take its clothes off here and
go skinny dipping and look how similar
these phones are shove that to the side
they're just so similar in dimensions
however I like the styling of the
blackberry torch better
I think aesthetically it's more pleasing
I love these gunmetal shiny gunmetal
accents here and i love the thinness of
this phone it is about the same
thickness as an iphone stack them up
here you can see and i just love the
curved edges because i get holes in my
pockets quite often and i think that can
be attributed to the iphone 4s kind of
rigid edges here so you could see i
cracked my phone a little while ago
anywhoozle this is very nice and I love
the tangible buttons here we have a
tangible send blackberry back and end /
power button here we also have that
classic blackberry optical trackpad as
well the back of this phone is actually
metal so unlike nearly every Android
phone you see on the market this phone
begs to differ with an actual metal
backing here and here's that 12 30 ml
amp battery I don't know how this is
going to perform hopefully it will do
well it's kind of on the light side
there's four gigabytes of external
storage via microSD card slot and this
is the latch to pull the SIM card down
so this phone actually has the
capability to be a world phone so that
is something to notice take note of to
notice I noticed it and you're taking
note of it one thing that I am
apprehensive about this is something
that John pointed out as well the volume
control is very slim it's kind of hard
to press in addition the mute button is
located right in the middle so it looks
as though it's easy to inadvertently
press that I like the fact that we still
have a function button up here and that
is controlling I think it defaults to
the camera speaking in the camera it's a
5 megapixel autofocus camera with 720p I
already told you that okay so here is
the lock button on the top very similar
to the storm if I can recall
in my opinion this is the phone that
should have been the storm truly USB
charging here okay you like that they
have not gone proprietary will remain
proprietary and that's a good thing
let's try to power this phone on oh but
before we do that let me show you what's
in the box here oh my gosh my mind is
all over the place these creative types
their brains work in such sordid ways we
have a getting started guide here okay
so here is recycling for phones and
batteries we have a connect me how to
connect to the blackberry desktop
software okay i miss the blackberry
desktop software we have a minut charger
here it's very similar to the iphone and
we have a set of headphones as you can
see focus there the uncomfortable type
okay i'm gonna see if i could power this
phone on here let's do some clever
control here okay no I'm powering this
phone on well there we have it there we
have it apparently the rep who sent me
this phone already got into the cookie
jar here so that's a good thing does a
very good thing we're jumping right into
it I like it right away this is very
nice blackberry 7 OS here and very quick
this is not the blackberry of 23 years
ago this is a blackberry that can
actually handle web browsers let's check
out the web here okay i was on youtube
on a second year oh look at that okay
technobuffalo there we go look at that
pinching and zooming without any
glitches without any lagging so I'm very
excited about this phone I can't wait to
review it it is very similar to the 9810
on AT&amp;amp;T the only difference is it's all
touch so we're going to do with the all
touch keyboard let me give you a sneak
preview of that right now okay okay so
we're here we have the keyboard okay
let's turn it the other way I will say I
might miss the physical keyboard I'm not
exactly sure but we're just going to
have to find out in my full review of
the blackberry torch 9850 for sprint two
hundred dollars after a 100-dollar
mail-in rebate this phone looks like one
of the hottest options on sprint's
network especially if you are a fan of
rim this is the time to revitalize your
love of blackberry be sure to go to
TechnoBuffalo com for more on this phone
and my full review coming up eventually
thank you so much for tuning in fellow
buffalo herders and I will see you guys
later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
