it from TechnoBuffalo and today we'll be
talking about Windows 10 Microsoft
recently pushed out a new build of
Windows 10 build 10 to 40 and it's the
closest build yet to the final release
with just two weeks until the OS is
available to consumers on July 29 it's
coming down to the wire today we'll show
you build 10 to 40 and also provide you
a recap of everything you can expect
from Windows 10 probably the most
exciting feature in Windows 10 is the
return of the Start menu it's the same
Start menu we all know and love but with
a little twist in Windows 10 you can
either launch the new start menu in full
screen or downscale the menu to a more
manageable window you can see all of
your apps on the left-hand side of the
Start menu and you're pinned apps and
live tiles on the right-hand side the
search function inside the new Start
menu has Cortana built-in which means
you can either start typing for a
specific keyword or simply use your
voice and speaking of Cortana she's now
a part of Windows 10 you'll be able to
use Cortana to run searches launch apps
set appointments and even location-based
reminders for users who are using the
mobile version of Windows 10 she has
been a joy so far to use and I think
Ratana will make searching for things
online so much easier since you're just
talking to your computer and have your
search results pop up immediately
we'll also be saying goodbye to Internet
Explorer in Windows 10 replaced by a
more minimalistic browser Microsoft edge
edge promises a better web experience
and make it easier to share reads search
and get things done one of the coolest
aspects of edge is the ability to
annotate websites which comes in handy
more often than you think you can also
enable read mode to help you focus on
the content you're reading and there's
also Cortana which will show you more
information in search results for
example if you're looking for a place to
eat Cortana will provide details about
restaurants giving you directions and
hours and she'll even book a reservation
through open table which i think is kind
of cool
notifications are one of the coolest
features of modern operating systems our
tablets have them our smart phones have
them and now Windows 10 has them too
Action Center will show you all of your
missed notifications from apps that
you've downloaded from the Windows Store
to security and maintenance to tips and
tricks on how to use Windows 10 all of
those notifications will live inside
Action Center making it easy to address
and organize your day inside Action
Center you also have access to some
quick setting toggles such as
Bluetooth Wi-Fi brightness controls
airplane mode and more the ability to
use virtual desktop inside windows is
something that I've wanted for a while
now and with Windows 10 we finally have
that option with a feature called task
view what task view I don't need to
minimize a certain AB just so I can
switch to something else I just need to
add a virtual desktop and quickly switch
between those windows it's a very simple
feature that adds a lot of value to
Windows 10 making it so much easier to
organise my workflow Windows Store apps
will also be much better with Windows 10
Microsoft said that Windows Store apps
and regular desktop programs will both
run in traditional windows in Windows 10
which means you'll be able to resize and
minimize them from the bar at the top
which I know is a feature a lot of
Windows 8 users have been waiting for
Windows 10 is vastly improve on PCs but
Microsoft didn't forget about those who
are using touchscreen devices Windows 10
includes a handy continuum feature that
essentially switches the interface
between the PC friendly desktop mode for
a more touchscreen friendly UI similar
to Windows 8 for example on a surface
pro 3 or any surface device running
Windows 10 snapping a keyboard will
automatically enable desktop mode and
pulling it off will enable tablet mode
because it knows that you took off the
keyboard
other than those major features Windows
10 will also introduce Xbox integration
giving users the ability to stream games
from your Xbox one to your PC there's
also a new snap feature that will allow
users to work on up to four apps at once
on the same screen a new task view
that'll take you straight to a single
screen that displays all your open apps
and files and redesign setting apps that
looks more modern and simplistic built
m240 has been a joy for us to use so far
and we can't wait till the official
consumer release starts rolling out
later this month Windows 10 will be
available for free on July 29 as an
update for qualified Windows 7 and 8.1
devices so make sure to check your
devices for that update anyways thank
you guys so much for watching and if you
guys enjoy this video give it a thumbs
up and we will see you guys in the next
one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
