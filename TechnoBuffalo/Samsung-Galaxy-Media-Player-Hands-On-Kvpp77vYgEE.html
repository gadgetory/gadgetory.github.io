technobuffalo here we're taking a first
look at the samsung and galaxy player it
is a full touchscreen android media
device so this is not a phone its go and
run through the specs with it quickly of
this guy it's got a very nice looking
definitely non Super AMOLED or super
amoled plus display it's four inches
that wvga resolution it's got wireless
of course you can see a full array of
android apps got full access to the
android market the wireless is done with
802 11 BG and hand it's fully optimized
for voice over IP you can see skype
right there you can get your video chat
on with the front-facing camera right
there or the 3.2 megapixel camera on
back on center come into configuration
size-wise of either eight or 16 and
looks sort of Samsung's familiar
TouchWiz interface I'll emphasize here
the screen is definitely again not super
amoled but it's actually pretty nice
I'll go ahead and hit the home button
and it's a physical home button and go
ahead and push it in then you've got
your menu and back buttons so it's apple
android you seen this you know many
times before using Samsung's TouchWiz
mayhem before but this is a dedicated
media player so let's go ahead and take
a look how media is going to go up here
on him someone jump into video so you've
got a video see if we can go back and
see the video player you look like you
got your all your video library is going
to show up here go ahead and hit playing
presumably it's look at a time with some
of Samsung's online downloadable media
options so the video caller is nice you
sit found a Blair inflection do it but
it definitely looks good you could
literally watch a music video a movie or
whatever it is or want to watch on your
device so i'll go ahead and exit out
I don't take a look at what the music
player is going to look like here it
looks very pretty Samsung's done a nice
job it's gideon you can go ahead and
open the menu here and go ahead and
choose some options for your sound
choice go ahead and go back see what
else we have I go ahead and you a list
is going to pull up all your music looks
very similar will be seen Android device
in the past I have an android device
that most of the capabilities are you
going to see here on my galaxy player
but if you are a regular feature phone
you want some smart phone function on a
smartphone you want the multi-touch
browser and service and Android action
you're going to get with the android
marketplace this is going to be a decent
device to check out i will say audio
fidelity contesting it right here is
actually pretty decent so this is john
