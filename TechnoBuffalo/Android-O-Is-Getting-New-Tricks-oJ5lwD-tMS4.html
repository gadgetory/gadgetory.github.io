up it was not an overly exciting keynote
for hardware but they announced a ton of
stuff for sophomores usually what these
developer conferences are about the
highlight of which we got a more
in-depth look at Android Oh coming later
this summer we don't know what the name
that's going to be I'm still still
betting it's going to be Oreo we could
get some behind-the-scenes look at
what's in the key features are going to
be so Android is kind of rethinking what
multitasking is going to be with we've
seen them try and do side by side
screens now the same picture picture is
the way of the future for multitasking
similar what we say on iOS so you're
watching a video did ever you want to
have a small window playing a YouTube
video and you can swipe it off the
screen whenever you want notifications
so we're also going to be big and
Android or your nugget notification dot
because you know there's notification
for that app you would interact with
notifications so like Instagram for
example we'll have a little dot next to
it
swipe down from the shade you'll see
that maybe someone liked the video or
left a comment you can interact with it
when you swipe it away the dot will also
go it's not like a badge counter swirl
just like a hey over here
look at this open up open up his app
Google intended Norden at a time it's
talking about machine learning and if
somebody said that was mostly like a
Skynet flashback so I did a lot of
machine learning when it comes to cut
copy and paste
oddly enough Phandroid oh so if you
think the most things that get copied
are things like addresses phone numbers
and email so if you're an email for
example and you want to copy some of the
phone number just go ahead sir tap it a
little no to select that whole phone
number it'll also give you shortcuts to
launch the dialer for example same thing
formats and addresses go ahead tap on an
address it'll select the whole thing for
you and also for name I'll give you the
option to pull into your contacts
if Andreo is about anything decided
republic helping delicious name it's
about battery efficiency and security
they talked a lot about vitals they
called it in a way that apps and oxy
bail just drain your battery in the
background commuting a lot of work in
the backgrounds to kill a lot of that
drains so things like snapchat for
example facebook that have been huge
injured battery drains
should be better this generation of
Android and sort of the last big thing
they talked about for Android OS OS
improvements overall faster Apple
something Android absolutely needed
faster boot up time from turn off
doesn't like to be a giant new rethought
version of Android just a better version
of Android and should be fast there
should be smoother and should also be
more security if you want to try it did
you actually try it now
go to Android comm flash beta and give
it a world so big story here is Security
battery life its new multitasking
hopefully by time Android ohit's
presumably the pixel to later on this
summer will know a lot more we're trying
to try Android Oh give it a shot
it's still definitely in beta so which
one uses a daily driver for example
don't expect it to run super smooth or
even have a great battery life right now
but what do you guys want to see an
Android Oh most that list is not yet
done give me a picture down below I'm
hoping for more elegant backups to some
upper back up and restore been waiting
for Android do that for a while anyways
leave a comment down below let me know
I'm going to go explore Mountain View
and see what else is here at Google i/o
