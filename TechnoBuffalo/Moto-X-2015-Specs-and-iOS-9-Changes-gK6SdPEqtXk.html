sangan from TechnoBuffalo and in today's
episode of a roundup we're going to be
talking about iOS 9 the Moto X 2015 the
oneplus 2 and Microsoft's plan to
release two new flagship Lumia phones
this is rumor roundup so let's go ahead
and get started Windows 10 should be
available in just a couple of months but
the reason why we won't see Windows 10
for phones right off the bat it's
because Microsoft wants time to finish
development on two new Lumia flagships
at least that's what it sounds like
according to unleash the phones
Microsoft is working on two new high-end
Lumia phones known as City man and talk
man city man is apparently Microsoft's
true flagship device and sports the kind
of specs Android users are accustomed to
we're talking about a 5.7 inch qhd
display an octa core Qualcomm processor
3 gigabytes of RAM in a 20 megapixel
camera we're also expecting it to come
with a removable back giving users
access to the battery and a microSD slot
meanwhile Microsoft stock man will be
very similar with the 5.2 inch qhd
display a hexa core Qualcomm processor 3
gigabytes of RAM in a 20 megapixel
shooter it's still unclear whether the
device will sport avram rule back like
its bigger brother but seeing as they're
somewhat similar it probably would
motorola already confirmed plans to
release an updated Moto X in 2015 but
until now we didn't know what to expect
from the third generation device a new
report suggests that the company is
gearing up to release a device that
should offer a solid upgrade over last
year's Moto X according to a list of
specs sent to gadgets portal the Moto X
2015 will pack some seriously high-end
hardware the device will apparently come
equipped with a 5.2 inch qhd AMOLED
display a 16 megapixel camera a
5-megapixel front-facing shooter a
Snapdragon 808 processor a 3,280
milliamp battery 4 gigabytes of RAM and
either 32 or 64 gigabytes of storage
Motorola didn't unveil the Moto X 2014
until September's so we're probably at
least a few months away from the new
flagship phone it is possible some of
those alleged specs could change between
now and then but if these specs are
legit will be pretty happy a report
surface on Tuesday that suggested Apple
is still missing major music deals
before it introduces its revamp beats
music streaming service during WWDC now
another report offers some clarification
on that in addition to nudity
we can expect from Apple during WWDC
nine to five max said Apple may indeed
be missing major record deals as
billboard notice but that it still plans
to introduce its new streaming music
service at WWDC still the site warned
that while the iOS app will be ready
inside of iOS 8.4 versions of Apple TV
and Mac aren't ready yet Apple will also
reportedly introduce iOS i'm currently
codename monarch with a totally revamped
version of Siri that closely mimics the
more colorful user interface of Siri on
the Apple watch 9to5 mac smart gurbin
didn't provide any additional details
about what a new version of Siri might
offer but we hope it grows more powerful
to match competitions such as Google now
and Microsoft's Cortana so what about
you guys what do you guys want to see in
iOS 9 let us know in the comments down
below last but not least let's talk
about the one + 21 + still hasn't
revealed many details for its upcoming 1
+ 2 but over on Chinese social network
Weibo the company CEO Pete Lau isn't
holding back he was chatting up with
fans and asked how much the company
should charge if its next smartphone
packs a snapdragon 810 processor one fan
suggested a price of around four hundred
dollars which he didn't balk at instead
he said sounds reasonable which suggests
a company might look at increasing the
price of its next phone in order to
deliver high end parts of course it's
not as cheap as original one plus one
which cost as little as two hundred
ninety nine dollars off contract but as
1 plus continues to improve its device
and scale up I wouldn't be surprised if
the price goes up at least a little bit
rumor has it that the oneplus 2 will
offer a sharper 5.5 inch display a
bigger battery and some kind of
biometric scanner the company recently
confirmed that the oneplus 2 will be
sold on an invite system just like the
original one but hopefully hopefully
it'll be available in higher volume
early on anyways that's it for this
episode of rumor roundup anything that I
talked about in this video will be in a
