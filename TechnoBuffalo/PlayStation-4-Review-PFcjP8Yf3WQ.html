next-gen console wars are finally
heating up with a launch of the ps4
we've been checking out the console
since its release and now it's time for
our review is the PlayStation 4 a smart
Buy has Sony earned your money find out
what we think and our ps4 review
starting right now when I explain how
I'm gonna do this review our gaming
editor Joey Davidson also reviewed the
ps4 in text form on our site
TechnoBuffalo comm and a lot of his
opinions echoed mine so I'll let you
know when we different and why first
let's talk about design at first glance
Joey was not a fan of the ps4 his design
when it was unveiled earlier this year
I'm the other hand really liked the
sharp edges and trapezoid inspired shape
immediately the designs grown a bit on
Joey though and he has his console
sitting vertically in his entertainment
center and mine lays horizontally we
both did notice that Sony's design did a
really good job of kind of hiding the
USB ports on the front the one real bit
of confusion at first was the power and
eject buttons which are camouflage so
well that a consumer might not realize
where they are when they first set up
their system on the inside the
PlayStation 4 has a notable hard drive
but notable kind of in a bad way because
its capacity is a relatively small 500
gigabytes with most games needing 20 to
50 gigs of space you're looking at
maxing out that hard drive really
quickly if you buy new games all the
time
fortunately Sony's done all of us a
favor and made it extremely easy to
upgrade the hard drive including doing
something kind of non Sony esque and
allowing for non proprietary hardware to
be installed so if you're even
considering swapping our hard drive just
bite the bullet and do it early before
you start loading up your original Drive
with content SSDs are also compatible
which pleasantly speeds up load times
Joey and I both agree it's great that
Sony again built their power supply into
the system meaning you won't be dealing
with an ugly power brick yes I'm looking
at you Xbox it doesn't change the
gameplay or the overall experience of
the console but an internal power supply
is a really nice touch and it's one
that's I think a little more
forward-thinking the PlayStation 4 is
also really quiet with little to no
additional sound beyond the faint hum of
the system
and when you insert or eject a disk next
up the controller I have both the
PlayStation 3 and the Xbox 360 at home
and over time I found myself preferring
the Xbox 360 slims controller over the
PlayStation 3 this time around I think I
will have a much harder time choosing
though because the DualShock 4
controller is a very very well designed
it's a little heavier than the DualShock
3 but that adds some much-needed weight
to the controller I think and they've
also changed up the design of the
triggers and bumpers making them way
more ergonomic and easier to hit when
you're in a jam or if you're panicked
which I always appreciate the touchpad
on the front controlled a drone in
Killzone and I thought that was an
interesting but not exactly amazing use
of the touchpad so I guess we'll have to
see how developers can make the touchpad
more organic to use before we're 100%
sold on it as for the controller speaker
well considering I've been playing
resogun almost non-stop since the ps4
dropped hearing keepers detected from my
controller was extremely helpful we also
really liked the headphone jack on the
bottom of the controller which was a
nice respite for my husband having a
listen to me play Methodist in resogun
over and over again did I mention I
really live resogun I really love
resogun unfortunately the one bummer of
the DualShock 4 is the battery life both
Joey and I got about 6 to 8 hours of
play before needing it charged which
isn't a super long time but should get
you through a solid play session we also
both wish the USB charging cable Sony
included was about 2 feet longer but at
least we can buy longer and cheaper
replacements a Joey tends to spend about
10 hours a day during review sessions
playing with the ps4 so he needed to
charge his controller every single day I
on the other hand spent about 2 to 3
hours a day at a time on the console so
I was ok with charging it every other
night moving on a connectivity you are
definitely going to need a subscription
to PlayStation Plus to get the most out
of your ps4 that's about 50 bucks a year
which is just shy of 1 less game for you
every year and I know we don't like
thinking about it that way but that's
kind of trade-off and it's actually
necessary because PlayStation Plus gives
you access to online multiplayer beta
access online saves auto system updates
game discounts and my favorite thing the
instant game collection so as long as
you're a member of PlayStation Plus you
get new games for free every month
sometimes they are
amazing like resogun and sometimes
they're kind of awful like contrast but
overall getting a couple of free games
passed the time with is okay by me so
for the both of us playstation plus
equals worth it
Joey covers the UI including social and
sharing features pretty in-depth in his
written review and I don't want to blab
for 20 minutes about the PlayStation 4
so I'll just say that I think the
sharing and social features are nicely
done though I do wish I could sign in to
my Google+ account instead of Facebook
which I don't actually use sharing is
also incredibly easy you have a share
button right there on a controller with
the ps4 doing the bulk of the recording
streaming and screen capping for you I
love that AHS for the UI I think it's
okay though I miss dynamic themes a lot
I miss making my own colors and I wish I
had the ability to sort things better
games categories friends blame that on
my incessant organizational urges but
there's nothing more frustrating than
having to look through my entire friend
list just for three or four of my
regular favorites that I always play
games with so what's the official word
well the PlayStation 4 is a good console
at launch but the really exciting part
about the ps4 is its potential so think
about the huge difference in games
between Call of Duty 3 which was a
PlayStation 3 launch title in late 2006
and Call of Duty ghosts also for
PlayStation 3 but out a month ago
looking a million times better there is
so much potential in the ps4 and it's
not about what it can do right this
second there's only a handful of launch
games and some of them aren't that great
but we hope Sony will constantly expand
and improve on their UI over time and
one of the other things is it that's
interesting to me is that console
updates are still a part of technology
that people only expect to upgrade once
every five to ten years and I think
that's largely because it takes that
long to mine the full potential out of
them just like those games I mentioned a
Joey and I both agree diehard gamers
will absolutely love the console day one
but for casual folks looking at the new
consoles to pick up the system as it
currently exists is just promising not
overly great immediately right out of
the box but not underwhelming at all so
it's definitely not a bad thing that's
