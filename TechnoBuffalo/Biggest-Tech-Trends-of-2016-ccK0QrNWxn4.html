technology that came out and a ton of
trends that made news so ought to pick
some of the biggest tech and the biggest
trends we saw the year and kind of put
them all together in the biggest buzz of
2016 notable emissions here are things
like the iPhone it was an incremental
update it created a lot of news when it
came out then that new cycle tend to die
down emissions on this list not a knock
time particular product to just didn't
make that big news so let's start with
something that surprised a lot of people
that was snapchat or snap getting into
the physical product market with
spectacles super hard to come by hung
available on the second-hand market yet
buy them from vending machine we'd wait
in line for like four hours as Venice
California get our hands on them it
turns out the pretty good they don't
look nearly as ridiculous as Google
glass did and school to see snapchat get
into something new the next thing that
made headlines and probably for the
wrong reasons is the note 7 arguably one
of the best phones of the year literally
went up in flames the stories weren't
focused on what the phone could do is
focus on what the phone was doing and
that was smoking and oftentimes catching
fire there were recalls and the phone
came back out then it got recalled again
and the whole phone got killed the news
cycle from the note 7 lasted for quite a
while and is still going on with
carriers issuing updates over the air
that are murdering the cell connection
on these things it was a sad it was a
sad year for the note 7 next up on the
list I was going to do ugh vented
reality but the main driving force
behind AR and 2016 is Pokemon go so
that's the next thing on this list I've
never been that big of a pokemon player
but I picked up pokemon girl I played it
for a while I loved it I got into the
mythos of Pokemon and it got me to want
to go back and play the old games and
then probably like you I want this Oh
later kind of forgot about it it was an
awesome game though that brought AR to
the forefront and it made a lot of
people re-evaluate whether or not the
future was going to be virtual reality
or augmented reality so shoes also made
a lot of headlines in 2016 particular
the Nike Air Mags or the Back to the
Future shoes nike made 89 of these
because back to 322 came out in 1989 I
gave the opportunity to give a few a way
to two lucky people who entered and
don't
to Michael J Fox is charity their
auction some pair off demand for as high
as 200 thousand dollars these
self-lacing shoes looked incredible and
technology filter down to more
affordable shoes if you consider seven
hundred dollars affordable but the Nike
Air Mags were a thing they came out they
got a ton of attention they raised a lot
of money for charity nostalgia is
expensive though 2016 in addition to
being a year of augmented reality was
also the year of virtual reality we saw
things like oculus rift HTC vive we saw
google cardboard come into its own
daydream came out virtual reality on
your face isn't does look like it's
going anywhere and it looks like it was
going to continues 2017 i'm selling the
fence but they're not i like vr i really
liked a playstation did at the psv are
but we'll see how 2017 to go to treat
the technology certainly made a ton of
news and we shall i wrote a lot of
stories about it with every new end
comes the beginning the end the nexus
line made a ton of news but i should in
the beginning of the pixel line of
phones named pixels been around for a
few years from google but now it's in a
phone format and that was a huge buzz
worthy thing in 2016 Google's flagship
their marquee foam their reference
design was being killed sort of Lisa
name was and they were making their own
hardware or at least overseeing what HTC
was doing with the pixel and the pixel
XL 2016 also looks like the year
Nintendo made a crazy come back we had
things like the NES classic the Nintendo
switch Nintendo is making headlines
everywhere I can't wait to get my hands
on the switch that's gonna be a 20-17
story but the announcement of their
next-gen console was 2016 and is still
making waves today and then yes classic
you still can't find in the last
category that made a ton of news and
2016 was home assistance in particular
things like the Amazon echo the echo dot
and Google home making their ways into
almost everybody's house chances are you
gotta echo dot for Christmas or whatever
you celebrate they're really useful to
have mono people using them as hubs for
the smart homes that I use mine for 2062
as a year that they permeated our house
2017 is probably going to be the year
they take over and
and murder us so a lot of tech and a lot
of trends happened in 2016 those are
some of the most noteworthy literally
and the most buzz-worthy things that I
thought but whatever you've off the list
let me know down below what you think my
product I missed or trends i miss we're
gonna pins in the top comments up to the
top so let us know in the pants region
so you has next video also i'm going to
see you next year i'm filming this in
the last days of 2016 so after 2017 to
you can't be as bad as a dumpster fire
the last year was</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
