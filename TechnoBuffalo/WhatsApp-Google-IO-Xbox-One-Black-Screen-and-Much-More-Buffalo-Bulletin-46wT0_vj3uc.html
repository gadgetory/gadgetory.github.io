Google IO ticket information Xbox one
bugs Metal Gear Solid 5 comparisons and
a new iTunes Music Festival location
it's Buffalo Bulletin time
hello internet and welcome to the
buffalo bulletin where we recap stories
from our site TechnoBuffalo comm every
Wednesday and Friday
if you're interested in reading more
about any story on the show check the
description below for links or click on
the graphics if you have annotations
available and toggled on I'm Ashley
Scavo parry top stories
the folks at messaging app whatsapp are
probably all out buying yachts today
after announcing on Wednesday Facebook
will be acquiring them for a whopping 16
million dollars with a three billion
dollar stock bonus in four years it
seems like Mark Zuckerberg felt like he
wasn't getting enough people to use
Facebook Messenger and so decided to buy
a competing client to fast-track
Facebook's messaging numbers as of right
now whatsapp doesn't have any ads and
will be operating separately for the
time being from Facebook but you and I
both know it's only a matter of time
yesterday Google announced official
dates for its IO Developer Conference
but this time around there's a new
ticket distribution process if you would
like to attend the event on June 25th
and 26th of this year you won't be
incessantly refreshing a ticket buying
page like previous years google says
this year you'll be submitting an
interest form and there will be a
lottery for ticket sales this definitely
helps out people who can't otherwise be
present for those mad dash ticket
sellouts that we saw last year and here
before everyone interested better start
saving up now last year's general
admission tickets cost 900 bucks over in
gaming if you're an Xbox one user and
you've experienced a strange bug that
causes your screen to remain black when
you boot up your Xbox one you are not
alone some users think it may have
something to do with the yes command
that follows Xbox turn off getting
recognized by Kinect fortunately for us
Microsoft has acknowledged the problem
and announced they are working on a fix
but for the time being Microsoft support
says the issue can be fixed by holding
down the power button for 10 seconds
it's definitely not as serious as a red
ring of death but still a little bit
stressful for unknowing Xbox one owners
also in gaming Konami released some
video this week showing off the
differences between the Xbox 360 Xbox
one PlayStation 3 and PlayStation 4
versions of Metal Gear Solid 5 Ground
zeroes the footage looks pretty great
across all four platforms but
ps4 version if I do say so myself looks
especially good if you'd like to see a
non compressed full 60 frames per second
comparison GameTrailers has a download
available that will Navy you to see
everything every gritty little detail
ground zeroes hits retail shelves soon
you will be able to pick up the newest
Metal Gear in the US on March 18th and
in Japan and Europe on March 20th lastly
our wild card story for dayz great news
for anybody headed to Austin for South
by Southwest this year Apple announced
this week it would be bringing the
popular iTunes music festival the South
by this year this will be the first time
the u.s. sees iTunes Music Festival as
Apple usually holds the event annually
in London currently only a handful of
bands have been announced for the show
but the lineup already features acts
like imagine dragons Coldplay pitbull
Zedd and Keith Urban with Apple saying
they've got a lot more to announce
that's the Buffalo bulletin for today if
you enjoyed the show a thumbs up would
be super awesome of you and if you want
