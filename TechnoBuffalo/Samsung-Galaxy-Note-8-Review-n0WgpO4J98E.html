impossible to talk about and review the
no date without looking back a little
bit talk about the note seven we know
what happens to battery in their recalls
we've been easy for Samsung here I think
to play a totally safe and release a
phone with minimal upgrades to make sure
there weren't any issues and a lot of
ways they did that but there's still a
lot of innovation in the note eight that
I found am I about four and a half days
of testing with it so the story with the
note has always been the s-pen and the
screen and that sort of sits above at
the very top of Samsung's hierarchy of
phones above the galaxy s line and the
screen here is gorgeous albeit gigantic
it's 6.3 inches and this thing is
absolutely beautiful as you'd expect
from Samsung Super AMOLED technology in
fact I would have said this is the most
beautiful screen I'd ever seen until I
saw the OLED panel on the V 30 so this
takes the cake as the second-best screen
that I've seen and the reason I'm saying
second best over what the SI or the SI
plus has this thing is actually 22%
brighter than the s8 screen which is a
huge amount and it makes a difference
when you're in direct sunlight if you
turn the brightness all the way up while
you're in a darker room you're going to
burn your eyeballs out the screen here
gets incredibly bright which is really
nice to see so a six point three inch
phone this is the same size as Samsung's
like old-school Galaxy mega it's only
0.1 inches bigger than the Galaxy S a
plus but that point one inches makes a
difference this phone is not the most
organized feeling it looks like an SI
plus kind of with the infinity display
but the design isn't as aesthetically
pleasing as it is on those phones it
feels a little boxy er doesn't feel as
thin as those devices so it's bit tough
ergonomically and especially makes it
tough with a fingerprint reader which is
still in the same spot that it was on
the s8 and the SI plus next to the
camera and there are two camera sensors
we'll talk a lot about those but on a
bigger device it's even harder to find
in fact the buttons almost flush they
can get doubly hard to find and if you
are left-handed don't even bother trying
to use a fingerprint reader the other
stuff from the s8 line of phones are
still here you still have the iris
scanning face unlock and of course you
can use a pin
or a swipe ass where it's a lot of ways
to unlock your device surrounding out
the screen it's bright it's beautiful
it's probably one of the best displays
on the market as you'd expect from
Samsung's
the aspect ratio is the same eighteen
and a half by nine but you get used to
HDR plus if you can watch HDR content on
Netflix if you're streaming it if you're
cure it's not gonna downgrade the
quality looks incredible here on the
device so screen aside the biggest
reason I think people get the note is
the s-pen it's here you can't put it in
backwards it's got a IP 68 just like the
phone does and it works really well on
Samsung's updated what it can do via
software so it lives in the bottom right
hand corner you pop it out you can start
writing right on the screen like you
could with the note 7 except now you've
got multiple pages so you can just sort
of keep writing page down keep writing
and page down and it works really well
I've had very minimal latency it's a
great palm rejection it's an awesome way
to sort of take notes to jot notes down
does a lot more than that it'll do live
translation now I'll do it by sentences
whether or not you like the S pen's
gonna depend on how much you're gonna
use it I use it mostly to draw pictures
of trains with my son it's nice for
editing screenshots and stuff it's not
necessary for me I know a lot of you
folks really want to have it and if
you're debating whether or not you want
to get this or the si+ having the option
to always have the s-pen it's certainly
a nice benefit so performance used to be
a category I talked a lot about when it
comes to flagships nowadays they're all
plenty fast there's actually two
gigabytes of RAM in here versus the SI
in the SI plus so there's six gigs as
opposed to four and things are fast
whether you're multitasking using
molting window playing games and any
pictures whatever the phone's gonna be
fast with no slowdown whatsoever
64 gigs of internal storage but of
course you can use the micro SD card I'm
putting as much storage as you can find
that's available I believe Allah support
up to 2 terabytes which I don't think
even exist yet other thing is that no
dates can be aware of that maybe you
didn't know it's got support for gigabit
LTE which is going to be the fallback
for when 5g hits so t-mobile Verizon
AT&amp;amp;T and Sprint
have all started rolling out gigabit LTE
or going through the near future and
when you get access to it it will be
really fast if you're on your phone it's
gonna be a little more future-proof note
8 even the SATA si+
support the technology as well I'm a
software front it's pretty familiar from
the s8 and si plus it's version
8.5 a Samsung's user experience which is
what they used to call TouchWiz there
are few notable additions so first in
the edge panel you've got something
called a pairing so Samsung uses multi
window so you can have one app on top
one app on bottom but now you can
actually put both of those apps into a
single icon on the edge panel so for me
if I'm watching video and using email I
can set that up so when I hit a button
it'll automatically launch it the way I
want a lot of apps you can do that with
it just makes it a lot easier so now I'm
sort of dragged apps around and I think
that means that people knew what the
window was there but rarely use it so
Samsung's trying to put that in front of
you and make it way easier to do so I
started using the Galaxy Note 8 from a
galaxy s 8 so things here we're very
familiar the Samsung user experience
they used to call it TouchWiz is 8.5
it's a newer version and things look
really good here I've become a huge fan
of Samsung software I know a lot of
folks give Samsung a lot of grief and I
used to as well but starting with the s7
things got really good here and actually
prefer Samsung's take on Android almost
over anything else there used to be the
rule that Samsung phones slowed down
over time and that was true I think from
the galaxy s5 and older generations of
phones but haven't tried the same thing
device since then that's no longer the
case
I use my Galaxy s8 for about five months
no issues I had an s7 before that no
slowdown at all if you have that me
preconceived notion not an issue here
with the note 8 so one of the other big
upgrades from the Galaxy s8 and si+ is
the camera so now I have two sensors
here it's got a wide-angle and a
telephoto it's really nice you can do
two times optical zoom ten times digital
you just hit a button we've seen that UI
before where I think Samsung hit a
homerun though is with the live focus so
if you under what that means actually
can create kind of a blurred effect
behind a subject and does it all with
software now we've seen that before
we've had at portrait mode on iOS the
oneplus 5 has it built in Samsung did a
couple cool things so first if you use
the Samsung gallery app you can edit it
after the fact it looks almost DSLR
quality before you started zooming it so
other sort of camera niceties shots in
low light will actually look
surprisingly good in direct sunlight
typical Samsung fashion a little bit
overexposed but the pictures look really
bright and vibrant
both the sensors here of optical image
stabilization so if you have a shaky
hand you're taking
pictures on a bus for example they look
really good so I imagine that Samsung
was a little gun-shy and overly cautious
when it came to battery we've got a
thirty three hundred million power
battery in here as opposed to thirty
five hundred on the SA plus and samsung
claims is smaller because of the ten
nanometer technology in the Snapdragon
835 which the same processor in the
galaxy s 8 NS a plus but haven't any
battery issues so again I was coming
from a galaxy s feet by the end of my
day I was generally yet maybe twenty
five thirty percent and I was about the
same here with the no date with the
exact same usage so it appears that
they've done a really nice job with
software managing battery and at some
point in the future when Oreo makes its
way to notate battery life to even be
improved but you can get through a full
day easily if you want to charge the
battery of course it's USB see it's got
fast charging and it's got wireless fast
charging as well and of course other
stuff you'd expect like ip68
so but not always perfect in the note
world even when you've got volume all
the way up on a phone call the speaker
up to your ear was not that loud it was
quieter for me than it was on the s8 no
DAC built in the speaker using
speakerphone it was seen the music is
not overly loud either so I probably
recommend either a good pair of
bluetooth headphones or if you want to
plug in headphones you can do it no DAC
again but it does have a 3.5 millimeter
headset jack built-in and a big knock on
the phone it's really the phone itself
it's the color choices I don't know why
Samsung does this they release other
colors and different regions just
release all the colors for everyone the
u.s. kind of got shaft in the color
Department we've got black and Orchard
gray ordered gray looks nice but the
rest of the countries got a
gorgeous-looking deep sea blue there's a
maple Gold you have to kind of wait for
those colors to make their way out here
and they eventually will but if you want
to buy a phone at launch you're kind of
limited Samsung sent us the black
version and this is a fingerprint magnet
it's the same sort of shiny black we had
on the s8 or the si+ so I recommend
putting a skin on it you've got a deep
brand skin on ours a link to them down
below and also Bixby's here with its
Bigsby button yeah I mean I've talked
about Bigsby at length for me it's
unnecessary Google assistance here which
has been plenty good enough but if you
want to use it victory vision Bixby
voice are both
here and they do what nixb does if you
decide to set it up or or not remap the
button it so does it expect it's not a
cheap phone depending on where you buy
it between nine hundred and thirty nine
hundred fifty bucks but it's tough talk
about price because Samsung does ton of
sales it's gonna be an expensive phone
regardless if you have an SI and si plus
it's probably not worth the upgrade
you're coming from a note five earlier
device we're going to really want to
consider what Samsung has done here with
the note eight it's an incredible bit of
hardware it is a big phone though and a
lot of people that might be a turn off I
recommend feeling it in your hand before
you go ahead and buying it if you wear
tight pants or shorts with shallow
pockets it's going to fall out or feel
really unwieldy for you what do I think
about the note eight is if the phone
you've been waiting for you skipping for
maybe what Apple has to come next if
you've already pre-ordered one I wanna
know what you guys think if you liked
the review please give it a thumbs up we
always appreciate it certainly helps
until next time I'm John R Ettinger and
