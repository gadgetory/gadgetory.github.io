from TechnoBuffalo and today Microsoft
released a technical preview of Windows
10 for phone and today we're gonna take
a closer look at what it's all about
and what's exciting about the new
Windows 10 update is the new features
Microsoft is focusing on with the
built-in apps that includes photos and
camera now maps mail calendar and the
new messaging apps aren't included in
this bill just yet but hopefully we'll
see them soon there are other
miscellaneous features too that we'll
talk about later in a video but right
now the Windows 10 technical preview for
phone is only available for certain
phones that are running Windows 8.1 such
as the Lumia 630 635 7:30 and 8:30
photos and camera have been tweaked
heavily in Windows 10 for phones there's
a universal photo apps across phones
tablets and PCs meaning all the images
you have stored on your device or
onedrive will sync automatically with
all of your Windows 10 devices similar
to iCloud photo library with Windows 10
- Lumia camera app comes pre-installed
and it features the same interfacing on
other Lumia devices now the other new
features we noticed were the background
images on the Start screen you'll be
able to see the full background images
behind the live tiles instead of
overlaying it on top making you feel
more natural and consistent with how iOS
and Android manages wallpapers the
settings menu also changed up a bit to a
more organized look matching Windows
tens UI there's also a new keyboard with
a joystick of some sort they'll let you
move the cursor around to edit text a
little easier and faster which is
definitely a nice addition I also
noticed that there are more quick action
buttons in Action Center before there
were four programmable quick action
buttons but with Windows sonders a new
expand button which shows eight more
buttons for quick access similar to what
we saw with windows 10 for PC there are
also interactive notifications meaning
you'll be able to dismiss an alarm or
reply to text messages without leaving
an app which I find very useful so far
after several hours of playing around
with the first tech preview for Windows
10 on the Lumia 830 it's not as smooth
as Windows 8.1 animations are a bit
choppy at times but the new features are
definitely nice we're still missing the
new mail app which is supposed to be
redesigned and play better with other
mail services and we're also missing the
new messaging features like the
integration with Skype and we're also
missing the new Maps app and calendar
Microsoft will be updating Windows 10
for a Windows Phone throughout the weeks
and months and we'll keep you posted if
there are any major changes with Windows
10
but as of now this is just an early
glimpse of what we can expect from
Microsoft in Windows 10 anyways that's
it for this video guys make sure to
