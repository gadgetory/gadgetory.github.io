technobuffalo here with an unboxing of
the droid charge this is the newest 4g
phone for verizon wireless let's go
ahead dig in I kept trying to think of
any charge joke but I just couldn't come
up with Denny so insert your own charge
joke here put him down below let's go
ahead and unbox this guy so presumably
we are going to see a release very soon
on the next few days at least in the
month of may go ahead and pull off of
the paper you've got that robot looking
droid I rip this off here nothing very
exciting on the box I will say it's
gonna take a fit of skill to get the lid
off there we go and here is your charge
this is a device that we first saw at
CES it didn't have a name then it was
rumored to be called the stealth we even
got some hands-on time with the device
when it was pre release it was actually
one of my favorite phones from CES 2011
so I'm really looking forward to getting
in there and seeing what we've got so
we've got some Samsung media hub credit
I will actually put this out to the
first one to claim it can have it there
you go ok so droid charge got some
reading material don't think people are
gonna read that but you've got it you're
sort of now standard accessories there
is a wall charger so we've got a micro
USB to USB cable we do and don't have
any sort of headphones in there ok great
let's go ahead and take a look at the
phone and because I know my audience I'm
just going to leave the plastic on here
well I film you guys won't mind right um
just kidding all right so we'll slide it
out of its plastic baggie and we will
rip this off if we get the whooshing
noise no whooshing noise I'll do that to
a camera so you prepare some sort of
whooshing noise zoom in a little bit and
let's run through these specs first to
see if there's a battery in there it
feels like there is I will power it on
while i'm talking assuming i can find
the power button which looks to live on
right hand side of the device see if we
have enough of a charge please you can
watch something while I'm talking
alright so this is the droid charge oh
there's my joke he came charged get it
okay so it's got a 4.3 inch diagonal
super amoled plus display but loud
you're not gonna want to turn this on
when you're in class or in a meeting
it's a super amoled plus display if
you've seen the beautiful Super AMOLED
screens on the Galaxy S series of
devices this takes that beautiful screen
takes a step further you may have
noticed that the galaxy s or any phone
the Super AMOLED screen had a little bit
of a bluish tint to it I talked about in
some of my videos it wasn't anything
that really competed you but it's
something that we definitely cognate it
up when you were using the phone this
takes care of that so you are going to
get really really bright colors you're
going to get some rich images go ahead
and unlock that called dark color don't
look bright black you're going to look
black man great visibility in direct
sunlight this is a gorgeous screen I'm
ever coming away from CES really really
impressed with it so super amoled
display resolution of 480 x 800 so it's
a very very very high res screen on the
phone as you can see it is running
android 2.2 or as you can see at least
it's got TouchWiz no gingerbread here
but being a new phone presumably it will
get a taste of tasty tasty gingerbread
if we check out the rear of this guy and
there's another sticker I'll go ahead
and remove this before I start talking
let's go bang see where that is there we
go boom removed because I read the
comments and you guys hit stickers with
a passion um so we got an 8 megapixel
camera on the back with an LED flashing
that does have autofocus business in it
which is kind of cool that will shoot
video at school 80 x 720 which is 720p
we've got a front-facing camera right
there for all of your video chatting
needs that's 1.3 megapixel one of the
nice things about this phones is 1600
milliamp hour battery that lives right
under here this is an LTE 4G phone
LTE sucks in battery life unfortunately
the way that LTE is done right now is
there are two separate radios a 4g radio
and a 3g radio and that can definitely
be a drain on battery however Samsung is
claiming you're going to get 11 hours
talktime and 280 hours of standby time
so that's pretty nice it's being powered
by a now tried and true 1 gigahertz
Samsung processor there is no dual core
action here on for chili but on the
upside it does have mobile hotspot
capabilities for sharing all that hot 4G
action which you can see I have right
there 4G that is one extra g then most
folks might be used to you can share
that mobile hotspot for up to eight
devices so awesome there is very thin
unsurprisingly like to buy it so let's
take a quick tour of it so there's that
front-facing 1.3 megapixel camera we've
got the bar as and logo and we've got
some physical buttons nothing capacitive
here the typical Android I really liked
the physical buttons actually we've got
your menu button home button your back
button and your search button on the
left volume rocca up and down there's
your charging port micro USB that's now
become standard really nice to about
sort of charging and syncing standard
looks like there's a microphone on the
side as well another dual microphone on
top 3.5 millimeter headset jack that is
non recessed so any headphones that
you've got will work even your Hello
Kitty headphones as I know you guys use
the power button is going to reside as
we just discovered on the right hand
side of the device power and lock and
right above that is right below that
rather is hdmi out under a door
fortunately that is going to be a
separate table they're gonna hook this
guy up to the TV you can do so the back
of it is hard plastic it's not a soft
touch you can see it's got a bit of a
reflective look to it and it is a with
Google device little bit of a hump in
the back you can see you're right
towards the bottom right there when it's
sitting on a flat surface it's got a
little bit of a rock to it but it does
feel nice in the hand so let's do a real
quick size comparison here is another
four point
range device this is the inspire 4G for
eighteen t similar to the desire HD or
the evo to 4.3 inch phone you can see
the difference from a size comparison
just for thickness let's bring in an
iphone 4 in case you are on verizon
you're considering perhaps this phone
the droid charge or the iphone four you
get a size comparison certainly the size
of the droid charge can be larger if
it's got a much larger screen but that
extra size doesn't come with much extra
thickness this is a very very thin phone
I've got to say it feels really nice in
the hand I think that if I had to pick a
phone on the verizon network to pick up
right now this would probably be the one
that I would choose go ahead and unlock
it our pricing is going to vary
depending on what outlet you choose
whether or not you go to verizon or
maybe amazon's having a deal that day or
your local retailers I think ideally
just don't know I will say though with
the screen here looks really pretty
although I'm sure that's not going to
translate onto camera let's go ahead and
jump in see if I can find a gallery and
open up an image for you this one weighs
just put it up for the first time it's
fine gallery and you guys are probably
to see it it's right there it's right
there but sometimes i crack into the
pressure I don't see these things when
I'm looking so let's see what we got
voice search navigation you take a look
at all the applications that are going
to come on here if you like TouchWiz I
don't like TouchWiz when the great
things about Android is that you can
totally customize your device to make it
look however you choose so it's like
we've got the stock android gallery
application here it is loading and this
is going to be expandable so if you want
more storage you can put up to a 32
gigabyte card in there it's like there's
nothing stored in here unfortunately so
there's a camera app I'm speaking of
that area you can see what they look
like see my boxes hit the home button
micro SD card slot is going to live in
the back here so I can get the top off
huh I can see the jokes all ready to go
and slide your finger nail if you have
any all the way around and presumably
that will get the back of this off let's
see
theory theory it'll do it I'll keep this
in it in the video so you guys can make
bail jokes there we go alright so 4G sim
card kind of still strange to see a sim
card on verizon devices you do not have
take out the battery though to get the
expansion card slot which is quite nice
so it looks like it's going to come with
a big card in here very nice 32 gig card
so you're gonna have that choice of
purchasing option so you can have a lot
of storage here I love the fact that you
can swap cards if you need and get a ton
of space and there is our 1600 milliamp
hour battery still very strange to see a
sim card as I mentioned but I love the
fact that it gives some tasty tasty 4g
action if you guys are in an area where
you have arrived in 4G go into a verizon
store and try it it is incredibly fast I
was using it over the weekend in
Southern California not this phone i was
using the novotel hot spot when I was
getting 12 megabits down and for up
which is really fast and a lot faster
than most home factions so until a
network at saturated presumably those
feeds go down a little bit you're going
to get lightening fast speeds this has
been a very long unboxing video I felt
like we got a chance to talk and get to
know each other a little bit better this
is the droid charge for Verizon Wireless
presumably it's going to be available
very very soon so check at verizon
wireless comm to get your droid charge
on i'm jon rettinger from technobuffalo
check out the website for all your tech
news leave me questions down below if
you want to leave me a joke down below
or tell me you're having a good day
because it makes me have a good day when
I know you're having a good day see you
guys in the next video buh-bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
