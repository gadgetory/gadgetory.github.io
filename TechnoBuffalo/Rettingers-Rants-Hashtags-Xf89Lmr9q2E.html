to you by gamefly what's up everyone
welcome back there pisode of renter's
rants I roast John renders the show
where I get you rationally upset about
something very silly once a week of this
week brick and hashtags don't hashtag
everything I feel like it's a new ad
hardy shirt people are just doing it
look like d-bags so stop it let me
explain strangers rants go and get
started the first I get hashtags there a
nice easy way to search things start off
you can search them on Twitter and I
didn't Facebook it across multiple
social media channels I get the point
behind hashtags heck we even use them
for a sub uh flow can set a hashtag as
the be I understand why they exist when
people take two crazy advantage of
hashtags and put things like hashtag
best sister EVER 2013 beach time party
love it makes zero sense again if you
want to hashtag things like ask the B or
Kobe or Lakers are the best better than
your team I totally understand that but
when you over use hashtags and only can
you not read it you're trying to say
this makes you look silly I go through
night trying to read social media feeds
and I look at Instagram and going
through Twitter a just see crazy
hashtags that nobody's ever going to
search for hashtags supposed to be
searchable terms you go through and
search for that no one's going to search
for my meal that i ate at 743 is
delicious and better than yours
instagram pic no one's going to search
for that think about what you've
hashtagged recently and if you're one of
those people that's hashtag something
that should be a full complete sentence
you shouldn't be hashtagging it you
should just write that sentence because
no one's gonna search for that
ridiculously long hashtag just just cut
it out people find that it's been really
annoying you for a while and there's co
people in particular that are in my
friend feet and not going to call you
out by name but I do know you watch
these videos hopefully you still want to
be my friend when you want this but cut
out with the hashtags go easy to ash I
find us some people are our own office
use hashtags all the time and I might be
talking about them but hopefully they're
not gonna see this video so am I crazy
wrong here this topic sucks
that would probably be an example of a
hashtag abuser so hashtag don't be like
Ashley hashtag use hashtag responsibly
