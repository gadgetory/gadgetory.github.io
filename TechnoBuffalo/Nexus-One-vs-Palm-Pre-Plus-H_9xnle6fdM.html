technobuffalo here there are a lot of
really good smartphones on the market
right now running very different fully
featured and capable operating systems I
think two of the most interesting on the
market right now the palm pre plus for
verizon wireless and the HTC built-in
nexus one also called the google phone
which is unlocked can be run on
t-mobile's 3g network or a tease edge
the palm pre plus right now is going to
set you back 149 bucks after two year
contract and Mel and rebates nexus one
runs anywhere from 5 29 unlocked about
to 180 subsidized from t-mobile so this
versus video we're going to cover a ton
of categories but in the interest of
brevity not making this an hour video
some things we're going to have to be
cut out we're going to cover specs
browser keyboard navigation app stores
notifications multitasking and a few
intangibles as we go so let's talk about
some of the more salient specs and the
things that I think you need to know
from a weight standpoint the palm pre
plus you're looking at four point eight
nine ounces the nexus one comes in at
4.59 a form factor you've got a
slide-out qwerty keyboard on the palm
pre plus and sort of that river rock
look and feel the nexus one has that
slate form factor very thin and all the
typing is done on screen as we'll see in
our typing test in just a minute so
speaking of the screens the palm pre
plus has a 320 x 480 resolution whereas
the nexus one has a 480 x 800 resolution
we really take advantage of all those
pixels on its 3.7 inch screen let's go
ahead and get to the test the first
thing we're going to cover her browser
is browsers quite a bit now is lead into
my versus videos with a browser
head-to-head so we're going to load
technobuffalo calm on Wi-Fi both devices
are on the same Wi-Fi network so there
shouldn't be a difference in network
speed here they're in a load site that
has been put on here both so images have
been cached so think of it as a real
world test of a site that you visit on a
regular basis so enough of me jibber
jabbering let's go ahead and get started
load them up on each
okay well go ahead which is at the same
time and get started so the palm pre has
about a in the palm pre plus about a 600
megahertz processor compared to the one
gigahertz Snapdragon processor the nexus
one which is actually the fastest
smartphone processor that's widely
available to consumers and right here
you can see the difference in speed
nexus ones already done the palm pre
plus just finishes a few seconds later
and really all of my tests the nexus one
especially on Wi-Fi comes in faster i
think that should just due to the
improved hardware let's take a look the
browser both now feed your native
multi-touch support the nexus one was
endowed with that earlier in the week
let's see how it works here you're
famous pinch and zoom features and it
goes very fast almost no delight as my
fingers move up it adjusts itself
accordingly you can double tap zoom out
an area and of course landscape
everything works there as well then
rotate it back neither of these have
native flash support so you're sort of
looking at apples to apples type of
comparison let's go back to the palm pre
and one last thing i want to mention on
the nexus one as i scroll I don't get
any sort of checker pattern it can keep
up with my finger scrolling and as I
stop it'll sort have a physics engine
that would keep it scrolling depending
on how fast my fingers moving we'll take
a look at things on the palm pre plus
goes very fast but you get a little bit
of a checkerboard pattern it goes away
pretty quickly but it is there as far as
multi-touch very quick there's a small
delay between when your fingers sort of
expand and come back but certainly not
bad at all I mean you can definitely do
the same sort of tapping features as far
as multi-touch browsers go I think this
is probably two of the three best on the
market right now you can't go wrong with
either these browsers are very
full-featured however the faster
processor on the nexus one makes
browsing a little bit more enjoyable a
bit more pleasurable because things do
load much faster and you'll see that
faster processor sort of take advantage
of everything as we continue the tests
but perhaps Wi-Fi was just an anomaly
let's test these things on their known
3g network so we're going to test this
on verizon's 3g and t-mobile 3g i'm
going to turn off the camera and come
back once I've turned Wi-Fi
off all right so you've got Wi-Fi turned
off on both of these I have three bars
of verizon's 3g evdo and I
coincidentally have three bars of
t-mobile's 3g data so it should be a
pretty fair tests go ahead and get
started we're going to load the same
page TechnoBuffalo calm and see how
these things come about it's like I
tapped the palm pre plus just a second
later or something to definitely keep in
mind as we check load speeds so looks
like they're showing content adjust
about the same time next is one almost
done actually you can see the yellow bar
across the top ok the nexus one is done
and the palm pre plus is still going can
see that sort of blue circle fill up
and it's still going almost done I think
this is again a result of the faster
processor t-mobile's network speed at
least test for test is not faster than
verizon's network but the increased
speed in the processor renders pages so
much quicker I mean it looks like the
network speed is so much faster because
the processor and the palm pre plus is
still loading so you can clearly see a
difference in the browser speed i think
that's equated exclusively to the beefy
beefy Qualcomm Snapdragon processor the
nexus one essentially the edge goes to
the nexus one as far as the browser's
multi-touch i think is a little bit
better and loading speed let's go ahead
and check out the keyboard how to input
text on these things well they both do
it in very different ways well collide
open up a notes application or a sort of
text entry on the palm pre plus and show
you what the keyboard looks like all
right opening up a memo application here
okay so let's go ahead and zoom down so
here we've got a blank memo on its
onscreen qwerty keyboard and i will try
typing this is a test and see how it
works out and i have had this phone for
a few weeks I've gotten relatively used
to the keyboard when zoom out just a bit
you can see me do this and let's get
started this is a test campri accurate
let's try one more word about palm pre
so not bad i have gotten a little more
accurate as i'm using it it is missing
sort of a fully functional autocorrect
which comes to be very annoying I've got
relatively big fingers Kingston as I put
them over one key sort of almost covers
for it's definitely a usable chorded
keyboard far as a physical one goes but
it's not one of the best out there if
you have very big fat fingers I tend to
have a larger hands you may have some
trouble typing on this I definitely
recommend going in and giving it a shot
the pixi I think has a little bit more
usable keyboard we'll cover that in
later video series so the moral being on
the palm pre plus it's a usable physical
keyboard but the operating system is
missing some sort of rudimentary
autocorrect features that i would like i
also got used to double tapping on the
space bar for a period there's a period
button right next door to that to be
it's personal preference in for me i
miss it you might not but if I wants it
to bring it to your attention let's take
a look at the nexus one and see how that
handles text entry that uses a a
complete on-screen keyboard let's go
ahead and open up say their memo
application and we'll see how it looks
open up a messaging open up a new
message
okay so this is of course a on-screen
keyboard you can use it either landscape
or portrait here is what the landscape
keyboard looks like then rotate it off
to the side ort it off to the other side
and get a sense of what the portrait
looks like we will try both and I'll
start out typing this is a test and i'll
write google nexus one just as i did
with the last one i'll zoom out just a
little bit senate make you guys blind
you can see that the autocorrect
immediately came into effect if i hit
spacebar it you know will correct it so
this is a cheat a bit accidental but the
autocorrect came right in as far as
other mistakes not completely accurate
but not bad either if i want to double
tap I do get that period let's try
google nexus one
so did some mistakes there nothing I
think you'd have to get used to keyboard
the keyboard I prefer actually I'm sorry
to prefer the on-screen keyboard to
split my in accuracy of the nexus one
but the palm pre plus is a nice
alternative go and turn it sideways and
we'll keep typing I'll try it same thing
one more time this is a test of the
google nexus one
so not so accurate there either big
keyboard is lend itself to accuracy one
interesting thing that this does have my
demonstrated a previous video was
another way to input text and that is
text to speech to go ahead and hit that
actually say what you want it to say and
it will type it right in there it does
do it pretty well this does have a spot
on the keyboard actually meant for a
smiley faces an emoticon throw and tap
that and you can sort of pull up a list
of them together yeah whatever you want
happy sad whatever the rest of those
things mean I'm you do have an option so
I'm not going to call a winner here on
this test can it go down to personal
preference I was a bit more accurate on
the pre pluses keyboard but I preferred
the on-screen bigger keyboard of the
nexus one so this one I'm going to call
it a draw and I think you're gonna have
to decide the winner depending on which
one you like more so we're going to move
on to navigation both these things
handle navigation a bit differently it's
take a look first at the palm pre plus
so unlock it slide to unlock and we're
here on the main home screen you might
think that there's a lot of wasted space
here you get a row of icons across the
bottom that are customizable you can
pull up the menu icon the launcher and
you can scroll and see the different
choices and you can move these around in
any order that you like now there aren't
really many physical buttons on the
nexus one you have a gesture area right
here on the initial around sorry on the
palm pre on the initial palm pre that
was a button that button is gone
replaced a touch-sensitive led you can
see it as I wave my finger over it saw
light up and if you tap that that will
bring up sort of your open windows I
don't have any right now and it also
serves as a gesture area for going back
and forth and web pages or bringing up
the quick launcher you can see right
there let's go and open up a card I'll
show you what it looks like we'll open
up a web browser and will open up say
Twitter application they can see right
here this will handle multitasking me
very well I can tap that open up Twitter
and that'll go ahead and launch for me
I'll handle both at the same time which
really makes for a very enjoyable
experience I'm a big fan of webos I
think this handles multitasking probably
better than any phone out there other
than test run words had actually 50
programs open
once they all work sort of very well and
without many hiccups so if i want to go
to the webpage i can just tap it if i
want to go back to deck your cart
feature go ahead and tap that button
down below and i can navigate right on
over to the deck cards now if i want to
close something I just swipe it up and
that is now closed in a lot of using
system memory okay shut down everything
same thing for phone whenever you like
everything on the device is treated as
its own card so you really have control
over what you're using so let's take a
look at navigation on the nexus one
slides unlock seems to be a pretty
standard theme so you get a bit more
customization not say with the nexus one
you've got five home screens go ahead
and scroll over to all of them if you
want to jump from one home screen to the
next you can go ahead and tap on those
buttons in the bottom left or right you
get sort of a deck of cards feature that
we saw on the palm pre pick the screen
you want and you jump right back to it
you're the ability to customize really
anything you want on the home screen so
I've got a widget right across the top
that shows me my network connections if
I tap and hold down I get pic other
widgets and there are some some pretty
good ones to choose from and you can
download many many more from the android
marketplace i'll go back you can put
folders change your wallpapers to get
these live wallpapers you can see in the
background it's actually moving or you
can put a contact directly onto the
homescreen a navigation is done pretty
much with your finger there is a
trackball here I don't use that that
much it's mostly flick scrolling
pinching and zooming and that sort of
thing for the navigation it is very
smooth and a really nice seamless
experience I personally enjoy sort of
the fun of webos and be able to the
ability to throw cards away and launch
them but you know they both handle
multitasking and let me show you how the
nexus one handles that so if i go ahead
and hold down the home button pulls up
this bar of open applications so
messaging is what i had open we're not
sharing it a keyboard the browser we had
during the last test I can jump to
either one of those and I'll immediately
be there and it handles multitask and
quite nice doesn't Leo pin' as many as
you want I believe it's got a limit of
five applications but you can jump
through and
take things very easily go back to
messaging and there I am without any
sort of delay one thing that I don't
like about navigation on this phone or
these touch sensitive bottom buttons
across the bottom they are not so
accurate and don't respond very well to
touch if I use sort of my finger and I
tap they don't always work you have to
serve sometimes hold it down to get it
to function a little bit better it
doesn't happen all the time but
definitely as use the device you will
notice it as I think a bit of an
annoyance let's go ahead and move on to
the app stores they both have the sort
of own apt catalogs or app distribution
centers the palm pre plus has an app
catalog aren't many applications in it
now as we speak but palm is really
pushing heavy developers and developers
incentives and of the launch of this on
verizon wireless is now has two carriers
getting a lot more interest from dev so
you should see plenty more things on
here it's got a pretty nice look and
feel to it it's nice and smooth I'm
running this again just over 3g network
things you would expect to be on here
Pandora Twitter clients messaging
clients they're all here this can handle
3d gaming just as a nexus one can but
sort of there's not that much available
as far as content you can find some
games where I say on the Android
Marketplace you'd find 10 or 11
different applications that make you
Twitter or if you're looking for on the
palm pre and they're really a catalog
you're going to find maybe one or two so
of course android is has a fantastic app
store we're going to open our up here
called android marketplace you can go
through and view just thousands and
thousand thousands of applications the
majority of which are free you have to
pick serve App Store app store you're
going to be hard pressed to be the
android marketplace i'm going to put
these two heads ahead just based on the
bevy of free applications and the
content that's available you know next
year at this time Paul may very well
caught up and it could be a drop but
this one clearly has to go to Android
and that's true of any Android device
not just the nexus one so let's talk
about notifications and how it handles
notifications what they both do it very
differently the nexus one for example
and really all google phones have
notifications up top via this
notifications bar go ahead and pull that
down see I've got you know a few emails
right there and go and tap it and launch
it for me I can swipe that up
and then go away and I get notifications
across the top and bottom right here on
the palm pre plus your notifications
that will show up right at the bottom
let me show you what those look like ok
so I'm a text message it just came
through here and I've got that little
icon in the bottom right now if I had a
new email that would be an envelope and
that'll show up really any where I am if
I go ahead and tap it I'll tell me what
it is so I've got that message from
myself Jonathan rettinger I can tap it
and view it or I can swipe it away and
there were multiple notifications they
would all sort of show up right there so
i'll go ahead and swipe that away and
it's gone i could go right up to the
application if I it tapped it but I like
the swiping a sort of a fun I turned of
enjoyable experience from I don't know
why it's very satisfactory to just swipe
the thumb away and see it go so when it
comes down to sort of the intangibles
both devices this is where things get
tricky I prefer web OS as an operating
system but i prefer the hardware on the
nexus one fat a pick one of these two
devices to use on a daily basis I have
to side with the nexus one I think that
the processor really gives it an edge
and almost everything that you do from
browser speed looking at pictures to
contact navigation to scrolling to
everything it's just an edge solely
based on processor if the palm pre plus
had a bit faster processor and a little
more horsepower I think would be a very
easy decision for me to side with the
palm pre pushes because I enjoy the
operating system a bit more androids
very full-featured I think I could use
it every day and be pretty happy so this
one again going to come down to your
choice see where you get reception for
both if you get good reception for
either I'd be hard pressed and not
recommend the nexus one which
coincidentally will be coming to verizon
in the coming months so if you're
holding out for a new phone you might
want to try to pulled out just a bit
longer and I know it's got a bit
long-winded to thank you for sticking
with me I am jon rettinger from
TechnoBuffalo with a head-to-head
comparison video for you of the palm pre
plus and the google nexus one i'll see
you in the next video bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
