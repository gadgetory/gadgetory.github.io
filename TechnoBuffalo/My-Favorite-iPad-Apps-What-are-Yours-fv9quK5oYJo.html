technobuffalo here every few months I
like to do a what's on my ipad update
there are a lot of really cool
applications out there and in the
comments oftentimes I learned about new
apps and I never knew of so most times
as videos are really just for my benefit
to learn some of the cool things that
you guys have found for your iPad's so
let's go ahead and get started alright
so my first screen here of apps and see
there's a search there's nothing really
fancy probably most the same
applications that you guys have leads
off with YouTube I actually watch a ton
of YouTube videos on here now if airplay
I just fling them to my apple TV
downstairs and just watch whatever I
like it's a lot of fun to be able to
watch youtube videos and keep always on
my subscriptions and learn about new
tech and cars and all the other stuff
that I like right on the iPad next we've
got photos and obviously everybody knows
photos notes Game Center I books and
videos all pretty standard stuff next is
skyfire it is actually a iphone
application but it does let you view hmm
some flash content i served in a whole
demonstration of this in a iphone
overview of what it does can see i was
looking at a puppy videos my wife and i
are considering getting a dog it'll play
flash content some of it not all of it
it'll buffer it down there and you hit
play and it goes ahead and just plays if
you want a full demonstration of skyfire
i'll put a link to it down below and
then of course settings but that's not
all go ahead a continued nothing really
out of the ordinary at the top here
contacts itunes ipod maps petfinder
mentioned that whole looking for a dog
thing it's got a list of all the dogs
that are available for adoption in your
area at your area by breathe by sides
and stuff you can see it's scaled all
poorly so it is an iphone application
but it's funny if we're looking to adopt
an animal and seeing dogs cats others
and the alike next Pages Numbers and
Keynote obviously if you want to edit
and create some of your Word PowerPoint
Excel or I work s the documents that's
going to be the way to go I do a lot
reading and sometimes I do the reading
on the ipad and i feel like my eyes
really need some abuse i will head on
over to the kindle store year which is
right there have got it on my computer
i've got a kindle application so it's
nice to be able to keep all my books
within that ecosystem analytics HD is an
application that lets me actually get
access to google analytics so i can
track trends and track traffic things
like that there is an iphone version as
well next is sportscenter this is an
application that I probably look at more
than I should I can see all my favorite
teams you can set up whatever teams you
like so I of course a Southern
California sports guy so i got my lakers
Bruins and angels you go ahead and see
all the news that's here today it's kind
of cool you can go ahead and watch what
you like but also will play videos from
espn.com sort of right in the browser so
go ahead hit play and all that content
will buffer up now you can go to
espn.com and actually still watch some
of those videos and get a lot of the
same article content this is just
optimized for the ipad i kind of like
the ticker at the bottom all i do
oftentimes still go to espn.com so that
is the ESPN f the weather channel i have
a weird obsessive-compulsive thing where
i was got to know what the weather is
outside that i always have to know what
time it is there's got to be some behind
that but to sort of feed my diseases i
guess this is the weather channel app
like to know sort of what it is like
outside i am in irvine in Southern
California right now I know people you
some guys might be a little upset 53
degrees Fahrenheit I went to college in
upstate New York in Rochester I look at
the weather oftentimes in Rochester saw
they've got dumped and snow it's like
four degrees so I'm very happy to be
where it does not snow and it's quite
warm that is the weather channel there's
a ton of weather apps am I missing one
that might feed my addiction a bit
better I love to hear from you guys next
wall street journal which is in my
opinion one of the killer apps for the
ipad it's a great way to go ahead and
keep up on all of your journal content
and see actually i haven't read it in
about two weeks we'll go and open up an
older issue and i can show you what this
looks like it looks very similar
obviously to the wall street journal
that's its name it's loading up
back issue here sometimes take some time
if you leave the application open and
then close it will download the stuff in
the background I hadn't opened it in
about a week so you can go ahead and go
through and sort of view different pages
you can pull down and jump to different
sections and jump back out to different
issues if you like so go ahead and back
and launch Monday's you go ahead and
jump to your sections free Wall Street
Journal and pick where you want to go
marketplace whatever it might be if you
find an article that you like so let's
say I want to read about fiat 500 new
car coming to the u.s. actually saw it
at the LA auto show looks sort of very
mini like I was going to build from
Carlo and I some cheaper safe very fuel
efficient way to travel so you want to
read article you're reading it ok you're
done you can pinch back supposed to be
able to pinch back and go back to where
you're there you go all right that's the
wall street journal that is a
subscription service Bloomberg is a
great way to track stocks there are ton
of stock applications out there I like
Bloomberg gives you almost real-time
updates for your stock portfolio next is
netflix netflix is kind of a must-have
so actually now they've got that the web
only option lets me check out my content
although i know i say it's must have but
i don't really use it that much anymore
I made spent on that much free time or
I'm just not watching that much
streaming content however I always like
to know that it's there to comfort it
like a warm glass of milk a good reader
is an application that's super important
for an iPad lets you open other document
files that maybe you couldn't open if
you didn't have the Pages Numbers and
Keynote option a few other file formats
it looks pretty straightforward the sort
of the UI isn't very exciting gonna
actually end up opening the application
quite a bit or sorry you don't open the
application at all oftentimes when you
an attachment the last if you want open
it using good reader and it's more of
just a conduit for opening content Angry
Birds of course here's my Angry Birds of
bragging which is awful you notice that
I am horribly musically not gifted
that's original Angry Birds games not
seasons or Halloween i'm still trying to
beat it Oh get there eventually um this
powerful big
sometimes expensive tablet is often
times turned into just a big calculator
for me so I've got two calculator
options here jumbo and calculator so if
you want to calculate others are good
things to do the next one here is atomic
browser there's a paid version this is
the light one it's a safari replacement
actually has a lot of really really cool
features this might actually merit its
own video but let me just show you guys
real quickly what this is so pretty
simply it's a web browser you noticed
tabs their play a pretty prominent role
let's go ahead and let's open up a
website and this should look pretty
familiar so I'll go ahead and jump into
it say technobuffalo dot-com and let's
see you can open up in a the same tab
you can go ahead and start new tabs just
kind of neat and they'll stay open right
across the top so a great way to sort of
jump back and forth in between tabs
didn't have to serve hit another button
and get your window to find the window
you want and then jump to it there are a
lot of really good settings too so
you've got a private mode which
sometimes you might want a lock rotation
and cream font size hide the tab bar if
you don't like it there and they're just
a ton of other settings here I can go
ahead and go through get a lot more
customization you don't necessarily get
with safari so looking for another
browser one that you're not going to
lose functionality from Safari doc
you're going to gain options I check out
atomic next I've got pac-man pac-man
again sort of the as powerful and
everything that the ipad can do up in
time to find myself using it for the
simplest of tasks and I love me some
pac-man so it's a great way to get your
pack on financial time is mobile edition
i just downloaded this and it's super
suck like reading the Financial Times
that this is some odd subscription model
doesn't really get access to much
content you get like snippets of things
not that interviews with the Financial
Times Europe but it does have that sort
of salmon pinkish hue like your
newspaper does so that's fun and I think
that that is it I use twitterrific as my
main Twitter client so far email
calendar app store all that stuff you
guys have seen before so I want to know
what applications i'm missing is there
something that's going to do an awesome
job it's something that you think
everybody should know about if it's a
great application and i find myself
using a lot i'm going to share with the
audience this is a really fun way for us
to interact and share some information
so i want to hear about your ipad apps
it'll make one of these videos to up for
the iphone and I guess I am jon
rettinger from technobuffalo and I will
see you in the next video creepy vibe</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
