technobuffalo here is an unboxing of the
latest and greatest 3d hotness this is
the evo 3d for sprint the spiritual and
literal successor to the first 4g
smartphone ever released on the market
the evo 4g so let's go ahead dig in and
see if it's worthy of that extra deep
alright so this guy is going to be
available on jun 24th you're going to
want to check your local sprint retailer
on time retailer for pricing because it
does always change here's a box pretty
minimal got the white display with the
evo 3d printed right there nothing
overly exciting I've got all the press
materials covered up there that's where
all the phone number information is go
ahead and slide it out of the box and
here we've got the evo 3d looking very
normal evil like let's go ahead and push
and push it out and now it doesn't look
very normal evil like there's a lot of
stuff on here we'll take a look at that
in just a moment push it right off to
the side let's see what else we are
going to get in the box we're going to
have a getting started guide and the
rest that stuff no one's ever going to
read got your micro USB charging cable
and we've got the wall adapter no
headphones nothing else found in there
those are the accessories push those off
to the side that's not the exciting part
let's take a look at the evo 3d and
let's run through the specs I'll let it
do a boot up while we are talking about
it so there is a lot of stuff to talk
about here first is that 4.3 inch
diagonal screen that size hasn't changed
what's new now though is a 3d LCD
display it's got a resolution of 540 x
960 here you can see it's running HTC's
new sense 3.0 interface thing feels very
very nice in the hand a little bit on
the large side but we'll get to those in
just a minute it's got one gigabyte of
RAM of course it's got 4g support and
that's Prince of wimax flavor 802 11 BG
and
n android 2.3 so you can get some taste
it tasted gingerbread going on on the
back is where a lot of the action
happens so first you got two cameras one
of those cameras is your 5 megapixel
camera shooter which augmented by dual
LED flash and of course autofocus dual
LEDs kind of looks like a robot face
with the eyes and the nose maybe that's
just me it's going to be able to record
video we're hearing in 1080p but there
been conflicting reports that perhaps
it's only 720p so I'll turn it on and
we'll check that out but the official
respect to do say 1080p it can also
shoot stereoscopic 3d movies and
pictures which is going to do at only 2
megapixel resolution so something to
keep in mind and stereoscopic 3d is 3d
without the glasses same thing that the
Nintendo 3ds uses the guys ever used or
had in those baseball cards when your
kid that as you moved it you saw the bat
swing that's very similar to
stereoscopic 3d yet to be sitting right
in the right spot at just the right
angle and then you can see all of the 3d
action all right so let's go ahead and
continue and run down the specs all of
this power is going to be coming from a
1730 milliamp hour battery you do have a
front facing camera as well it lives
right up there so you can get your skype
on from a dimension standpoint it is
five inches long two point six inches on
the width and point four seven inches on
the thickness and it weighs six ounces
and all of this is being powered by a
1.2 gigahertz dual-core Snapdragon chip
so this guy has a lot of power in it so
you've seen HTC Sense three-point Oh
first time we've seen it is on the HTC
Sense station sort of its stablemate
this guy available on t-mobile they're
very similar in the spec department
although of course the evo 3d does bring
3d to the mix but in case you were cross
shopping honest if you look like next to
each other there you go it is a super
phone well half sandwich missing the
meet in the middle so let's go ahead and
see what we got on
advice you got your typical Android
buttons encapsulated here in those
circles likely become familiar with on
the original evo 3d so you got your home
button your menu button you're back in
your search on the left hand side your
micro USB charging ports going to live
up on the left on the top 3.5 million
get your headset jack power and lock on
the right there's a lotta action
happening here on the right let's go
ahead and take a look at this so we've
got a giant camera shutter button right
there if you felt like you needed a
dedicated camera shutter button and a
big one at that this is going to be
quite nice for you've got a 3d to 2d
switch right there I will say that just
on holding this device while I've been
testing it that camera but is huge and
definitely hits your hand if you're
going to hold it with your right there's
a bit of a ridge or you can see it it's
not necessarily sharp but you definitely
feel it sort of glide as you're holding
the phone something to keep in mind on
the back that's where all the 3d action
is going to take place back here it's
kind of texturized and fuels a very nice
almost like a rubbery feel different
than the soft touch we've seen before
hope you guys are able to see that get
picked up on the camera it's got a
really high quality feel to it as
typical of HTC devices then you've got
the front-facing camera on the front so
this has been an unboxing and first look
at the brand new coming out soon evo 3d
for Sprint is this the phone that you
guys are looking at that you really want
to see I'm kind of curious let's go and
take one look at the camera and see how
the 3d business happens so looks like we
are we're in 2d mode so we can snap
normal 2d pictures see there's my hand
what if we slip this over 23 B so let's
see what happens and now we are shooting
in 3d supposedly let's go ahead and snap
a quick damage my dirty desk so does the
autofocus business and it snaps it and
I'm looking at it right now you
obviously can't see this but perhaps you
can see the image change we've got some
3d stuff right there so let me go ahead
and open up the image go ahead and take
a look we'll go ahead and go to pictures
which should be located somewhere on
here you can see all the HTC Sense
three-point oh goodness that you're
going
yet sort of broken down someone's got to
see pictures on there somewhere I can
see you guys probably yelling in the
comments it's right there but I will
find it because I can't read your
comments in real time unfortunately I'll
go read them afterwards photos photos
photos camera i can probably get to it
from there but now i feel like i need to
find the pictures gallery there it is
alright so let's see what three pictures
look like in here certainly you i can be
able to tell camera shots so when you
take them in three you get a little 3d
image right there we'll go ahead and
jump into that one now you're not gonna
be able to see that this is in 3d
probably it's gonna look weird and
blurry to you but as I move this around
I can see the image changing and it does
look to be in 3d probably get the same
similar eyestrain you have with
stereoscopic 3d although we'll use this
for a while and see if that still true
here and see if the 3d is more of a
gimmick or an actual selling point so
unfortunately you can't see the 3d but I
can I know guys what do you guys think
of the evo 3d is it your next smartphone
are you going to pass what do you guys
think in general i'm jon rettinger from
technobuffalo and i'll see you and talk
to you and tell you bad jokes in the
next video bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
