John Rhett enger' from TechnoBuffalo
here one of the most compelling new
features in the iPhone 4 is that little
guy right there the front-facing camera
which is tied into Apple's new FaceTime
video chat software so I want to give
you a Democrat all receive a call switch
to FaceTime and vice versa and this is
only going to function if you are on a
Wi-Fi network so I've got one of my
viewers and regular callers to live in
show Tony marlo here I'm going to go
ahead and give him a call and see how
this looks I'm going to call him
normally first and you see when I make
the call that there's now a new FaceTime
little icon right there I'll put on
speaker
it's just a regular phone call hi Tony
Oh Tony are you there perfect so you can
see right now we've got the regular row
of icon but we're used to say hold you
now have a FaceTime video camera so I go
ahead and push that we're going to see
eight a video call to Tony to be able to
see me you guys can see me they're sort
of on camera and the front-facing camera
is actually not bad the VGA resolution
looks pretty decent now it says
connecting and there you can see Tony
and Tony won't you wave your hand a
little bit and say say hello to the
audience people can see R the quality
alright so you can see the quality Tony
looks pretty good Tony move the camera
around a little bit so you can see how
it looks sort of show the background
alright perfect you can see that things
actually look pretty nice and you can
switch front facing the back facing in
the bottom right hand corner there's a
little icon and go ahead and switch that
Tony just did it I can switch that right
there now it's looking at my office in
the desk you can also take this phone
and switch it over and switch landscapes
and now you can see sort of another icon
another view and I can actually pick
this right here and I can move it
anywhere I want so I can pick the views
and say I want to go back to the front
facing but Tony has got a much better
view than I do and then there I am right
back so Tony I'm going to hang up from
you right now and you can guys can hear
by the way that this is now over voice
over IP or VoIP and the quality is very
good and when you
switch to FaceTime it's a seamless
transition it actually does not use your
80 minutes so Tony I'm going to ask you
to now to give me a call and see how
this works so I'm going to hang up from
you and go ahead and give me a ring back
over a standard phone call will switch
over to FaceTime so Tony's going to give
me a call back here is the home screen
again on the iPhone 4 and we'll see how
this looks when you receive a call and
you switch to FaceTime then I'll have
Tony call me directly from FaceTime
slurries regular call so there's Tony
I'm gonna put him on speaker Tony are
you there
alright now go ahead and to add FaceTime
we can see how long this takes so tell
me when you push it alright so you can
sort of see the time so would like to
FaceTime and Kate accept or decline go
ahead and accept it and takes probably
another 3 or 4 seconds and there we go
so about four to five seconds overall
which is pretty fast and now we are
seamless transition over a Wi-Fi to
FaceTime
so Tony now I'm going to call you back
right over FaceTime directly and not go
through the 18t route and see how that
works so go ahead and close out of there
and now if I want to call somebody
that's got FaceTime I can go ahead and
either initiate a FaceTime or they make
sure his numbers not going to show up
here when I do it so I can go right -
right - Tony I'm going to cover up his
phone number here but when you go ahead
and select a contact you're not gonna
have a new icon my phone keeps raining
here now we have a new icon that says
FaceTime so let me show you again what
that looks like so there it is right
there it says FaceTime so I'm going to
go ahead and call Tony directly from
FaceTime so now we're sort of getting
the AT&amp;amp;T proud of this we're just using
the voice over IP Wi-Fi client and now
here we are Tony now Tony Allman asked
you to call me directly over FaceTime if
you don't mind all right and then we can
sort of see what that looks like as well
so there's a FaceTime would like to
FaceTime accepted recline looks pretty
standard and now we will be connected in
just a few seconds over FaceTime in
theory there we are
Tony thank you very much hoping to
demonstration I appreciate it
bye-bye all right so that was a
demonstration of FaceTime the new video
chat application for the iPhone 4 it
looks to be very useful I'm actually
very very surprised about how crisp and
clear the video quality actually is it's
not for that pixelated thing that I
expected so things probably can depend
on the strength of your Wi-Fi network
where I am right here evidently where
Tony was things work very nicely so
whenever your iPhone 4 is come be sure
to get your video chat on any other
features that you guys want to see
demonstrate on the iPhone 4 be sure to
