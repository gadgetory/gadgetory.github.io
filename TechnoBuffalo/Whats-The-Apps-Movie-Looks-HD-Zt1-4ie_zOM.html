you by hostgator well how's it going
there G thing
thug life dog house is John Q here from
TechnoBuffalo and welcome to what's the
apps in this episode I'm gonna be
talking about a color grading
application for iOS called movie looks
HD now before I get into this I must say
that the moment I got into video making
I've been fascinated with color and in
the world of video making manipulating
color beyond color correction is called
color grading color grading is used to
give a certain look or feel to enhance
your footage or to even help tell your
story better red giant is known for its
library of color grading software
especially plugins like Magic Bullet
Looks which sells for four hundred
dollars so it's red giant software's
movie looks HD like the mobile version
of their highly acclaimed Magic Bullet
Looks
well just have to find out right now
kind of cheesy ending to that intro
blast vine I like this voice I'm on the
radio yes okay
exciting to give you guys some quick
background information I color great all
the time but I do it in really really
subtle way I might make the background a
little bit dimmer or change the color
contrast between the background and my
skin the price for movie looks HD is
$1.99 from the Apple App Store with
support for both the iPhone and the iPad
for that price I was super excited to
try it out when you first open the
application it asks to enable location
services normally I keep location
services off because I don't use it and
I believe it just helps with battery
life but I found out that this app
absolutely requires it even to just load
up your camera's footage why I don't
know idea maybe Red John software is
collecting localization data for
something the intro screen was a little
confusing to me usually when you open an
application they show you a loading
image then the full app appears but for
movie looks you have to tap start movie
looks which sort of blends in
the background don't you think when you
open the video that you want a grade you
have the option to trim it which is
quite handy to be honest about this look
at me all happy light in such walking
down the street like that time to select
your grade you're presented with a total
of 40 different styles under preset
subheadings some of them are pretty
obvious like black and white blockbuster
in popular film but what does quick and
essential mean I don't know picking a
filter is pretty easy just swipe tap and
go the thumbnail previews help give you
an idea of what the final grades will
look like some grades are playfully
named after certain movies or TV shows
these are only my guesses of course but
I must say Currahee emulates a Band of
Brothers look optimist for the look from
the more recent transformer films and
neo for that matrix look want to make
your video look like the matrix heck
yeah I do mr. Anderson I was pretty
disappointed to see that you couldn't
really do anything to tweak the grade
you only have a strength or brightness
meter I was kind of hoping to have been
yets color wheels and all that fancy
stuff you get with magical it looks but
hey it's only an iPhone app to make it
worse it doesn't render in the
background if the app is minimized once
everything is done the final file will
be in your camera roll album and there
you have it folks graded footage right
on your iPhone speaking of graded
footage I'm gonna take some time to give
a shout-out to Hostgator don't you love

Skippy that's a great deal back to the
review so overall I would say that the
practicality of the application is
pretty limited
sure grating footage is fun but it's not
as fun when you're grading options are
limited and not to mention the render
times my goodness mr. Anderson Oh
my goodness so for that I'd have to get
movie looks HD a 2 out of 5 save your
money and your time just grade your
iPhone footage on your computer so if
you really really really want something
on your iOS device to collaborate on the
go I guess pick up movie looks HD but
other than that no man stick with the
computer stuff that thing back there
that computer monitor pretty ballin
pretty ballin I hope you guys enjoyed
this video this was John Q from
TechnoBuffalo and I'll see you guys next
time it is</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
