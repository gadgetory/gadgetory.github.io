technobuffalo and every now and again on
YouTube people like to make videos
showcasing their top favorite
applications on their phones and jon
rettinger or I'm gonna call him Jake is
jay is easier Jay asked me to show you
guys my top five right now i am using
the iphone 4 and I'm not really an appt
person so won't go to the App Store
download everything and try out
everything but there are certain apps
which I do use every single day so here
are my top 5 non-default iPhone
applications number 5 netflix i don't
use this one every single day but when i
do it is awesome it's like the iphone
eyes version of their website which is
basically what an application is the
application is free but i think you need
to be subscribed to their services to
use it which i think it's only eight
bucks a month since i live in canada the
selection isn't too great let's see
Anastasia spongebob epic my boys I don't
know something I love about Netflix is
the resume feature it syncs with your
online netflix accounts so say if you
watch something on your computer you can
resume it on your phone and vice versa
and as you guys can see I've been
getting my hoarders fixed song and oh
yes the quality is amazing and I can't
really show you because of copyright
mm-hmm but the quality is the same as
the iPhone YouTube quality even over 3g
big win right there number 4 rtm or
remember the milk this is a really cool
to do service that pushes alerts and
sinks and that is you guys can see I
like things that sink then like Netflix
the application is free but you need to
pay for their services which i think is
about twenty dollars a year it shows you
what you have do today do tomorrow or
reduce stuff lists and so on looks like
I still got to get my exercise and brain
challenge sessions on for today you can
also mark things complete and complete
postponed to do note it's just awesome
number three echofon echofon is an
alternative iphone twitter application
there's a free version which is what i
have in a paid ad free version I know
the iphone has an official twitter
client but i like echofon better for one
reason and one reason alone you can
retweet with a comment which is
something you can't do with the updated
iphone twitter client i did some
research and apparently Twitter doesn't
like the quotes old retweeting style
where you know you add your comment with
retweet but i like doing that because
like sharing my thoughts opinions of
feelings other than that it's just an
all-around slick and simple torta
application and it works great number to
a note awesome knows it's a free version
with a limited amount of notes that you
can save or paid version which is what I
have with unlimited amount of notes that
you can save usually I don't like apps
at deviate away from the iphone you I
because I like things simple and
consistent but man the UI is gorgeous on
top of gorgeous you can customize the
colors of the folders the icons to font
the paper the background is just really
beautiful and oh yes it can sync with
your Google Documents epic I use notes
all the time to write down video ideas
reminders and so on and I stuck with a
default iphone notes application for a
long time because I was like why do I
need to pay for a new notes application
but man the folders Google sinking the
UI awesome note so good to good number
one skype i have never seen such a well
integrated mobile application ever and
with skype branding is sort of like
having an extra phone line on your phone
I you Skype every single day for both
business and personal but not for the
whole IM and voice chatting thing i have
an unlimited US and canada calling
subscription with skype which allows me
to call any US and canadian landline or
cell phone number and talk for as long
as I want you for only three bucks a
month seriously that is amazing on the
phone side of things it works just like
the iphones phone app that's weird to
say both for dialing out and receiving
and to make it even better it works over
Wi-Fi and 3g and the people who have
called over 3g say the quality is just
fine so technically if you have a good
data plan and some sort of unlimited
skype thingy you could be getting
unlimited calling which is awesome well
i hope you guys enjoy me sharing my top
by BATS my main man met he's starting to
pc vs mac series here in TechnoBuffalo
i'll get j to post a link down there and
until next time guys keep up the awesome</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
