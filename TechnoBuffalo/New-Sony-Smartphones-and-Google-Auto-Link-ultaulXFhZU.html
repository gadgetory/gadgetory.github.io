to you by Linda calm what's up everyone
will go back to episode of rumor roundup
I'm your host Jon renders to show her I
take all the dead groomers from the week
and a dig through my pick through them
and I figure out what I think is the
three to five most interesting rumors of
the week of this week Google is trying
to get in your car it's not enough
they're everywhere else new Sony phones
looking to be pretty hot and even more
iphone 6 5.5 inch rumors free iPhone
hated I didn't include the 4.7 inch
model so consider that a favor does
rumor roundup let's start rounding them
up let's start with the big G according
to auto news google has plans to invade
its own ink our solution coming up at
Google i/o really just next week it's
not really a big surprise given Apple
has also been showing intense interest
and which stare at while you're driving
the folks outer news claim Google
solution will differ and that'll sort of
project data from Android onto the car's
dashboard screen rather than just
integrating the whole thing like carplay
does so Google was supposed that users
be able to control the experience with
their cars dial and buttons give them
full control without needing to touch
their phone at all which is good you
should be doing that anyway we're
driving Google set to plan to detail a
system at i/o which again is just next
week but no partners are going to be
announced fabulous be kind of a beta
access other this year's remember at
Google launched an android-based open
automotive alliance with Audi Hyundai
honda kia and nvidia and this appears to
be the first major product to emerge
from the skunkworks lab that they have
Auto link is expected to be available
for driver sometime this year so
definitely be good time to decode the
system has to offer to make sense what
happened to the year so soon but I think
Google in your car wasn't the biggest
fan of car play with an apple did it's
kind of just bigger icons figure almost
your Cardassia already does I don't know
didn't really do much for me hopefully
Google system though will be a little
bit better love to hear thoughts on it
leave in the comments okay down here so
I think Sonja's been on a tear releasing
some pretty awesome smartphones of cats
past couple years is z2 z1 before thats
minis and some giant ones is ton of
awesome new phones are come out
there and according to the rumors sony
has at least three new smartphones
coming down the pipeline on that
information came from the Chinese forums
one poster there so that devices are
currently code named Pegasus aries and
leo I let him provide any information on
the new devices other than they are more
likely than two months away from launch
hopefully more information will be
written in the stars oh alright so
that's actually a bit of a hint however
in September is just over two months
away from now and that's when the ephah
or is a trade show kicks off in Berlin
last year's sony use the show to invade
xperia z1 this xperia z2 was already
announced in Barcelona back in February
it's possible that one of the coding
devices is the Xperia z3 or Zed
threesome yellow me which might make its
debut in Berlin the other two mid
devices are probably going to be
mid-range phones to sort of meet the
more affordable market might see an
official Xperia z2 compact the exact
same time but we really don't know but
what do however is that there's room for
starting to improve its handsets in this
coming months the LG g3 out now and it's
crazy quad HD display it's possible if
somebody wants to match that with a quad
HD handset of it's very own it's also
possible we'll see the Snapdragon 805
frost inside of the device which is
likely to hit the market very very
students are flooding high-end devices
but don't worry we will be at IFA in
Germany so these devices do come fill
out video hands on and just get all
geeky over them to get our greasy hands
on the skreets I think somebody's made
some of the best screens out recently I
love to see what they have coming out
would serve quad HD I think we look
awesome along they don't secure it with
waterproofness I don't take a CLE of a
home run on our hands we get right back

TechnoBuffalo let's ly and ta com such
TechnoBuffalo back to rumors and last
but definitely not least jimmy lin i
kept saying jeremy lin every time I read
this is Jimmy lid not the basketball
player plays for the Rockets he is a
Taiwanese supastar brought us in the
very first images of the iphone 5c
obviously not recently when it was first
thing leaked and last week pictures of
the alleged iPhone 6 it's got a new
picture to share Lynn recently published
a photo to Weibo that shows a giant 5.5
which iphone 6 next to another iphone
presumably the iphone 5s which is fixing
because it's got a cracked screen sad
face Jimmy the device is clearly much
more in the phablet territory which has
been term dominated by android phone
makers and some windows phones recently
Apple might enter this fray sometime
this fall with its newer and larger
beefier maybe more sexy iphone 6 to
complement a smaller 4.7 inch iphone 6
also expect hit in September you like
super close like this we don't have to
dumb a unit or real unit but we can also
see appears to be touch ID around the
home button I mean the fingerprint
reader isn't being sacrificed at all so
that's good you can expect it would be
they got more real estate we don't know
if this legitimate uh but you know Lynn
said access earlier device in the past
or at least very accurate dummy units so
I don't know it might be true you can
also see the power buttons been moved to
the side sort of other small tweaks but
it's a bigger iphone which people have
been wanting at least Apple now Chris I
didn't give you a choice 4.7 5.5
personally one giant phone that's just
me looks like it's coming and coming
soon you know maybe an announcement
sometime in August rly September get
your hands on whatever is gonna be
running iOS right out of the box you
