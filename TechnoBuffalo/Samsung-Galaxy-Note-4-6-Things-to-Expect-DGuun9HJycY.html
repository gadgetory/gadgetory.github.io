TechnoBuffalo here samsung recently
announced it's going to hold a press
conference in all really all over the
world Berlin New York and Beijing on sep
tember third which is the day before my
birthday the invite pretty much
confirmed that this is where Samsung is
going to announce sequel to this guy the
Galaxy Note 3 so probably going to be
called the Galaxy Note 4 will see it for
the very first time we now though have
some concrete details thinks earlier
leaks this week so without further ado
let's run down the top six features to
expect on the Galaxy Note 4 number one a
quad HD display and some fresh hardware
I sort of threw in there under that same
number one this one's pretty much a
given at this point we're definitely
specting Samsung to reveal a 5.7 inch
quad HD display with Samsung Galaxy Note
4 which all to compete hopefully super
aggressively against the already
ridiculously awesome and badass LG g3
which already has got that same high
resolution screen samsung is pretty much
the Yoda of display technology are
hoping that this one's gonna just blow
us away based on the most recent crop of
photos though we think the device is
going to have me red shed display so
with just Dean you tiny little bezels to
which should make it look dead sexy and
finally we're looking at a small speed
bump probably a Snapdragon 805 chip in
some markets although it's likely
Samsung will toss in a new exitos chip
for other areas like they like to do
maybe Europe and Asia also should see a
16 megapixel camera on the back as well
so that we should have lumped that went
into like three but star diamond sake
let's make it just one because we had
someone to talk about that would mean
we're out number two virtual reality
plugin so in July some spilled APK files
the galaxy note 4 revealed some features
we can probably expect we already know
Samsung's working with the crazy awesome
folks in oculus on their own VR headset
it's going to work with Lena smartphones
Galaxy Note 4 has a VR setup wizard stub
ap can suggest and introduce a virtual
reality headset in tandem with the phone
and that's a virtual reality headset in
samsung galaxy note 4 will work hand in
hand other APK files though do support
the quad HD display new SL 3.5 software
and a fingerprint reader a verte reality
headset is largely expected to function
similarly to google cardboard which is
kind of funny to say sir free as a
shallot can be paired with
Alex your product/service full function
virtual reality headset essentially
means to be like this on your head it's
kind of like look around just like I can
see things so it's a fancy version of
what they could do with guard board I
mean at number three new note-taking
features since it's got that note in its
name so like patents suggest and the
scene for the theme your league patents
suggesting the Samsung Note 4 or one
soon after it will feature probably the
most impressive S Pen functionality to
date fat describes using ultrasound wave
to pinpoint the S pen's location at all
times using a series of sensors
positioned around the bones display
hopefully let all that fancy just
translates to even more accurate
note-taking which would be super
impressive step since I don't know S
pen's been fine i think could have been
better either way though there's
definitely bound to be improvements on a
note-taking side we can spec to
Samsung's s-pen probably go through a
full redesign come in at number for an
improved industrial design so we got to
see leaks earlier this week and they
looked pretty awesome so the note 4
looks super thin as you'd expect as
premium looking chamfered edges which
sounds super familiar the Samsung
exactly confirmed that one of its coming
devices will employ a new use of metal
instead of plastic and earlier this
week's images might reveal a little bit
of metal but we're largely expecting the
material to be saved for the rumored
Galaxy alpha the back of the Samsung
Galaxy Note 4 and this is just the note
3 appears to have some of the same
stance in material which we loved on the
oneplus one and it should be pretty
awesome combine the sort of the faux
leather look we saw on the note 3
overall though expect a super thin
design with more refined body in
addition to premium features like like I
mentioned before quad HD display which
samsung makes killer screen that should
look really awesome on a bigger phone
coming in at number 5 so many sensors
you just can't handle it the latest
batch of photos that we saw early this
week where a lot of this stuff is coming
from should suggest we're going to see
the same sensors that we saw on the
galaxy s5 on the note 4 including
fingerprint sensors that should be
pretty friggin sweet so I know that's
not a big surprise your side on the s5
it should make its way to the note 4
position of the expected fingerprint
reader though could be kind of new don't
have that on the note line now but its
course on the s5 one report though
didn't mention the Samsung time with
adding a UV sensor in the back of a
phone so you know when to put on
sunscreen this could be you so to tell
you how dangerous UV rays are on a given
a possibly learning you to load up on
sunscreen and i'm totally not joking
there i would not expect that to happen
I don't need my phone to be like listen
dude you're gonna get skin cancer I
think that my eyes and my brain should
tell me that but who knows maybe it'll
be a sensor be like you shouldn't smoke
or you shouldn't be inhaling the air
today it is gross for you but whatever
more sensors to make its way to the
Galaxy Note 4 and lastly not really a
feature but something new it should come
to market way quickly after it gets
announced evidently if you believe the
rumors the s5 wasn't successful at
Samsung was hoping it would be and with
the iphone 6 and rumored iphone air
coming very very soon the rumor mill is
churning that samsung is going to try
and get the note for in your hands as
soon as humanly possible they've already
allegedly asked manufacturers to boost
production so that the phone can get to
market mere days ever gets announced on
sep tember third that's way way quicker
than samsung usual schedule of
announcing a phone they're used to
getting a sort of obscure small market
and slowly filtering it out to the rest
of the world should see should come to
market very racing so announced on the
third maybe sec wait guys September you
might be able to see it in your hands
pick it up and carry your stores but who
knows just remember right now more
likely it'll get announced let me
available to be a buy unlocked right
after and then you know whenever cares
get it hopefully will be in a few weeks
after of course so these are just rumors
but looks to be pretty concrete what
we're seeing we will be in Berlin on
September third so we'll be able to
bring you the latest news as it happens
of course check back technobuffalo calm
to get all of that goodness I love big
bones I'm excited for what Samsung is
going to offer any features you guys
want to see we didn't mention leave it
