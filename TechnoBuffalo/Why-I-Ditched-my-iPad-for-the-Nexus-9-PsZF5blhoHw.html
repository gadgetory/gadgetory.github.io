TechnoBuffalo here earlier on Twitter I
put out a tweet saying I was ditching my
iPad with Retina display the first
version that had it the one without
touch ID for this guy a nexus 9 and I
got a slew of questions about why I was
doing it what was going on with my iPad
and a whole bunch of other stuff in
between so I thought what better way to
explain it then just to talk about it on
video if you guys are in so much
eduation or thinking about what tablet
to get hopefully this will help clarify
things for you
so we preface this by saying I've been
in Royal iPad user since the first gen
I've go back and forth on phone os's
seemingly every week between every major
phone OS when it comes to tablet I've
always preferred the iPad I don't do
much on my tablet at least that many
different things primarily a leisure
device for me i watch youtube videos at
night and i reply to emails in the
morning and some social networking in
between and that's really all that I do
on my tablet so for me the iPad just
been a really good fit for everything
that I've needed that is until iOS 8
started to hit and things start to get
very buggy so Apple updated the iPad
Mini to include touch ID that was the
only thing that changed I didn't see a
reason to upgrade my own personal tablet
I didn't need touch ID on my tablet I
don't travel that much anymore so I
don't worry about that security so
they're glad to stick with what I've got
so when 8.0 hit things started to get a
little slower apps started to crash a
little bit more both Apple apps and
third-party apps and then I went eight
point 1.3 hit things went from usable
but annoying to very very very tough to
use the apps that I use all the time
started to crash very very regularly I'm
pretty ingrained in Google's ecosystem
certainly for YouTube TechnoBuffalo as
email as for Google Apps my personal
email is through Google started using
Google services more and more whether by
intention or not that's time to work as
well as I used to on iOS the YouTube app
for example whenever I would use that it
was about 50/50 at the Apple actually
worked I could see all my videos my
subscription box but I tried to click on
one to play it just wouldn't play all
out to close the app open it up again
and then maybe you would work for a few
videos and stop working again it got to
really annoying I had to start using
third-party to video players which I
don't think off the same functionality
at
the native players so that got to be
annoying as well mail was another thing
that started having issues witnesses
apples native mail client built right in
to iOS scratching I go ahead and plot an
email it would just crash in between and
I got to be very difficult to start to
you started looking at what my options
were I've never been that big a fan of
bigger size tablets while I wasn't using
an iPad air she had a switch side
smaller tablets it was in my preference
that's why I haven't used an iPad ever
since Apple released the first gen mini
I thought for me it was a perfect size
for looking at what else was available
that I could use and I really enjoyed my
time testing the Nexus 9 and you might
have the perception that Android for
tablets isn't up to par it isn't what
iOS is and for a few years that might
have been the case when honeycomb first
came out but at least with the
introduction of lollipop that is no
longer the issue at all Android for
tablets is really really good there
might not be the same tablet for tablet
amount of apps you've got on the App
Store versus a Google Play but
everything I need is here and works
really really well
people have been tough on its design for
build quality I think me included the
black only have is kind of falling apart
with creaky this gray whitish version
has been absolutely awesome it's light
it's got good battery life's got a high
resolution screen I can hold it very
easily in one hand to reply videos look
great mail hasn't been crashing on me at
all and I'm using cloud magic for mail I
was really excited to try and use
outlook on it but outlook kept crashing
on the Nexus 9 so adios outlook so
looking forward to really trying to use
this as my everyday tablet maybe slowly
ditching iOS lease on the tablet front I
go back and forth on the phone usually
one we call use Android go back to iOS
and usually back and forth or just carry
two devices I'm usually testing
something in between so I'm think
they've done a really nice job with this
from the form factor to the way to how
it performs I really enjoyed it so the
difficulties people have when switching
phones my iOS Android aren't issue here
I don't care that connect as my photos
I'm here at care to message on my tablet
doesn't matter to me either got my phone
right here me anyway so all those
problems that people might have faced
when they're worried about switching OS
is an issue on tablet front so I'll keep
you guys
updated on what I think how it works I
ordered a case for this and then we're
excited to try using on a more regular
basis I think that HTC and Google had a
really nice partnership here and put
these two things together and make a
really really good product I most
important and excited try something new
you know we reviewed the Nexus 9 I
enjoyed the Nexus 9 I use it for a few
weeks but not to actually start using it
for weeks and months I think it can be
very interesting and of course if you
guys interested in seeing what happens
and how things perform I love to share
my thoughts with you I have you guys
decided what tablet to get you know
think twice it seems like Apple is maybe
leaning towards abandoning the iPad Mini
there's no real update this generation
as I'm adding touch ID perhaps next gen
I'll get a processor upgrade but I need
speed I need power evidently for using
you know YouTube and the small things
that I do I think the Nexus 9 offers a
perfect marriage of all that I think you
guys are watching I hope you enjoyed I
just wanted to share my tablet story I
figure maybe a few years in the same
boat looking to get a new tablet maybe
have to consider the Nexus before maybe
you're considering jumping from iOS
Android or vice versa so I thought my
story might help influence your buying
decision and I guys hope you enjoyed if
you liked the video give it a thumbs up
you always appreciate it and of course
check us out right here at TechnoBuffalo
