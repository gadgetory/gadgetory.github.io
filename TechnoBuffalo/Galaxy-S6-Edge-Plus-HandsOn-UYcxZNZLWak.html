technobuffalo checking out the brand new
galaxy s6 edge+ as a mouthful you can
see it's similar to the galaxy note 5
and in fact it packs the same specs of
the same XE nose processor the same four
gigs of ram the same 5.7 inch quad HD
display you're getting 518 pixels per
inch there you do however lack that s
been on the bottom so you're looking at
a 3.5 millimeter headphone jack USB
that's two point oh and then you have
the speaker right there on the left the
volume controls within easy reach at all
times you can see with my thumb on the
top no nada on the backs of 16 megapixel
camera and you've got the I believe
that's the same sensor that we saw in
the galaxy s6 so we already know it's a
really sweet camera glass back panel
here glass front panel you've got the
metal running along all sides so it
feels and looks super premium now
Samsung's targeting this at the folks
we're going to do a lot of multimedia so
a lot of you know video viewing and
photo viewing and all kinds of stuff
like that and it's pretty brilliant so I
was just going through this earlier you
know they show the weirdest things in
these videos there's a lobster and a
spoon with oil but it looks great so you
can expect that with all of your videos
now here's the new thing it's this slide
out future here we've seen it before but
now instead of just contacts you can
have app so you can have your frequently
used apps i added instagram so you can
quickly jump in there and you can also
move around in and tweak this so here
you see the edge lighting is on people
edges on apps edges on information
stream is on so you can get all through
your apps your notifications your
updates
all kinds of stuff like that there's not
much going on here so that's the big
thing there the edge and of course the
screen but otherwise it's really similar
to what we saw with the galaxy s6 edge
is just plus the plus size much bigger
and has the faster processor now one of
the things that I think kind of gets to
me is it's 32 gigabytes or 64 gigabytes
of storage there's no 128 gigabyte
option this time around and I feel like
multimedia people or probably you know
kind of want that option and we had it
with the galaxy s6 edge but otherwise it
does have all kinds of nice features
like achieve and PM a quick charging
that the large 3,000 milliamp hour
battery that charges just as quick as
the galaxy s6 did with the quick charge
through here on the bottom and other
niceties like Samsung pay and the finger
per meter in the home button in case
just want to show you a quick look here
at the galaxy s6 edge+ this is todd
