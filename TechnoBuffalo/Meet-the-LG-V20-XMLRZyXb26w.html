themselves from the smartphone pack by
giving some cutting-edge features and
kind of new design this is the LG V 20
with all the screens turned off yes I
said all the screens it looks like most
other smartphones out there how are
those suckers on and things start to
look a little bit different this is
obviously a successor to the pretty
popular LG v10 and I think the flagship
for the Korean company this is packing a
lot of new things into it it's got
things like steady report 2.0 hi-fi quad
DAC HD audio reporting a front and rear
wide-angle camera lens it's a poorly
delivered killer pictures but for me the
biggest feature that I'm excited about
it's a first non Nexus phone the ship
with Android 7.0 nougat and Google's new
in-app phone search function think of
steady record as E is the electronic
image stabilization just jacked up on
steroids I get a ton of questions about
audio capabilities and smart phone it's
the world's first smartphone to feature
32 bit hi-fi - powered by ESS
technologies which means it's gonna
sound pretty darn good the quad DAC is
gonna deliver way cleaner sound and
minimize distortion ambient noise but up
to 50 percent if you're big into selfies
it's got a 5 megapixel front-facing
camera but the big story there it's a
wide-angle so you get a 120 degree lens
to expand your sort of experience
arguably one of the biggest features
about the LG line of phones is that
second screen and has been improved with
double the brightness and 50% larger
font size compared to what the v10
Howard so you can use that for a launch
or you can send notifications up there
you can have information pop up you've
never used a second screen or at least
never seen one it's totally worth
looking at it might change the way you
use a phone the v20 is shipping with
LG's UX 5.0 plus they just made it a lot
easier and improve than what we saw with
5.0 the V 20 also features multi window
to display two apps at once in a split
screen format which is native to new get
the phone feels really premium and it
does for those asking featuring
removable battery no mods they can pop
in a fresh battery it's made of metal in
fact it's al six zero one three metal
found in aircrafts sailboats and
mountain bikes so it's really light and
really durable the rest of specs are
what you'd expect from a flagship here
you've got a Snapdragon 820 you got a
5.7 inch qHD IPS quantum
display 513 PPI on the second display
case you're wondering is 160 by 1040 or
an equal 513 PPI which is pretty
impressive for gigs Aram are on board
and the rear camera 60 megapixels with F
1.8 aperture and even megapixel with the
F 2.4 aperture not sure of your wide
angle one a pretty decent size thirty
two hundred million power battery an
again that's removable other things
you'd expect to like quick charge to
replace and fingerprint sensor in the
back are all built-in you don't yet know
pricing or release dates but we do will
update this a few colors you can be
available either Titan silver or pink if
you are so inclined so this is the LG v
20 looks like to be a worthy successor
to the v10 is evie 24 you give a thumbs
up for second screen would you think of
something you really need to try for the
new smartphone market plus already based
on new keys didn't have to worry too
much about software updates coming on in
until next time you're on right injury
