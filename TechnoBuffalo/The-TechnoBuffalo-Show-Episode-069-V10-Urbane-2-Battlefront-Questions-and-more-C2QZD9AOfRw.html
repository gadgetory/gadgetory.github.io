TechnoBuffalo show I'm live your to host
for today shot money editor and chief of
the site and I am joined by deputy
managing editor Todd Hazleton everybody
are you doing this week Todd good we
have definitely entered the holiday
doldrums yes I there are days where
we're like can we start making up
stories Oh yesterday we were joking can
I make up gaming stories and can the
gaming department makeup mobile story
simple just swap yeah and then you were
going to use each other sources they're
actually there was a story this morning
I read I know I give too much away about
it but there was a story i read that
normally I would have sent it over to
you and I was like no I have never heard
of the site B I'm not seeing anyone else
covering it you know there's just too
many red flags going up here but it's
still open on my iPad just in case i
said to you later it's so slow well and
the crazy thing about all these rumors
too is yesterday there was the UM the
Apple watch charging pad that Apple was
apparently building you and I thought
when I was looking I was like that's so
ugly there's no like I know it looks
official but maybe maybe she's a rumor
and then today of course it's official
no you never know what these things I
other times what it looks official
you're like oh that's that looks dead on
and you know they're like oh that was a
Photoshop yeah i know i am getting
better at spotting photoshop's look like
yeah but so the blackberry prev review
is out so everyone can head over to the
site and check that out yeah I didn't
want to give away too much last week I
know it was one of our topics but now i
can say like I really really love the
phone I have it right here I've been
using it and I bought it so here goes
nothing you know enjoy those funds
though where you know we review a lot of
them and I like a lot of them but it's
rare where I'm like okay should i buy
chod not this 1i box its unique you know
what the keyboard so I thought okay
there's not going to be another phone
for a while that I'm gonna be like oh
darn I kinda know and I think that's
actually the highest compliment someone
in your position can give a phone is if
you go ad spend euro
money on it that's that's a pretty high
praise yeah and I will say though
however I was reviewing the eighteen t
unit John had our review unit in the in
our review and my ATT one had some
software bugs and stuff like that in me
since i'm buying it for myself now is
more comfortable going with the unlocked
version because i know blackberries
gonna get the updates to it sooner and
stuff like that so actually ended up
returning the eighteen t unit and i'm
going to i bought the unlocked unit so
then we have the review in the office
yes so I kind of advising people out
there you know if you have the
capability to do so you probably want to
go with you unlock just to the quicker
software updates but well now the perv
review is out that phone is dead to us
so moving on so moving on to the next
great thing LG v10 yeah LG v10 you have
it on my desk a probably let's go
charging um I really like this phone so
it's one of those once it's kind of
sliding under the radar we have the
privilege pro all kinds of stuff that
we're trying to work on and I need to
write up something on this because it's
actually a really great phone been using
it for a little bit it's very the thing
is for review like I'm not so sure I'm
gonna go crazy on a review for one
because it's very much the g4 in terms
of the snapdragon 808 and stuff like
that they boosted ram up to four gigs
though same camera except they highlight
video capability so there's manual
controls for video it seems to do a
pretty good job with that i'm not a
videographer though so no matter what
I've tried to do on nothing's that great
but it's got dual front-facing five
megapixel cameras so one wide angle one
just regular and that's pretty neat but
the front-facing is not incredible on it
and then of course it's got a secondary
display which I thought at first was
going to be a gimmick we saw that first
on the Samsung continuum a couple of
years ago on verizon didn't really do
much this one's actually pretty cool as
music controls it's always on for like
to time and stuff but then I actually
use it for shortcuts to my favorite apps
that are always at the top of the screen
so I'm actually really liking the phone
I like the build that has 64 gigs of
expandable storage I don't think
marshmallows coming too late next year
which is kind of a bummer but
those phones that you know it's not if
people aren't really talking about it
like a flagship like the Galaxy s6 or
even prove or anything like that but um
I'm really really liking it the length
of time it is taking to update phones on
Android is really getting annoying it is
it's frustrating it's almost like I feel
like most consumers well I take that
back most consumers probably don't even
care one quick thing to everyone yes you
can flash it yada yada I'm talking about
the ninety-nine percent of people in
this world they have no idea what that
means yeah i agree with you Todd I the
although it's hilarious to hear my
mother who's in her late 60's go when am
I getting marshmallow it is pretty funny
yeah boy hey why do you even know that
word I read your site oh okay but she
constantly asked me what she's getting
the next you know android update you
have like you wanna try flashing but
yeah it's like it's so especially right
around the time the new versions come
out because unless it launches with that
OSU have no your phones out did before
you will walk on the store before you
even pay for it I know that's the thing
it's like I almost you know it's just
you should you know when you buy a phone
if it's fronting lollipop assume that
it's gonna have that for a long time and
be happy if it if it gets an upgrade
earlier because that's just the way
things are going on especially if you're
not unless you're buying it unlocked
which is great and that's the way I
think you should do it you know in a lot
of these cases that you do get updates
and even though the blackberry I was
saying by that unlock what I was talking
about updates are those are security
patches and stuff I don't think it's
gonna get marshmallow until next year
also which is what they said I know
that's only you know just over a month
away but it could be well into next year
before available so I liked it but you
know there's a look like we were just
talking about the v10 that's a great
phone I don't know when that's getting
marshmallow that's next year microprose
great phone I mean so now I'm certain to
wonder like how much should I really
care
marshmallow too I mean now on tap is
neat but even when I was using on phones
like 89 I didn't feel like I needed it
and then the expandable storage part I
thought was the best part where you can
format it as internal the otherwise
under so i don't know i mean there's
like battery life improvements and stuff
like that but yeah i'm not i'm not kind
of you know I feel like for the first
time between lollipop and marshmallow
I'm not like oh I really need it and I
feel like going from KitKat to lollipop
I felt like I needed it like a bigger
that was yeah mark marshmallow doesn't
feel like as big of an update but yeah I
don't know but so overall though you
like the v10 yeah I like to like the v10
a lot it has sort of a rugged back and
scout the stainless steel slide switch
are really nice and I know we can talk
about this in a little bit but it really
matches the watch urbane too well but it
just feels like a more premium handset
than the g4 and that's the point they're
gonna continue to build on this V family
of devices next year there'll be a V 20
or v11 ah know what they're gonna call
it so I see a lot of people always
talking about like well maybe I'll wait
for the g5 and part of me is like we'll
meet you should wait for whatever they
replace the v10 with that's another year
from now in any case I think the v10 is
positioned to be a really great phone
for a while it's got plenty of RAM
plenty of storage cameras great we
already know that st. Karen's the g4
display isn't slightly curved which I
actually like better I do like OLED
displays these days vs LCD I like how
could they get nice and inky black like
the proof here but you don't get that on
the v10 so I think I think it's one of
those funds that people aren't talking
about that should be considered yeah
yeah the market no speaking since you're
holding the herb am too what do you
think of that so far it's still a little
too clunky for me and I'm a guy were big
watches anyway usually like one my wife
got me it's dumb watch but um it's kind
of clunky kind of big but android wear
seems to run a little bit faster
this it has an additional gig of ram i
think i donno maybe it's one gig instead
of 512 it may I suggest you never say to
Chrissy you know that dumb watching it
yes you wouldn't understand that I'm not
saying smart watches yeah okay Justin
top smart right trying to help you out
incomparable yeah yeah don't yah be for
our letting um it's a android wear just
it's not tuned you for me like a just
old notifications keep popping up and
stuff like that no this this is unique
in that it um it's it's marshmallow
Android where I think it's version 1.4
you can place phone calls from your
wrists and stuff like that I really
haven't spent a lot of time doing that
because I just got it on friday and i
haven't really taken out of the
apartment my ATT signal up here it's not
good but i think that's neat the battery
life was really bad for me at first it
was dead within like ours but that's
because i had the ambient display on i
had the brightness all the way up cuz i
thought it looked really cool like that
but didn't do well um otherwise you know
i like the side buttons and try to show
everybody I don't know it's kind of hard
to show stuff on here I like the rubber
strap and it does complement the v10
really well it's like the two were sort
of built together almost imagine that
yeah what you know I I've actually found
myself over recent weeks not even
wearing my Apple watch which is right
here on my desk dead oh no it is on you
got ya after the whatever that first
android wear watch was that you and i
both bought g watch the g watch okay i
don't care how much they improve android
where I have such a bad taste in my
mouth from that thing I wonder if that's
a part of my problems he like I always
try to approach it you know the new
device and stuff I just can't like kick
it into it you know and it always feels
slightly bug you you and stuffs going on
you know I'll mention that in my
write-up of this watch but it just
doesn't neither I mean Apple watch too
there's nothing there's something
missing from all these devices and I
don't know what it is well antsy and
that's why I still like the pebble time
you know it's a SmartWatch but it's
simple enough that I don't have to worry
a lot of things right you know I I'm
mainly using it as a notification device
more than anything oh and telling time
yeah yeah although I will say this this
is incredibly stupid to me whenever I
change time zones I have to manually
change the time zone on it that's really
weird I feel like it should just pull it
from your watch oh yeah our phone I know
but no I have to manually change my time
zone hmm you know I was just thinking
when I was saying you know there's
something's missing from me some Isis I
feel like it's the voices we todd i feel
like it's the voice assistant i don't
want to say it behind me but the Amazon
echo and if I say her name she'll go off
and I'll be a pain in the butt but I
didn't get that um she's really good and
I feel like on my watch you know you
could say okay google or hey Siri or
yadda yadda hey Cortana Cortana it it
never really it works sometimes it
doesn't always pick up everything you
have to be very deliberate with this
thing behind me if I say that's why I'm
not if I say Alexa she's can it go off
too loud and that's I feel like the
watches and our phones need something
just as accurate is that and my computer
actually or Cortana might start many
right here works sometimes but if
everything was as reliable as if I'd use
it more I'd probably like my smart
watchman I like how you're now like
whispering yeah she's gonna turn on she
is she watching us yeah I swear that
thing I use it every day he's watching I
I thought I don't want her to over here
over the gossip yeah but I mean I don't
you know from lights most of the time
it's my light so I'm controlling my
living room and my bedroom lights with
it but music and sports scores like that
I've written better on the site but
really really love the Amazon echo you
know I that is one of those devices that
that the other day when Amazon had that
sale I was so tempted and I kept trying
to think okay way I don't have any smart
bulbs for her to control
what else am I really gonna do with her
yeah music and stuff like that is like
my favorite thing so I can play you know
what I'm sitting at my desk here I'll
say like play Frank Sinatra its natural
play that'll be like next song or you
know play this instead and she takes off
it's actually funny sometimes I'll try
to speak sentences you were like you
know Alexis stop doing that bat shake
she responds still so so he's kind of
fun to play with yeah i saw the light
the light oh no I I'm still tempted to
get one I don't know why yeah I wasn't
sure why at first either and then I kind
of made uses for it by getting smart
bulbs I give you that Oh see now I
thought you had the smarts bulbs before
you got her no I did them together I
wanted to set it up i made a project i
thought it was gonna be more of a
project took about 10 minutes like plug
plug plug okay it's all set up I i I've
still got to try to talk myself out
buying her buying one of her at some
point um anyway hold on one moment here
Brandon is bran is interrupting he knows
that we're podcasting but f no that was
not worth interrupting me for anyway the
joys in our God John for everyone who
doesn't have john is a town so
everything is running through me this
week but uh Sean's our air traffic
controller yeah that's why I've got the
big headphones yeah anyway I'm pushing
1000 good grief so final topic that we
wanted to touch on Star Wars Battlefront
yeah so you bought it I did it mm-hmm my
reasoning longer yeah my reasoning was
50 bucks for the DLC hahahaha no I
didn't even look at that now I'm one of
those guys were I'm still very old
school in the game just like oh here's
the game it's coming i'm gonna buy it
and i forget that these days are like
nickel and diming us like oh
by this by that you know later and blah
but I that's okay because I ended up
playing it last night and I played the
beta but let you know finally get to
digging in and see everything is a lot
of fun I was playing with my friend um
yeah it'sit's kind I don't want to say
it's simple and it's not simple i was
getting annihilated but what Joey say
today I think our gaming our head of
gaming I think he said it was you know
casual or something and it is it's right
it's not like hardcore like I've seen in
other games that I played but it's a lot
of fun the graphics to me we're really
amazing the audio sound effects it's
tough for a lot of fun there's some
really cool modes like heroes vs.
villains you're going around is like
Luger han Solo vs darth vader and Boba
Fett and it's it's 3 on 3 plus so it's a
match of six on six but there's three
heroes on each side and the heroes like
the super powerful people and so you
know you're running around with a
lightsaber or you know pistol and it's
awesome that's six on six then you have
supremacy where it's you know 20 on 20
huge maps just people everywhere to like
there I find these times where like you
just getting cornered at checkpoints and
it's just like floods of people and it's
like armies it's just craziness and then
there's also like an air assault mode so
you're flying around at x-wings &amp;amp; Tie
Fighters and stuff like that it's just
it's a lot of fun all right there's a
part of me that does want to play it but
I just I'm also then this comes from my
collecting mentality I'm a completist so
the ID the idea of not having those new
maps and also not having the new maps
also Lisa fracturing of the user base
which i am not a fan of because then
you're stuck only playing with the other
people who didn't buy those maps yeah
you know and then the second map map
pack comes out some people that bought
pack 1 won't buy pack 2 so you got a
further fracturing it's yeah it's a bad
idea yeah that's annoying that happened
to me on Dallas field for on the pc
actually where i was playing in it's
like you know i just sort of like load
up the most popular servers or something
and it's like oh you don't have this map
necessarily can't fight so i ended up
having to buy them and right now about
it for all the other maps are like 20
bucks but you know i'm sure i'll end up
paying that extra 50 bucks along my
friend
still playing and it does get expensive
100 oh well such me haul ass did any of
you play the original to star wars
battlefront games I played both of them
I like the first one I wasn't a huge fan
the second one actually didn't play the
earlier was uh they were entertaining
and I'm sure this one is to buy just
freaking DLC man yeah I was talking with
my buddy last night though it seems like
and like this is an official or anything
Joey would obviously have a much better
idea of the grass with this but I we
were saying like they could have cut
corners and really made this kind of a
crappy game I feel like people still
would have bought it because it's Star
Wars but about that no no you're totally
wrong there okay one has ever bought a
crappy product because that star wars on
it ocio you're being sarcastic
completely but it but it actually is a
fun game so it's like okay they actually
put some polish on it no I believe me if
I looked around my desk long enough i
would find crappy star wars products on
it somewhere especially if I dig in the
closet under the stairs in my basement
where my childhood original Star Wars
products are believe me I would find
crappy products hiding in the Harry
Potter room oh yeah well let's see i use
I know I one time I had like returned
the Jedi trash can for my bedroom I also
remember I had some return of the jedi
shampoo because it was shaped like java
that's kind of cool yeah they're saying
it'd be awesome Jabba the Hutt was one
of the characters in this game maybe
later how would he get across the
battlefield like I don't he probably
wouldn't just like slithering blob but
whom yeah commander I don't know good
grief hey Brandi come on podcasting here
ever Brandon I love the fact that
Brandon knows that were both podcasting
it was a thing that couldn't wait I
don't know I didn't read it okay Oh
Brandon but uh
i I don't know it's I want to play the
game a any well we have another question
from such from Bohol hear about the name
you get fallout 4 star wars battlefront
and/or rise of the Tomb Raider I played
the last tomb raider game loved it and
this time though I decided to hold off
till it's no longer an xbox exclusive
because hey it will come out complete
edition on PlayStation 4 in a year hmm
so why not just save myself the money I
that's the type of game where I don't
feel the need to run out and buy it the
second it comes out fallout 4 I just
don't have the time for something that
massive that's exactly what I'm yeah and
I already said what I said about
Battlefront um yeah I mean I I was
playing a ton of Destiny there for a
while I haven't turned dusting on two
weeks I just don't have time right now
yeah I don't have time to play anything
at the moment yeah I didn't start that's
the nice thing about Star Wars Balfour
as you can count jumping it out if your
casual like me it's casual game um and
it's like whatever okay that was fun you
know spend 20 minutes here there yeah I
have all these other games to you that I
bought that I haven't really played like
I still have dragon age inquisition that
I played a lot of I in Finnish I have
Witcher 3 that played very little and
didn't finish I have what's that MMO I
don't even know the top of my head in
case like what I'm five games I'm
playing right now they're just not even
playing Tony Hawk I bought yeah I see
like I desperately want to go back and
play red dead redemption again but that
like uh I have 70 hours right right well
I came so great but it so it was on our
list of the xbox 360 games that aren't
backwards compatible on the one right
yeah but that's why I still have the 360
my 360 s third breaking and that's why I
ended up buying all these other consoles
yeah well I I have the game though we
won't go through all the consoles I own
but uh it's too many and there was a
period a couple years ago where I got
rid of a bunch of my really older stuff
like my 8-bit Nintendo and man which I
kind now regret I did keep my
got my super nintendo though ouat
sisters you would have to pry the Super
Nintendo from my cold dead hands that
was one of the greatest systems ever
built yeah but anyway so let's jump into
some of the questions we've been getting
which folks all bored you they're all
from such a Mahal so if anyone else has
questions please feel free to jump in
and ask questions as well and here's an
age-old debate from from such and ball
is there actually a need for
smartwatches is there a need no are they
aaos just like your parents will do you
need this or do you want it or you just
want I hated that talk yeah because
there always was no I want it which
means I need it Brian I want it really
bad equally so is there a need for
smartwatches know it are the is there a
need for tablets know is there a need
for smartphones no is there the list
goes on and on I know is there a need
for a mobile telephone yes but is there
a need or one that is more powerful than
all the computers put together the power
of the Apollo 11 mission no I feel like
smartwatches though are like and I
remember a pew research study that I
sometimes linked back to that said like
they're still one of the problems is
there still like an ongoing like you
don't find a reason to continue wearing
the wearable after so much time right
like eventually you're just like okay I
don't need it right now and you still
put it on one day and then you don't put
on the next day then you're just like
and that's how I always end up I mean
how long i had the Apple watch on for a
long time and I was just sitting on my
desk I'm like don't I guess I could
charge it and put it on and you know
it's not dead technically but just like
yeah no I am I wear my pebble I i wear
my pebble almost every day except when
i'm typing a lot i do take it off just
because i don't want it banging on the
key
board but uh no I love it for like when
I'm traveling especially when it going
like airports mmm as you all know I'm
going on vacation starting the middle of
next week you all work all the time when
I'm in England because it's just I co
when I'm walking down the city street to
go okay rhian instead of having to pull
my phone out and all that stuff so
that's true I do like it for stuff like
that yeah yeah totally i right now I'm
going back and forth on this i'm so
tempted to get some sort of fitness
tracker because i have no idea how much
i walk when I'm over there and I've been
trying to lose weight the good chunk of
this year and I've lost quite a bit of
weight but I tried to decide if i want
to buy a fitness tracker before I leave
I'm like is the pebble not good at that
the misfit app on there because they
have that one out often look oh look I
haven't I think it's a popular one on
pebble they make the you know the really
basic one that actually fossil just
bought misfit but I think that yeah I
think that's pretty good at trying to
think of what happens yeah I I'll have
to hop to look into that yeah cuz
otherwise misfit was the company of me
like a $25 you know fitness tracker was
like the one that could fit your
shoelace and stuff oh I remember that
IRA monitor yeah um ok the I'm I'm torn
on this one so I'm going to put a few
disclaimers after I asked the question
here from David Nunez what do you guys
think what do you guys make of the verge
rating the apple TV as the quote best
streaming box unquote as of right now
the video has 800 thumbs up in two
thousand thumbs down never seen a racial
like that in a while let me say first
that is generally the policy of
technobuffalo not to comment on other
sites you know we just we don't find
that to be that wonderful of a thing
when it's a review that's a little
different i'll say this i don't think
the apple TV is the best streaming box
by a long shot
yeah I think I'm in the same well it's
not even close to mine I returned mine I
think it has the potential to be I think
you know if they're talking about that I
think if you're buying it as a gift for
the holidays and you know somebody has
the old Apple TV and they're interested
I don't know I like it's a good product
because if the apps that will come to it
but I would still go with the Roku to be
honest it the apple TV is a good product
but there are far far better streaming
box zap like every Apple product is all
about keeping in the apple ecosystem and
it at this stage it's just too limited
to be a true cable box replacement yeah
and like you and I said when we discuss
it a couple weeks ago when it first came
out it still to me feels very much like
a product that launched with the part
missing its I really do truly believe
that they're working on their own
streaming solution and they push this
thing out the door early just to get the
holiday sales yeah and in the long run I
think that was a mistake well let's fit
this way the general consumers not even
gonna notice but for those of us that
follow this stuff yeah we know it's
missing yeah yeah I don't know I mean a
lot of things you're minim for me me not
I'm glad to see plexes there that I
think that was pretty cool I mean it
launched right when the apple TV didn't
we talked about that an earlier show but
I think other ones like Amazon Prime TV
or wherever they call it these days um
that that's like a huge glaring hole on
the apple TV for me anyway cuz their
stuff on there like to watch Downton
Abbey and I don't know soul I think
about it when I think about streaming
boxes these days and I think about the
best one for people like if I was gonna
buy one for a gift and that my mind goes
right to Roku goes right to like a
comcast maybe something like that but
you know those are also a lot cheaper a
lot of olive ways and again maybe some
people want the apps on their TV and I
think that's I think that's definitely
where we're going as an industry and
Roku does have apps of its own and gain
stuff like that too but you know the
apps that I saw in the apple TV when I
had it like air B&amp;amp;B were just nothing I
wanted to use the games were nothing I
wanted to use it maybe it's because I'm
not that the idea okay the air B&amp;amp;B from
your television it's just what it just
didn't make sense to me like it I would
much rather go on a site where i can
read reviews and see it on a map and do
all these other things like why would I
want to do that through TV I just wanted
that use case in any case from Chris
panton in the market for a new phone
$400 is the max I'm really considering
the oneplus x + 1 + 2 are there better
options i know there are two different
price points and I ruled out Moto X
because a bad customer service of
experience I think right now if you're
in the market / phone on rail and you're
willing to go unlocked wait a week
because the the leaks are definitely
indicating that there's going to be some
great phone deals next week yeah it
phones that were previously not within
your price point whatsoever will be next
week yeah so but that being said of
those phones I would lose either of
those one blesses yeah I probably lean
towards a one plus two but that's just
me I also would I mean I don't even
think it's something that's you have to
wait to go on sale i think the nexus 6
is still in that range maybe even below
it especially lately things like ebay
and that's a that's still a great phone
too so i'd consider that I mean the
camera is not amazing good no there you
go yeah nope it this is my UK phone for
this trip you know honestly I haven't
used the oneplus actually where the 1+2
those are out in irvine so i thought you
had had some time with both of those um
yeah so I look around I think there's a
lot more options out there than you
realize and personally i think i would
go with a Nexus device if you can find
it in that price range first yeah hello
i mean the newer ones you get your
facing limited store
kind of a bummer at 400 bucks so it
really really depends on your use case
but I think both those phones are fine
and I would look for her again last
year's models on sale soon yeah well if
you're in the US yeah that's true
although if i told you about what's
happening in the explain i know in the
UK they carried some of it over well
yeah so the wall marker as de which is
the UK arm of walmart several years ago
started doing black fridays and that
ended up spreading out to the rest of UK
retailers well last year i think there
was one or two injuries at enhanced a
store so as that this year is not doing
black friday but is so permeated the UK
now that when i walking around
manchester on black friday there are
black friday sales going on it's so
bizarre that's awesome yeah it's awesome
but it's it you're like to you got you
you guys don't have Thanksgiving so this
is just like some random friday lien
expats over there suffering I know but
it's just it's still so bizarre to me
but from such a bahal is the pebble
smartwatch is still the best all-around
SmartWatch it gets the job done i think
so i think so i just don't like how ugly
its where's mine I have all these smart
you see so you know that me it I don't
care about aesthetics i do cuz my wife
makes fun of me yes but you see I don't
have a wife so problem solved she's like
other things so ugly I don't like I'll
fine now I'm not conscious about it yeah
well that's really that it's not really
why I I do like the way you know like
that these have much better displays
that I'm holding up the watch urbane to
second edition i think is the
appropriate need like what a dumb name
let's switch that real quick LG watch
urbane second edition you mean I ass I
don't know but I don't know what some of
these companies are thinking when they
named their products yeah a
here's a little tip for all of them
there's a reason that all phones are
called iPhones there's the reason why
all tablets are called iPads it's
because they're short sweet you know
easy to remember and they can be turned
into verbs mm-hmm look at Google folks
hey you ever picture yourself saying oh
let me yahoo that yeah that's it but you
can say said that real quick yeah let me
ask jeeves that will say that actually
works though Oh God even chiefs from
David Nunez Todd living in NYC d you run
into fellow tech journalists roaming the
city streets yes they're like wild
wolves traveling in packs I love on
people i follow collaborate not not in
the streets I actually do live in the
same neighborhood as one of my buddies
at a business insider tech insider now
so we would see each other we were like
block away from each other but no you
see each other all kinds of tech events
were briefing and when we go to
briefings there's usually you know like
12 of us around a table so we see each
other all the time or you know if it's
one-on-one briefings I'm getting in the
elevator someone else is coming down all
the time we see each other so yes oh we
say hi you know the industry a lot some
of us have worked together a lot whether
it's at other sites or we had the same
boss because I was there and that's what
else was there there's a lot of people
have worked at laptop magazine actually
in New York so it's we joked that it's
sort of the School of Journalism so for
people like coming out of school and
tech writing a lot of people over tried
it laptop magazine at school then they
go on to other sites or stay there a lot
of friends so there so I mean yes we do
see each other pretty frequently but not
not just randomly just like you wouldn't
see you know somebody from college maybe
you do no I it was really funny I went
to a right after I left Mashable I'd
gone to work at a company called silicon
or sitepoint i went to site point
gonna remember where i went and but i
was going to be in boston to visit a
friend and Mashable was having meet up
but I haven't met a lot of the mashable
folks and so I went to the mashable
party anyway which they were totally
cool with and I met the guy who had
taken over my position at Mashable I had
taken over his position at sitepoint
hahaha that's pretty funny so we had
literally swapped jobs and we were
meeting at this meet up and were like oh
ok that's just bizarre we we literally
hit swap jobs that's pretty funny it was
cheap as hard as I would I will say
though a lot of the tech journal asinus
is actually pretty small so a lot of
people we did a lot of us do you know
each other oh yeah it's a very small
community yeah very small we actually
used two years ago I've been done in a
while we would organize like happy hours
and so all the people from the sites
would get together and meet for drinks
and food and stuff like that and so I it
seems like obviously we're competing on
some level like you know for page views
and stuff like that but as humans you
know a lot of us are friends it's not
like cutthroat or anything no I'll kill
all of them Joakim comics joking
obviously we all have different opinions
cuz we're all so you know that's yeah
some some people think the apple TV is
the best streaming device from tice
Williams what are your thoughts on the
new gear VR those releasing thing about
venturing in VR is this project a good
way to start Todd you this is definitely
all you yeah I do I really like the gear
VR and for a hundred bucks I think it's
a lot of fun um there's a lot of cool
content so netflix for example you can
load it up and you're in you're
basically sitting in like a small living
room and it's like a fully furnished
once you like look around there's a
plant and stuff like that then you just
like dim the lights the movie starts so
you know if you don't have a little you
can watch one there um there's also like
awesome games i forget the name of
one but one of my favorites is like
you're flying around in a jet pack and
you if you use the Samsung controller
which is where in here um you know you
could shoot thing like targets and stuff
it's a lot of fun it almost reminds me
of pilot wings in a way but the graphics
aren't as good that's what Nintendo cape
and then in 3ds I liked a lot to pilings
and then there's a what else there's
lots of like 360-degree content from
milk VR that Samsung's continually
putting in so there's no X game stuff or
mountain dew stuff I don't know it's
pretty neat the graphics aren't like is
sharp and crisp and amazing as you'll
find on on the oculus rift and stuff but
obviously that's powered by a computer
and this is your phone and for a phone
it's actually really cool I mean worse
comes to worse I'd say grab it from
somewhere like Best Buy hundred bucks
you have like a usually a 30-day return
window and take advantage of that just
play with it I find myself doing that a
lot these days ah let's see here from
David Nunez how's the technical Buffalo
doesn't put this show at the top of its
website when it's live I think it would
drive more viewers I'm always looking
for the link to this video on Twitter
that shouldn't be the case David I agree
with you we just currently don't have
the ability and that's something we've
discussed for the next version of
technical Buffalo's putting some sort of
video embed player up at the top so
definitely on our list to discuss for
the next redesign of the site yeah we
want to have a lot more control over
stuff like that yeah that there's going
to be a lot of changes coming to
technobuffalo when we finally have time
to to get to that it's amazing how
little time we have to work on things
like that from such a baja have you
tried Apple music on Android I have not
yeah I have it here as I've said in
previous shows i unfortunately play for
way too many of these services i'm not
sure why but it works pretty well um
i've used it i was using it and then i
switched to youtube music for actually a
lot of my listing because i I'm loving
that I know it's sort of a change of
topic but
music school I have my playlist and
something I've already set up obviously
on my iPhone but youtube music has been
great because you can play all the
videos and stuff or just end or just
leave in the background we're store for
offline like a whole playlist they make
for you we actually just got our got a
question through Twitter here from a
Daniel jeweled I saw a concept iphone 7
video of an iphone that has no bezel at
all do you think apple will do this I
that technology i think is just too far
away the no buzz Lamia yeah well I don't
know what they're gonna do with the home
button if they actually embed the finger
perimeter we've seen technology allows
that to work in the display I mean
though here's the problem is that all of
a sudden then you know you're blocking
the screen with your finger and like I
guess that works sometimes but like how
do you hold it you know that the bezels
also serve a purpose so your fingers
aren't always blocking part of the
screen that's my opinion I think it
would look awesome well then you think
about it you know it's like the galaxy
s6 edge it looks really cool but then
when you're holding it sometimes just
like mmm really know if i need you know
no bezels on the sides yeah I I don't
get that worked out but that's what's
cool about the frig is the bottom scroll
pad so like when you're going through a
site i mean to touch the screen which I
like keyboard now well folks I think
that's going to bring this week's
episode to close a quick little bit of
housecleaning next week the show is
going to be on Tuesday as Wednesday a
lot of people will be traveling to get
