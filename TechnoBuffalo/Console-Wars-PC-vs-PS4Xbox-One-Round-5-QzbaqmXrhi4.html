at the Wii U and Nintendo's unique space
within the war since then quite a lot
has changed for Nintendo the company
lost a leader who was a true gamer at
heart he wanted Eric took with Nintendo
fans before shareholders and he took
risks to keep Nintendo quirky weird and
true to its core he won a son will be
missed dearly it will be interesting to
see what Nintendo's next chapter has a
storm
you
now while we wait for Xbox ones new
Windows 10 based UI before comparing the
software side of things I think it's
time we take a look at the shadow of the
beast that looms over all three consoles
this is a battle of attrition console
peasants versus the PC master-race
it's armed welcome back to the console
if I had a diver every time someone
announces the superiority of the PC
master-race in the comment section of
the console wars I'd pretty much be able
to afford a high-end gaming PC I've been
a PC gamer since the glory days of doom
and LucasArts classics like full
throttle and TIE fighter and back then
pcs were expensive tricky to use and
infrequent native updates some twenty
years later at least a couple of those
definitions still hold true but for the
most part PC gaming is more affordable
and more accessible than ever pcs have
always been a step ahead of the consoles
when it comes to number crunching
prowess and without spoiling the
conclusion of this episode I can
guarantee that PCs will always be
technically more capable of driving
better graphics in the consoles emphasis
on technically more capable and the
reason is quite simple this is a gtx
980ti graphics card
it's an enthusiast class card that costs
pretty much what the ps4 and Xbox one
are priced at combined the card is
capable of driving some amazing graphics
with resolutions textures and effects
way beyond what the consoles are capable
of for almost 700 bucks it ought to be
and it's really not uncommon for PC
gaming enthusiasts to run two or three
of these bad boys in an SLI
configuration providing PC graphics even
more of an edge compared to the consoles
and this I think sums up the point of
pcs it's a truly scalable platform the
only restrictions you really have is the
thickness of your wallet PC gaming
however does not have to be expensive
you can build a gaming PC for the price
of a console you may not run games at
Ultra settings but most games scale to
the capabilities of your PC but I think
for the most of us PC gamers building a
PC at a console price that's really not
the point at all is it when I think PC
gaming
I think overclocking 120 FPS 4k or at
least 1440p resolution multi-screen
setups and every single graphics
maxed-out for the shear reason of future
proofing and upgradability if you are
serious into getting into PC gaming
don't skimp too much on the components
build your PC on a solid foundation that
can be easily upgraded for me it's all
about that sweet spot where performance
meets the price and upgrade ability is
key so you can gradually beef up that PC
if you want a gaming machine that costs
the same as a console get a console if
you want a gaming PC do it just do it
don't let your dreams be dreams gotta go
all-in maybe okay now that we've
established that pcs are technically
more superior than consoles let's
discuss why the relevance of PC gaming
performance has been losing its luster
in the past few years PC gaming in my
personal opinion has taken a few turns
for the worse lately a couple of months
ago I decided to upgrade my graphics
card to play one of my favorite and most
anticipated franchises on the PC with
the best possible visuals water
technology could offer to get me even
more excited GPU manufacturer and Vidya
showed off its new special effects
exclusive for the PC version and I was
hyped I went out and splurge and dropped
a pretty penny for my new graphics card
and then came launched Batman Arkham
Knight was broken and those special
Nvidia game works effects caused my high
end GPU to chug out frames like a
slideshow shortly after the game was
pulled from Steam and all sales of
Arkham Knight on PC have been
discontinued indefinitely at least until
fall as it turns out developer
Rocksteady was not even in charge of the
PC port and the game was outside to a
more obscure dev team the graphics
settings alone in Arkham Knight truly
suggests that this game was definitely
not intended for PC
publisher Warner Bros launched Mortal
Kombat X earlier this year with similar
issues on the PC and according to play
reports MKX on the PC still has some
serious issues even now several months
later so it seems that in 2015 releasing
games broken is perfectly okay and wait
for the patch might as well be written
on the boxart
having lived in an age where you just
stick a cartridge in a machine and play
games that's me a bit on the edge about
these shenanigans and these issues are
definitely not exclusive to the PC as
the consoles get their fair share of
issues but the problem is are
unquestionably more prominent on the PC
side and the problem lies in the PC
games are indeed most often treated as
ports the weird thing is the PC gamers
obviously have cash to spend so why
exactly do publishers tweet the platform
as secondary with a side dish of
half-assing it well as usual it all
comes down to money with a few excellent
exceptions to make the rule PC
iterations of triple-a titles make less
profits on the PC because of this
publishers now focus on the consoles
with the console hardware and
specifications in mind while PC hardware
is immensely more capable it's also more
fragmented with countless combination of
GPUs and CPUs with multi-gpu
configurations thrown into the mix it
ultimately requires much more
optimization to get things running
smoothly on various hardware specs so
the console game sales is where the
money is at so there's really no need to
protect your that are at the level of
1440p or 4k for that matter and there's
also very little interest to put effort
into effects that only the latest PC
GPUs can handle obviously this situation
works to the benefit of the consoles as
developers can concentrate on a single
hardware spec to squeeze out every bit
of performance making exclusive games
like Uncharted 4 look absolutely amazing
and the game looks every bit as pretty
as what the best pcs can currently offer
whereas on the pc has previously
mentioned the hardware component
combinations are endless so the cpus and
gpus
are more or less expected to power
through the code that's hurtled that bit
so like it or not
both of the power of the PC and effects
that modern GPUs are capable of is
ultimately going down the tubes another
reason for the publishers focus on the
consoles is the piracy on the PC is
still a concern think of any triple a PC
release type it into Google and add
torrent
without going into many details
downloading almost any game illegally is
about two mouse clicks away many would
debate the impact of piracy but looking
at the sheer amount of concurrent seders
for any Hot PC title there's really no
going around it these numbers will
impact publishers when they assess how
big of a slice of the development pipe
will be devoted to the PC port and this
is a point that PC master-race advocates
often emphasize when promoting PC gaming
PC games are a lot cheaper than console
games ok yeah that might be the case but
you have to consider at what cost online
key store like g2a and others sell
perfectly legal digital distribution
copies of steam games origin you play
games you name it often for less than
half of the suggested MSRP prices of
titles so if it's a choice of buying
witcher 3 for 60 bucks on Steam or 25
bucks on an online key store which do
you think a substantial portion of the
market will choose and I'm pretty sure
there's less money for the publisher in
a 25 dollar game than a full 60 dollar
release so publishers have to consider
what is smarter and more fiscally
predictable when it comes to business
rampant variable pricing multiple
digital distribution platforms a little
bit of piracy here and there and a very
fragmented hardware landscape it
requires quite a lot of optimization so
it's really not that big of a surprise
why PC has beard off from being a lead
development platform for triple-a titles
the things that most would consider as
benefits for PC gaming are actually not
doing PC releases any favors despite all
the bad handling of triple-a titles on
PC PC gaming is actually living a golden
age of sorts it should not be overlooked
at League of Legends dota and other
MOBAs and more frequent players online
and there are frequent users on PSN and
Xbox Live combined let that sink in for
a bit also eSports and Indies are
thriving on PC oh and regarding triple-a
titles thankfully there's still some
great developers and publishers that
continue to take PC gaming seriously to
name a couple CD Projekt RED and
Bethesda a phenomenon that I think is
feeding into that wait for the patch
mentality is early access while it is
kind of cool to get a sneak peek of the
idea concept and promise of something
that is to be I've Altima turned from
experience that the buggy horrible mess
that is early access games truly takes
away from the final experience and
immersion suspension of disbelief can be
thrown out the window in a pre-alpha
build of any game part of the problem
obviously is that you do get tired of
the game before it's actually finished
no matter how much I like the concept of
early access for me I can't help but
feel like Dorothy peeling back the
curtain to discover the utter
disappointment of the glitchy hot mess
that is most early access games and this
is from a guy who's dropped a couple of
hundred bucks in the star citizen early
access obviously opens up a development
and financing model that enables a lot
of games into existence but I'm hoping
with all my heart that it never arrives
on the consoles
if you're not into MOBAs it can be a
slightly frustrating time to be a PC
gamer
I mean you played Origen blizzard steam
rapture good old games what else
each of these digital distribution
platforms has their own accounts
software updates annoying adverts and
pop-ups with the exception of perhaps
steam and good old games most of these
platforms are basically totally
unnecessary bloatware all these at least
for me just emphasize the simplicity of
the consoles one machine one service one
distribution model so you've probably
noticed by now I'm not one to
romanticize the PC master-race
as a PC and console gamer I can see the
benefit and disadvantages of both sides
so consoles vs. PC let's wrap up a few
pros and cons reach obviously 4k gaming
and above 60 frame rates multiple screen
setups only possible on the PC if and
when everything is working on the PC
versions of games they will always look
and run better than on the consoles
emphasis on if and when a great thing
about PC that it's highly scalable the
myth of PC gaming being expensive is
simply not the case anymore as most
games scale to the capabilities of your
PC on the other hand I think a great
thing about console gaming is that
everyone has the exact same experience
there is no graphics card enemy on the
consoles and there's no need to tinker
in the graphics setting 21st start up a
game which can ruin the first experience
and sense of immersion
backwards-compatibility and a massive
catalogue of games dating back 20 to 30
years even is a clear advantage for PC
and the sheer amount of gaming content
simply Dwarfs that of all consoles
combined let's face it consoles still
owned the living room environment while
steam machines are making waves in the
couch and controller space and it is
totally possible to hook up your PC with
your TV as I have done but the living
room experience of PC gaming is nowhere
near that of the consoles consoles offer
a hassle-free and streamlined experience
an excellent example of this is rest
mode on the ps4 it enables you to
quickly continue your previous gaming
session with a single button press big
picture mode for steam makes the
experience a bit better but the benefits
are easily outweighed by the games being
fragmented into other digital
distribution platforms and there's
really no easy way of accessing your
entire catalog of games without going
back and forth from the controller to
the mouse and keyboard
it's an annoyance that is not easily
solved consoles simply own when it comes
to accessibility and ease of use a great
thing about the support for control
schemes to everyone's liking and needs
PC support both Xbox one and ps4
controllers obviously Mouse and
keyboards whole tank joystick setups
countless Drive wheels you name it PC
supports it that there is a great
advantage as mentioned before consoles
are predominantly the lead development
platform for big releases and with very
few exceptions console game sales amount
to more than PC iterations of games and
for this reason the unforeseeable future
console hardware will not only be
priority but the lowest common
denominator in terms of hardware
requirements for games this means that
the full potential of my expensive
graphics card that crunches more
teraflops than all the consoles combined
will never really live up to its true
potential I am a total whore for
graphics and I simply want the best
possible visuals and I will be playing
witcher 3 on the pc because it looks
absolutely stunning but even though i
bought arkham knight to play on the pc i
will be playing that on a game console
for obvious reasons
my patients were waiting for patches on
the PC is simply running vin mascot
monetary cost aside I no longer have
time to spend waiting for patches and
reading on neogaf about PC performance
issues I rather spend that time playing
the game and luckily for me the game
looks and runs great on the consoles as
well no matter how many active players
League of Legends has or how many
excellent free-to-play games there are
on PC there's no avoiding the fact that
PC gamers will miss out on quite a lot
the console manufacturers are locking
down amazing exclusives that will never
see the light of day on PC so in
conclusion the PC master-race deserve to
be taken down a notch to an equal level
the console peasants tell them of the
games and the consoles for the most part
let you focus on playing them and I'd
subtly go out to say that PC gaming is
in somewhat of an identity crisis and
there are some serious issues that
publishers and developers need to sort
out going forward the points in round 5
go collectively to the console Alliance
I say unto you welcome and let us enjoy
console gaming as equals No
as brothers
