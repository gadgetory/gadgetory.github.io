to you by Toyota hey guys Ashley with
technobuffalo here at Pep com at CES
2014 I am here with Lloyd Clark from
Roku brooke has got a lot of really
exciting stuff happening here at the
show one of them being this beauty right
here this is a roku TV Roku TV is
happening everybody this is not a
set-top box plugged into a television
this is a TV that runs roku this is your
default here and then if you want to go
to cable your video games blu-ray
netflix all of the channels that Roku
offers are available to you on this
television and other tvs as well so high
sense and TCL are their starting
partners hopefully we'll be adding lots
more in the future so let tell us a
little bit about why roku made the jump
from set-top boxes too full on roku TV
branded right there on the bezel we saw
a problem with Smart TVs that are really
not living up to their potential there's
complexity there's extra cost and this
is something that we think is wrong we
want people to watch more TV and the
best way to do that is give them all
their choices right on the home screen
so we designed a TV for the people for
the way people watch TV today awesome in
it now is this gonna add and I'm
shopping for a new Smart TV is this
going to add a hundreds of dollars to my
bill am I gonna have to go and spend a
bunch of money on a smart TV well if
you've looked at Roku prices before you
know that we're very very affordable
same thing exactly is going to happen
with television we want to make it to
attain able for almost anybody oh and so
uh what I know you guys are focusing on
right now a specific size range and it's
32 to 55 inches is that right 30 to 55
inch you'll be available from two
different manufacturers to start and we
do think it's going to be a platform
that other manufacturers going to adopt
so you'll see from a variety of
different companies of variety of
different prices come
this late summer in 2014 so late summer
you're going to be able to get your
hands on an actual full on roku TV you
know more set-top box that you need to
plug in but they're still going to do
set-top boxes so if you happen to have a
television that you've recently
purchased and you can't quite upgrade
yet you're going to be able to plug in
your Roku 2 you're going to be able to
plug in your Roku set-top box and use
that just like you do right now which is
pretty cool and this is actually the
remote for a roku TV you can see not
complicated which a lot of people are
really big fans of and again this is I
was just saying before we started
filming Roku's make really good gifts
and I think that this right here speaks
to why it's a good gift because you give
this to your grandparents they're not
going to call you in the middle of a
Sunday afternoon saying I don't know why
this isn't working I which button and I
wish I can't get back to the television
so I think this is a really great thing
you guys are doing late summer 2014
Lloyd thank you very much for talking to
us and good luck with everything that is
Roku TV here at Pep com CES 2014 we're
going to bring Allie all kinds of stuff
from the show floor not just here at Pep
calm but on the convention center floor
everywhere all over the place we're
doing it technobuffalo style at CES

get the Toyota for sponsoring our CES
