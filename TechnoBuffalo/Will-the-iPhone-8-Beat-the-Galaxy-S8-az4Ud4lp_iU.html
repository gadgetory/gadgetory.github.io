fires of fanboy war but for one video
let's dump some gasoline on those flames
and compare at least rumor was the
galaxy s 8 versus the upcoming iPhone 8
or iPhone X the flagship oullette iPhone
that's been rumored for several months
caveat sear these are totally based on
rumors this is nothing that's been
written in stone or fact but I'm basing
us off of the most prominent rumors that
we've heard some of this could come true
all the could come true and the opposite
is none of it could come true having a
hypothetical discussion on the iPhone 8
vs Galaxy s8 I think for the first time
in several years I'm actually more
excited for what Apple is supposedly
coming out with then what Samsung is
releasing in just a few weeks let me
tell you why 2017 marks the 10-year
anniversary's original iPhone first of
all it's crazy that a decade has gone by
there's been a ton of conflicting rumors
don't know it's gonna be called the
iPhone 7s that's going to be an
iterative phone then the launch the
rumored iPhone next is going to be their
flagship their thousand-dollar phone
that's gonna have a curved OLED panel
facial recognition AR capabilities
one-up touch ID have kind of a
multifunction strip on the bottom
improved optics better battery and going
to be again extremely expensive it's
kind of what I am basing this comparison
video off of that flagship really
expensive phone I also expect that if it
does launch to launch with a more
iterative maybe 7f kind of looks like
the current body just a little better
features Samsung sides looking to bring
a ton of thunder with the galaxy s 8 and
they're rebounding from the note 7
debacle at the note 7 didn't have its
battery issues I think the note 7 would
have been our favorite phone of the year
so Samsung would have been riding really
high now I think they've got a lot
riding on the success of the s8 remember
your fresher we're looking at probably a
5.8 inch curved display look at the
Snapdragon 835 chip four gigs of ram we
don't know the resolution the screen
that kind of seems to go back and forth
but you're probably going to settle on a
qHD panel thinner improved optics in
that as well I also should have faster
wireless charging of course the VR
capabilities that Samsung has been known
for gear VR and also doubt the note 7
line
is done it should be the first phone you
can buy from Samsung it's gonna be using
USBC so no slouch in its own right and
I'm excited to see that phone but I
think what Apple's got is finally
something new for the past five or six
years for Apple I've been saying this is
a year this year we're gonna get
featured Andrews had for a while we're
gonna get wireless charging it's gonna
happen this is the year and then you
know iPhone 5 iPhone 5s iPhone 6 iPhone
6s iPhone 7 no dice so we're getting a
lot of really exciting things from
Apple's probably the first phone in
about four years actually been a huge
change from design language apples had
it's a very first iPhone screen on top
circular button down below that's going
to change again all allegedly based on
the rumors if Apple does completely
ditch the touch ID button relying again
again on retinal scanning official
recognition things admittedly Samsung
has had and windows phones have had in
the past but that'll be how you'll use
Apple pay and others just using your
face and it's not like the old-school
Android way of using your face unlock a
phone it's actually scanning the the
retinas using the lines on your face you
can't just like hold up a picture or
video in order to get the phone to
unlock so it looks like a lot of cool
things that other competitors have had
for a while are coming to the iPhone as
well as that beautiful OLED screen
figure device curved all the way around
I'm really excited I've been let down I
think by Apple to pass like a lot of you
guys have to despite them being the
number one phone vendor in the world and
them selling just millions and millions
and millions of phones I might not be
excited by the iPhone 7 but certainly a
lot of you are and they've sold again
just between like a butt ton and like a
bajillion of them so like somewhere in
between that those phones are flying off
the shelves Apple certainly doesn't have
to do anything the recipes working but I
think this iPhone X is going to be the
perception shifter at least for Apple
what do you guys think am I like way way
off a my cotton distortion field again
with Apple even though they haven't
destroyed anything yet nothing's been
announced I just kind of got thinking in
the office start talking about what's
coming
planning our schedule for the next few
months we've got kind of excited about
Iliana jot something has happened for a
while so I thought we'd throw it out to
you guys and see what you think about it
if you're excited for the iPhone X with
the iPhone 802 set to call it and the
galaxy s 8 and are coming to the day
