brought to you by audible.com sup sup
John Q here from TechnoBuffalo and I'm
back in my subterranean studio space aka
my basement for another episode of
what's the absent in the last episode
some of you guys have asked me to check
out an android application called
launcher 7 so without further ado here
is my launcher 7 review review reap just
one second here sorry to interrupt but
this is the third launch ii application
that i've checked out for WT a nothing
wrong with that plus you guys can ask
for it but just no more launching
applications for a while and yeah yeah
sorry about that intro yeah intro and
the phone flips over yes one of the
beautiful things about Android is the
ability to customized in since the
beginning a mobile theming about six
years ago people have tried to emulate
other mobile operating systems I don't
know why there's just something really
free and fulfilling about it's like if
you're walking down the street and
someone just hand you a free donut
you're like you hey man you sure though
yeah man here's a free donut here you're
cool so I have my donut it's just I
can't explain it makes you want to whip
your hair back and forth with launcher 7
you can emulate the Windows Phone 7
launcher screen on your Android with
bright green tiles and everything
launcher 7 basically only has 2 screens
the launcher screen and the app screen a
tiny part of me was kind of hoping for
this thing to Windows Phone 7 is the
entire phone but oh well that's that's
fine
the tiles can be moved around and they
have that whooshing launching animation
swipe the screen to the right and you
have your basic app list
unlike other launch applications
launcher 7 it's kind of lacking in the
features Department the only notable
thing you can really do is change the
tile colors pretty cool but math and
adding custom tiles is cumbersome and
confusing yet to tap on settings add
special tile and get this male tile how
you're supposed to know that it's like
if you wanted to buy a note pad and the
only thing you can do was go to the post
office to buy it it just doesn't make
sense it doesn't register you know so
you know what I'm gonna buy that note
pad for that inflated post-office price
and write a letter about how this
post-office notepad metaphor doesn't
make sense to John Q at TechnoBuffalo
maybe throw in some hate words
there you know why cuz I'm conveniently
at the post office
you know that doesn't really make any
sense that's fine that's fine anywho so
you tap mail tile and under launch
application you tap pick your
application then pick your application
then swipe to the right name it
something and choose an icon by tapping
stock or bonus bitmaps apparently you
can load some of your own from the SD
card as well then finally tap create
mail tile you're gonna be prompted but
just tap yes and you're done you can add
widgets but they usually don't look
right another downside is that all the
tiles are static meaning you won't see a
notification if you get a new message or
missed phone call or something the only
active tile would be mail but then you
got a tap on that god-forsaken stupid
add mail tile thing after that you have
to reset up your email even if you've
set up everything already with your
phone's default sync settings you know
what you know you know what's gonna make
me feel a little bit better to take some
time to thank our good friends at
audible.com/anna Bolcom is the leading
provider of downloadable digital audio
books and spoken word entertainment
choose from over 100,000 titles to be
downloaded right on to your ipod or mp3
player to be played back anywhere
anytime choose from books in every genre
science fiction thrillers dramas
comedies business history and much more
recently I started listening to a lot of
radio shows of louis c.k on hope en
anthony and it's great to have on in the
background while you work and you know
what audible has quite a few of them and
they're each like four hours long so I
have a lot of stuff to go through it's
fantastic like my face just go to
audiblepodcast.com/tekzilla thats te CH
n o to get a free audiobook download of
your choice when you sign up today again
go to audiblepodcast.com/tekzilla free
audiobook back to launcher seven to be
fair the application isn't that terrible
a huge plus side for launcher 7 is its
simplicity and it's lightweight in this
I don't even know if that's a word
lightweightness but that's okay so you
know you don't ever have to worry about
it slowing down your phone cuz it won't
personally I'd give it a three out of
five I feel like adding custom tile
should be a lot easier and I'm not sure
if this is possible because I'm not an
app developer but adding live tiles for
something like phone calls messages
tweets and things of that sort would be
really really cool
value wise I give it a 5 out of 5 10 out
of 10 110% cuz it's free you know so
yeah well hope you guys enjoyed my
review of launcher
seven and I must shake things up a
little bit here if there's an
application out there that you would
love to check out but you haven't yet
for whatever reason let me know the
reason and let me know the application
and I'll check it out for you so this
was John Q from TechnoBuffalo thank you
very much for tuning in and I'll see you
guys next time
latest it just doesn't click it doesn't
make sense you know so I I go by my post
office no I don't buy a post office I
would if I could buy that post office
send myself some mail all the time 24/7
