to you by AMD what's up everyone welcome
back to another episode of ask the
Buffalo the show where you can ask me
Ashley skele AKA not jon rettinger any
question you might have for the wide
world of technology every tuesday we put
up a call for questions on TechnoBuffalo
com you can leave your comments and
questions in that post otherwise you can
send them to me anytime of the day or
night at technobuffalo or Ashley a
schedule on Twitter just use the hashtag
ask the be so I'll see it and usually I
answer between three and five questions
every episode let's get answering
because this is asked the Buffalo
technobuffalo commenter Josh asked if
you were choosing between chromecast or
an apple TV which would you choose both
can do YouTube and Netflix and both work
well with iOS devices is it worth it to
get a chromecast if you already own an
apple TV well here's the thing Josh so
actually as of this recording which is
friday afternoon chromecast doesn't
quite work with iOS yet so uh if i had
to choose right this second it would be
apple TV but i think what it really
boils down to even with compatibility is
two things number one where do you buy
your apps and your movies and your
television shows and number two what
kinds of devices do you have in your
home if you're an android-based home and
you have an HTC One and you've got a
nexus 7 obviously to me the chromecast
is the better choice if you have of
course Apple products in your home you
want to get an Apple TV because you're
able to do mirroring you're able to use
airplay there's so many options that
Apple TV offers you sure they can both
do YouTube and Netflix but the other
thing is that a box like Roku does
YouTube and Netflix really well so I
think depending on what you're looking
for in terms of streaming from your
mobile device to your television set I
would say as of right now if your google
household yeah a chromecast if you're an
apple person you love iOS Apple TVs the
way to go at artistic revenge asks which
do you prefer for a smartphone Android
iOS or Windows I actually have this
dream of a phone
that is designed like an iPhone has the
same level of productivity as Android I
really like widgets but also has the
camera of Lumia and the notification
system of webos for me I want that
perfect chimera of smartphones and I
don't obviously think that'll ever exist
because web voice is dead for day-to-day
driver I do have an iphone but i also
have an HTC one that I used as a
secondary device because I like to have
my finger on the pulse of both for right
now I do use an iphone as my daily
driver at Kevin Wilson 94 asks it seems
like the 3.5 millimeter audio jack is
going to be a limiting factor in
thinness do you think we'll see it
superseded I do think at some point
bluetooth is going to end up just kind
of being a natural part of our
smartphone experience so I don't think
we'll have headphone jacks anymore on
our smartphones but the problem with
that is is that Bluetooth technology is
not quite the same in terms of there's a
lot of tininess to it and a lot of
bluetooth headphones and headsets and
things like that even in the higher end
stuff you just don't get the same rich
audio quality that you might see from
say a hundred and fifty dollar pair of
audio technica cans for your ears for
right now i think the audio technology
is not quite there it's gonna take a
little while to do that and lastly king
of tweets asks hey what is your
education I did graduate high school and
I also have a two-year degree of an AAA
associated the arts degree in English
and then I have a four year degree from
chapman university in television
production so um this is definitely not
anything that's new to me however I did
for a while when I went to school kind
of want to write comedy so I wanted to
write television which I do get to
script stuff still I get to write the
show and and all that stuff but um yeah
so now I do technology which I've loved
since I was a kid with all the great
stuff that I learned in terms of my
official education so that's where i
went for university and it was great but
no plans for masters because really this
kind of stuff right here for a video
production person is your master's
degree um you don't necessarily need it
working out the field way more important
i think before i go i wanted to tell you
guys a little bit about
and these newest chips the a series
mobility APU o is tough for a while to
find the right chip for mobile that
combined media performance with great
productivity until now the new a series
mobility APU is the world's first
quad-core chip designed specifically for
tablets and touchscreen laptops like the
acer aspire v5 it's also adaptive to
your choice of environment so let's say
you have a hybrid tablet with the
mobility chip on board but you want to
drop it into the AMD turbo dock well the
chip will know what's in there and it
will deliver up to forty percent faster
GPU and CPU performance by taking
advantage of any additional cooling the
dock might have available so that's
super awesome if you're using a device
like the acer aspire v5 you have access
to a full microsoft office suite may get
the perfect choice if you need to get
some heavy duty productivity apps going
on if you want to learn more about
getting the best of both mobile and
desktop worlds in your processor head

series mobility APU that's it for this
