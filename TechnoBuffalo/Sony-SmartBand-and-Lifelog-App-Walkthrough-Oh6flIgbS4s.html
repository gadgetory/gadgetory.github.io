technobuffalo i'm here at Mobile World
Congress in Barcelona Spain checking out
Sony's SmartWare and specifically the
lifelog application here on the Xperia
z2 but basically it's a wearable device
and you can see got the black model but
there's concepts for different covers
you could put on it and really the idea
here is it's not just a fitness bed but
a actual life log and that's why the
application here will tell you about
that so you have it connected with your
Sony device you keep track of calories
burned in your steps which you would do
on plenty of other devices fifth pitcher
for the jawbone or anything loss nike
but here you can also keep track of
other things like how much time you
spent in the car or biking we're on a
train we're listening to music and
taking photos or watching videos and
playing video games so the point here is
that maybe you're trying to lose weight
but maybe you're also spending way too
much time playing video games and so you
can sort of see the balance in your life
as you go throughout the day and when
you might have done stuff so here you
can see earlier in the day playing video
games listening to music being a media
maven if you will and then later on kind
of spent some time walking around took a
picture and then didn't do anything the
rest of the day but it sort of shows you
the timeline about what you were doing
says what you took a picture of or see
the music one what you listen to so kind
of cool history tracker to as well
that's a really a life log all in one
and this is Todd Hazleton with
technobuffalo checking out the Sony's
wearable here at Mobile World Congress
in Barcelona Spain what's up everyone
