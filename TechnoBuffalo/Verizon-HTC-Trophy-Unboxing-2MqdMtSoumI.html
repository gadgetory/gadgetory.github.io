fast and furious this week we're just
trying to keep up I got the trophy I got
the revolution I got the trophy I got
the revolution which one let's uh let's
do the trophy some people want a trophy
wife other people want a trophy phone I
guess man that was a terrible joke what
is going on I'm Noah from TechnoBuffalo
calm its the HTC trophy one of four new
smart phones Verizon rolled out this
week this is the only Windows Phone 7
device they rolled out the others are
all Android phones the the LG revolution
does LTE the Droid x2 dual-core version
the Droid X and the Xperia Play the
playstation phone all rolling out this
week with this one the HTC trophy $149
on contract Windows Phone 7 news coming
out of New York this week from Microsoft
they did an official preview of Windows
Phone mango codenamed mango the the next
big update really the biggest update to
date which will be rolling out this fall
along with new hardware but current
devices will be supported in the upgrade
so if you pick up a trophy now you'll be
able to upgrade it to mango when mangos
available this fall but in the meantime
here's the trophy made by HTC it's got a
3.8 inch display it's got a Snapdragon
processor it's got 16 gigabytes of
on-board storage so we'll take a look in
just a second in the box you get an AC
adapter you get a set of headphones
earphones and you get a micro USB cable
and then you get your your manuals so
HTC differential differentiating a
little bit with their Verizon phones
including earphones in the package and
some of them like I have noticed whereas
some of the other companies don't but
anyway the trophy 3.8 inches and it's
very lightweight it actually it has a
nice feel to it it's you know it looks
like a Windows though the Windows Mobile
or Windows Phone 7 devices have all kind
of looked the same to some extent you
know some differentiation that arrived
on Sprint has a keyboard the surround
has the slide-out speakers but you know
basically all kind of the same look
Microsoft had some some hardware
standards you know that
everybody had to adhere to so you've got
the three capacitive touch buttons on
the bottom you know kind of a basic look
and feel but it's a nice looking phone
and it's lightweight like I said which
is good and I like you know the 3.8 inch
it's kind of a nice you know it's sort
of iPhone 4 screen sized and a nice
in-between if you want some some real
estate but don't want a huge phone like
these new for 4.3 4.5 inch devices 4800
WVGA resolution on the side you've got a
single your hardware camera button which
is a feature of all Windows Phone 7
devices you've got a 5 megapixel camera
on the back with flash and HD video
capture on the top 3 1/2 millimeter
audio jack your power lock switch on the
right or on the left spine rather you've
got a rocker switch for volume and a USB
port and then there you go your
microphone down there on the bottom and
again you know this does not have mango
but it will be mango supported it's a 3G
phone not an LTE phone but you've got
pre-installed you've got slacker radio
you've got the HTC hub you've got of
course the Xbox Live integration the
Zune integration so let's go into what's
going to apps here and see what else
you've got going on Internet Explorer my
fries and mobile netflix pre-installed
which is nice so you know kind of the
kind of the basics here but you've got
Netflix and well they're the HTC huh
I'll tell you what shout out to our boy
John Rhett injure the original
TechnoBuffalo John for Lakers as I'm
sure you're all aware he was on I just
saw with that that little warning about
privacy he was on the CBS Early Show the
other day national TV
early morning talk show explaining how
geo-tagging works when you turn on GPS
on your phone you take photos and you
upload those photos if you upload them
direct from your phone your metadata is
on those photos so people can very
easily download your photo look in the
settings and find out exactly where and
when the photo was taken so privacy
stuff that you know geeks are aware of
and we all fiddle with our settings so
to speak but a lot of people aren't
necessarily aware of and they take their
photos now it's so easy to share
are directly from your phone onto you
know onto Facebook and YouTube and
everywhere else and people don't
necessarily know that they're sharing so
much precise information so if you
haven't seen that check that out it's up
on our on our web page on our in the
news page there on TechnoBuffalo comm
you can watch John spot on the early the
early show on CBS very cool to get a
great job anyway so you know kind of the
basics here there's not a lot that's
changed with Windows Phone 7 again the
big updates coming later this year so
just kind of nice to see a new form
factor and the $149 price is pretty good
I am I'm trying to get through here I
thought there were more apps I could get
to by scrolling swiping but I guess I
had to hit the button there so here we
go there's a you know the HTC hub with
some apps there they're rolling out the
apps you know crustal but surely but
they're you know they're coming and I
like the Metro UI design language of
effects Xbox Live of Windows Phone 7 you
know I think I think there's a lot of
potential here but they're playing
catch-up and I don't know if it's gonna
be too little too late it'll be
interesting to see how much of a push
they can make for the holiday shopping
season but I like the live tiles
enhancements coming to the live tile
system you know a lot of stuff coming in
the fall and I don't mean to give the
trophy short shrift but I really you
know the exciting news is what's going
to be coming down the line so there's an
article on TechnoBuffalo calm you can
read but kind of a full-on roundup of
all the stuff coming in the Windows
Phone mango update later on and like I
said if you pick up a trophy now you
know you'll be ready for that update
come fall so your future proofed which
is good but it's the HTC trophy Windows
Phone 7 3.8 inch WVGA display 5
megapixel camera 16 gigs of storage and
a single core 1 gigahertz Snapdragon
processor from Qualcomm it's available
right now 149 dollars on contract on
Verizon much much more on Windows Phone
