TechnoBuffalo here's a full review for
you of the latest from ZTE this is the
flagship spec axon phone it packs a ton
of power at a pretty reasonable price
we're gonna do this review a bit
differently we're starting a new format
called review and - if you couldn't
guess it I'm gonna do a full review of
the phone in two minutes so you know
everything that you need to know in just
120 seconds I think it's like the format
let me know down below
I picked reviewing - because it couldn't
do anything fun that rhymes with 3 or 4
so if you guys can guess I'm a talker so
I'm gonna try real hard to condense
everything down so you know whether or
not this phone is going to be right for
you
without further ado let's start the
clock I use a device for four days on
AT&amp;amp;T the 5.5 inch 2k screen is pretty
good bright colors did look a bit washed
out but it was great in direct sunlight
the phone is crazy fast a Snapdragon 810
4 G's a ram as you'd expect things just
zip apt open really fast ever had any
delay whatsoever did a ton of
multitasking no issue from the looks of
device it looks almost HTC built with a
kind of industrial metal the top and
bottom there right here and here are
plastics they don't get that cold metal
feel that you get with the rest of
device but overall it looks and feels
premium and I really like the way the
device felt when I picked it up in the
morning for that cold metal well it
looks like dual front-facing speakers
only the bottom ins a speaker but it
does sound rising ly awesome the skin on
here is light faced in android 5.1 dot 1
it's useful but i still prefer the stock
look so i through nova and moon shine on
here but that's the beauty of android
you customize it to be any way you want
the 3000 milliamp hour battery is as
good as advertised
I've got about eleven and a half hours
on standby they advertise 12 and a bind
of day had about a forty percent battery
life left that's what the screen
brightness set at around 75% the back
and multitasking buttons can be
configured but they just show up is dot
I kept forgetting which night had set it
for I wish there was a better way to
show which was which at least had the
buttons on-screen the dual 13 megapixel
cameras on the back takes pretty solid
pictures in both low and normal light
want to see more pictures hit the link
down below go to the article you'll see
a gallery there dual LEDs also make for
ridiculously bright flashlight I love
there's a physical camera button as well
be taking pictures way easier and yes it
has NFC I would have liked more than 30
gigs of storage here but you make do
with what you got 450
I would absolutely buy this phone and I
would happily use it for the next year
to two years it's a great value and a
great phone ZTE nailed it
pick up the axe on something boom under
two minutes
full phone review let me exhale ice like
the micro machine guy what do you think
of the format I love do your thoughts on
it if you liked it let us know if you
don't let us know too what sort of work
to tweak it I figured if you guys wanna
know everything you know about a phone
don't want to watch eight-minute video -
or give it everything that you need to
know until next time jad renter from
TechnoBuffalo see you guys next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
