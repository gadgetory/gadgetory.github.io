TechnoBuffalo here is an unboxing for
you of the HTC aria a new android 2.1
powered handset for eighteen t wireless
that's going to be coming on jun 20th
for 130 bucks after rebate and a
two-year contract this is made by HTC
and is one of the lucky HTC phones
they're using HTC Sense drinking at all
kinds of cool widgets and a few more
home screens so move through the specs
as we continue the unboxing here this is
much needed phone at 18 Keys lineup it
sort of as a prosumer model phone
certainly above their other Android
offering the backflip let's go ahead and
do the unboxing this just came from HTC
and AT&amp;amp;T no need for the big night
affair since we have these pull tabs
have to risk my fingers to try and open
a box All Right see what we got here
have some press material quick start
guide for set off to the side and again
we'll go through the specs as we
continue the unboxing tour alright this
looks like this is a pre-production
packaging certainly not where you're
going to get when you buy the device in
the store on the 20th or afterwards this
is just something there send me out I
guess to to reviewers so spec wise again
this is running Android 2.1 and as a 3.2
inch hvga of course multi-touch
capacitive screen it's got inbound Wi-Fi
need support for the new 7.2 megabits
per second HSPA network an 18th is
starting to roll out I've powered by a
600-acre ranch Qualcomm processor and
has 512 megabytes Abramelin 384 of ram a
micro SD card slot and having eight
twelve hundred million our battery which
is supposedly going to keep you going
for about six ish hours let's go ahead
and start the unboxing so there is the
device itself push it off the side for
just
a moment very small let's see what else
you're going to get in the box or I
think you're going to get in the box so
HTC looks to be continuing it's colored
innards and battery scheme and this time
we have yellow so there's a 1200
milliamp hour battery n AT&amp;amp;T and rather
HTC sort of standard array of
accessories got a stereo headphone
inbound Mike of course a 3.5 millimeter
headset jack got your USB cable and
appears that this is probably going to
use coarse micro USB and your us wall
plug so nothing terribly fancy there go
ahead and push that off to the side and
let's take a look at the phone itself
there's sort of a lot to see here that's
the interesting size screen that's a bit
smaller than we usually see but it makes
the phone extremely possible 3.2 inches
and takes advantage of sort of an
optical trackpad something that we've
seen before for example in the droid
incredible which HTC also made so it's
of course a capacitive multi-touch
screen you've got your home button menu
button back search button standard
Android array on the left hand side
you've got a volume up and down rocker
on the right you've got nothing on the
back we have a camera whose resolution
I'm actually not sure but I will add
that in the annotations speaker grill
any sort of industrial looking screws
which I don't see me assume we need to
remove put in the battery let's go ahead
and pop the battery in and we can power
the sucker on and on the top you've got
your hold and power button and 3.5
millimeter headset jack now let's do a
quick size comparison so you can see how
big or small as they look on some of its
competition or friends we've got the
iphone 3gs here to 3.5 inch touch
screens you can see there is certainly a
difference in the size of the two
devices there we've got the nexus one
which is on multiple carriers see the
size difference there as well and just
for laughs we've got the big daddy we
have the HTC evo 4g and it looks like a
father and son combo here so i will zoom
out and i'll show you a bit of the
thickness of the device to help you will
gauge it it is very thin so
there is next to the evo will bring in
the necklace one and will complete this
smartphone sammich with the iphone 3gs
let's see how the battery panels you
moved here I don't assume they have to
pop off the sort of industrial looking
back well let's see go ahead and see how
this works it looks like you probably
have to pry it around the sides here we
sort of seen that on some other devices
think of it sort of like the palm pixi
so I'm going to go ahead and try and
pull this thing off okay so it's a bit
of a trick to get this back off I do
want to clarify this does actually have
a 5 megapixel camera on the back no LED
flash but as if I've megapixel sensor
you've got to pull the battery off they
claim in the manual you got to put your
finger right in that little lip and pull
off I don't have big nails and I can't
do it so if you take your finger and you
push right in that grill and you hold
the device you'd be able to pop off the
back in theory there it goes and I
assume we're going to be looking at an
all yellow back so you work at the top
off continue to sort of work your
fingers around it there we go so the
back is off and there is a spot there of
course for the sim card at a micro SD
card and seeing what size come installed
I believe it's two gigs you get a two
gig micro SD I'm going to be installed
in the box and purchase the phone go
ahead and put the battery in see if it's
got any use it try and put this back
cover on there we go goes on a lot
easier than it goes off alright so turn
its on it will seem a guy of any power
I'm sure going to get sort of the
standard Android boot screens but in
case you guys want to see it here we go
and it is a very interesting form factor
to have a phone to screen the small
really makes it very tiny especially
interesting compared to sort of phones
now are going larger and larger screen
like the 4.3 inch on the EVO 4G we've
seen on the hd2 and some of the new
other phones are coming out to get
larger and larger this is sort of the
more of a prosumer model offering you
want power but you don't need screaming
speed you want something can be able to
multitask something that's sort of going
to get you through the day this looks to
be served at the sweet spot this would
be akin to the HTC hero type of phone so
not not top of the line but certainly
not at the bottom so it's going to be
the phone I think a lot of people are
going to be looking for when they come
to Android for AT&amp;amp;T so we get the HTC
quietly brilliant they are necessarily
loud 18t 3g scream and fireballs do i
guess you could say our Darren
and there we have after a few minutes
the Louis Prima have you know there is
not a sim card in there yet the slide to
unlock it's going to take me to some of
the setup stuff and there you have it a
first look at the HTC aria stay tuned to
the channel for its fun of other
coverage sitting on the stacks up with
other Android devices anyway jon
