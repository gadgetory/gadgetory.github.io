TechnoBuffalo show I'm like you're to
host for today Sean ani editor-in-chief
of the site and i'm joined by deputy
managing editor todd hazleton everybody
are you doing today Todd I'm good
welcome into my apartment and he's
watching the show I have a new webcam
and it's very wide angle yes it is it's
extremely wide angle well you'll just
have to keep that much more of your
apartment clean it's all a devious plan
by your wife that's great she messed
with the settings to get as wide a
tangle as possible yeah well it is a
quieter week than last week thankfully
it is uh not as crazy I I don't think
there's a whole lot next week either
yeah I think it's finally actually
slowing down remember when you're
talking about this couple weeks ago I
think there's been maybe one week we've
gone since like before WWDC in June
where there wasn't like a meeting or a
big briefing or something right uh this
week it's finally quiet which means of
course we got to work on the reviews and
all that stuff yeah it's nice to be over
all the announcements but then comes the
time for the devices to actually arrive
oh I'm boxing do the reviews yeah all
that fun stuff you know and that's one
thing a lot of people don't understand
is that you know be it a phone you know
a phone you actually have to use for a
while before you can review it unlike
some sites out there that tend to review
in 24 hours ahead or video games where
yo Joey and his crew have to play
through the entire game before they
apparently i forgot to silence my iphone
yeah me too but I feel like that's kind
of comes with the territory it's a
technical right in fact our stuffs gonna
be going off yes it's muted now but uh
you know it takes a while to get through
all this stuff yeah I don't envy gaming
we've talked about that before but i
can't imagine trying to get through
games babies cuz i'm not very good at
gaming feel like we take me twice as
long yeah that's the possibility I i
I've done one or two game
reviews and it does take quite a while
to work your way through them and it
also it's it's very different I mean I'm
sure Oh for Joey and his folks it's you
know they're used to but whenever I've
reviewed a game it's been like I feel
like it's a job and that's not why I
play video games yeah yeah exactly it's
I mean there's there's a lot of games
like thinking about far cry earlier this
year and for some the other ones I was
playing like The Witcher witcher 3 um
we're like there's open worlds and so
many side quests and things you could do
but like I feel if you're reviewing the
game you kind of just got to get through
it right and then maybe you can go back
afterwards so yeah yeah well the this
week we're going to be discussing a bit
of streaming there's been a lot going on
in the screaming spoons and of course
the the biggest thing is the release
finally last week of the new Apple TV
and well we good you just go ahead and
jump it and not wait for someone to uh
ask the question what did I return this
week what did you return this week it
was apple TV I bought it on sunday i
bought it sunday night because i had to
go to bestbuy anyway i was at my in-laws
house i had to help them work on some
internet issues so i was getting a
powerline networking thing and they
happen to happen in stock not happened I
actually did look ahead of time to see
if they had it and kind of made that my
trip to best buy in any case so i bought
the 32 gig version i was really excited
to play with it and i came home went to
set it up the bluetooth pairing didn't
work so that meant that you know it
didn't pull in my Apple IT or my
bluetooth or maya Wi-Fi settings
automatically it did for you though
right i think other people it worked for
really well i don't know why mine wasn't
working so that was like going into it i
was immediately frustrated because you
have to use this new remote which by the
way isn't very good and you have to go
through and click you know Todd dot
Hazleton my whole email address um you
know login I think it failed the first
i'm logged in it worked the second time
and then I'm presented with this home
screen I'm like okay now what okay let's
get some apps now I got some games the
remote wasn't very good for those games
i thought you know okay i could buy
another third-party control or whatever
which by the way if you want another
remote they're 70 bucks half the price
of the actual app Apple TV which is
insane um that is ridiculous yeah so I
was like ah man um you know just I
wasn't impressed I was like okay other
boxes can do this they don't cost 150
bucks but it looked nice i'll give it
that like the interface my wife even is
like why did you waste your money on
this Lake will do what is it do we have
like ten boxes we don't we have an old
road cute of a grip she always likes to
say like I do actually have to survive
that's like her defense so I was like
and we have an old Apple TV um but in
any case so I was like all right you
know good point then two days ago Plex
came out which is awesome so I finally
set up my streaming server again I
haven't had one of those in years got
Plex set up i'm streaming movies that i
have rented elsewhere and it worked
really well and I was like okay this is
awesome but then reminded you know okay
Plex is also on the roku to which we are
you so I was like now what so last night
I was uh I was finally getting back to
building a pc and I needed some stuff
from Best Buy and I was like you know
what Apple TVs going back and I swapped
it out for an SSD and some other stuff
so by Apple TV you know I think it we
were saying last yesterday before I
returned it that mate I think it'll
probably be worth at 150 bucks later on
when there's apps and stuff to do but
right now it's just like no you know and
I mentioned this to you I think one of
the silliest things to me so the new
remote which is not that great charges
via lightning port bread there is no
indication on the remote whatsoever that
it's actually charging or that it's full
yeah so you just plug it in for a while
and kind of go I hope it's charging
yeah and the reviews i was reading were
saying like oh this remotes so much
better it's awesome um I didn't like it
at all the the touch sensitive area was
finicky OEM I changed his speeds I
changes speeds of several times I just
didn't like the way that it was I was
sort of mousing with my thumb um you
know I think Roku remote is so simple
but I prefer it so I don't know i just
edited 70 bucks my selling price it was
like get out of here come on that's
crazy well and also the fact that the
click to confirm is the touch area which
is at the top of the remote so it's kind
of awkward you kind of like have to drag
it back in your hand to get your thumb
up there and to give it a clean click
yeah it's just it's oh yeah and one of
the things I wrote about to I like
having these streaming boxes as music
players for my living room sometimes and
I was kind of frustrated to learn that
Syria doesn't work with Apple music I
don't know why I assumed it would but i
did because this has a universal search
but it can't tap into Apple music which
is mind-blowing so then you know I'm
like okay I'm gonna play this and I have
to like go into itunes and type with
this remote and it's terrible like even
the layout makes no sense to me it's a
long list of letters from left to right
and you know I was entering in something
on my playstation 4 last night and just
like boop boop boop boop it's very easy
maybe it's because of the controller but
also the layout makes a lot more sense
you go up down up down you know and
you're typing not like a long list and
by the way if you go to the end of that
list it doesn't bring you back to the
start you've just makes no sense so I
don't know I was very just pace I I'm
keeping mine simply because i am the the
streaming guy yeah but it's as i always
say on these shows folks this is not our
official review right but i really i
don't know i we waited this long for
this and as i was telling you off off
mic the other day
you know it feels like they just finally
went okay we can't wait longer we got
push this out the door it feels like
there is a missing piece yeah yeah it
does and I think that's might be there
TV service or something exactly what the
heck like okay it looks great in there's
apps and that part is really cool okay
and I think there's gonna be a lot of
really cool apps but you're just still
like huh like why why did it take how
long five yeah yeah I don't know it it
definitely feels unfinished hmm you know
and not worthy of the wait that's for
sure yeah uh I think it's yeah because I
think the first thing people are going
to say in defense of it is well the
games are there in the apps but you
really once you get a hold of that
controller and try to play the games it
just doesn't feel right like even Crossy
Road like swiping up left right it's
like just that's not the way it should
be done I mean maybe I'd have to buy
another controller before I judge it but
but and see that's the thing though that
would be a third-party controller so if
you're judging the apple TV on the Apple
TVs merits you can't take a third-party
controller into consideration right so
at that stage yeah it's not good yeah
and I don't need another controller to
be honest I'd at this point it's just
like I'm just gonna use my console right
like I have all of that stuff on my
console and I okay i don't have the apps
but one of the things you're talking
about the other day two is like yeah
there's air B&amp;amp;B which actually would be
pretty cool for booking apps are just
looking at if you're going to visit
another city or booking apartments but
it didn't really make any sense it
doesn't have a map so you can't see
where the apartment is and stuff like
that is I would have been better served
by using Airbnb on my computer
smartphone and so that to me means well
why does there need to be an apple TP up
and I don't think there needs to be and
so then I would just go to my ps4 where
maybe there's not apps but
there are the games and I already have
the controller and I have all the
streaming services I need and that just
makes more sense to me and again yeah
we're not bashing it this is you know in
a review i think we're looking at it so
what did Apple try to do and do well in
that bag boy here it's sort of like well
it doesn't fit my lifestyle and I can't
go into a review and say you know this
is a crappy product because I don't need
it well we would do that but i'm just
we're talking here on the show about Lee
well I really because it doesn't make
sense for me tome it's plugged into my
hdmi switcher but since the initial
setup I know my hdmi switcher is set to
either my Roku or my blu-ray player
because i'm actually watching some
physical media lately so I'm not even
really playing with it hmm you know I
just I don't know I'm not that excited
by it I just I think I think there
definitely was a we were waiting for
something to happen it didn't happen we
gotta go ahead and get this pushed out
yeah and I I admit they're one of the
reasons I bought is because I just want
to see what was going on and I in
knowing full well I could return it yeah
so yeah exactly so I don't know it very
odd but in general there is a lot going
on in the streaming space right now of
course the biggest news of the week
being that not only is a Star Trek
television series on the way it's only
going to be on CBS all access right and
I love a lot of people immediately after
they announced for like why did they do
this this doesn't make any sense there's
a good a sense if I don't have any hard
numbers on the number of subscribers to
CBS all access but and for those that
are outside the US Hawk explain it real
quick it's 599 a month gives you access
to all the current CBS shows plus a lot
of archived shows back to like I Love
Lucy you know Twin Peaks a bunch of
other stuff they produce cheers and
so on so there's a lot of content on
there the thing is those CBS is the only
network that went out on its own app it
unlike say ABC NBC and Fox and the CW
all went with hulu CBS is CBS they
decide oh we gotta do our own app its
nobi 599 I never hear anyone discussing
CBS all access I never hear it discussed
so here we are we're going to get one
episode of the new Star Trek series on
prime-time television which will be like
a little a little taste of what you
could be missing on CBS all access and
then it all moves over to this five
ninety-nine a month thing gee willikers
you take a pop culture icon you put it
behind a paywall what do you think is
going to happen to the subscription
numbers of CBS all access well I think
they'll go up yeah exactly to me it was
a no-brainer what this was all about yep
but what do you think because it seemed
like I mean that's what we think it's
probably exactly what will happen and it
does make sense to us but yesterday
people seemed so angry on Twitter that
like it was like they were gonna drive a
boycott here's the thing when push comes
to shove and it's a new star trek series
all those people will subscribe so so
they know it's not gonna be a big deal
no it's not gonna be a big deal I mean
and yes so I'm sure somebody will figure
out a way to get them onto torrent sites
and which I'm not condoning in any way
shape or form you know so there's still
going to be piracy and all that but the
majority of people my father who is a
die-hard Star Trek fan when he was in
the Navy and Star Trek was on he and
this was back in the 60s and he could
not watch it my mother who was just his
fiancee at that time had to watch it
every week and write him a letter with
the synopsis of the episode that's
incredible so my mother who had no
interest in Star Trek every week
it rode out a full synopsis that's
incredible you know this is a man that
has watched every iteration of the show
seen every movie all that stuff by golly
he's going to pay the five ninety-nine a
month to watch a new series right right
there's zero question in my mind that my
father will be sitting right there going
chod how do i log into this new circuits
coming on but does he come out is it uh
January 2017 so it's oh yeah it's quite
a while I here's the thing they have
even got writers for it yet Wow so I
think everybody should not worry for a
little bit yeah and the show did receive
what's called a straight-to-series order
which means that most shows have to film
a pilot then the pilot has protested and
all that Star Trek has gone straight to
series which means just start filming
and go right so the Star Trek show is
happening yeah okay someday we may even
know what it's about but but on the flip
side of things apparently during the
time warner earnings call this week they
have hinted at the idea that perhaps
they should hold onto their shows a
little bit longer before they sell them
off to third-party digital platforms
Netflix right and you know a lot of
people are like well why would you do
that because you're making money from
them the thing is if you look at the
numbers for the Nielsen's people that
are actually watching television as it
airs or even what they called plus three
numbers which is three days of DVR
watching post the original airing mhm
the numbers last season dropped nine
percent okay so there's a lot of people
they're just going I'll just wait until
the whole seasons on netflix and binge
it right that's exactly what's happening
but so time weren't that's what they're
trying to fight it gets yeah yeah
because it while they're making money on
this one hand they're losing nine
percent of their audience that's that
much lower of a commercial rate they can
charge
Oh see I see it from the business
protected but I now I understand why
you're saying I think that's tough
because I was saying earlier we were
talking about this topic I said well
that sounds like they're just not
getting adjusted to the times but
because I think that is what people are
doing you know really i'm just gonna
pinch watch it later why would i watch
it now are worried about it now i watch
something else hmm yeah so it yeah it
will work itself into they have to lower
their advertising rates because they
don't have as large an audience anymore
hmm so they can hold on to it for say an
extra three months and collect you know
maybe you launch your own digital
platform maybe you know part of hulu
whatever the netflix is still going to
want the show in three months they may
play a little rate but they would still
want it so hopefully they could drive
more people back to the traditional
terrestrial television which is not
going to happen people will just wait
three extra months right in the hopes of
driving their advertising rates back up
yeah that's really tough i think i'm
with you though i don't think people are
gonna go back I think what they'll do is
they'll watch something else knowing
that they could just watch this later i
mean i've done that to where you know oh
I think I came into a game of thrones
season late or something and I was like
I'm just gonna wait for the season to
finish and then I'm gonna binge watch it
oh I don't know if it was Game of
Thrones or something like that but it
was the same idea it's like I'm not
gonna I'm not gonna get involved with
the TV show and it's just gonna come out
later and it's a lot more fun to watch
shows on your own schedule I think
that's oh yeah the industry's going yeah
yeah I know I'm I'm much happier I mean
you know this morning I as you know Todd
I come in early to work out and stuff
before work you know and I love the fact
that I pulled up hulu and there's a new
episode of the flash for me there's
agents of shield you know there's
iZombie you know I've got all these
shows that I love to watch and I can
pull up whichever one I feel like
pulling up right you know that's the way
I prefer to consume television at this
point and you know as
we've said on the show many times now
you know now that I'm a cord cutter and
that's another thing about CBS all
access with which I lost over a little
bit you know I think CBS all access
suffers unless you watch multiple shows
on CBS or you're a hard hard-core cord
cutter like myself there's not a whole
lot of impetus to subscribe to CBS all
access in my case i watch for CBS series
hmm you know if i only watched one or
two i would go and just go by the entire
season through amazon or itunes because
it would work out cheaper in the long
run than the five ninety-nine a month
exactly since i watch for shows
financially it makes more sense to
subscribe to all access although i
haven't thought about this yeah i may
cancel it in the summer save myself
eighteen dollars you know why should i
be subscribing when there's no new
episodes yeah that's actually
interesting my wife and i were thinking
about doing this with cable cancelling
it after football season one of the
reasons we have cable here so you can
just watch the football games but after
that we don't really watch a lot of
shows that we can't get elsewhere online
you know whether it's we've been
watching Downton Abbey and that's on
amazon prime or anything else you know
Game of Thrones for example we could
just now get HBO Go where as of last
year that wasn't an option either so I
don't know there's an HBO now that's
there's the one scream go is the one if
you already happy you know HBO now is
now and alone right so that's the one
they should just call that this I don't
know what it that was the silliest idea
to name them two different things yeah
just pay for it and one work so you know
yeah you haven't tied to your cable yes
you you fire up the app and there's a
are you a current subscriber yes are you
know or you click no would you like to
subscribe to our on demand yeah exactly
why do two separate apps I made no sense
whatsoever and read it it has caused i
don't know how many times I've had to
explain HBO now versus HBO go to people
really yeah well I mean here we are
recover it every day and I was
we wish one it's it's not your field of
expertise I mean that's fine but ages
yeah and jerrell it's just like it made
no sense well let's dive into some of
the questions we're getting a lot of
them I am NOT going to make this a
regular thing but this has gotten three
uploads so that's something we're going
to say hi to Luke Petrovitch please
don't a lot of people get the idea it
was it Luca I'm Luca Petrovich hello
let's not get a whole bunch of people
now requesting that we give them shout
outs but how we do have a lot of
questions here from Jeff k do you watch
Gotham I hear the Rings are following
steadily it's such a great show I'd hate
for them to can it I do watch Gotham I
thought this week's episode in
particular and I won't say what happens
in case you haven't seen it was
mind-boggling they stepped up a whole
lot of storylines in one quick shot I
love the show but I'm also a huge Batman
phonetic so even though it doesn't
follow the comic canon I uh and well
looka that was not an appropriate
question and that one yeah guys keep the
questions clean because I will just
delete them and not read them and he
asked it again so anyway Luca you've
just lost getting any questions answered
anyway um from such a ba hall hey sean
how sling TV now as compared to about
six months ago you know here's the funny
thing I I think sling TV suits some
people what I've discovered since
cutting the cord is that I have zero
interest in watching what i refer to as
linear television which means this show
airs at this time then this show airs at
this time if I'm going to turn on my
television I would much rather just jump
into hulu and pull up something I know I
want to watch than surfing a bunch of
channels going as there
hang on yeah that being said I think
sling is a great product I think it
serves a very certain demographic but I
don't think it's the perfect solution
for everyone I'm trying very hard not to
slam sling TV because I do like the
product I just don't think it's for me
personally hmm i met you sling TV
believe it or not um I mean I saw the
demo at CES and stuff right it's
interesting and for me why the big
things is months and months ago they
they sent me an email about as a press
person they sent me an email saying you
know they were adding BBC america and
the AMC Networks still not there and i
miss i des one thing i do miss having
kept the cord is BBC america i was a big
BBC america watcher but uh yeah I I
don't know what's going on there I for
instance we had some new cabinets put in
our house and the guy the Handy band
that did it for us he's a family friend
he came back a couple days after we had
him put the cabinets and he goes I need
to talk to you about your television I
was like okay and he goes when we put it
up on the shelves you only plugged in
one cable you didn't plug in a satellite
dish or a cable box no I didn't and so
he was all fascinated by the idea he had
no idea what cord cutting was really
yeah he had not heard of it at all and
he goes well my wife yay i start
explaining netflix and hulu he didn't
know exactly what netflix did didn't he
he's a smart guy he's a great handyman
he does beautiful work for us just not
his area of knowledge right ahead as I
was fain netflix and hulu and all that
to him he goes home my wife was k she
still wants to watch ill you know she'll
wanna watch her shows she just like spin
sometimes like sling TV and when i
showed him sling TV that really pushed
him because he goes he is so tired of
paying for these cable packages where he
pays for channels that he has no inter
step right you love the idea that
they're clumped into interest areas so
there's like a DIY subscription there is
it he goes well what about when my kids
come to visit they want to watch sports
I was like by the five dollar sports
package for one month right he goes I
can buy it for just one month I was like
yeah he goes why am I not already doing
this you know so what I don't think for
people like that yeah exactly so he's
look he's researching it now and I may
be going over and setting him up with
the roku and everything else here in the
next month or so nice hey uh but that's
the I think that's one thing is that we
also have to understand is that a lot of
people don't know this concept yet right
I feel like it's been so I guess it's
been that the past couple years we were
talking about it you know this is what's
gonna happen I can't wait for this to
happen then it started to happen now
it's really happened it's happening and
for the rest of you know the non geeks
out there who haven't cared it's still
very very very new even the idea of it
yeah yeah I he was he was boggled by the
idea that I was not pay a goes so what
do you pay Roku every month I was like
nothing it was like okay that's all lose
mine yeah yeah no that was a shiet
forgot about that conversation until we
started this discussion yeah that's a
perfect example of I think that there
still needs to be a lot of education and
this is something you will never see a
network television channel discuss this
oh now yeah there's no way I mean you
would have to rely on newspapers or
magazines or websites to run the sort of
stuff and that's still not going to get
to the masses right so I don't know it's
going to be interesting to see where
things go from Davis tap is the Roku
experience better than Android TV or is
it just
still better i think i think i like I
think it depends on what you want to do
personally I love the Roku experience I
am NOT a family Android TV experience I
have an nvidia shield set-top box I was
actually the one that wrote the review
on it and from the hardware perspective
i loved the shield from the software
perspective which was one-half percent
android TV is just not a fully realized
system yet i think that's the way to put
it it's just not there yeah I feel like
what Google did was they created a
foundation said developers you know make
your apps for it here you go and it's
still very like okay now like what can i
do what do I do now on my android TV now
nvidia stuff on at the gaming stuff
that's all awesome that's really cool
actually or you can stream games but if
we're just getting back to the core
android TV experience your kind of like
whereas Roku everything's there again
well for me Roku is the best option
because it has all the services that's
why i like it like amazon prime is a
glaring one that's missing from android
TV and apple TV whereas Roku is sort of
you don't have that sacrifice I I cannot
understand why amazon instant video is
missing from those I know it makes no
sense yeah it's actually given like if
Netflix is there than it should be just
there right but I know he's Apple you
know they're fighting obviously we're
Amazon's not selling their stuff and you
know blah blah blah aren't they like
what they would they roku's gone from
amazon now is a chromecast chromecast
and Apple TV Apple TVs yeah amazon did
leave the roku whip i think no cuz they
have a dave a good partnership that's
right yeah i think that's very telling
that amazon kicked the chromecast and
the apple TV to the curb yeah you know
now my understanding
is at least with Google TV they should
just be able or your Android TV they
should just be able to publish the app
is I with chromecast being kicked out
i'm starting to wonder if there isn't
something going on in the background
that were not aware of yeah well they're
very in terms of the Amazon TV versus
the Android TV and the apple TV it seems
like a very competitive landscape yeah
well as long as the Roku still there but
you know I do think the work of
experience is better for sure from such
a Mahal off topic i know this was a
while ago but what did you think of the
pebble time round i have not played
never annoyed you know I didn't um I
think I honestly the pebble time kind of
just turned me off so I was like maybe
next year when they have a new product
so I didn't really follow time round or
the steel or anything like that I heard
it's nice looking though it just has big
mean I saw it obviously online we
covered their ports but they add an
event in New York and I heard from other
journalists said it's nice looking but
has very thick bezels in person take
that who taught you well now oh let's
see moving along here to do from Bobby
Delaney have any of you guys bought a
google chrome audio and was it useful or
just a min no I have bought it it just
from the description of it alone i was
just kind of like yeah yeah me too it
seems like it would be useful i have a
speaker you can probably see it right
there for those watching the show that's
uh that's pretty nice and it it's not
bluetooth I forget what it is but it's
like it's one of those sharing standards
that never really took off and so I
can't really use it unless i plug it in
with a 3.5 millimeter headphone jack and
so with a court so that's why i think
the chrome audio is nice if i want to
use that speaker again it's more just
sitting there for decoration
but there's a psycho sitting next to it
yeah that's the echo next to it which I
use pretty frequently so that's there be
a good product for for this the chrome
audio but I also often think like why
not just get a bluetooth adapter and do
that but you know considering the cost
they're both cheap and I don't know I
haven't used one we have it in the
irvine office though and i know that
those guys are using him so yeah I just
I don't know I just didn't seem that
interesting to me but yeah I still have
like my computer speakers that are
plugged in right next to me no from
David Nunez what laptop do both of you
recommend for students surface Booker
surface pro 4 surface books just so
expensive surface pro 4 I would go with
but I wouldn't get the entry-level
quorum model i'd probably go with at
least a core i5 which is what we sent
our review that's the model reviewed the
new keyboard is all i can i haven't used
the surface pro 4 that much we did like
it i know it's a great product i have
the surface pro 3 with the new keyboard
and that's awesome so i think that's a
good good laptop to consider if your
student the only thing that's
frustrating and I've mentioned this on
the show is when I've been at press
events and I don't have somewhere to sit
down or enough space for that kickstand
the lap ability is awful so just about
Todd mm-hmm they have demoed to us
during the launch of the surface pro 3
that lap ability was awesome yeah as he
SAT there awkwardly you don't have laps
or something I mean it's just it's not
it doesn't make any sense in a lab so
that's the one huge drawback ya know I
but the size is really great it's just
so small yeah I love it when people
trying to convince your products got lap
ability yeah but don't bring it up you
know is awesome it's something it's not
um from jackal Cooper I'm from China
maybe a maybe I am not so familiar with
Americans
this is what it is Rho cool you guys
mentioned it's actually spelled are ok
you and it's a small device about yay
big or so that I'm sorry for those of
you listening to audio that it allows
you to download apps to it like for
Netflix or Hulu or for various streaming
television services and get them to your
television let's see here to do uh this
is one I kinda want to address from Jeff
k what do you think about the bending
issue or non-issue for the nexus
suitably I have a very strong opinion
about this stop denying your phones
exactly that's my you know folks if you
take anything yo within reason you know
you can't you know do it to a diamond or
go a pickup truck or something with your
bare hands but if you take anything and
put it in your hands and put your thumbs
there and go ah guess what's gonna
happen LLL the same goes for the bin
gate around iphone and now the bending
issue issue air quotes for the nexus 6
yep folks these people are setting out
to bend them yeah you don't try to bend
your phone and you should be all right
exactly or put them in a case yeah the
the way a I've a lot of people have told
me i should have to put it in case in my
opinion you're you've got an investment
in your pocket you know you have a value
in it when you want to go to trade it in
though better condition it's in the
better it's going to do comic book
collectors we put our books and bags we
shouldn't have to but we do to protect
them you know it's the same with phones
this all this bending stuff these are
people that are trying
to make a name for themselves or they
just want to get views on their videos
I'm sorry it's not an issue it's not
going to happen in everyday use yeah I
agree it's like the tests I think the
first test we're in let's use the word
test nurse Lee I think there's at least
some something to be said about okay you
know does this screen scratch really
easily blah blah blah I mean get you
start to learn that stuff but only when
it comes to say like when you want to
see the difference between corning
gorilla glass 3 in class for because
those are what these manufacturers are
using so you know watch that once and
get used to it and then you know what
you're getting or if it's coming
something like the droid turbo four or
two sorry just jump two years in the
future droid turbo to what are its
aspect where they're saying like oh this
screen is like super resistant like
throw it on the floor then throw it off
for because that's what the manufacturer
is telling you to do f yeah and then
that phone actually as it turns out
scratches pretty easily because they had
to go with plastic to keep it so shatter
resistant so it's like okay that's your
trade off show me that but now if a
phone company comes out and says we have
Gorilla Glass 4 that's it's the same
scratch resistant so don't so stop
scratching it you know like on these
videos and then why don't you hold a
flame up to your smartphone like don't
ever put these things they have
explosive batteries if it whatever put
them here you don't get a blow torch out
every time a new phone and just you
scratch your name in the back yeah and
like I've never explict I've a candle on
my debt like what am I gonna do just go
hold this over and accidentally and be
like oh man it didn't hold up i'm so
pumped i need a fire resistant felt like
don't do that and then don't bend them
why would you like if you bend a phone
it's gonna been if you try to do that
like these are just stupid things that's
like somebody going in a plane and
saying this failed the plane drop tests
so don't buy it like when are you ever
gonna drop your phone out of a plane my
favorite is the guys that shoot him with
like 50 caliber sniper rifles yeah did
anyone ever
forever say you know this phone will
stand up to a 50 caliber bullet know
they have a coordinated just doesn't
make sense to me there are a couple
instances like the scratch resistance
which already got into you know if it's
marked as water resistant then show us
that test fine but don't and these same
video people will take phones aren't
water resistant throw them in the water
like just to say like oh who's at the
bottom of the pool and then some poor
guy out there is gonna be like oh it
actually is kind of water resistant I
won't worry about it then he throws in
the water and then you know what next
he's paying nine hundred dollars for a
replacement he just doesn't do any
service to anybody none of these videos
well David Nunez disagrees with us which
we are very open to people disagreeing
with us sure I disagree putting a case
on a phone that a company who spends
millions on design should be a crime for
example putting in case on galaxy s6
edge just turns it into a galaxy s6 but
that's not what we're saying what we're
saying is you know okay my iphone 6 plus
I put it in any case because i want the
highest trade-in value i can get when i
go to buy my next phone it has nothing
to do with how Apple designed it or
anything I am protecting it from you
know I earn it normal everyday wear
scratches dings all that stuff so yeah I
put my phone in a tank but this will
probably get me you know I I spend
twenty dollars on the case it'll save me
fifty sixty dollars on the trade-in
value yeah that's why I case stuff I
think David's saying to that like there
are the beautiful design aesthetics that
these manufacturers and designers come
up with like it's a shame you know if
you had a Ferrari why would you put a
Ferrari in a tank like it's a shame to
hide that the nice looks of a phone
which I think makes sense and I have
mine in the leather iphone case but I
would say my word out I can get I do
this now for similar reasons is you but
when I have the iphone 6 plus it just
got like I wanted to do that what David
what you're saying is like carrying it
the way it's supposed to be carried
but it was just getting scratched and
scoffed and stuff like that where I was
like now just looks ugly and I gotta put
in a case anyway and so now I keep it
protected because I don't want it to be
in that situation and the nice thing
about its protection is like okay the
case gets scratched you have to replace
it you can't do that with the body
anyway yeah it's you know there are a
lot i know a lot of people who like to
not be used cases and i see that to know
and we do David it's just that you know
if you have a concern about your phone
bending because there's so many reports
of this out in the wild yeah notice the
sarcasm there then put it in a case or
by a different phone but in general I
think I'll all this bending stuff is so
overblown ah yes I all remember to put
my phone on silent I forgot anyway
section Baja off topic hey Shawn yours
are you subscribed to Marvel unlimited
which comics are you reading now have
you checked out invincible Iron Man or
they now ended or soon to be rebooted
Miles Morales ultimate spider-man for
those that don't know Marvel unlimited
is a subscription service where you pay
nine ninety-nine a month and there's
over 17,000 marble books you can read ad
you can read as many of them as you want
I am subscribed to Marvel unlimited I'm
currently going through back when Civil
War launched I just read the mainline
Civil War I didn't get in all the side
stuff so I'm diving into a lot of the
side stuff especially the spider-man
side story was really interesting I'm
still not sure why DC has not done
something like this but that's DC but no
I've not had a chance to check out
invincible Iron Man or Miles Morales
ultimate spider-man yet let's see we got
time for one more question they just
sure hear from David Nunez and 2015
would you to personally by a smart TV or
non smart TV personally every smart TV
software is pretty garbage except for
LG's webos I would agree with you there
the
the the smart I used the term smart
loosely os's are for the most part
garbage I do like LG's webos that being
said I normally the second I i just
recently bought a refurbished vizio that
was on a killer deal and yeah it has
smart features about three minutes after
it was set up i had my Roku plugged in
and i was off to the races but yeah I
don't know what's with the TV
manufacturers and their os's they're
horrible I think they can sell the
software stuff could sell you know spots
on there that's why they come pre-loaded
with so many apps um if I was buying a
TV i would not have smart TV at the top
my list but it turns out you know a lot
of them have those features now sort of
included out of the box I don't use them
I can't remember the last time I saw a
TV that didn't have a smart OSN right
now yeah well i bought the the screen
i'm using in front of me actually it's a
TV i think it was like 200 bucks and
it's just the best buy insignia brand it
doesn't have any smart features but i do
like hey i like the fact that there are
now roku tvs with ya roku just built
straight in that's actually I have one
here in my office I have a TCL yeah TCL
and they white box some of the cable
providers services in uh I think
Australia and England uh sky this guy
yeah yes guy has asked i branded roku
pretty cool yeah i actually i finally
saw a picture of a sky roku and egg I
for those that don't know i'm heading
over to england in a couple weeks i I
always end up in a electronic store at
some point to just boggle it some of the
things that are popular over there that
aren't popular here so I'm going to see
if I can't find a sky Roku just to look
at it it's just a Roku with the sky logo
on it but anyway that is going to bring
this week's episode to a close as always
