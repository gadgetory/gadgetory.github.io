have a nexus phone in your pocket maybe
Nexus tablet in your bag but there's
been a gaping hole in your heart or
rather on your wrist when it comes to
android wear believe the folks at
android police google has you covered
with not one but two nexus watches
coming sometime in the fall codename
angelfish and swordfish let's start with
both of these two things have in common
they will be launching presumably with
Google's just announced at i/o Google
assistant and also they should be the
launch devices really some of the launch
devices for Android wear two point oh
they both feature really familiar around
design if you're a moto 360 order like
myself you'll notice no flat tire
fortunately the bigger daddy of the two
also presumably going to be the more
expensive is code named angelfish notice
more buttons because it's going to do
more things it's rocking LTE GPS and a
heart rate sensor the smaller of the two
will be a more android wear watch for
everyone doing things like notifications
and of course using Google's assistant
for just talking to your watch like
we're living in the future android
police went on to say that these are
certainly unconfirmed and they could be
cancelled or design changes all together
they do look pretty ready to go so what
do guys think are you ready for a nexus
watch I certainly know I am a love to
see what Google can do I would love to
get my hands on the larger of those two
i use my android wear watch all the time
even the comments down below what you
guys think would you buy what would you
not buy one what price would it have to
be to make you happy give the video a
thumbs up you always appreciate it so
next time for jon rettinger
