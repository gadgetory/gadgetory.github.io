from technobuffalo and today we're just
going to quickly recap what happens
today's apple event in under four
minutes first I'm probably the biggest
news of the day was apple's new Retina
imac if you watch last week's rumor
roundup we mentioned apple might release
a 5k iMac and the company did Apple
today unveiled at 27 inch imac would
retina 5k screen which our own jon
rettinger said looks absolutely gorgeous
in person as a resolution of 50 120 x
2880 which was made possible by a new
timing controller created by the company
which apple says has four times the
bandwidth of its previous generation
27-inch imac the timing control
essentially tells each pixel's what to
do and when to do it and all 23 layers
make up the 1.4 millimeter display
pushing a 14 point 7 million pixels to
your eyeballs but even with four times
more pixels it requires thirty percent
less power through more energy-efficient
LEDs the base model equipment an i5
processor AMD M 290x graphics and 8
gigabyte of RAM one terabyte fusion
drive and is only going for 2500 which
is surprisingly is a fairly decent price
for a display the 5k screen in a
computer built in number two the mac
mini receive a slight update today too
it's now equipped with Intel's Haswell
processor intel iris and HD graphics
5000 an option to upgrade to an even
faster pcie-based flash storage which
we've seen in the latest macbook pros
and come standard with 802 11 AC Wi-Fi
and two Thunderbolt 2 ports and starts
at just four hundred ninety nine dollars
apple also unveiled the ipad air 2 which
is eighteen percent thinner than the
first generation ipad air it comes
equipped with an all-new a8x chip apple
says this forty percent faster than the
a7 use in the first iPad air touch ID
has been added to which can be used to
make apple pay purchases with the apps
that support the service and there are
more LTE bands inside and 802 11 acs
well there's also a new 8 megapixel
iSight camera and an update at f/2
points you facetime camera up in the
front the new ipad air 2 starts at just
499 for the 16 gigabyte model 599 for
the 64 gigabyte model and 699 for the
128 gigabyte model
number four that I've had many three got
a minor update as well with the biggest
addition being touch ID internals are
the same as last year's model including
the same a7 chip though Apple did add
the gold color option matching the rest
of its mobile lineup in addition to the
new color option app will also drop the
32 gigabyte model giving customers the
choice of either 16 64 or 128 gigabytes
finally Apple said its new digital
wallet solution Apple pay will launch on
monday october twenty alongside iOS 8.1
