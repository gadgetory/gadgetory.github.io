technobuffalo here and i want to give
you final predictions for tomorrow's
back to mac apple event and let you know
how coverage is going to shake up stay
tuned for all the details all right so
first let's talk about coverage the
event is going to begin at ten a.m.
pacific time and as with all the apple
events we will be live blogging it via
twitter so flows you that are in class
or in work and can't get online you just
have your phone or mobile device with
you you'll be able to get all of the
updates the only difference is we're
going to do live blogging on the
official TechnoBuffalo twitter account
which is at technobuffalo te CH nov uff
al oh so be sure to give the account of
follow for minute by minute updates of
the event will be kind of tweeting out
everything that's happening as it's
happening and of course we'll be
recapping everything that gets announced
and speaking of what's going to get
announced let me give you my predictions
for what i think we are going to see
number one I think that's getting dremel
number one that is my announcer voice I
think we're going to see a preview of OS
10.7 that's a lot of pointing a code
names lion are probably officially named
lion all the Apple OS 10 software
operating systems that a word software
operating systems have been named after
a CAD leopard tiger snow leopard and
lion finally a Snow Leopard was
previewed about a year before it's
actual reliefs doesn't expect to get
this on your desktops anytime soon what
I do expect you the big announcement is
a revamped redesigned dashboard
integrated with iOS so you hit the
dashboard and you get sort of a new iOS
looking environment which also opens up
new avenues for revenue with Apple via
the ability to sell apps via what I
assume will be a new app store on the
desktop computer that may also tie into
a touchscreen interface on Apple's new
computers moving forward we've seen
file patents for touchscreen imax in the
past certainly one out of every 100 or
200 patents actually comes to fruition
but it would make sense what Apple did
for me to finding the touchscreen phone
market they very well may do for the
desktop market so it's something to sort
of look forward to this companies like
HP and like Lenovo is sort of dabbled in
the touchscreen desktop or laptop
marketplace but with relatively little
success so we could see sort of
something very new and cool about that
what do you guys think are you excited
about it and I think also the big
announce that we're going to see and
they say I'm not pointing I'm using my
hands to make something around is going
to be a new redesigned macbook air and
the macbook air was first announced it
was an engineering marvel sin it was
light but it was to overprice to be a
netbook 200 powered food everyday
computer it sort of was in that middle
ground floating in space for consumers
what we think we're going to see our two
separate models and 11.3 and a 13 point
6 inch probably display panels from
price if you figure he's been starting
at nine ninety nine supposedly they are
going to use something called an SSD
stick sure it looks like a stick of ram
for your hard drive we're supposedly
you're going to see fully upgradeable
RAM and we're going to see upgradable
hard drive via this SSD stick very soon
also talks about is thin as a standard
USB port so quite thin assumingly it'll
retain its similar wedge shape that
we've seen on Kurt macbook airs and
probably bring it in line with how the
rest of the macbook pro line looks
meaning the black bezel and a full
multi-touch glass trackpad without the
button this would probably be a very big
sweet spot for Apple so it would be a
few hundred dollars premium over
standard netbook at the lowest end
configuration we're also getting the
full power or it'll probably be a cord
to do a chip for a relatively low price
and access to Apple's operating system
and they're out of life sweet and
speaking of ilife suite now decide
really sweet transition we may also see
iLife 2011 with the axing of I DVD in
some new mystery application that really
nobody knows about me
the dashboard so look for that coming
soon and again just to refresh
