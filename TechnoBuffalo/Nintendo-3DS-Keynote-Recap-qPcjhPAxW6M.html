technobuffalo here and i want to give
you a recap of Nintendo's keynote from
the 2010 III conference suppose you the
don't know is the biggest video game
conference of the year and seems for
electronic entertainment expo so
Nintendo went through and talked about a
lot of stuff the focus of their event
was on the new Nintendo 3ds the sequel
and follow up the spiritual successor if
you will to the nintendo DS the dsi and
then the dsi XL this is 3d handheld
gaming without glasses which is really
kind of cool reports they actually
worked very well and is extremely
impressive so let me reiterate and go
through sort of aspects of it so glasses
free as I mentioned it's got to screen
similar to the current IDs the top
screen is 3.5 inches so essentially if
you like having an iphone size display
right on the top see me live dance I got
some notes in front of me the keynote
just ended a little while ago it's got a
slide it led us to address the 3d or
turned off completely if you move your
head a little bit to left a little bit
to the right as opposed to the 3d effect
is lost if you have to constantly tweak
it if you're going to hold the device
sort of all your moving around a car
other 3d effects may not work so well
for you it's going to be best if it's
sitting on a table I'll wear your head
and device won't be moving something too
much keep in mind so the top display is
only one that's 3d the bottom ones
similar to the current vs setup is going
to be a touch screen the gun analog
stick on the side which in 10 those
calling a slide pad a similar to what
we've seen on say the PSP Go or the
PlayStation Portable that same sort of
motion it does have a gyro motion sensor
so they would a sense motion not just
tilt left or right but actually forward
it back which is probably going to be
huge for some of the gaming titles which
we'll talk about in just a minute it's
going to be fully compatible with DSI
games so the good news for everybody's
got a back catalogue of games intended a
generally pretty good but making sure
their consoles work with the previous
generation it's going to also have two
cameras for 3d photographs so they can
take three you picture yourself
manipulated and send it off your friends
which I'm sure is when you
used by teenagers all over the world so
let's talk about games because there are
a lot of games they talked about
Nintendo said this is going to be the
biggest launch support they've ever had
for a console which is pretty cool and
judging by the title as they touted it
looks like they were right so finally
saw a new kid icarus game which throws
you that may have played on the original
Nintendo was an awesome side scroller
but probably one of the hardest games
ever made the graphics on the 3ds look
extremely impressive I'll the graphics
on this kid icarus game looked better
than almost anything we've seen on the
week today definitely a big
accomplishment for a mobile handheld we
don't know what the specs are on device
the rumors haven't maybe being a Tegra 2
processor so the games they showed they
showed mad ninja gaiden resident evil a
batman game splinter cell and metal gear
which is you know huge array of titles
they didn't announce pricing or they
didn't announce a release date but they
were showing the devices on the floor so
you'll need you to believe that we're
gonna see it in time for holiday 2010 so
what you guys think it looks like 3d is
here to stay whether it's 3d television
in three movies and out 3d gaming
something that you're interested in
certainly no glasses make it more
appealing the fact you have to sort of
keep it console still sort of loses some
of the appeal to me but I want to know
what you guys think are you excited
about the 3d is not excited you know
just generally curious leave your
comments down below I am jon rettinger
some techno Buffalo and I'll see you the
next video it's like I'm doing something
else I'll see you the next one look like</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
