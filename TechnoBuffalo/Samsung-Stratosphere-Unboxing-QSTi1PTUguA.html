Mike Pearlman from TechnoBuffalo doing
an unboxing of the Samsung stratosphere
for Verizon Wireless do you think this
phone will blast you into the
stratosphere that was a cheesy pun let's
find out after this fun little graphic
welcome to my unboxing of the Samsung
stratosphere for Verizon Wireless and
this is a true unboxing because I even
left the bubble wrap on it's my favorite
part of the unboxing process is the
bubble wrap snap egde so let's let's
take this off here it's the first time
you guys have seen bubble wrapped in an
unboxing I just give you all the goods
don't I I'm like the Santa Claus of the
unboxing world here it is
it's the Verizon Wireless samsung
stratosphere this is a galaxy s phone
part of the bargaining Galaxy S family
lineup we just have some legal
information there the back is fairly
plain we have the package contents we
get the phone the lithium-ion battery
the pre-installed micro SD card we have
the wall USB charger the quick reference
guide and the product and safety
warranty brochure Shazam and a picture
of this phone for those of you don't
know this phone is a sliding QWERTY
keyboard phone in fact Verizon Wireless
and Samsung telecommunications America
recently introduced this phone as the
first 4G LTE smartphone from Verizon
Wireless equipped with a five row QWERTY
keyboard and design with Samsung's four
inch Super AMOLED screen so these are
kind of specs that we've seen in the
past before I read any more specs to you
let me just open this phone and I'm
really bummed out because there's really
no tape to speak of here
usually instead of John's obligatory
knife I take out the
torch and light it on fire no I'm just
kidding
I used my sonic the hedghog key and if
there was tape there I would be doing
the spin dash across that bad boy so
here it is the Samsung stratosphere for
Verizon Wireless and I have to tell you
it's a pretty familiar design something
that I have seen very similar to the
Samsung transform for Sprint I remember
it kind of has an epic 4G feel remember
the original Epic 4G yes
another sprint phone so let's sit the
phone to the right of the box see what
else is in this box we have our okay SIM
card was just pre-installed in the phone
all righty
we have a cable USB charging cable that
connects to up hold on I'm getting a
phone call
hey Shawn what's up I'm doing an
unboxing alright will not repeat that
Wow Shawn likes to talk it's cool it's
like talking to Seth Rogen okay and
lastly we have the product safety and
warranty information here for the
Samsung stratosphere typical fanfare oh
and what what I was in the middle of
doing was unwrapping the new Samsung
charger which looks so strikingly
similar to another charger that's white
and boxy and that's all I'm gonna say
from there let's look at the design of
this phone we've the power lock switch
on the side here on the top we have a
3.5 millimeter audio jack on the right
we have a fairly small volume rocker
volume rocker we also have a USB port at
the bottom that's for charging let's
talk about cameras this thing has a 1.3
megapixel front-facing camera and on the
back I believe we have a five megapixel
rear-facing camera with LED flash there
so these specs are pretty similar to
many of the phones and many of the
Android phones that we've seen last year
we've seen at the beginning of this year
so that is something to consider as far
as this Android 2.3 Gingerbread and let
me fire the phone on finally try to get
this back on here and it's actually not
that hard to put on and off the got to
be honest the back panel is a little bit
flimsy so it looks like we have some
juice in a beautiful super-mo LED screen
and let's talk about the screams
resolution let me see here oh wait very
cool I like that and of course we get
the Verizon logo 4G LTE now I will tell
you I'm not gonna be able to connect to
the 4G LTE in this video I live in a
fairly remote part of New England
so the moose antlers have not extended
this far yet okay so we have Android 2.3
Gingerbread as I said we've got the
camera the camera also has 720p HD video
and this phone has mobile hotspot
capability as well up to 8 devices up to
8 Wi-Fi devices
okay so bluetooth 3.0 also and of course
Samsung's media hub and typical fanfare
there as well but it's this slide-out
QWERTY keyboard that is fairly
interesting and you can see it lights up
and it's not a bad spread you know I'm
gonna have to really play around with it
and see how it does but here's the phone
we have a pretty good amount of battery
life here and 2.3 Gingerbread you know
it's gonna be hard honestly hard to
swallow with Ice Cream Sandwich tasty
delicious ice cream sandwich out of the
freezer as I like to say it's going to
be tough to you know go back to the
gingerbread man but I got to tell you I
guess if you're looking for a 4G verizon
phone that's not the thunderbolt and has
a full slide-out QWERTY keyboard the
stratosphere is your answer so that's
all the teasing you're gonna get with
the Samsung stratosphere this has been
my unboxing for TechnoBuffalo check out
more on this phone and every other
additional electronic you can think of
we're even considering pet tech yes pet
tech but for next time I'm Mike Pearlman
for TechnoBuffalo and I'll talk to you
guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
