TechnoBuffalo comm last week I took a
trip down to the DreamWorks Studios in
LA where I got to tour the studios meet
Jeffrey Katzenberg CEO of DreamWorks and
find out a little bit about how movies
like the upcoming Kung Fu Panda 2 are
made to look so good we also got a demo
of the new Samsung Smart TV line so
let's check it out
do is bring meThe map angel' area he's
our senior manager of convergence and
he's the one that knows all the ins and
outs and plays with this stuff and not
only our stuff but the competitors as
well and he's gonna walk you through the
new smart hub interface thank you
hi everybody I'm on that inch Larry I
work at headquarters in Richard of Park
New Jersey my job at Samsung is to help
you guys understand and help the public
understand and our executives really
what goes on in inside of the smart club
interface and inside of connected new
products Samsung products and
competitors so we kind of my job is kind
of fun you know I get to play with other
guys our stuff too and it's really
interesting so if you have any questions
please ask and get started so 2010 in
our main interface was since the maps
now the main interface is smartlav
interface smart and interface offers a
lot more to the consumer you know and in
a single screen so but still the core
section of Smart Hub is Sam some apps so
it didn't Sam Samantha patience we're
going to go into that right now
so within samsung apps we can you know
consumers can can download free and paid
applications like you know we've got
some big names in here
then this 99 or whatever we've got a
YouTube down here so let's let's go over
here I know somebody asked about YouTube
earlier so we're gonna select YouTube
will download this it's a three point
two three minutes pretty small but we
are going to pass connection here three
more and install the app so now I have a
choice if I was consumer like well what
do i do from here you can run it and
record from here without going back out
to this markup interface we're gonna go
back out to the interface just to see
where it went so a gentleman asks before
earlier you know what how can I change
this like how is it consumer actually
going to use this right because they
really want to tailor this interface to
to what they want they want to see the
the apps that they're that they want to
use right so we just downloaded a
YouTube and it happens to download
because we have a lot of other stuff in
here right now it's over here on the
second screen so what we're going to do
later when I get down to this area is
we're gonna organize this and make it
really easy for the consumer to choose
what they want to what they want to see
down intersection so so that's new too
now we have YouTube down here there's
the next section that consumers probably
uses your video and search so we're
going to go into the your video service
so what your video is it's it it's a
service that Samsung offers that
aggregates all of our VOD and video
services in one place so you can search
for a video like Megamind
yeah
I think this but this might have just
come on and this also the set screen set
so here's 300 right now this it has
three point seven stars this is within
your video so people can like it or
share it we happen to have a hundred
people liking this movie so I'm gonna
say I like this movie it's pretty good
in the share section now I have in
social TV to talk about the second I
have my Twitter and my facebook set up
in social TV so I'm gonna say this movie
is so awesome and I'm watching it in in
your video that I want everybody to know
right everybody's gotta go so I'm gonna
hit it share it and it'll save to
physica it'll save to Facebook and post
it to my Twitter account and we don't
have to confirm it right now we'll look
at that in a second so I shared it there
now if I want to I can watch this movie
if I really wanted to so we'll go to so
it's gonna be available soon on
blockbuster right now we have it
available on Vudu and in the future
we'll have more VOD Services others that
we offer currently that will populate
here we're gonna launch a new right now
is everybody seeing blue do before
understands what it is the great thing
about voodoo is that and the reason your
show is it it offers really amazing
quality to the consumer via streaming so
you can get 1080p quality with 5.1 sound
over the Internet in HDX what we're
gonna do is we're going to come down
here hopefully it won't be too gory
movie we're gonna do a two-minute stream
in HDX look up caring upper right hand
corner right now I have one bar will
probably bump up the two maybe but this
is actually streaming over the internet
right now and this looks okay I think
the beginning of those Sandies
good question yeah but instead of
hundred people like this is that in
total across the entire network or is
that just your Facebook no actually that
light now okay that like is separate
from Facebook and Twitter that like is
within your video so that's a hundred
people like it within your opinion
that's correct
yeah everybody who has access to this
has access to sorry this looks really
good it's let's I mean everybody
okay so now we're back here in a smart
hub and so let's talk about the
recommended section real quick so like
Eric was saying the recommended section
is populated by us these are
applications that analytically are very
popular or used you know constantly so
so we also put some new applications in
here like it's for 3ds one of our new
ones Explorer 30 is going to offer
full-length three feature film streaming
over the Internet to consumers okay the
DreamWorks titles will eventually be in
there all right Hulu Plus we have here
Netflix I mean these are the old
standards everybody's got this important
stuff all right we have ESPN
SportsCenter which runs as an overlay an
overlay application of full screen
application two different titles okay
overlay application runs sort of like
this where you have whatever you're
watching your source in the background
and you have the other application
overlaid on top of it another great
overlay application is social TV this is
an internal Samsung app so what social
TV allows you to do is whatever is
playing in the background we have how to
train your dragon appoint now let's give
you a live TV it could be whatever
alright so right now oh here on my
Twitter account you can see your video
director blah blah blah gives me the
information I just tweeted that two
minutes ago so from social TV in your
video it has this connection okay to my
Twitter account the cloud but also to
here in social television I could
actually make a tweet if I wanted to
right now I can say what's happening in
we get up there to my accounts so it's
fast and it's this is good for those
people like they really want to be
connected to the friends all the time
they want everybody know what they're
doing all the time so if they're
watching TV and eating cheese puffs
they'd be like I just ate the cheese
puffs so and in here we have a facebook
same thing as opposed to my facebook
status this is again through your video
and then another thing that's
interesting here is we have Google Talk
chat so a couple of people are available
here through Google Talk chat and then I
could talk to them and check using
pretty keyboard or with sensitive tab or
a galaxy phone or Android device we're
actually iOS devices as well with her
right now this is what we offer in the
future we might offer some more stuff so
now that we I mean we hit all the main
stuff up here right now let's talk about
what the consumer can do in this area so
there's a lot of things down here like
we have we have scheduled maintenance
miners sources channels favorites you
know these things these are standard on
every television you're gonna see these
on every set that can supervise I've
never I don't watch a lot of pictures I
don't look at pictures on might not look
at music on my on my TV set so they can
really easily create a folder so we're
gonna go to edit mode there which I use
it with the yellow button and then we're
going to create a folder called folder 1
and now we have our little folder that
we made here and I'm going to select
some stuff let's let's take videos
music with Russell the about channel
favorites all this stuff right I'm gonna
say move to folder let's go offer me the
folders that I made so they were gonna
go all in the folder one and now if I go
back out to the Smart Hub all that stuff
that I had out here that might have been
I didn't really like where it was maybe
it was cluttering it you know I now have
you here in a single folder and I can
move this wherever I want I don't have
to have the folder here at YouTube here
I put YouTube there move it around
wherever you want to put it so it's very
highly customisable yes right that's
correct
you can edit the name and application
the application is what it is and then
you can even change the folder name if
you want if you want to put all your VOD
since it's single one you could make it
multiple folders for VoD one for music
one for whatever that's correct
this is the area that consumer has
control over which is you know half the
screen up here this is it this is to be
new recommended since maps in your video
so this this area they sort of have
control over depending on what they
watch write to your video then
eventually the recommendations will
change what videos are shown in the
urban air space alright so let's move on
in a web browser so web browser is
available on select LED TVs and plasmas
what the web browser is is just folks
it's a full web browser full full flower
support html5 support using WebKit
browser and right now this is our
Samsung main page and there's different
ways to move around so standard you can
move around just using tabbing like
you're pressing tab on a on
work or I could switch it to pointer
mode and then you get your little cursor
up here and you can actually move the
cursor around just by sort of rubbing
your controller the way it works is
underneath the enter button on the I
have really horrible fingers I'm sorry I
goes underneath the enter button here on
the Direction pad there's a little IR
sensor inside there and that IR sensor
can sense the movement of your hand over
top of it so I'm going to move the
little pointer around so exit out of
that we'll come back to Smart Hub
