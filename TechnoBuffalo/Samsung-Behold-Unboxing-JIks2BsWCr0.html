unboxing for you of the samsung behold
for t-mobile this is a full touchscreen
phone similar to the samsung eternity
but this one's available for t-mobile's
network while the Eternity is 480 this
retails for 149 bucks on a new two-year
contract let's go ahead and dig in this
is sent to me fresh from the PR folk at
t-mobile open up the fedex path here
that should be enough let's rip the rest
there we go a little bit of a PR
material on the phone itself that's say
a little bit about the samsung behold
and some of the key features large
touchscreen display then profile
available and brushed expresso or like
Finn rose full HTML browser touch woods
interface 5 megapixel camera and video
recorder with a 4 x digital zoom and
autofocus pretty impressive built-in gps
with gps navigator accelerometer full
qwerty support for mms i am an email
stereo bluetooth my fav speaker included
gig of one gigabyte microSD card
quad-band gsm and UMTS hsdpa so it is a
3g phone which is very cool using
t-mobile's 3g network let's go ahead and
see what color they sent looks like the
black one I think this box has been beat
up a little bit probably the 5th or 6th
persons reviewed this phone so here it
is samsung behold picture the device on
the front I don't have my eternity
anymore to show you guys with but it
does look very similar a little bit
about it experience the freedom of the
web truly get your fingertips ok picture
a device on the side on the back some
more specs calling my tone Wi-Fi ringers
knife
games phone book 3g all the stuff that i
just read to you nothing else really on
the box let's see what we got inside
pulls off to the side documentation
getting started guide services all the
stuff that really nobody probably reads
terms and conditions a book you can see
everybody is really interested in still
sealed in the plastic and the samsung
model number is the SGH t959 let's see
what else we've got some headphones with
a samsung proprietary headset port say
when they use for charging that's a
little annoying but not a big deal
here's the charger with the
aforementioned Samsung proprietary
reports I have flattened USB and a USB
to that port connector going to take a
look at the phone itself it's actually
very thin very small it's got a nice it
is a resistive touch but you kind of
senior push it from the side that it
indents a little bit but doesn't have
the typical resistive squish to it so it
does feel nice let's see what we got on
the front of device looks like we got
there's your speaker send an end key and
a back button on the side we got volume
up and down and a micro USB port let me
zoom in here so you guys can see what
I'm talking about there we go a little
micro USB port right there there's
nothing on top of the device on the
other side you've got a hold you've got
a hold button and probably a
programmable soft key I'm guessing that
goes to a camera on the back there you
have your 5 megapixel camera which is
actually a very impor
massive to have with the portrait mirror
and a flash property of t mobile
demonstration unit not for lease or sale
good to know alright so let's do a size
comparison this is going to draw a lot
of comparisons with the iphone so as i
usually compare and go ahead and show
you guys so there is the iphone with the
samsung behold behold is much smaller
could stack them on top certainly see
that there's a size difference there we
do the profile shot certainly it's
thinner device as well let's see if it's
got a charge and let's power it up for
the first time it's me hold down the end
button should turn it on there it goes
samsung behold and like i do with most
of my phone reviews i'll use this for a
couple weeks and i'll let you guys know
what I think so there's t-mobile tom's
guide interesting and that appears to be
auto update of dating time and it's got
that really nice TouchWiz interface with
the widgets you can actually drag these
widgets out onto the homes from and kind
of use it for whatever you like I'll go
through the widgets each one during my
review but it looks like there are quite
a few of them here and it's got the four
buttons across the bottom so you've got
phone phone book and menu and the menu
looks very similar to the eternity that
I reviewed before so I'll go back home
alright guys it's like I get full 3g
receptor here so it'll be nice for
testing the web browser hope you enjoy
this is an unboxing of the samsung
behold for t-mobile stay tuned for the
full review I'll see you guys in the
