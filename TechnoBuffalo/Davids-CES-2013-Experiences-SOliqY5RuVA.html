13 and i'm here at CES 2013 with
technobuffalo I'm the contest winner I
got to come here with them and make
videos for them and hang out with them
so it's pretty much any tech reviewers
dream to come to CES and I finally got
to do it after winning their contest and
I've been here for the best three days
this is pretty much the last day of CES
for me I'm just gonna talk about my
experiences you know what I got to do
with the Buffalo all the videos I got to
edit all that kind of stuff hanging out
with the whole team and just what I got
to do here when I first found out that I
wanted to contest a pretty much had a
heart attack has I've been watching
TechnoBuffalo for years I've always
wanted to come to CES ever since I first
heard about it so finally getting to
meet all them getting to all the people
who are behind the scenes this is not
just John and Aaron who are on the
videos anymore it's everybody who is
behind the scenes things have all the
writers and everything like that I never
actually got to see them on video so
getting the meet them in person was a
completely new experience getting to see
you know what they were like how funny
they were actually were meeting these
guys in real life is complete whatever
what you guys see on camera they're
honest probably the funniest people have
ever met so other than going to the
actual CES show like where I am right
now I got to go to press conferences I
got to go see Samsung Sony and AT&amp;amp;T you
know all the stuff that they're going to
be releasing the next few years and all
the stuff that they're releasing now I
get to actually see that live so that
was amazing the only thing I ever got to
see from that was you know live blogs
from technical and other companies and
now I'm actually getting the seed in
person and make my own live blog and
post up on Twitter post up on YouTube is
just it's amazing it really is exactly
what I want to do and before I came to
CES I wasn't really sure I want to be
you know a tech review type person but
coming here getting to do this having
the experience they have the opportunity
to do this kind of stuff has just
changed my mind so much I definitely
want to do this when I get out of
college one of the best things about
this shows you really get to see all the
behind-the-scenes stuff and want you
guys see on youtube you know I didn't
think it was this big it's honestly like
six or seven buildings just filled with
exhibits and companies from all across
the country and the globe who gets to
come here and I get to see all of them
pretty much what it really is my dream
to come here and I still can't believe
that I want and I get to be here with
you know technobuffalo and their whole
crew and just getting to meet everybody
and actually getting to do this make
videos on their channel and you know
have backstage pretty much passes to see
all this stuff for my own channel so my
favorite part about the shows that I
actually
to see products before they even come
out right when the launch is pretty much
announced like the Nvidia shield the
project shield I get to see that it's
actually you know right in front of me I
get to look at it I get to make videos
on it that's amazing I would never be
able to get a chance to do that I was
sucking to CES we pick up up low so I
just want to say thank you one more time
for Tecna buffalo and 18t for sponsoring
this event and letting me come to CES
with you guys it has been amazing this
is honestly been the best few days of my
life I've always wanted to do this I've
always wanted meet you guys and now that
I actually got to do it nothing could
beat this really I want to come back if
you guys ever have the chance to come to
see yes please come here you guys will
definitely love it if you're in a tech
grant anything like that you'll
definitely love coming here this place
is like a tech person's dream come true
pretty much so I want to thank you guys
the viewers specifically for watching my
videos giving me support giving me some
advice you know I'm gonna take all this
stuff you guys said and bring it to my
channel hopefully it'll make me you know
grow as a person and grow as you know a
tech reviewer hopefully I'll be able to
