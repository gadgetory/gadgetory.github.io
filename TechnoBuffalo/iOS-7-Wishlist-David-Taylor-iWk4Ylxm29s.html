technobuffalo and with WWDC just a few
days away in this video I'm going to be
talking about the top five things that I
want from iOS 7 iron start up at number
one has to be a brand new UI overhaul I
want I OS 7 to look different I'm just
sick of the old stock iOS it's been
around since 2007 I want to see a brand
new just cool looking iOS I haven't seen
anything like that besides jailbreaking
like I have a I have a theme on my
iPhone but that's from jailbreaking I
want to see what Apple can do with their
own stock version of iOS Jony ive is
definitely the person to be doing this
kind of stuff he just has a great
creative mind you'll be able to make iOS
look the way that a lot of people have
been wanting it to look for the past
couple of years so hopefully I brand new
UI comes out with ios7 that's definitely
one thing that I'm really looking
forward to number two is going to be the
ability to reply to either emails text
messages or you know set calendar
appointments all that kind of stuff from
within other apps I don't want to be
going from my calendar to my text
messaging app then back to my email just
to send a few things I want to be able
to respond to a text message from within
temple run if I'm playing a game and I
get a text message I want to be able to
instantly respond to that right away
without having to switch over to the
text messaging app I want to stay in the
app that I was playing we're staying the
app that i was replying to before and
reply to the original text message that
I got right then it just makes things a
lot easier in jailbreaking it lets you
do it so iOS can definitely handle it
especially the iphones even the iphone 5
can handle it they don't be worried
about that it's just it makes everything
a lot simpler if you can reply to things
quickly and not having to leave the app
and then go back into it using the
multitasking thing it's just a pain I
want to be able to reply from stuff
right within the app that i'm using at
that time number three is going to be a
brand new app store and itunes store
applications now the way that they look
now it's just it looks weird in my
opinion if you go into the app so you
probably have all seen it it's about
three and a half apps per page as you
can see when I'm scrolling across and
then the little blocks on the bottom
it's like two and a quarter or two and
three fourths of an app it's just it's
just strange it does
look like something Apple would do
hopefully they're going to be revamping
that with iOS 7 and their whole new
theme maybe it'll come out with a
brand-new looking app store and itunes
store but i definitely want to see a
overhaul to the app and iTunes Store
applications just because just looking
at these like I really don't like the
way that they look especially when you
search for apps and you try to find one
that's specific for you and then you
have to scroll through a bunch of them
to even find the one that you're looking
for it just it doesn't work very well I
hope that they come out with a brand new
UI for both of those applications now
number four is going to be new lock
screen and home screen customization
ability it's like it goes back to my
original point of the customization with
the iOS 7 but i want to see especially
things on the lock screen in the home
screen I really don't like the fact that
I have to unlock my phone go into the
weather app just to see a forecast for
the next day I want to be able to see
that on my lock screen really quickly if
I just click the home the home button I
want to be able to see it show up and
instantly be able to interact with it
click on it and then it will open the
app but if I want to see something just
really quick I want to see that all my
lock screen now what I have installed is
in telescreen which is a jailbreak tweak
but it lets you have basically exactly
what I want to see with ios7 I want to
be able to see my stocks I want to be
able to see the weather for the next few
days or the next week or so I want to
see all my text messages i just want to
see everything that i can then interact
with right away on the lock screen and
especially on the home screen i want to
be able to see widgets especially with
the weather and stocks as well alright
the last thing I want to see changed is
an update to Siri in general I've been
used in Syria for a long time now and I
really haven't seen much change since it
was originally released they added a few
sports things here and there but not too
much that would make me use it even more
i use it mainly when i'm driving that
way i don't really have to look at the
phone or text it all while I'm driving
that's great for that but I really do
want to see just an upgrade to it I have
to do more tasks let it change the Wi-Fi
status let it change all this stuff like
that turn bluetooth on and off just a
little things like that would definitely
make me want to use it more so let me
