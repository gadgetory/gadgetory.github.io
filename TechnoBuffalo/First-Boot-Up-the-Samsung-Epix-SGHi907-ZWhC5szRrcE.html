lakers calm here and i'm going to show
you the first boot up of my review unit
SGH i907 also known as the samsung epix
first thing I got to do is remove the
SIM card from my iphone so i use apple's
sim removal tool which is really just a
paperclip push then ejects the sim tray
pull it out take out my sim put that
aside I'll move the camera down here so
you guys can see the samsung so here it
is will go to the back push the button
release the level sim card goes right in
there so we'll take the card pop it in
and take this monster of a battery
battery which is an 1800 milliamp hour
battery put it on put the back on slide
it in you peel off the plastic on the
screen here you can get to it there we
go a little bit tricky there we are and
let's turn this thing on with a power
button right on the side let's see what
they ask us to do red light just turned
on samsung hopefully you can see that
there again this is running on AT&amp;amp;T
network it's 3g hsdpa UMTS that logo
really just proved it it's got Wi-Fi gps
2 megapixel camera this was sent to me
just by a TD to review so i'm going to
do that i'll use it for a day or so and
give you guys my opinions after the
weekend windows mobile 6.1 is running
tap the screen to set up your mobile
device so I'm go ahead and need the
stylist here haven't used one of these
in a while then pull that out I'll tap
the screen alright tap the screen firmly
and accurately so we'll tap right in the
middle
more time all right next single tap an
item to select it and hole we can go
ahead and skip this not necessary
skipped us again and as I'm touching
this you guys can't see it but it's
vibrating I'm getting a little bit of
haptic feedback so complete alright so
that's pretty much it here i am now in
windows mobile 6.1 and you notice that
little arrow right there hold it up so
you guys can see it there's a little
error looks like cursor that actually
works by this little touch pad here i
haven't had a chance to play this yet
but i will use it and let you guys know
what I think so this is jon rettinger
with john for lakers com i hope you guys
enjoyed the first boot up video and I
promise it'll be a review coming soon
hope you guys enjoyed be sure to check
out the website and I will talk to you
guys soon link will be up in the sidebar
