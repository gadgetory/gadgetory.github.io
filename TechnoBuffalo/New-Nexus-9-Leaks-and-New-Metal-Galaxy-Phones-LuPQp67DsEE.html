to you by ting mobile that makes sense
what's up everyone look back the episode
of rumor roundup i'ma Grosjean register
sure we take all attack rumors from the
week and I served them up to you on a
silver platter I've got something
special for you this week I haven't been
able to say in many many many months not
a single Apple rumor on the show I know
why you guys are excited about that
we're going to talk about Samsung's
going Full Metal BlackBerry's getting
back in the game with the classic style
and a new Nexus might be coming or new
Nexus is NEX I not sure it's from rat up
going to get started let's begin with
Samsung so Samsung finally started using
metal and smartphone designed this year
results far as we can tell them pretty
awesome so first remember there was a
mid-range galaxy alpha with its kind of
cool looking sleek metal edges following
last week by the pretty baller high-end
Galaxy Note 4 and just the crazy
futuristic Galaxy Note edge now I think
the company could be working on another
device that covers the entire back panel
in metal as well which in my estimation
is Wade long over to do the news comes
from our friends at Sam mobile which
claims an upcoming samsung phone the
model number very sexy SMA 500 will
sport a full metal body that includes a
microSD slot for added storage but no
removable back cover we're guessing
though that means the battery's probably
not getting removable unless it's like
some weird back cover battery thing the
rumored handset could also come equipped
with a 5-inch 720p display a quad-core
Snapdragon 400 processor 8 megapixel
rear camera 5 megapixel front facing
camera 16 gigabytes of built-in storage
and a 20 or 330 million power battery
the SMA 500 league won't feature a
fingerprint sensor heart rate monitor
waterproof coating look it over some
sort of hybrid sim microSD card slot so
certainly not the high end but we're
getting more metal and hopefully that'll
filter its way up to the flagship
devices the s5 and maybe the galaxy note
5 love no plastic at all the rumored all
met or smelled smartphone sounds more
like galaxy alpha 2 than anything else
hopefully all this boils down to more
metal coming to phones I think
phones a bit more high-end feel like
you'd sort of cause disaster though for
cell signal maybe we'll see it coming up
soon I'm hopeful well it's going to be a
bit of a while before we start hearing
rumors about the galaxy s6 and the note
4 is not even here yet so get
comfortable waiting a while Samsung fans
let's talk a bit about blackberry listen
I know it you've brought up in the
comments I've been a bit harsh on
blackberry I think rightfully so but i
think the canadian company it's got a
few more drops of blood in those veins
blackberry has a few new smartphones in
the pipeline and while the company
hasn't really put its most focused on
hyping the upcoming passport handset
which in my mind looks frigging awesome
there's one more device for blackberry
fence look forward to a brand new batch
of photos leaked earlier in the week
offering a close up look at the
blackberry classic so despite early
rumors suggesting it might not launch
into early next year it looks like we
might getting even sooner the black
break classic expected hard it really
the blackberry faithful the longtime
customers who want a familiar experience
as you can see you see a rectangular
display that's somewhat bigger than 2.8
inch porsche design p9981 which is a
silly silly name it also offers you
simple design with round edges and that
ball or full qwerty keyboard that I
still have a soft spot in my heart for
one set of link back bye blackbird Doc's
called the classic powerful yet
uncomplicated that same league suggested
the blackberry classic might not launch
2015 although I'm open it's gonna be
sooner rather than later because device
looks super finished so blackberry if
you don't remember is gearing up for a
pretty big event later this month so
it's possible the classic could make it
appearance there although I'm just
expecting the passport to finally get
most of the spotlight in fact give us
release date I want that weird square
phone in my hands my thumb's need
something to type on if you haven't
given blackberry shot you might want to
consider it blackberry 10 points for
brings a lot of new features to the
table including built-in actus amazon's
app store and now await easier to
sideload really any android app at all
and of course access to BlackBerry's own
app catalog to get sort of a lot of apps
on the device it's pretty elegant to use
i think your peak system is awesome
blackberry emails still among the best
going on BBM is still a really awesome
third-party messenger kia's oh I guess
diffusing on a blackberry its first
party but you can now talk to anybody
else that has BBM so that's the third
party start of it stop the rumors for
quick
thank our friends at tang you probably
got a mobile phone in your pocket you're
also probably over paying for it let me
tell you about Tang with 10 your arm
forced to pick a plan based on what you
think you're going to use each month
you've actually pick what you actually
use each month which means there's way
less waste you simply pay for the
service that you're going to use you can
leave the service whenever you want with
no fees at all there aren't any hidden
admin fees or weird sketchy charges you
don't know what they mean like random
surcharges ting bills are simple to
understand and they only charge you for
your usage but six up bucks per device
plus taxes depending on where you are
the end of the day we're just overpaying
for our cell phones look at your next
cell phone bill I challenge you and see
if you understand every single line item
you are charged for it is impossible to
understand a try and call them get an
answer in your stuck on an endless loop
of transfers and automated lady telling
you to press 4 if you're ready to get
started use promo code TechnoBuffalo
ting calm and save 25 bucks and your
device purchase or get $25 and ting
service credit towards your monthly bill
give it a shot you won't regret it and
last but definitely not least let's talk
about some new necks I so Nvidia legal
documents might have accidentally out at
the Nexus 9 at rumors say is being made
by HTC the device will allegedly be
Google's next big tablet and offer array
of major upgrades / they already pretty
awesome and existing nexus 7 a document
plainly name drops the HTC nexus 9 and
the reason being that the device
supposedly features in videos
ridiculously awesome Tegra k1 chip
documents were unveiled because of the
legal quarrel with Qualcomm and Samsung
/ GPU technology patents so that's
really not here or there I wish about
information on the freaking Nexus 9
which will supposedly sport an 8.9 inch
display 2 gigs of ram 16 to 32 gigs of
storage a megapixel camera on the back
with optical image stabilization on all
devices doesn't matter what screen size
just saying and an aluminum zero gap
construction with tapered sides a
document says the device will be out in
third quarter of this year so we're not
that far away it's already
september-october to make the perfect
month for Google to finally release
android l which will no doubt coincide
at a new release if Nexus devices so I'm
thinking that's a good time for it
previous rumors claim the advice
wouldn't be out until q4 this year so
take out information with the obligatory
grain of salt oh it's clear here though
is the nvidia tegra k1 chip will indeed
power the device which is worth waiting
for that thing is frigging sweet that
along with the specs listed might lead
to next device that's a little more
expensive than users are used to but
keep an eye on that as well but you know
what happens of course will be there any
event and if anything else new leaks out
we'll have it on the site technobuffalo
