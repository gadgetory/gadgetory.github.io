brought to you by domain.com well hello
dear how's your wednesday going so far
good grand it's John Q here from
technobuffalo and welcome to what's the
apps recently my friend showed me a
rather interesting app on his iPhone and
I thought I just had to share it with
you guys and you guys are smart group
after reading the video title i'm pretty
sure you know what this video is gonna
be about so without further ado let us
check out photosynth the Photosynth
application gives you the ability to
turn you and your iOS device into a 360
degree camera photosynth is something
developed by Microsoft that allows you
to view panoramic photos in 3d because
goodness knows everything is better in
3d but seriously this technology is
really awesome you can see some great
examples on the website when you fire up
the app the on-screen directions guide
you as you spin around pretending to be
a tripod it automatically snaps photos
while building a 3d grid of your
surroundings so when you're done playing
tripod and photographer you let the app
render the picture photosynth calls it
stitching once it's done you'll be able
to view it on your phone 3d and all and
like everything nowadays you can share
that darn thing in a bunch of different
ways and that's just rhymed oh yes
including Facebook Bing Maps the
Photosynth website and email you can
even save it to your camera roll the app
actually automatically does this but if
you save it through share you can crop
out the blank areas as cool as the app
is it does need a little bit of work I
personally have a hard time taking
proper pictures with this thing either i
suck at lining things up onto this
imaginary 3d grid or the software needs
to be a little bit better on lining
things up itself either way my resulting
pictures look messed up I mean look at
that door I hate that door no matter how
hard I try okay no matter how steady I
am I just can't get the darn thing to
work there's the best of Bing Maps
gallery where you can see really amazing
examples too bad there's only about five
examples right now why don't my pictures
look anything like that they don't have
a stupid door like mine does the
stitching process can be a little bit
long especially if you took a lot of
pictures you also can't let the app
stitch in the background but I'm
guessing that's an iOS restriction
sometimes
take really long to render and you just
become impatient and that just reminds
you that nowadays we are you know really
impatient people for some reason and
everything is instant instant on instant
gratification instant coffee instant
noodles here you go take my plate sir
and all of that jazz so whenever
something like that happens it just
gives you some time till you know relax
reflect upon myself and this feel-good
feeling Hale lasts about five seconds
before I become impatient again and hate
just starts building up for no reason
and will end when the app is done
rendering you look at the picture and
you just have have all this hate and you
unleash all that hate on to that stupid
door I hate that door and speaking of
whatever I was just talking about I'm

domain.com back to the review overall
photo sense is really really cool but I
feel like it's at that stage where the
service is more novel than practical at
the moment at least on the App anyway
but the darn thing is free so I can't
really complain three out of five for
now well I hope you guys enjoyed my
