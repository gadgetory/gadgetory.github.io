to you by godaddy hello ladies and
gentlemen welcome back there episode of
ask the buffalo i'm your host jon
rettinger and you can just consider me a
horned beast fur the next I don't know
five six minutes I'm the Buffalo going
to be answering your questions you could
ask me any question you've got from the
wide world of technology from what cell
phone you should get what table' should
pick up next you can ask some business
questions about what's going on with
technobuffalo or even some personal
questions for me up this week we're
talking about the all new HTC one
android wear in the pretty awesome moto
360 a technobuffalo app and if and when
we are gonna go for K this is s the
Buffalo let's start asking Buffalo's if
you want to get a question feature on
upcoming episode of acid Buffalo you can
do it one of two ways every tuesday we
put an article up on TechnoBuffalo calm
saying hey you leave us a question you
can just do that in the comments
otherwise you could send it to me on
social media use hashtag ask the Beast
send it to John for lakers or send it to
at TechnoBuffalo well pick three to five
depending on how longer in depth they
are first question comes from the
websites and mr. Andrew paulist who asks
John I still don't know if I should get
me all new HTC One the Nokia icon please
help me so as of this filming the all
new HTC One has not been announced but
it's probably the most elite two phones
with the iphone 5 so I think it's safe
to say we know most about the new device
and maybe not all of it so we just did
our review on the icon I gave it a
really solid 8.5 it was one of the
better phones that we tested in recent
history it's probably the best Windows
Phone out there going having said that I
got a soft spot in my heart for the HTC
One I loved the original the sequel
looks to be just as good if not better
it's got new specs it's got a little
bigger screen it's got those crazy dual
cameras on the back you can focus
afterwards so ask yourself sort of one
question what ecosystem are you and are
you in sort of the windows ecosystem it
makes a lot of sense for you to sort of
stay there then you definitely want to
look at the Nokia icon or you maybe want
to try the Android side we're looking to
make a switch a sort of a wide variety
of
apps more important you have show if so
rather then you want to look at the HTC
one if cameras most important quality of
the pictures then go back to the Nokia I
kind of had to pick one though the HTC
One last year is my phone of the year
the new one I'm hoping is going to be
the same if I have to pick one i would
say wait for the all new HTC One
hopefully adopt a trick question the
next question comes from Shashi Mahal
and I'm sorry from a screwed your name
hey John how do you think Android wear
devices will stack up against the
samsung gear pebble and the other
smartwatches you did not call galaxy
gear so kudos to you and is Google doing
going in the right direction with
Android wear the first thing Android
wear is Google's open source operating
system for wearables we knew was coming
and I suspect we'll see an official
version perhaps a nexus version at
Google i/o coming up in just a few
months essentially what we've seen are
different variations of Google now on
your wrist and Motorola was like hey we
got something pretty cool to show you in
the Moto 360 it looks like a gorgeous
timepiece first and foremost it's got a
round display it looks like a really
high-end advice but also it's got google
now on it's got android wear integration
presumably motorola will do some of
their own sort of magic tricks with it
it looks really cool so yes I absolutely
think they're going in the right
direction I think Google now is sort of
made to be on your wrist you could ask
it questions get information really
really quickly and of course get
notifications a SmartWatch are known for
so yes yes yes and double yes I think
Google is absolutely going in the right
direction next question is when we get
all the time I answer it seems probably
every other month or so comes from
twitter at sound switch fans ask is
there a technobuffalo app coming to ios
and android the answer is maybe but no
time soon we don't have anything to
develop it right now we're having a
heavy focus on the mobile experience of
the site we're getting ready to roll out
sort of a new version the site that'll
sort of give you the same experience on
desktop and mobile absolutely the
direction that we've been heading
recently i haven't seen everything
especially put a lot of resources behind
a mobile app perhaps they'll change in
the future maybe the end of the year but
right now we do not have any plans for
mobile application although i will say
their unofficial third-party apps out
there for pretty much every app
ecosystem let me take a minute to thank
our friends and overall good p
at godaddy they wanna remind you that
it's go time and good get is here to
help kick butt online you can set your
website today she's always dreamed about
it they two dollar ninety-five CENTCOM
visit godaddy.com enter promo code
techno 295 get your calm for just two
bucks and ninety-five cents check out
the website though for the rest of the
details found a dream starting your blog
you on website now is a perfect time to
do it get started our last question also
comes from twitter user at tomasa de
llegas asks at john for lakers you guys
need going for k anytime what importance
is 4k play with technobuffalo so first
and foremost we've got all the lenses
for canon switching would require
purchasing Don's new lenses and I know
that Sony's got a 4k handycam but I
don't think a handycam didn't give us a
same quality and same diversity we can
get with interchangeable lenses so I
know you can get crazy cannons in the
twenty to thirty thousand dollar range i
can do 4k teddicus t100 can do 4k but
has not been enabled yet so i haven't
seen the compelling reason to make a
swish now something like Panasonic it
has pretty awesome 4k options coming out
very soon but again gotta produce all
new lenses are purchased an adapter then
you're shooting video with essentially a
DSLR which we do do but it's sort of not
as compelling least for me as a
dedicated camera for video so perhaps
when Canon or Nikon or sony comes out
with a really awesome interchangeable
lens dedicated video camera can shoot 4k
we will make that switch load would be
easier from a lending standpoint if
cannon would do it I don't think many
people have 4k monitors York even bother
viewing for cake onto editing it can be
a bit tough if you're not using a really
top and computer I just don't see a
compelling reason to do it right now
therefore that compelling reason does
happen though will absolutely make the
switch to 4k out a wager probably this
time next year we'll probably shooting
most of our stuff in 4k is probably
reasonable expectation maybe we see you
know Apple released and 4k displays and
sort of see it permeate our audience a
bit more hopefully that helped answer
your question so thank you guys for
watching another episode of ask the buff
hope you enjoyed it's good to be back in
the ass to buffalo chair I really
enjoyed getting a chance to talk to the
audience and just sort of you know just
chat and see what's going on and answer
