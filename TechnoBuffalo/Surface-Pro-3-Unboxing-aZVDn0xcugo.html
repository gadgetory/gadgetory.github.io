TechnoBuffalo it's an unboxing I am
super excited about it is the surface
pro 3
I loved the surface pro 2 and I'm really
excited to see what the threequel is all
about let's take a look at the new type
cover I can't really unbox it but I'll
take a look at it let's go ahead and see
what the pros are all about so here is
the box for the surface pro 3 it's
slimmed down quite a bit like the tablet
itself Microsoft handed these out at the
event a few days ago they handed out
tablets and boxes separately so we had
to kind of put the tablet in so it's
more of a rien Bocking I would say goes
ahead and slides right off and there she
is
it said sided - she looks like art it's
awful go ahead and get this out of the
box here is the Microsoft Surface pro 3
we'll get to all the specs in here for
them to see what else is going to come
in the box real quickly we've got the
new surface pen and don't call it a
stylus so Microsoft will get Maddie if
there's all kinds of new stuff you can
turn the thing on to double click it
it's got all kinds of new sensitivity
they got rid of some of the effects
where it wouldn't match up one-to-one
when you're moving it so a lot of new
things here with this pen push it out to
the side and surface pro 3 booklets and
other stuff I assume this is some
warranty information English and Spanish
this is where the charger is going to
live I also believe that they slimmed it
this down as well I didn't talk much
about it but we'll see what it looks
like still a brick though ya come out of
here cord
there we go so there's that part of it
still has a powered USB port and also
there is as I clumsily open this up
there is that part of it so slim down a
little bit still still a break but a
much smaller one and it is also still
magnetic but now it slides in to connect
so that's a charging stuff
acha spend too much time on that that's
not why you're here this is why you are
here let's say hello to the Microsoft
Surface pro 3 and all of its reflective
glossy glory so it's a tablet so it's
all about the screen and the screen got
super improved here it is now 12 inches
and I hired an HD res
I do math quickly that's 216 PPI it's up
from ten point six on the surface pro to
Windows 8.1 pro and launch its using the
fourth generation intel core chip so
it's either a three by five or seven for
eight gigs ram available in four
configurations 64 128 256 and you
guessed it a measly 512 gigabytes you
can expand and storage though up to 64
gigs with a microSD card it's got
cameras on the back we've got a five
megapixel camera on the front we've got
a front-facing selfie Microsoft's hoping
will be a Skype camera it's got 802 11 a
BGN and AC Bluetooth 4.0 36 watt hour
battery and no NFC and it's a really
thin 0.3 6 inches now pricing has got a
broad spectrum of ranges here starting
at $7.99 all the way up to 1949 ours is
the core i5 model at 8 gigs of RAM 20:56
gigs of storage which is nicely middle
Specht I'm going to set you back about
1,300 bucks so there's a lot of other
things different here about the tablet
aside from the screen first that
Microsoft button is gone from here and
is now here Microsoft really wants you
to use this a lot in portrait mode they
made a lot of comparisons to the iPad
open sort of you use this in the same
way a lot of talk about OneNote and how
it's going to interact with with the
stylus or with the surface pen
sort of use it as a notepad replacement
the other big thing they talk about is
the hinge and they kept talking about
friction friction on the hinge and how
friction is good and that kept making me
giggle but the original surface had a
hinge and then the surface to have two
places for the hinge now you can
position this any way you want and it
will stay there almost all the way to
flat which is really cool it's kind of a
great angle if you want to write on the
screen did a really nice job with the
hinge I one of the coolest things I
think about the surface line on the
screen here these on first impression
looks absolutely gorgeous albeit very
glossy but it does look quite nice the
other thing Microsoft was touting with
their surface pro 3 is the all new type
cover first you've got actually a real
trackpad it's plastic it's not that felt
material anymore and a clicks which is
nice as well I've got a spot here now
for your surface pen so you're not going
to lose that and it goes and clicks in
the same way they talked a lot about
this fake word they made up called lap
ability I used the surface pro on my lap
at home quite a bit and it was always
sort of wobbly but now there's a
secondary hinge right here as you go
ahead and sort of lift that up there's
another magnetic strip and it'll connect
now you get an angle on the keyboard you
put this thing on your lap it's kind of
much less flexing to feel more natural
like an actual keyboard as opposed to
having some sort of weird peripheral
accessory Microsoft is saying it's gonna
be your tablet's to be your lab topic of
your only computer it's got the power to
back it up those you guys that are
wondering how it can handle games it is
Intel integrated graphics so it's gonna
be a little bit hard to do some really
big 3d rendering that kind of stuff but
I'll get you through whatever you need
at least on low settings answer me
handle video editing as well that's what
you want to do although I want to wait a
little while on the export so for
comparison here is the surface pro 2
versus the now much larger surface pro 3
so just remind you ten point six inches
twelve point six inches and gorgeous
higher than HD display is also a big
thinness difference here surface pro 3
is point three six inches surface pro 2
is point five three inches
they claim that there is a fan here
inside of the surface pro 3 oh they said
it's really small really quiet so
anybody know there's a fan in there so
you should get at least a fan list type
experience so continuing sort of our
tour around on the left-hand side that's
where your volume up downs going to live
through twenty five-millimeter headset
jack there's a little indent to pop out
the hinge if you want to on the right
hand side you've got USB 3.0 mini
displayport there's a speaker and on the
top you've got your power and lock
button go ahead and hit that and go back
home there's been a real quick first
look and it gets first impressions of
the surface pro 3 and I'm excited to use
them to put it through its paces I use
it as I mentioned my surface pro 2 quite
a bit so put this one to the same things
and see how it's better or not better
and I mentioned real quick before I go
differences in the type covers let me
show you those real quickly
so here's second iteration of the type
cover probably can't even see the
trackpad it sort of integrated into this
bottom part was not very accurate
here is the third iteration you can see
it's more to find a different material
you had little indents here for button
didn't actually click how to kind of tap
it now whole thing actually clicks
similar to the trackpad on Apple laptops
or the Magic Trackpad the whole thing
actually ought to be treated as a button
which can make clicking a lot easier for
you so you guys just a real quick first
look at the surface pro 3 we'll put it
through its paces do a full review I
think eyes want to see particularly sure
to let us know until next time I'm John
wrench for TechnoBuffalo see you guys
