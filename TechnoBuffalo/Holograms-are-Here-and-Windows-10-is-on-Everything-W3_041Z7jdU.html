technobuffalo here Microsoft two and a
half power windows 10 keynote just ended
and if you're not one of the lucky few
that that amount of time to spare like
if you were working for example you miss
a ridiculous amount of Awesomeness so we
had to jump right in and tell you
everything that microsoft announced so
first the quote that really sums up the
entire day came from the end from CEO
southtown nutella who said we want to
move from people needing windows to
choosing windows to loving windows
microsoft is moving in that direction so
usually what I do recaps I'll start at
the beginning with what they announced
and I'll end at the end what they
announced but I gotta mix up the order
at least at the beginning because
freaking Holograms holograms microsoft
introduced a brand new windows
holographic concept that brings
augmented reality from like this level
to like a level that you can't even see
my hand so imagine seeing just your
baller minecraft feels right in your
living room potential for this stuff is
absolutely incredible so it's a headset
of course and it's called hololens
people are probably already trying to
think of the hollow lens whole names
like you saw a google glass but it looks
a little silly but it does allow the
users to see Holograms wherever they go
they can see games apps and more all
embedded right in the headset itself it
doesn't even look like a real finger
microsoft said it's going to be
available in the Windows 10 time frame
which is kind of vague and just like
them some wiggle room but it looks like
it's coming soon microsoft said they're
also making it very clear to holographic
is something it intends to bring to the
market this is no way vaporware at all
and aside from just seeing holograms
don't you take here Holograms you can
hear Holograms behind you like if to
puck you know holograms coming up to do
a rap you know he's back there in one
example Microsoft showed off skype being
projected onto a wall and another
minecraft world was easily accessible
right in the middle of your living room
so imagine just you know maybe like your
wife or mom or dad when I was making
dinner and you're just sitting there
just freaking chopping trees you look a
little silly but beyond awesome I'll
Microsoft that the experiments is a
mixture of augmented reality by taking
advantage of holograms and the headset
worn by users the headset by the way
that looks
little silly but snow bigger than oculus
rift you've gotten use to saying that
sucker on your face this is gonna look
pretty natural so aside from just a
crazy cool novelty factor Microsoft
seeds of huge potential use cases for
the holographic headset not just in
gaming or for home use they specifically
mentioned architects walking around
potential decisions where astronauts
we're on different planets like just
imagine them being on Mars and looking
around being like hey dude I'm on Mars
and imagine what kind of possible
education program developers could
create this as well one of the coolest
things I thought about the hololens it's
an untethered PC essentially you don't
de plug this into a computer it's it's
own encapsulated computer so no wires
your PC needed microsoft says it'll also
support spatial sound which means able
to actually again here the Holograms a
similar how oculus is implementing 3d
sound for its latest VR headset a
high-end CPU and GPU also be included in
the headset along with a third process
microsoft made they're calling a
holographic possibly need it or who pooh
other fancy budu includes advanced
sensors and you just see through the
lenses alright so i skipped around a
little bit but I just had a jump right
in with freaking Holograms now we'll
start with how the keynote actually
began it was with Windows 10 so the big
question I had was when's it going to be
available how much it's going to cost
the first thing it's going to be a free
upgrade but only for the first year of
its existence so upgrade within the
first year that includes upgrade windows
8.1 and Windows 7 along with smartphones
running Windows Phone 8.1 give update
your device microsoft says it'll keep
this off we're current for its lifetime
of that device which is kind of nice and
the new builds for this will be
launching sometime next week so you
don't know when it's going to be
launching officially but if you want to
get hands that early build next week
will be the time for that so again free
for the first year after that it's going
to cost you some money as we don't know
how many so they talked about Windows 10
for like a really long time but here's
some tidbits the cliff note version so
to speak Windows 10 s design so some new
features that were discussed today
taverns we've mentioned before included
full screen start menu new action center
for interactive notifications in the
sidebar area brand new settings
experience where you can quickly tweak
your system settings as well Windows 10
also features a continuum feature up
Kindred's that double as a laptop and
tablets so you can move around with the
mouse and keyboard like you would if
you're just sitting at your desk moving
just the tablet mode like if you pull
your surface off its keyboard dock for
example it'll prompt you to ask if you
want to move your device in tablet mode
and I'll sort of put everything to you
full screen you put it back in the dock
and they'll go back to serve a whole
bunch of different windows so it goes
touch friendly when you need the two and
it will go more desktop for the nena to
just really cool thing that Mike shots
of corporated and again you have the
option to it's not gonna just do it on
its own and you know start thinking for
itself next let's talk about sweet
cortana she's awesome on Windows Phone
she is going to be awesomer and Windows
10 because she's going to be built into
Windows 10 and we're civically built
into the taskbar a small microphone icon
remind you that she's gonna respond to
voice commands Microsoft digital
assistant will live right there on your
desktop and sometimes offer
notifications as well otherwise it looks
like the same old Cortana we already
know pretty well you could ask questions
you can search the internet you can
check whether just have her tell you
jokes you'll sing to you too you can
also call up documents and PowerPoint
presentations anything else microsoft
office cuz you through your local drive
cloud storage onedrive I ask questions
like show me photos from December
whatever date and they'll show you that
so Joe Belfiore said that having Cortana
your pc is like having another member of
your family around sitting you and
helping you out getting things done well
members of my family aren't that helpful
but she's there I think Cortana is one
of the best workflow systems out there
and only makes sense to have it on the
desktop but Cortana's original home was
on your phone so what about owns Windows
10 for phones and tablets preview that's
going to be coming in February just get
it out of the way but now you could
finally it seems weird even have to say
this finally finally with an extra
finally set a background image making
your phone much more customizable and
personal you can do that on previous
versions as well but you get much
reflects ability but it's going to show
through the tiles it also looks much
cleaner than just setting a background
image for tiles although I imagine that
option still available if you just want
that as well I let me be very clear
though this is a gigantic major upgrade
not just a fresh coat of paint so
customization options are super nice
their pool NT of new features to match
the windows 10 experience across just
ton of form factors
for example new Action Center Windows 10
sync to the pc so notifications you
dismiss on your phone what else its
appear in your computer or the other way
around and so it goes just like that
it's super simple and really elegant we
also saw a new setting menus in line
replies for messaging skypes integrated
right into messaging and finally because
microsoft is putting emphasis on
universal apps the app ecosystem has
potential to be better than ever so
you'll see office of course and much
much much more running perfectly on
these smaller form factor hopefully apps
going to get way better because one
platform across everything then
Microsoft was like hey heard maybe
you've heard some about this project
Spartan ORS I'm just calling it audios
internet explorer it's a new browser
Microsoft introducing with Windows 10 so
just a code name right now but I like it
maybe it'll make its way to production
smoke on a completely new rendering
engine and it looks very very very clean
and very minimal just kind of people
want this what I want in a browser so
pretty looks aside there also some
really good tools included make the
browsing experience much more powerful
than typical Chrome Firefox I and operas
so there's any annotating motor stalls
users to draw all of our web pages you
can comment scribble and then share
notes with your friends family or people
that you hate worth noting those the
drawing all over the browser isn't
exclusive to touch and pen which is a
really kind of neat feature they
introduced which means you can easily
use this feature with your old just
desktop and mouse doesn't quite look as
nice and elegant but you can still very
easily share notes and add comments and
click anywhere on the page you're good
to go so next big thing with the Spartan
browser the Microsoft focus on was the
action of reading which is really what
you're doing on a browser at least most
things you're reading text new features
essentially swim at web pages look like
a book I'm making it much easier to that
jess whatever contents on screen for
long-form content scale imitate any of
the kind of nastiness of busy pages
provides a much more minimal reading
environment clean simple but like we
defined with services like pocket or
Instapaper or even reading lists in
safari and of course Cortana which is
also again due to Windows 10 we built
right into Spartan as the tons of rumors
after just recently katana will be
easily quickly available right in the
address bar to get pretty much infinite
access to that personal assistant
everywhere type in whether immediately
weather's going to start populating and
pulling down and that bar same goes for
flight and form a
throughout restaurant web pages for
example Cortana is going to be there
help you cut the information and also
tell you directions menu contact
information just a ton more next let's
talk about Xbox to the part of Microsoft
there's an Xbox app for Windows 10
before you're like of John and app this
app is pretty cool players will be able
to play one another across the xbox one
and Windows 10 versions of the game
which is kind of badass all right so
cross-platform gave me you can also talk
to people that are on xbox live a lot of
Awesomeness therefore honor we give me
more about what I'm talking about go to
techna buffalo calm and check out just
the mass and those articles we posted
and then things got kind of crazy so you
know what Windows needed more form
factors maybe how about a freaking 84
inch 4k screen boom meet the surface hub
it is I just said a ridiculously large
4k display with a ton of high-tech
sensors and wizardry dual cameras
microphones speaker and Silas support
all built it into it it's running a
heavily modified version of Windows 10
which is obviously adapted for just a
giant enormous screen size looks really
cool you can use it for white border you
can have skype show up at a corner for
conferencing and also be four inch 4k
display no idea what that's going to
cost but I wager it's going to cost
either one of these and one of these or
at least a first firstborn child so we
don't know so just a ton of stuff came
out of Microsoft today you got virtual
reality 84-inch sets you've got windows
10 for desktop Windows 10 for phones
cortana and a lot of other stuff that i
just think that time to mention others
would have been two and a half hour
