and for this battle we've got the two
kings of Android and I'm ready to piss
off 50% of you in one corner we've got
the latest from Samsung this is the note
8 in the other the latest from Google
this is the pixel to excel on paper and
objective tests these two sit atop the
Android throne I'm sorry for UV 30 or P
10 fans out there these are the two
phones to beat it is 2018 so you change
up the categories a little bit we've got
six categories to pick a winner and like
all of our verses it will not be a
cop-out whatever is best for you type
answer we're gonna declare a winner so
to round out our six categories the
first is Hardware this is now including
the build and spec so device we've got
camera display software battery and
intangibles so our first category is
Hardware this used to be build in
previous verses but now encompassing
everything inside and outside of the
phone so on paper these phones are
extremely similar the US version the
Galaxy Note 8 which we're talking about
the Snapdragon 835 the RAM stories a bit
different the note eights got 6 as
opposed to the 4 in the pixel 2 XL I
have not had any sort of slow down at
all with the note 8 in fact performance
has been incredibly fast and things that
are usually pretty intensive things like
multitasking no issue with that
whatsoever really intense gaming no
issues I have had no OS slowdown I've
had no OS stutters and no OS issues so
if you had issues with other Samsung
phones in the past leave that aside the
note 8 is incredibly quick for the build
side of things aesthetically this might
be one of the most beautiful phones ever
made in my opinion I love the way this
phone looks I love the way this phone
feels the glass on the back certainly
makes it fragile but from a purely
aesthetic standpoint the note 8 is a
work of art so we'll talk later at
length I promise about the display but
the infinity display on the phone rounds
out the way the phone looks and feels I
love the curve and how it sits in the
hand and on the negative side I've
talked long and hard
red in the face like the stupid location
the fingerprint sensor I don't care if
he's a case or it's fine for you I'm the
one making this video and for me that's
a stupid location I wish they'd put it
somewhere else which we'll probably see
in the upcoming Galaxy s 9 so yeah so
the story for the note it's fast it's
beautiful and it's really quick but it's
not to be necessarily outdone by with
the pixel to excel brings to the table
and you think just cuz it's got to be
server and less it gonna be slower not
the case it's amazing what can happen
when software and hardware at least for
the most part get vertically integrated
this phone is a beast on the design
standpoint the pixel choose a nice phone
it's a goodish looking phone it's gotten
bigger bezels than we've seen on late
2017 I guess now 2018 standards but you
do have front facing speakers which are
nice the screen is still pretty good so
the two-tone look of the pixel is not
for everybody's taste I like the metal
feel I like the way the metal
complements the glass least
aesthetically on the device I've said it
quite a bit in other videos I do not
like the ridge that comes around the
side of the screen my finger hits it I
prefer the infinity edge that I've got
on the note it's a functionally designed
phone it is function over form here
that's what Google is known for it's
this phones not gonna win any design
awards and might win awards later on but
it comes to design it's certainly not
going to take the cake from the gorgeous
things that we've got from Samsung and
on the positive side they put the
fingerprint sensor we're fingerprint
sensors belong not next to the camera
sensor where you can reach it without
having to turn your phone around so hats
off to you google for actually doing
what you should do the fingerprint
sensor I know a lot of this is probably
the hardest category that I've had to
pick a winner that was a theme that came
through throughout all these categories
but I'm not gonna cop out and say
anything a tie for me when the best
features about the no-dick that I use
all the time and that is the s-pen
having that option to use the s-pen
being able to plug in headphones listen
to music are things that I have used
that give the Note 8 its lights but I'll
be in an edge over the pixel 2 XL
Samsung takes this round so next let's
jump into camera and I want to say these
are two of the best smartphone cameras
on the market it's hard to take bad
pictures with either of these but there
are
many factors to make one of them better
let's start with what we've got from
Samsung and a no date there's a case you
can't recite foe inspection the top of
your head here's what the Galaxy Note 8
is packing so it's a 12 megapixel dual
pixel sensor F 1.7 aperture and 2 times
optical zoom and dual o is so portrait
shots are all the rage on smartphones
it's no exception that it's in the note
8 and it takes incredible portrait shots
I love they can do the focusing
afterwards it's really easy to bouquet
and blur out the backgrounds incredible
job on portrait things and low light
things in highlight any picture that I
take with the cameras just tend to look
good perhaps by some taste a little a
little bit saturated I like the poppy
colors you can adjust it in settings if
I really like what Samsung has done out
of the box with the cameras and the
front sensor is no slouch either it's
got smart out-of-focus 8 megapixels it
takes really good selfies I made that I
take probably more selfies than I should
and often times I find myself reaching
for the note 8 the more with the note
days is it's hard to take bad pictures
in fact you got to be a really crappy
photographer to take anything that's bad
in any sort of light and that's a theme
that colds true with the pixel as well
and it's looking at aspect you think
this would be a blowout because you know
one sensor versus two but damn Google
did a great job this time around
anything I threw at the pixel to excel
just took good pictures and that's true
with the note 8 as well where I became
really impressed with what the pixel to
excel could do within its portrait modes
uses machine learning and neural
networking to get better it's recognized
what a person is recognized hair to
recognize the area between fingers
junkit strange spider-man webbings and I
think that's where the pixel to excel
starts to shine while the note 8 is
awesome as is the pixel to excel is
going to be getting better and already
seen it get better over the two ish
months as I've been using it yeah it's
not perfect I wish to 4k wasn't capped
at 30 frames per second but I can
overlook all those things for an
incredible rear facing camera and
incredible front facing camera with
portrait mode if I had to pick a device
just based on camera in fact if I had to
pick any phone in the entire world based
just on camera
maybe hard-pressed to find one better
than the pixels to excel
and that's saying something because the
Samsung is really good but the 2xl is
definitely taking this round alright so
next let's go to display and I'm not I'm
not gonna belabor this point much longer
than it than it needs to we've told a
lot of stories I made a whole video
about how this planet pixel 2 is not as
bad as everybody says and it's really
not especially asked in November update
it looks a lot better you look at the
saturated colors that people tend to
like and it's a fine display in its own
right when you compare it against the
best display and I think is ever bid on
a phone 6.3 inch display on the Samsung
Note 8 is incredible pictures look
incredible the Black Codes are
incredibly black obviously the colors
are extremely vibrant I say this a lot
it looks like there's a sticker on this
display I've had this phone for now a
better part of three and a half almost
four months and I'm still impressed with
how good the screen looks even direct
sunlight you just cannot beat the screen
on the note 8 I'm gonna short this
category a little bit because it's not
necessary you should have seen this one
coming for a mile away Samsung's clearly
taking a display category alright so
next let's jump it to software this is a
new category for us when we reserved
we're comparing two phones right in the
same operating system and at least on
paper they're the same operon system
they're both running Android albeit
aesthetically very different takes on
what Google's OS can offer so I'm not
Samsung on the past for their take on
Android TouchWiz modern UI or whatever
you want to call it it's gotten way
better but they're still fighting that
stigma from the galaxy s5 and earlier
when they threw everything at the
kitchen sink at a samsung phone
Vivint used a modern Samsung phone if
you same device since they need the s7
you are missing out it's gotten a lot
better and maybe it's exactly just to
say this maybe I'm I'm gonna be screamed
at by the Android purists but there's a
lot of things that Samsung does on their
version of Android that I like better
than what Google does on stock OS I like
the setting menu I like the dialer like
how gestures are integrated I like how
handles multitasking at pairing there's
a lot of really good things inside of
the note 8 there are some annoyances
though of what Samsung's done having
duplicate apps for it to the Google
stock apps are super annoying
I don't wanted a separate Samsung only
app store super annoying but I guess
they can be hidden
suppose but I think one of the biggest
compliments I can give to the modern
Samsung skin Fork of Android ever you
want to call it so that when I use the
Samsung device I'm not putting a
third-party launcher on it it's not
something I can say for many phones
they've done a really nice job here
utilizing what their phone can do and
taking advantage of all the features and
sensors that are built into it and the
mortal this section here is don't knock
the Samsung skin and so you've tried it
on the negative side though Samsung is
notoriously slow for software updates so
assume the version of Android you get
when you buy the Samsung phone is pretty
much what you're gonna have for a super
long time Oreos been out for a while
we're still stuck on nougat I wish
Samsung was faster with the OS updates I
get that it takes time but it's
frustrating when devices like the pixel
get updates much faster which brings me
to the 2x elf so this is pure Android as
Google intended or I guess now it's pure
Android as Google intended on the pixels
I know a lot of Android purists holds a
pixel in a previous Nexus line up to
this huge esteem for what Android
flagships phone should be and to say
anything negative about it is completely
sacrilegious but there are some things
that I don't like about this and I'm
just gonna say it I don't like the
weather widget at the top I wish I could
change it resize and remove it all
together I don't like the search bar at
the bottom for my eye and my aesthetic F
belongs at the top and maybe I'm just
not used to it I wish I could change it
which I could tweak that's Google
doesn't let you spend strange you took a
bit of Annapolis approach to telling you
how things should look on their phones
and obviously I know if their party
launchers can fix app talk about the
experience just out of the box so having
said that really like a latest version
of Android the most up to date the most
secure the latest that Google has to
offer I know I am always going to have
on my pixel device and that's a peace of
minds that you don't get with something
like Samsung and quite honestly I just
enjoyed the experience it's fast
everything about this phone just feels
screamingly quick its way the things
work together I like how Google's
services are presented the way they were
meant to be this one's tougher to call
than I expected but a slight edge this
round is going to Google and the pixel
to excel but credit to Samsung freaking
credible UI ID so next let's jump to
battery in previous verses videos I've
just told you my use case and which one
lasted longer but it's a new year we
want the new test to see which battery
is actually better and going to last you
longer so here's what we did we took
both phones a note with it's 33 hundred
million power battery and the pixel XL
if it's slightly bigger 35 20 mil and
our battery and we drained them to 0
which is harder than you think and we
use the in box accessories to charge
these phones up and see which ones
charge faster so after one hour the note
8 was at 59% and the pixel 2 was at 62%
so we wanted to try and drain the phone
so we charged them up to 100% we turned
max brightness on be close all apps we
kicked on airplane mode but kept Wi-Fi
working and we streamed the same three
hour YouTube clip and that's where
things got interesting they were exactly
the same
after 8 and a half hours both phones
died so those tests were surprisingly
close we gave this category a slight
edge and I'll admit it I'm aware of the
irony of giving a battery category to
the note this one goes to Samsung by
virtue of doing more with less milliamp
hours last but not least let's jump into
intangibles all the little things that
come together to make the phone and
awesome package of both of these bring a
really long list of intangibles on the
note side you've got things like the
s-pen wireless charging Samsung pay
which is different than Android pay ip68
expandable storage you've got a
headphone jack a lot of little things
that make this an incredible device to
use and to hold the picture to excel
brings a ton of awesome things to the
table and I can't overstate this enough
one of the things that brings is a
fingerprint reader and they're really
nice to use location but aside from that
you're getting incredible speakers again
the latest updates from Google you're
getting stock Android is important to a
lot of folks and of course Android pay
is built into this of course you're
missing some things you get with other
phones like expandable storage that's
been oddly a staple of the pixel ina
Nexus line before that and that phone
jack is gone we look at the laundry
lists of extra features that phones
bring to the table the note 8
just taking intangibles so now that I've
got your foaming-at-the-mouth either
with happiness because you are super
pissed off let's recap and declare our
winner of this versus Hardware went to
the notes camera went to the pixel
display went to the note software it
went to the pixel battery went to the
note intangibles went to the notes in
any great battle ali-frazier there can
only be one winner no matter how hard
both people fight there's no
participation trophies and vs. and
despite the pixel to being a badass
baller phone only one winner and that is
the Galaxy Note 8 it did an incredible
job with this device I think everything
about it is borderline perfect but it's
pretty crazy that I just happened to be
texting you on my Google pixel Excel -
and you said that another iPhone was
better so I just kind of had to come
here to argue that ladies and gentlemen
it's a starting tackle from the LA
Chargers mr. Joe Barksdale Philip Rivers
was only sex 18 times this season sorry
what were you saying he's the guy that's
protecting mr. Philip Rivers so I'm
saying I'm saying the notes is the
winner and if somebody who's used both
phones we've talked at length about both
phones so I actually have actually had
the note and I was probably one of the
most excited people for that phone I'm
excited like because I had to know 7 and
you know we all know the battery things
and all that but
in that time also you know waiting for
the note I had a Google pixel excel and
when I got the note I really missed the
pixel excel and what I meant by that was
the software features the user interface
the ease of you know notification
dismissals I mean it's just an easy
phone to use it just works you know it's
not the sexiest or most extravagant but
at the end of the day you know this is
the phone that I would want to have
every day and for the record for anybody
yells at me about why I picked the note
or how much Samsung paid me I convinced
Joe to get the pixel to excel I
legitimately love both phones the week
we played the Patriots yep you convinced
me to get it he was just sitting there
at hotel board I was like going to make
now it just came out you loved it
I limped on over and got it I just
didn't know that you were gonna abandon
your first love of the galaxy Galaxy
Note 8 I didn't know you were gonna be
so wrong with your assessment against a
fight again I thought I taught you I
can't even say that laughing are you
physically intimidated by me very do we
look the same height sitting yeah cuz
standing up is super funny I met Joe
thanks for coming Joe come on we have an
album coming up 25th January 25th it's
called butterflies rainbows and
moonbeams and I'm sure you know you guys
are here music and hopefully you John
will have me back again well link to
