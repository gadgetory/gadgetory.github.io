the iphone review as always send me any
questions if you got them and thank you
all for subscribing but on the bottom
you've got the phone after all it as the
phones got to make phone calls on the
bottom it's broken up into five
categories you've got favourites which
is Apple's equivalents
speed dial you can just tap who you want
to call recent recent calls contacts
pull up your contacts and you can scroll
through with your finger or drag your
finger along the side to go faster and a
keypad I'll show you real quickly what a
call looks like on a keypad five five
five five five five five a call pulls up
this simple call menu where you can mute
it go to the keypad speakerphone add it
hold it or go to contacts to add another
call for a conference and it's in call
you just hit the big red and call but I
found call volume to be reasonable no
better works or really any other phone
I've had that speakers no louder or
quieter than the other phone I've had
it's perfectly acceptable phone you
don't have any trouble with it ring your
volume could be a little bit louder but
you can definitely hear it and the last
thing you have here is the voice without
the visual voicemail it shows up the
name of the contact of the phone number
of who called you I don't have your
voicemails right now but just mail it's
a very pared down mail functionality
there isn't push email or not getting a
blackberry change server what you're
getting is a pull mail pulled it down I
use pop for work it seems to work pretty
well it is full HTML email which is uh
which is nice Safari is in my opinion
one of the most useful features of the
phone I use email on phones a tremendous
amount and that found this to be
incredibly incredibly helpful so I'll
give you a quick example here up Safari
that's apart and we'll go hit the top
here top of the page and gives you the
option here of typing a web address now
you've got to use this soft keyboard
which
takes a lot to get used to if you watch
the videos on apple.com they say it
takes a week it really does take a week
I've had the phone since they came out
and I just now feel comfortable with
with using it so I'm going to show you
guys what a website looks like I'm on
Wi-Fi I here in my apartment I'm gonna
load a pretty intensive site below an
ESPN for you
so yes pin shows up right there
I'll click it and you can see how fast
it loads on Wi-Fi
so they're pretty much is there's the
whole page and again you can turn it
sideways I hit the button excuse me turn
it sideways and you get the profile view
you can scroll through the webpage but
you know the text is kind of small to
read it's a full webpage on a little
screen here so what you can do down
there what you can do with the screen is
just double tap and it zooms right
another text very cool you can read what
you want or scroll over and you also
have the same functionality head up the
pictures and zoom and you can pinch and
then zoom out by not pinching or
pinching the other way when you're done
reading or trying to go back to the full
page if you double tap again goes back
to where you were originally DoubleTap
again pulls back the the whole webpage
it's very fast over Wi-Fi you know as
you can see lightning quick over edge
it's okay I've used 3G phones in the
past not as fast as 3G obviously but
it's definitely usable you could be a
little bit patient loading intensive
sites but for checking Gmail or checking
yahoo mail or even loading a page like
ESPN it's really not bad I will actually
show you guys by contrast telling it
takes to load ESPN for example over edge
okay so I just turned Wi-Fi off and I'm
going to refresh the page hit the
refresh button and though while it's
loading I'll talk a little bit about the
phone again the email it said is
serviceable the web application though
is is amazing there than any other phone
I've used I've used windows-based trio's
I've used Windows Mobile five Windows
Mobile 6 I've used BlackBerry's really
I've tried the Symbian really tried all
browsers and this thing is far and away
the best and if you're a heavy internet
user there's nothing better and there's
a new I am client of just released for
the iPhone by Abby Drive which is it
really takes care of the lack of iChat
which the phone doesn't have and there
we go there's a ESPN pretty much fully
loaded not enough blistering fast but
certainly not terribly slow so let's
quit out here
the Internet and again sorry to keep
breathing through these features here
and again that one that features
everybody's excited about is this new
and improved iPod so you hit the iPod
button on the bottom pulls up a list of
artists playlist songs you know you can
scroll through with your finger like
normal music videos too if you have them
but the killer feature here is the full
cover flow pick up the phone turn it
sideways and you have all your albums
speaker volume is actually pretty good
when you play music so we'll play the
example a green day click it pulls up
all the songs on the album pretty close
to the big album cause you can see what
it sounds like
over at all yes in conclusion here I'm
extremely impressed at the iPhone while
it might take an extra step to dial a
number because you have to hit phone
instead of just hitting your speed dial
it's a pleasure to do it's fun to watch
the GUI it's fun to watch and shrink and
disappear and it's not just kids stuff
it actually has advanced business
functionality like I said the email web
for business is very important I travel
a lot for work being able to view my
company's website or competitive
websites or pull down information is
very useful nothing does it better than
the iPhone as I said if I had a rank if
I had to rank the iPhone on a scale of 1
to 10 I'd have to give it a 9 it's
enjoyable it's fun and it's just a great
great phone build quality is excellent
highly recommended battery life seems to
be very good I take it off the charger
at about 6:00 in the morning when I wake
up I charge it at about midnight when I
go to bed still has battery left no
problem that's with some pretty heavy
internet usage and pretty heavy phone
usage it's a little bit expensive you
know that's a sticking point for most
people if you have the money I think
it's absolutely worth it it's a great
phone it's fun to use and it really is
best of all worlds so guys thank you for
watching
send me questions if you have them
thank you for subscribing and enjoy</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
