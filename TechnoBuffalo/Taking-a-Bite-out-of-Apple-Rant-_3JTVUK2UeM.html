to you by domain.com Don injure listen
you can tell I'm upset and I feel like
I've got a right to be upset let's talk
about Apple a little bit listen I got my
start reviewing Apple products that's
what I did for the first like a year and
a half of me on YouTube my first big
unbox actually my first video I ever did
was in a boxing of Apple's old Santa
Rosa MacBook Pro I will always have a
soft spot in my heart for Apple and as
I've grown as a reviewer I don't really
care if it's an iPhone or an Android I
review every product on its own and man
Apple has made some big mistakes and
from a path that was really clear and
straightforward
they have veered like all the way off to
Antarctica so let's start this beard
rant with the new Magic Mouse so let me
show you a little something here this is
a Magic Mouse probably the most under
Gunawan being used but it's fine they've
had that for a while but let's say
you're using your new Magic Mouse and
dies it runs out of batter and you've
got to charge it as these things tend to
do how my friends are you going to plug
it in put in new double-a batteries nope
not anymore plug it in from the back
nope apples beautiful design or design
is first and foremost and it's
unapologetically plastic they put the
freaking charger on the bottom of the
mouse how you gonna charge this pull it
pull it big deep breath it's on the
bottom how can you use a mouse like this
riddle me that people I don't understand
Apple you're always designed focused
what were you thinking putting the
charger on the bottom you made a mouse
that was like marginally useful with
multi-touch gestures and swiping and
turned it into a brick for the hour that
you're targeting it I know what charges
fast what have you something to use it
while it's charging I just don't get it
you're getting annoyed you're getting
very annoyed getting your mouse let's
talk iPad pro toss me ah he thought I'm
not gonna iPad pro coming out I've used
one
at the event Apple's positioning this
thing as a mobile powerhouse with the
latest technology the company has they
got some cool tech but there's one
glaring omission this tablet that's the
latest and greatest most powerful it has
all the coolest technology does not even
have the coolest technology at Apple
offers no 3d touch in this thousand
dollar-plus tablet when it gets SPECT
out why okay and maybe the argument is
made the panelists too big technology
wasn't ready yet for a large screen
tablet I can't understand that but then
why position is why released the iPad
pro now you've waited this many years
wait you can put the latest tech in your
latest tablet maybe they're holding out
for dec generation similar to the no
camera the first generation iPad so I
got something from generation to in
which case you are screwing your
consumers over who's going to spend the
thousand odd plus dollars for this
gigantic tab with a gorgeous display
with fast hardware and a really quick
processor and not be able force touch to
FaceTime your mom you got actually tap a
button then tap another button my mom
your mom that's too many buttons Apple
dude all right I just got to feel like I
got a I got a center myself a little bit
good idea all right
so I bought the new MacBooks they came
out thin light relatively powerful up a
claim that was going to be good I'll do
any video editing on it so I figured for
what I do mostly managing the site
emails YouTube videos general computing
the new Mac will be fine but to hedge my
bet I paid the extra money and I
upgraded I got the faster processor X
RAM more storage I got the fastest one
Apple makes and watching YouTube videos
while editing a Word document
slows the thing down what I if I can do
that on my iPad but my computer slows
down I'm spinning I'm so mad I don't
care if it's got mobile a more it's got
an a 9 or where who made the stupid chip
if I can't do something on it why does
it exist if you wanted to be a piece of
art let me hang the damn thing on the
wall but don't sell me
apples and then give me oranges oh you
like that I like that that's what I did
in fact the things gotten so slow over
the months up and using it I think about
replacing it at home with the surface
pro 4 which is then light and I know I
can watch a YouTube video while editing
a Word document that's my thought on it
I don't I don't get it Apple you had
such a clear path you redefine the
mobile industry you had the best
designed hardware the best design the
laptops tablets that were second to none
and then everything kind of fell off
Android caught up in a tablet apartment
lanova was putting out crazy awesome
designs for their laptops they flip
around I don't know what you're thinking
you're putting charge on the bottom of
things you're not putting your latest
acknowledging your products make your
products that are just slow find your
way back home Apple this guy's going to
be pissed and a little upset and I just
wish you'd do a little better job with
it here's Johnny
