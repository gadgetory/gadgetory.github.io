John Retton different TechnoBuffalo here
it's an unboxing of the late 2012
27-inch iMac
I'm very excited take a look at these
guys I've had a chance to see the 21
I've never seen the 27 yet in person
this model is optioned a little bit so
it's not stock it's a 3.4 gigahertz quad
core i7 model it's got a 3 terabyte
fusion drive in there
I ordered it with only 8 gigabytes of
RAM and I ordered 32 from Amazon these
are the coarse air vengeance I was about
160 bucks versus the $600 at Amazon are
that Apple rather sells it for so save
quite a bit of money that way let's go
ahead and dig in we'll use our
TechnoBuffalo unboxing knife and we will
cut the plastic boom plus it has been
cut and looks like the boxes aren't the
only thing that got a little bit of an
upgrade with the new iMac I think this
just opens straight up and falls right
down hopefully the computers not gonna
come with it at least in theory got
Chinese guy around I'm gonna pull the
thing straight out let's go ahead and
see we got the top this is going to be
your keyboard and mouse come standard
the Apple wireless keyboard and the
Magic Mouse so got those those guys off
to the side see what else we're gonna
have in here pull off a top saira phone
apple still never managed to get away
from shipping stuff with styrofoam
despites how environmental they are the
other
they're never elegant with me unboxing
I'll tell you how much I've got it freed
from its styrofoam she'll let me go
ahead and pull this up off to the side
and I'll come back in just a second all
right so we got all that unwieldy
styrofoam and cardboard box out of the
way here is the 27-inch iMac go ahead
and take it out of its a cloth paper
leaving only time I'll probably ever see
the screen without fingerprints on it
pull offs off for the grand unveiling
boom there is the 27-inch iMac never
seen this guy from the side it is quite
thin right there it does taper off to
the back that's a bit deceptive but it's
definitely on the thinner side so coming
around to the back you can see quite a
array of ports here down here we've got
audio in we've got a SDXC card slot we
got four USB 3.0 ports two thunderbolts
and of course your Gigabit Ethernet for
all your web browsing needs what you
can't see though is back here right
above the power there's a slot to
replace in your ramp very easy to do
this guy off to the side of course will
be doing a ton of hands-on with this
giving you guys full rundown how it
performs gaming wise editing
