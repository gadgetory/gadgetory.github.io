from TechnoBuffalo and today is a big
day because Google has finally launched
a low on the very last day of summer so
they kept their promise of a summer
release so let's go ahead and take a
look at what's up with a low so I
already signed up and you do so with
your phone number which asks you when
you first open up the app as you can see
I already have a couple conversations
going on the first thing I want to go
over is the Google assistant so as you
can see I'm having a conversation here
with Google assistant about Conor
McGregor as I should be and it basically
interacts with you and you can basically
type in any sort of question you have
whether it be about Conor McGregor in
this case a sports game and then it also
as you can see gives you recommendations
automatically what about Floyd
Mayweather what about Ronda Rousey and
by clicking on it
Google assistant will come with a
response and it brings up her profile
automatically it's pretty good Google
did say this is sort of almost like a
beta version so don't take it as though
it's finished but it does really really
well and I like it I like having it
right there in my messaging app now
these sort of quick reply cards here as
mentioned are going to be a common theme
so now let's say I hop into a
conversation and let's say I'm talking
with Niven and then this is how we get a
confirmation here we're gonna have this
little check mark to shows its end and
then if it's a double check it'll be
once he's read it he has read it we got
a double check he responded and now I
get an auto reply option how are you we
can also go on hit this plus button and
we can use stickers I'm a huge fan of
these stickers apparently Google got
specific artists to make these and I'm a
real big fan of them they're very fun
they're very unique and they sort of add
a new touch of flavor anyway so this is
super addictive and super fun you can
also send photos you can also take
photos and then send those and this is
another cool little feature you can
actually go ahead and draw on them so
you can scribble on them do whatever you
want and then
send and they become a part of the
conversation so as you can see it's all
very fluid and it works really well it's
very fast one of the last things is
let's say you want to make an emphatic
message you can type something press and
hold the send button and then depending
on how far up or down you scroll that is
how big or small
that's ooh couldn't said it better
myself and as you can see we got a quick
little preview right there when we got a
response it actually also allows for
auto replies in the notifications so
awesome stuff and standard stuff here
from other messaging apps you can do a
voice recording by pressing and holding
and then slide to cancel it and the very
last feature is encryption google talk
to that intent to encryption that has
not made it to a low however antenna
encryption has made it in incognito mode
so I have an incognito conversation here
with Niven as well we talked a lot this
is for the inappropriate things and what
we have here as you can see at the top
right is a timer so the conversation the
chat will expire in our case after five
seconds the internet off it will
instantly disappear or you can do one
day or one week so if we leave it to
five seconds you can see my messages
already just disappeared he said what's
going on and then five seconds no what
happened to John let's find out and as
you can see the messages disappeared so
that works pretty well it's cool to have
the end and encryption here Google did
say that they're not going to be doing
end-to-end encryption into all the
normal messaging because they want to be
able to acquire data so Google assistant
can be better fitted for your needs and
that's pretty much a low the issues with
a low that I'm already realizing is when
you're chatting with people who are not
on a low it sends as a different number
like a four or five to the number not
your actual phone number and it gets
really weird doesn't really work as a
good SMS app unless the other person is
using a low as far as we can see now
anyways
so that's pretty much it for this video
guys let me know your thing in the
comments down below are you a fan of a
low are you gonna go ahead and give this
a shot I think there are some good
things I think there's some things that
are making to make adoption kind of hard
moving into the future thanks so much
