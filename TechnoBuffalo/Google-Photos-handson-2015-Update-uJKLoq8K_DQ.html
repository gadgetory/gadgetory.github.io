Sangin from the TechnoBuffalo and today
we're going to be checking out the new
Photos app from Google the company
finally spun off its photo service from
Google Plus this week and it promises to
be the only photo and video storage
locker you need the great thing is that
it's cross-platform so you can get it on
iOS Android and even on the web today
we'll take a closer look at what the
Photos app is and how it works when you
first launch the app photos will ask you
whether you want to backup and sync your
photos and videos in high quality or
original there's an upside and downside
to both of these options so make sure
you choose wisely the upside of choosing
high quality is that you can save as
many photos or videos as you want since
the service offers free unlimited
storage the downside to that is you can
only upload photos up to 16 megapixels
and 1080p videos which means if you're
uploading a 22 megapixel file Google
will have to compress the photo down to
a 16 megapixel photo in order to
properly back it up in the cloud the
upside to choosing original is that you
can upload any photo or video in its
original state without compressing its
quality the downside to that is storage
is limited Google gives you 15 gigabytes
out of the gate but that should fill up
fast if you're a serious photographer
the interface of photos is pretty slick
and it's obviously designed with mobile
in mind which makes a lot of sense since
most of us take photos on our phone it's
easy to navigate through your photos
since everything is organized by date
and is in this nice camera roll like
list you can see your photos in three
different views either by using pinch to
zoom gesture or just choosing the view
you want
there's comfortable which displays
photos in a larger grid compact which
organizes photos in a smaller thumbnail
and month which organizes photos by
month I personally like the compact view
which shows smaller thumbnails so I can
see more of my photos when you do choose
the view you like you can easily scroll
through it and there's also a search
icon which is probably one of the
services coolest features for example if
I type in sky in a search field it'll
show me photos that I took of the sky it
doesn't matter whether you have
geo-tagging enabled or disabled or even
if you have pictures labeled photos will
still figure out what you search for
like magic it's kind of scary but pretty
amazing at the same time now another
cool thing we notice is that it can also
recognize faces and it works really
really well we didn't have to tag anyone
it will analyze the photos and figure
out what photos that person is in like
we said earlier kind of scary but pretty
amazing there's also just news
a feature which is designed to
automatically create animated gifs
collages and highlights without you
having to do anything for example photos
that you took in batches will turn into
animated gifs when the assistant feature
in Google photos creates something it'll
send you a notification to your device
but you can always turn those
notifications off if you'd like you also
be able to make your own collage story
or Jif by heading over to collections
and pressing the plus button after that
you can quickly copy the link and share
it to your friends whether they have
Google photos installed or not all of
this Auto grouping is for your eyes only
and won't be available for anyone else
to see and if you want to turn the
grouping features off you can along with
the assistant features over all the new
Google Photos app is amazing so far the
UI looks great it's simplistic and
offers a ton of cool features the search
function location and face recognition
feature is super freaky but really neat
at the same time and the ability to
access and backup from multiple devices
is an awesome feature as well if you
guys have been picked up the Google
Photos yet it's available now from the
Apple App Store and Google Play Store
for free so make sure to check it out
and let us know what you guys think
anyways thank you guys so much for
watching and if you guys enjoyed this
video make sure to give it a thumbs up
and we will see you guys in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
