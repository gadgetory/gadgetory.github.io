to you by Forza Motorsport 5 only on
xbox one coming November 22nd what's up
everyone welcome back to episode of
renter's rants i am your host jon
rettinger last week i got a little upset
i might of using four letter words but
this week i want to give you some advice
on something that's going on in the
world of technology those pictures you
send everything you do online lives on
whether you wanted to or not I'm
thinking about sending sexy pictures
listen up so I'm sitting here in the
tech world at the ripe old age of 33 ty
realize is probably older than most you
guys watching this video so I'm gonna
put on my grandpa glasses I'm gonna dye
my hair gray wanted to sit by the
fireplace and let's have a talk I've got
a friend who went to apply for a job and
it was extremely qualified for the
position and his employer asked him for
his facebook password which was very
very very uncomfortable and awkward and
you can discuss what not it's right or
wrong it's a whole other discussion but
he gave them to them and they went
through his facebook photos and they
found pictures from several years ago
that might be deemed inappropriate and
he did not get the job they didn't right
come out and say because of those
facebook photos but one good reason they
at least played a part in why he didn't
get that job and I'm thinking about all
the talk about snapchat turning down a
ridiculous amount of money I'm thinking
about what you guys use snapchat for so
let's have a talk about what you're
gonna do with your phone technology is
everywhere I am probably part of the
last generation remembers not growing up
with the internet it wasn't all that
long I distinctly remember getting AOL
and product you for the first time and
getting dial-up internet so i didn't
have sort of these issues and then have
the technology available when I was you
know 12 13 14 15 and I'm up I didn't get
my first cell phone i think until I was
about 16 years old even then it was
giant Nokia and only accessory it had
was a vibrating battery so you know
somebody was calling you that's right if
won't you from to vibrate you had to buy
a second battery that's a whole other
story so before you guys are thinking
about sending sexy pictures using
snapchat doing anything else or posting
a picture of you and your friends online
maybe
a few too many drinks think about it
before you pose it because that stuff is
going to live on forever in if you
delete the picture someone probably at
that right click and hit save as it has
on the desktop do not do it it's not fun
if you let's say think that your
boyfriend when you're in high school of
a year you're going to be together
forever and you just love him you want
to show how much you love him by sending
him a perhaps a picture just know that
you're not gonna be together forever
probably and probably going to show the
picture to other people and you're going
to be mortified that goes vice versa if
you're new and you want to send a in a
probably picture to your gal just don't
do it just think about it do not do it
don't it's going to live on well after
you this is sort of the first you know
generation of kids it's growing up now
that has access to this full time and
what's going to happen it's not yet been
known as far as whether or not employer
you look at those pictures whether or
not those pictures are get to be public
or not Facebook you sharing your
passwords or whatever it just never
worked it to just just don't do it that
sort of my old man rants for the day
maybe it wasn't what you wanted to see
your to hear but it's good advice and
you should consider taking it let me
stop for a minute to thank our friends
and sponsors at Forza Motorsport 5 only
on xbox one coming November 20 seconds
if you're like me you love video games
that I'm super excited about the next
generation of consoles because of the
power and the graphics look incredible
i'm also a big car guy and the idea of
seeing these gorgeous cars and
next-generation graphics make me drool
in the face they haven't seen what forza
motorsport 5 looks like you have not
seen the next-gen console looks like
they look freaking gorgeous the cars
look awesome and as they would if you
were staring at them in real life you
can see really finite details like
stitch leather the rims are shining back
at you you can see the beautifully
polished paint it just looks absolutely
awesome and beautiful in the car just
rendered well I'm like you're in a
showroom if you're ready to race Forza
