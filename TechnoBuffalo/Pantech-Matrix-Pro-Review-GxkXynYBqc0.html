for you of the pantech matrix Pro 4/18
Wireless if you want to pick one of
these up it'll cost you 179 dollars
after rebates on a new two-year contract
from either a TN t--'s online store or
your local shop so let me talk a little
bit about the device you guys saw the
comparisons that I did when I compared
it to the iPhone as far as doing general
features like text messaging adding
contacts and calendar items so first let
me start with my opinion on windows
mobile 6.1 standard meaning non
touchscreen and if you'd like to see
those features in action be sure to
check out that previous video so let me
give you some reference to where I was
coming from I had used a Samsung
blackjack it was running Windows 6.0
standard not 6.1 like this device and I
was really very unhappy with it when I
used it it took an extra three or four
steps to do anything the you I was very
unintuitive and it really was not the
stablest of phones either so I was very
skeptical when I came to try the pantech
matrix Pro and I have to say I actually
came away very impressed with what
Microsoft has done with windows mobile
6.1 the sliding panel interface that
they implemented you can see right there
makes navigating much easier you don't
have to go to the Start menu go to
calendar hit menu add new items you can
really just do a nice and easily write
here change your ringtone your
background your task manager you know it
makes it actually relatively intuitive
and for a Microsoft operating system I
was relatively impressed when time I had
using it I didn't experience any crashes
which also was very unlike the Samsung
blackjack that I had definitely got to
give my hats off a little bit to
Microsoft for putting it or not bring
system s we're little be stable this
time around and I'm curious what they'll
do with windows mobile 6.5 standard when
the back comes out so let's get back to
this device let me show you a little bit
about it it is a little bit on the thick
side some of you guys are come device
comparison here with a few other ones
you may be familiar with so here is the
iPhone you can see it's difficult ly
thicker and here are a few other windows
mobile devices here is the AT&amp;amp;T fuse
that I come
paired the iPhone with and a few videos
back there's a thickness comparison
there and see just about the same and
this is a touchscreen device
here's another Windows Mobile
touchscreen device the Samsung epics
these are all current devices and AT&amp;amp;T
is line up by the way you can see it's
markedly thicker now a lot of the heft
from the pantech matrix comes from this
dual slider it's actually very cool so
slide it out you've got your standard
keypad right there nice and easy
although I do need to mention that the
keypad is very flush with the phone and
there's no ridges between the numbers or
the aren't in your ridges between the
numbers so it's gonna make dialing
without looking very difficult so keep
that in mind well it does have a nice
look to it it's not necessarily so
practical let's slide that down and if
you slide it up you get a full QWERTY
keyboard so while we're on the QWERTY
keyboard let me talk about it here it is
a straight three row keys and it
actually does have some nice key press
to it next click feel and when you push
it it will take a little bit to get used
to the keys because it's very spread out
but after a day or two really Billy
typing without any difficulty notice
that the hotkeys to are on far left and
the far right something to keep in mind
and it does have the number keys inlaid
in there so you have to hit the function
key and type on one thing I didn't like
about the device though and something
that relies heavily on screen rotation
what's a screen rotation speed let me
show you guys what I mean by that turn
it back on there so when I slide a
keyboard out look how long it takes for
the screen to rotate takes a little bit
of time I thought that should be much
quicker than that that wasn't something
I was terribly happy with reception was
actually got very good reception was
able to hold on to really 5 bars most
places I was at so that was always nice
although right now in my apartment
generally where I get three or four or
five bars I was only getting two so that
was a little bit disappointing so it's a
phone so it's got to make good calls and
I'm happy to report the call quality
actually like most phones I've tested
recently coca-cola tea has been
fantastic really wasn't any white noise
or hissing on my end and on the other
end its caller feel or that it sounded
nice and clear also testing it with a
few
two headsets worked great no problem in
pairing was a breeze its navigation on
the phone is a little bit interesting -
it looks like a scroll wheel but it's
not actually just a straight deep head
with a button in the middle and you've
got your HOME key and your back button
and your sending end button it's kind of
glow underneath there
so overall guys actually was very happy
with the phone it was very usable I felt
it was very possible I know some
complaints are the heft but for a device
that gets a dual slide you're gonna have
to sacrifice slimness River
functionality so that's something that
comes along with the territory so if I
have to rape this phone kind of at a
scale from one to five I gotta give it a
very very very solid three-and-a-half to
four let's say 3.75 as the rating if I
can do that
it does chip with Pocket Internet
Explorer which is a an atrocious browser
so if you do want to get the Pentek
matrix Pro download upper mini or sky
fire they have both versions for the non
touchscreen 6.1 standard and that'll
make your browsing experience much
better this is a full-featured smart
phone you can do your calendar your
email hookup with Microsoft Exchange you
can go on the internet like I just
mentioned you really can't do everything
on this phone but it's keep in mind that
it is a non touchscreen device so anyway
guys hope you enjoyed if you're looking
for something like this I I can
recommend the pantech matrix Pro I think
AT&amp;amp;T and pantech did a very nice job
with the design I think Microsoft
actually is improving their operating
system
I was very down on Windows Mobile in the
past maybe I'm trying to sway a little
bit on that certainly won't take me away
from my iPhone but if you're a Windows
guy or gal and you want to have
something that'll sync up and compare
nice and easy this is a good option for
