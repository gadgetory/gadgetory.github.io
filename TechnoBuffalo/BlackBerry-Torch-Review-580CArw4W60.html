technobuffalo here is a full review for
you of the AT&amp;amp;T touchscreen qwerty
hybrid blackberry torch I begin all my
phone reviews talking about call quality
if the phone doesn't make good phone
calls it's not going to be much use to
you doesn't matter how good email or web
browsing is going to be phone calls me
our paramount to the success of the
device on a lot of other 18t films I've
texts really been no call quality issues
I've been crystal clear no white noise
or teeny sound on either end the
blackberry torch did have a bit of
popping cracking and there was
definitely some tinny sounds on mine and
the colors other side of it something to
keep in mind on the ink call volume
while definitely loud is not as loud as
other phones are tested in the past so
if you're a bit hard of hearing or you
like just loud and calls you're
definitely going to want to try this out
before you pick it up a speakerphone
offer was definitely quite loud and
really usable in the car on the flip
side of the coin the reception this
thing pulls it is fantastic on other
devices other AT&amp;amp;T devices where I
usually got maybe two bars and 3g those
fringe service areas this was pulling in
almost four or five bars of 3g so if
you're in sort of an outskirt 3g area
it's definitely gonna be a phone or
gonna want to check out it's going to
get probably the best reception of any
AT&amp;amp;T phone out there right now so let's
jump into the review of the phone I'm
not going to go over every feature of OS
6 which is what the blackberry torch is
running I've did a whole video star
recapping all those features let's talk
about what's most important and this is
a blackberry certainly it has a touch
screen but makes a blackberry blackberry
is this guy the full slide out keyboard
very reminiscent of what we seen on the
bold devices and this is a fantastic
typing experience I used to be a pretty
dedicated blackberry user and I
forgotten how much I really like having
a full qwerty keyboard this is
definitely one of the best if you've
used a bold new path and definitely be
familiar there's not as much a throw on
the keys as there aren't some other
device that's because it's a slider and
the keyboards got to be a bit there to
slide in and out however it is very good
and works really really really well and
I got used to a very quick
myself actually missing a corded
keyboard now that's not the only way to
input text here on the blackberry you
have an on-screen keyboard as well which
works pretty decently and black gray is
definitely updated the autocorrect sure
as well it's not something nice to see
if you a lot of texting or emailing some
of the features that I really like about
the torch is the built-in integration
with social media so there's now you can
see I've got a built-in twitter app
facebook myspace already built into the
device knows across here is notification
so about 107 unread emails one voicemail
that little orange icon at social media
and RSS feeds and such and then Facebook
so you can pull in all of this
notification information you go in tap
that top part I've got some personal
stuff in there so I'm not going to show
it but you get sort of a full list of
all notifications actually i'll just
block out the bottom and i'll show you
here you can see it's sort of all comes
up very nice then you can see pretty
easily everything that you have going on
tap it to get rid of it I really just
worked perfectly and as a great wave
notifications I thought that REM really
needed their notification system other
than a blinking LED or envelope that
they had in previous devices this works
very well certainly on par with the
android tab be pulled down from the top
or notifications window great way to
switch profiles as well makes it nice
and easy go ahead and tap that select
what you'd like and you get right to
your wireless settings by tapping the
top part choose your network Wi-Fi
Bluetooth all the rest of that stuff are
all pretty handy now this phone is not
without its quirks being a
first-generation os6 device things don't
always work very well you can resize
this here with notifications of what it
shows oftentimes well those resizing on
ahead and freeze on me and would just go
away and I couldn't see any icons
actually have to pull the batter and
restart the device now certainly with a
software update I soon this will all be
fixed but it is worthwhile I'm noting
that if you are going to use this device
you're going to run into a bit of bugs
nothing that's going to really hinder
your overall usage something to be
prepared for I'm thinking about the
notifications here this is really what
makes os6 quite nice are the icons
rather that you can customize what you
like so you can view all favorites you
can set their favorites if like media
you can view a media on here we'll talk
about media in just a min
downloads is there certainly a new
blackberry application store here so you
can download sort of new applications
something to keep in mind though a lot
of the applications that are found on
the blackberry app world don't work
again with OS 6 of things that you're
used to using a friends I've got google
maps right here doesn't work very well
so you may run into a problem of broken
apps with OS six sort of as the
manufacturers and developers work to
update their code something to keep in
mind and again you can be sized anyway
like if you want to show two rows or one
row remember how you last at it you can
show all of them or show none and have
it just sort of hide it you can pull it
up and show whatever you'd like I like
to I Eva says my daily driver for a
little over a week and I really enjoyed
it I found two rows of icons with the
all was really the best way to go for me
email is very typical blackberry the
menu system is really what you'd expect
things have just been redone a bit for
touch so it go into options you can see
now the menu system isn't so listy you
can now actually use your finger and tap
what you'd like now if you're not used
to using a touchscreen to blackberry you
never have to use a touch screen at all
there is a five-way touchpad here so you
can go up down left right and select it
in to do all your navigation but you'll
see that things are pretty different go
ahead and go to display things are now
grouped go ahead and select whatever you
like and subs larger and finger friendly
so let's jump into the browser a little
bit that's something that's really
important to mobile phone users
something that RIM was really really
really deficient in they had an awful
web browsing experience we've actually
bought a company that makes a
webkit-based browsers and web kit the
same sort of let's say underpinnings
that Apple using the iphone and that
Google uses an Android so a really
really solid web experience and it's
about what you'd expect here it works
very well a multi touch enabled you get
pinch and zoom it actually web page
render times are quicker on the
blackberry and they are on an iphone for
example however the processor can always
keep up with the render speed of the
browser so you get a bit of a slower
experience that's preeminent of the
torch overall it's limited by the
hardware its processor clocked at 600
about 24 megahertz now processor speed
doesn't always mean everything black
braid is a really nice job at memory
management so using things overall using
email text messaging is going to be very
quick and zippy we really noticed as
slow of the slowness of the process
there's going to be in the web browsing
when it comes to viewing media as well
can definitely be a bit choppy something
to keep in mind so go ahead and exit out
of here and there is also no support for
html5 or flash I'm not really going to
be able to view any embedded media or
any really embedded content anyway at
least as of yet on the blackberry torch
I'm going to jump over to meet you here
I mentioned that this is touchscreen
enable so you can't pinch and zoom your
way around photos pinch and zoom it's
got its own built-in YouTube player
which really just launches a YouTube
mobile in the web browser that's about
all it is it works well it's not the
best of screen resolutions not
necessarily so high but it does work
very well for viewing web pages and
connect pictures on the back speaking of
pictures you have a 5 megapixel camera
which does have a bit of auto focus in
it and LED flash first time room is
really show them that they're putting
their force behind a decent camera and
it's the best blackberry camera that
I've seen certainly not gonna take any
Ansel Adams s pictures with this we just
want to snap a few shots of you and your
friends out of the club it's going to
get the job done certainly wouldn't
print them out and make a poster size
but for quick phone snapshots it does
work one problem i did have with the
device often times i had a hard time
sliding it up without selecting anything
there isn't really a Ledge to sly yet to
actually touch the screen to slide it up
sometimes I would select applications or
if I slid it up by the bottom I'd
selecting put the trackpad I've got to
be a bit difficult sometimes something
to keep in mind as well when you're
considering the torch long as you can
use the sides and slide it up you have
to find a way the best work for you but
sometimes I find myself inadvertently
launching application something to bear
in mind so overall I was actually very
happy with the torch I think it's
definitely the best a blackberry
currently on the market I've gone on the
record and say I wasn't the biggest fan
of storm devices this does not have the
sure press keyboard doesn't click it's a
very traditional capacitive touchscreen
you touch it there's no
depressing of the screen at all just
like you find on Android palm pre or an
iPhone it's for a similar experience and
it does work very well I think rim is
definitely on the right track here with
Oh at six and the torch I wish you had a
bit of a faster processor and I wish
there was support for at least html5
content I think we sort of saw those two
things the web browsing would be a much
better experience and it's definitely
being better around a device overall
though I was very very happy with there
was definitely a few shortcomings on a
one-to-five scale I give it a very very
very solid three and three-quarter stars
for emails is going to do one of the
best email experiences you're going to
get because it's a black bear and it
just works very well coming from an
iphone I really appreciate the email
management that you can do on a
blackberry it really shows that
efficient Apple's email client is one
other last bit of gripe that I had i use
google calendars and contacts for
sinking back and forth and it wasn't
really a native way to sync here
actually had a download google sync and
then sync my contacts and sync my
calendar that way so it's a bit of
another step to go but it will sink of
all your google stuff that's what you
use because like to hear what you think
about the torch do you like it not like
it as of right now it's going to set you
back one hundred ninety nine dollars on
eighteenth you the two-year contract my
time you watch this video very very very
well may be cheaper so for exclusive
