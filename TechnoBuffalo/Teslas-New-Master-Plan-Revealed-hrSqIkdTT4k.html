revealed phase 2 of Tesla's master plan
if you were scratching your head saying
I didn't know they had a plan 1 you were
not alone it's been around for actually
about 10 years and lives on Tesla's
website but here's what plan 1 was step
1 build a super expensive low volume
electric car they did that with the
Roadster step 2 is using proceeds from
the roadster to build a more affordable
family sale car did that with the Model
S and the third step in Tesla's phase 1
master plan was to build a way more
affordable mass transit car for everyone
at Tesla is doing that with the model 3
so now it is time for phase 2 and if you
don't know Tesla's goal has always been
promote sustainable fuel not necessarily
to always make money and people buy
their own Tesla's that's why they
release all their patents publicly so
the goal with phase 2 is to address all
the different modes of terrestrial
transportation as Eli must put it in a
holy crap did they do it so here's what
to expect from Tesla's phase 2 master
plans first the Solar City merger makes
a lot more sense
Elon wants beautiful solar roofs on all
houses uma be connected to Tesla battery
packs on the car side that's where
things got interesting not surprisingly
more body styles based on the model 3
architecture so we'll see a crossover
SUV and we'll see a new type of pickup
truck don't know what that means but
pickup truck powered by electricity
coming soon Elon then went on to address
other modes of mass transportation
things like buses there will be a Tesla
bus and it will also be a test about big
rig both of which are expected to make
their debut sometime next year leasing
design forum hit the road sometime in
the next three to four years and speak
in the next three to four years that is
when Elon Musk claims cars will be fully
autonomous meeting you can just go to
sleep in the back and Tesla's got some
plans for full autonomy essentially if
you want a car to come pick you up you
open up a test lap and one of Tesla's
own fleet of cars will just drive up
pick you up take you where you want to
go if you are a Tesla or do you want to
make some money from your car you can
actually let your car join that pool so
while you're at work your car can just
be its own uber pick people up and come
back
and you can make some money from it I
don't know how I personally feel about
safe and someone else sitting in my car
and how they would treat it but it's an
option to make some money now from your
automobile elong playing people only
driving their card 10 to 12 percent of
the time and the rest of it just kind of
sitting and doing nothing so a ton of
Tesla news as a huge fan of electric
transport as a huge fan of Tesla in
general I am super excited what do you
guys think about phase 2 of you
interested in any of this it's
fascinating to see you know if you're
not a fan of Tesla or a fan of musk at
this sort of fan of musk
fed of my own mosque to start to see it
electric transport gain more and more
footing is just really cool to sort of
be a part of that kind of revolution
alright guys let me know in the comments
down below mash the thumbs up but we
appreciate it
John renders TechnoBuffalo the guys the
next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
