technobuffalo it's been a while since I
just SAT here and talked about something
else on my mind a world to tech I want
to talk about sony's latest IFA
announcement not the z5 itself or even
the z5 compact for the 4k rocking z5
premium our own toddy dalton was in
Berlin for its announcement and we did
her hands on video of it I went through
and read the comments on it and I was
surprised at the amount of negativity
focused toward z5 premium so I want to
talk about it talk about a 4k screen
other than I think it's worthwhile and
see if maybe that's going to be the
commonplace thing for us to stare at
over the next few years so first if
you've been living under a tech rock uh
maybe haven't been up to date last week
Sony announced a z5 premium and what
that's going to be it's their flagship
new z5 with a 5.5 inch screen but it's
got a 4k screen that's 2160 by 3844 just
a ridiculous 801 PPI say you're going to
ask it's got a 3430 milliamp hour
battery there's been a ton of negativity
towards the 4k screen mostly variances
of people saying why do we need that
waste time adios battery life this one's
the last for 14 min 24 thighs things
along those lines that a few comments
about all of that certainly pushing more
pixels we're gonna take more battery
life that is very very true I don't know
if for kitchens are necessary certainly
they're not necessary conceal use a
screen with a low resolution looking at
a phone to 2k screen I'll talk to us
that much of difference between a good
1080 screen and to an average to pay
screen if you look at the screen on
let's say the g4 for example next to a
really good 1080p screen on just that
big of a difference I think do look a
little bit crisper where I think before
kick screen could be nice as far as
displaying a lot more content but if it
cuts on your phone generally it's a web
page or something but it's a mobile
version and things are sort of shrunk
down for it on a 4k screen you can
almost get a desktop view of what you're
looking at grants is probably a super
tiny so imagine it a little bit of
upscaling you can probably make things
look absolutely gorgeous crisp and see a
lot of content on one screen so I'm not
of the school that thinks 4k is
necessary at all hell I barely even
think two kazes a Serie all on the
screen but I am saying and I encourage
you to do the same thing is don't judge
it until you
see it maybe there's a reason for it
maybe it's going to make something look
incredible we never thought when you did
before the other caveat obviously is
battery life the 30 for 30 pack sony
says and we get through a whole day i
will certainly be the judge of that and
get one in but its fastest green
technology is advancing as fast
processes are advancing we have not seen
much advancements in the way of battery
technology sure we've seen things like
battery packs pickups be molded
shape-wise a little bit we haven't seen
sort of a new battery technology itself
it's still mostly just lithium-ion cells
for for almost everything which you
lived in the fortunate love to see you
do advancements in battery technology
things like lithium-air they're making
their way into electric cars soon we're
moving away from lithium all together I
love to see something that can serve
push battery technology forward so we're
not limited by the juice and the phone
or the tablet buy more of what we can
actually do with the product i'm excited
to get to that point I didn't think we
had to have a first device that pushed
the boundaries for a 4k screen now
certainly I don't think so many things
does fun everybody's going to buy but
it's a flagship and it's sort of Sony
statement of saying listen we can do
this we're a forward-thinking tech
company you should think about us will
you buy your next phone it's like a halo
car how do you for example no Zapata
sell a lot of our eights but Artie's can
get people into delish it look at people
to come look at and while they're there
it may pick up an a4 or consider in a
six I think Sony is hoping that you look
at the z5 premium go wow that's
incredible the z5 doesn't perfect for me
or z5 compact so right device for me
it's all part of Sony trying to change I
think the mindset of how people perceive
their mobile division I think it's a
really nice step in that direction i
will say that naming a premium was a
really bad decision for my estimation
makes other devices see not premium and
if you don't want to call it applause
something that's fine but called
something different certainly by calling
one premium implies the others are not
they were trying to sell a lot of phones
applying your flagship device is not
premium is is a tough pill to swallow
but want to just to talk to you guys
about it what do you think about a 4k
screen we wait till you see it before
you can judge it or if you already just
judge it and found at guilty I'll do
your thoughts not leave in the comments
down below be civil to each other love
to hear what you guys have to say until
next time i'm jon rettinger
