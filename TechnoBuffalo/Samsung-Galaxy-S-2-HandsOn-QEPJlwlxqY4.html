Spanish or Korean for that matter I have
no idea it doesn't matter I'm known from
technobuffalo calm and i'm here at the
samsung unpacked 2011 event in barcelona
spain that I perform a world congress
starts under here with the galaxy s2 one
of two products announced tonight the
other one being the galaxy tab 10 dot 1
tablet and you can check out the other
video that I did to see that in action
but this is the new generation of the
galaxy s smartphone it's dual core it's
got a 4.3 super amoled plus display
nothing like more acronyms and more
add-ons to the name of technology to
confuse her if it I mean get rid of
excited put the phone it feels really
nice they have this tagline more with
less and this one is really lightweight
sometimes Samsung gets a bad rap for
making products that feel kind of cheap
and commodity like but in this case the
lightweight is awesome the phone's
pretty hot to the touch right now
actually it's been cranking out you know
all evening people people demoing it
filming it and photo in it and
everything so we'll have to see when
they actually release the dice is how
they run enough heats of problems
definitely feels warm but super thin
8.49 millimeters is got an 8 megapixel
camera on the back with LED flash and
Full 1080p video recording headphone
jack on top on one spine the less fine
you've got a rocker switch on the other
spine you've got a power switch on the
bottom you've got a I'm not going to
make the same joke I made in the tab
video about the device that prevents me
from walking
but that's what it is I don't think
there's anything on the bottom on the
front you've only got three buttons now
it's funny android phones you stuff for
now it looks like three I don't know
it's a fragmentation of the buttons but
you've got your menus button you got a
back button and then you've got a home
button and you know the interesting
thing here you've also got a
front-facing camera 2-megapixel front
camera for video chat and all that kind
of stuff the interesting thing here is
the the work that Samsung just keeps
putting in to their UX layer the user
experience that differentiates them from
other Samsung devices I have long not
been a fan of samsung touchwiz although
samsung touch was 30 I thought you know
this is this is getting better bordado
looks really nice day they've really
done a lot of work to it you know just
the icons and then the fonts look a
little smoother just a little a little
more attractive to look at the
customization of you know these
different widgets on the home screen or
your multiple home screen so it's really
nice it's smooth it's easy to you know
and a nice combination of the customers
customizability of Android if you will
with a little bit more you know
attention to detail and and look and
feel then you get out of stock Android
by the way this phone runs Android 23
gingerbread with obviously the touch
with score on top there now for hubs on
the new TouchWiz experience social hub
Music Hub readers home in gaming hub and
social you know they are what you think
they are or what you think they are from
the names Social Hub is all your
messages your friends your feeds all
that kind of stuff gaming hub is a
gaming portal music hubs and online
music store readers have is an e-book
reader online the online store for books
and magazines and all that kind of
business and you know they went over
this in detail in the presentation
tonight which was typical Samsung high
production value for sure
and you know it really looks like there
are a lot of lot of offerings are a lot
of work they put into it but as I as
somebody I was talking to you know kind
of joked let's see if the US carrier
just muck it all up and say to Samsung
hey take this awesome thing you did and
make it worse with our customer look
we're so we'll see you know this is
hopefully not and if you're from the
non-us part of the world like you know
here in Spain for instance you may not
have that issue you may get the devices
more in there you know as the artist
envisioned them so to speak but
hopefully in the US will get the galaxy
s2 and it's not adulterated form or
close to it I believe the device that
actually they did not say anything about
when it will be available obviously no
pricing nothing like that you've also
got hspa+ 21 Meg's down 5.7 up 5
gigahertz Wi-Fi like we said the dual
core application processor the battery
is 1650 milliamp hour samsung went into
detail about why super amoled plus is
better than devices like IPS based
devices like the Apple Retina display
and how it's not all about pixel size
and pixel density but it's also about
refresh rate dammit and color saturation
all that kind of thing I'm not going to
get into that now because I just be
repeating what they said but I can tell
you that you know and it's a powerful
phone it's lightweight it feels pretty
good in the hand
and from what I've seen so far it's
impressive and the screen the screen
looks great it pops for sure so trying
to get through this this trailer here
check out a little gaming action
loading loading it's probably a bad idea
maybe we'll get some separate video of
the game in their little thing on the
game pump right there anyway there you
go its first look samsung galaxy s2 you
know it's not a huh I can hear the
Android faithful crying foul let you
know we want stock Android and you know
I understand that point of view but for
me I'm very interested impressed on
first glance of what Samsung's done with
their software and it's cool because
they had good ideas but there is kind of
weirdly executed before hopefully when
this actually launches it'll stand up to
the first impression which is a nice one
for touch with Sporto anyway from
Barcelona at the samsung galaxy s2 and
galaxy tab 10 dot 1 launch event
otherwise known as samsung mobile
unpacked 2011 I'm known from
TechnoBuffalo much much more from
Barcelona all week technobuffalo calm</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
