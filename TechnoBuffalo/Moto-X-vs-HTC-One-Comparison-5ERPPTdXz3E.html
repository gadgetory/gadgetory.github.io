TechnoBuffalo there's each you see one
on the left and we've got the Moto X are
on the right just want to show you quick
comparison clearly this is taller than
the Moto X though the screen on this is
4.7 inches so you just getting into the
wider bezels here sorry the thinner
bezels sort of more of an edge to edge
screen on the X now Motorola's said that
they've actually increased the size of
the pixels by twenty-seven percent
versus most 13 megapixel camera phone
photos for better low-light camera shots
I've been able to test that really but
that's similar to what HTC did here with
the four hole true pixel where it may be
huge pixel size that you get better
low-light shots it's 10 megapixel by the
way on the Moto X move around the
devices you can see both have the
headphone jacks up probably both of that
sewer plant sort of a rounded back I'd
say though it's more prevalent on this
one and Motorola told us it did that and
then fill that space in with the battery
and it made that rounded back because it
found that in consumer testing that's
what people really liked me around
advised micro USB on the bottom just
like on the one you see the size
comparison here to think it's just
wanted to give you a quick look so you
can see how they stack up to each other
both are really easy to use with one
hand which I really like though the Moto
X is a little easier to be honest in
case it's Tigers the time of
