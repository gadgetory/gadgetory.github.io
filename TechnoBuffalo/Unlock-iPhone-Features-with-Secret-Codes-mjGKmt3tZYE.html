like an old friend they don't always
tell you everything I've got some iPhone
secrets they've yet to reveal to you
some of these iOS is added to the
operating system itself like call
blocking for example but something just
about entering a code just seems more
stealthy more James bonding James James
Bond bundage so let's say you're calling
somebody back but you don't want them to
see your number your iPhone can do that
dial star pound 31 pound then number you
want to dial and when you give a phone
call your number will show up like this
the number of balls and for your signal
strength is fine but sometimes you want
to know what your signal strength
actually is especially in a remote
location your phone can do that yes you
have to enter a new mode called field
test mode to do that go your dialer
enter star 3 0 0 1 pound 1 2 3 4 5 pound
and star that immediately hold the power
button once the power down screen shows
up hold the home button - you're back on
the home screen and boom looking upper
left-hand corner you'll see a number
that are range from negative 40 negative
140 to read that scale negative 40 is
the best signal strength and negative
140 is almost no signal helping around
negative 80 is usually pretty good what
if you want to find your imei sure you
go the old-school way and go into
settings and about but we're all about
doing something fast good your dialer
its star pound zero six pounds there's
your IMEI and if you're a postpaid
customer you want to check your bill
balance know how much you got it oh go
to dialer again star two to five pounds
there's your bill balance let's see you
want a little bit more about your phone
when you want to get more granular
things like calls SMS data etc and show
you whether or not they are enabled or
not star pound 43 pounds and you're on
your way and fluids you don't know what
pound is hashtag like an old person
contacts these are just six of many
codes built into your iPhone some of
these you guys might know about some of
them maybe not if you want to know a lot
more if you link down below and good
article on TechnoBuffalo comm got a ton
more codes for you so let me know which
ones you guys find useful if you've got
one that we didn't mention here leave in
the comments down below let's say you're
blocking your number to a friend and
let's say with said friend you want to
collaborate with that individual the
folks at Atlassian have you covered you
can track and manage tasks for any
project don't matter how complex it is
you can use JIRA for that if you want to
create content organize results and just
bring your team members up to speed and
lastly it has confluence on a message or
video chat
they got HipChat and if you want a
managed code in real time
you're building that next killer app

covered with bitbucket
