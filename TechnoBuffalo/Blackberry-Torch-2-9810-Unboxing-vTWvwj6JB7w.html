from TechnoBuffalo here at than unboxing
for you of the 4G blackberry torch 9810
there it is 98 10 let's go ahead and see
if this newest torch can illuminate its
way to 80 80 's line up but um Shh
all right so this guy is going to be
available on AT&amp;amp;T as an AT&amp;amp;T exclusive
in the US for 50 dollars on contract
August 21st so a pretty decent price 18
t is really trying to be aggressive with
this so 4G blackberry torch rethink
possible we got some package contents of
pictures and some specs we're going to
go over all this business anyway and
some of that serial number business all
right so this box is sealed which means
it's time for the obligatory big ol
knife senior stabby else tabary no don't
cut my finger off Express let's go ahead
and open this sucker up or at least try
to so there is tape here is knife the
two she'll meet and hopefully not my
finger somewhere in between all right so
let's try this again so if I can slide
that knife on in there and bam it is
sliced my finger is not and now it is
time to open the box
drumroll please hey blackberry torch to
rethink possible welcome to AT&amp;amp;T and
there it is looking very similar to the
prototype we leaked a little while ago
actually identical to that and pretty
similar to the original torch push it
off to the side for just a quick moment
let's see what else we're gonna get in
the box you're gonna get a plastic tray
yay underneath that plastic tray Quick
Start Guide connect me books ebooks
battery we're going to need that micro
USB charging cable little port that
plugs into your wall it's got a USB port
on it and the same stereo headphones
that we saw on the 9900 with microphone
and a little rim cleaning cloth no belt
holster though so I know our own
editor-in-chief Sean Ani likes to rock a
belt holster but not gonna happen with
this phone so push it all that business
off to the side let's run through the
specs of the torch too as i zoom the
camera come on closer let's get to know
each other pretty well alright so it has
a 3.2 inch screen which is being
covered by stickers I know you guys love
stickers especially when I leave them on
it's got a resolution of 480 480 by 640
it looks like I left a little bit of
sticker there sometimes I just don't
know my own strength
go ahead and pull that sucker off it's
got 8 gigs of internal storage HSPA+
connectivity that's why AT&amp;amp;T is calling
for G so it's going to give you 14 point
4 megabits per second down theoretically
on the back of this guy five megapixel
camera with autofocus and LED flash this
does have autofocus and 9900 the bold
does not it's running of course OS 7 on
a Snapdragon 1.2 gigahertz processor and
this battery is just about 1,300
milliamp hours so it's not a giant
battery in fact I believe it's the same
battery that was powering the torch one
so if you're a torch one user and you
want to save a battery or carry extra
one I can go ahead and do that let's go
ahead and pop the battery in let's do a
real quick boot up here go ahead and
peel off some more stickers or I can
just leave it on you know if you guys
don't mind try and get that off there ha
and let's see if they're going to
include a microSD card open the back it
easier to get off the original torch and
indeed it is slide that business off and
it looks like there is not a micro SD
card included it would live right there
SIM card pops right in there so I could
be stuck with the eight gigs unless you
have your own micro sd card so batteries
in go ahead and push the battery door
back on we'll go ahead and boot up we'll
do a real quick comparison here at the
original torch so I get the battery door
back on slide on battery door pardon the
look sometimes you freeze on camera come
here
battery door don't get pain in the butt
all right go on I'm not gonna enter this
part out because this is what happens
this is life folks this is like a
reality show
okay so let's putting on awesome and
it's going to focus even better so here
is the original torch look at that it
looks like they're cousins the white
model the silver
model this is also going to come in
white keyboards
look identical best way to tell the
difference here is actually to have to
feel the device the trackpad here feels
a little bit better not when you roll
your finger on it when you click it it's
got a bit more tactile feel to it
keyboards are exactly the same
dimensions here exactly the same and as
I mentioned I believe the battery is
exactly the same so let's go ahead and
pop the back of this off and check it
out it is exactly the same battery and I
believe that actually the battery doors
on the 9800 and then you tank even be
swapped so if you don't like this sort
of look you can swap this sucker right
on so I'm going to try and Barriss
myself live on camera again it's a
battery door and let's see if they are
interchangeable in case you want like a
punky brewster style phone I just showed
my age they're mixing and matching and
boom look at that it does work so people
can think you've got some Frankenstein
blackberry here alright we'll go ahead
and hit okay don't show me how I don't
have a SIM card continue and probably
get a video BlackBerry OS 7 here's where
your finger goes and you swipe things
and things pop up you pinch to zoom on
things get pinch to zoom again on things
can move things around their menus your
finger is a white circle your finger
still a white circle but it has buttons
I should stop singing and mention that
while these look like a passive buttons
there are actually physical buttons or
not separate buttons but they do push in
when you touch them so you know that now
video still playing blah blah blah your
fingers a circle great thank you
blackberry
here's your Quick Start Guide I'm going
to exit this look at that here's where
okay here is OS 7 on the torch actually
pretty fast when I use this on the
prototype it was very quick we now have
sort of the final production stuff to go
ahead and see what version of the OS
this is running check out Vice go ahead
and device info if I got to hold this up
I can't see from the camera
duh software updates where is it about
device virgins there we go
it's a shipping with version 7.0 points
261 so two six one with the shipping
with yay you guys have seen the
highlight of the features of OS 7 that
I've done on the bold 9900 you've got
boys search here which you can search
with your voice here's a new on-screen
keyboard you can see it's a keyboard
it's on screen and it rotates and
rotates pretty fast so 49 bucks is a
pretty good deal for a blackberry torch
one I really like the phone was
definitely a bit slow this one ups the
speed ups the RAM ups everything and you
get that HSPA+ connectivity and 50 bucks
is a pretty good deal so I am John Rhett
endure from TechnoBuffalo and this has
been a long unboxing of the blackberry
torch 9810 state 2 TechnoBuffalo for all
your BlackBerry news in case you guys
want to see just for fun what this looks
like next to 9900 there you go I'll
slide the sucker open and hey you can
see there two keyboards and this one's a
little bigger quick tour of the device
charging port blackberry buttons
microphone volume up and down
programmable hard key lock button and a
mute button and my bizarro back from the
torch one I've got on here so that's it
