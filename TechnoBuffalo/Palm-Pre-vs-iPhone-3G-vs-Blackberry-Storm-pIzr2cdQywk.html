browser comparison test of the Palm Pre
the iPhone 3G and the blackberry storm
browsing is a very important component
of all three devices let's compare the
speeds of each Wi-Fi has been turned off
on the iPhone and the Palm Pre not an
issue on the storm since it's not
equipped with it cache has been cleared
this is really ultimately going to be a
test of AT&amp;amp;T 3G network and Sprint and
Verizon 's EVDO Rev a networks
respectively so we're gonna load
pocketnow.com on each device and we can
gauge the speed I'm going to try and
click all three here at the same time
which is much more difficult than you
think alright looks like we got all
three iPhone started just a second later
and they're all off
looks like the iPhones first one to show
some content the pre is very close
behind iPhones almost loaded all the
content so has the pre the storm is
lagging very far behind and the pre is
almost done so is the iPhone you can see
the little indicator light right there
letting you know how cliff are it is
little circle what's filling up the
iPhone is done in the pre is almost
finished and the e video network of the
storm is lagging just a little bit and I
do have very strong network signals for
each this is a very fair comparison and
the storm is still going while these two
are definitely done so let's see how
panning and scrolling works on each
device both the iPhone and the pre both
claim multi-touch and very easy and
smooth finger scrolling so finger
scrolling is very smooth on the iPhone
you can double tap to zoom and it looks
like the storm is almost done double tap
to zoom out it does have a multi-touch
so you can pinch in and pinch out and
the same is supposed to be true on the
pretty much check that out will pinch in
and that was just a smooth will pinch
out
and we'll DoubleTap very nice and easy
and it didn't look just as smooth as the
iPhone doing both at the same time you
can see that there really is no lag or
delay the storm here should be able to
pan and scroll as well and it does it's
relatively smooth and you can double tap
to zoom and that worked as advertised
the storm however does not have
multi-touch you have to do the zooming
through a pushing of buttons on the side
so guys wanted to give you a browser
speed comparison test of all three
touchscreen devices really these are the
big three on each of the major carriers
- the t-mobile g1 so if you found this
useful in making your decision overall
I've been relatively impressed with
Sprint's EVDO Rev a speeds cigarettes
the channel for a ton more pre videos
coming up we're gonna be demoing webOS
contacts really every faceted device is
gonna get demoed if you have any
questions be sure to stick around and
watch those also for exclusive content
