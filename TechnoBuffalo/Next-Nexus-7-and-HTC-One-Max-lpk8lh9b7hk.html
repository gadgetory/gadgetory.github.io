to you by gamefly what's up everyone
walk back there episode of rumor roundup
there's so many tech rumors each and
every weakness to show we take all them
rumors smash them and serve them up to
you in one single video so you don't
miss a thing you can go to your friend
and say hey I know what's coming do you
up this week we're to talk about Apple
even filing trademark slug crazy
supposedly the next Nexus 7 specs have
been leaked and HTC One one of my
favorite phones of the year looks like
it's poised to get both big and little
brothers and the last but definitely not
least a 20 megapixel sony phone might be
coming soon this rumor roundup go ahead
and start rounding up all right so let's
start with apple and the iWatch rumors
if Apple lawyers got paid by the
trademark and patent favorite stuff to
probably buy one of their own islands so
one day after Japan made apples
trademark for iwatch public knowledge
for other countries of followed suit the
good folks at 9to5 mac person covered an
application for patent made in mexico by
maria theresa whore a telus head of
trademark departments at orochi merkin
and linder SC on behalf of apple that
was a mouthful the iWatch trademarks or
made into two categories one for the
hardware the other for the software and
we're filed on jun 3rd their rivals
though macrumors also uncovered
trademark applications in both Taiwan in
Turkey not longer here also uncovered
application for an apple patents in
colombia on june fourth including japan
and russia this brings the number of
countries with an iWatch trademark
application to six such a worldwide and
well create an effort can only mean it
just a matter of time for apple
officially acknowledges the iWatch at
least we're hoping anyway so if your
patent trolls out there just start
patenting everything that I in it the I
dishwasher the I coffee machine yeah I I
and just be like maybe I was gonna get
into that I am hoping that Apple's could
have some crazy innovation right now I
don't see much of a need for a
SmartWatch but few years ago I have too
much money for a tablet either so I'm
fingers crossed and maybe Apple's got
some of that use
left and they are going to give us
something delicious that we're all going
to want to wear on arrests supposedly
the next generation Nexus 7 specs have
been leaked which is kind of exciting
this story though it can be a little bit
dubious it goes a little something like
this a user was logging in to an ace to
support for him and ask him about the
next generation tablet essentially the
support rep from asus is like hey dude
if you're super nice I will tell you
what's coming now it's believable
because a lot of these reps do have
access to his internal databases it's
unbelievable cuz it just seems too
obvious okay i was on with apple's
support i asked about the 5s they told
me everything he also said 17 color
iphones are coming so according to the
wrap the device was for a 7 inch display
with a full HD resolution else that's
kind of nice were bumped up to 1080p
being powered by a Snapdragon 600
quad-core cpu 2 gigs of ram 32 cos
internal storage 5 megapixel rear camera
nice to have a real camera on their
android 4.3 a 4000 milliamp hour battery
Bluetooth all the rest that stuff I
loved a nexus 7 and I'll love its big
brother the nexus 7 squared next is it
can mean x is 8 one of my favorite
phones of what really ever the HTC one
looks like it's families going to get a
little bit bigger there's been plenty of
speculation surrounding the rumored HTC
one mini but according to a leaked
document from European retailer 02
German a phablet size HTC One max may
also be in the works the HTC One mini is
expected to launch in q3 and Oh to
Germany recently claimed that the
handset would be available starting on
august 3rd the handset will likely run
android 4.2 point2 jellybean though it's
unclear was going to come with HTC's
latest sense 5 UI the flagship ones
quad-core processor or that funky ir
blaster one of the devices that i really
want is a phablet version HTC one looks
like the HTC one max previously leaked
as the t6 supposedly is going to feature
a 5.9 inch full HD display two point
three gigahertz quad-core snapdragon 800
processor so that's 200 better than 600
two gigs of ram 3300 million power
battery boomsound speakers the
ultrapixel camera and a stylus and i
also run android key lime pie suggesting
its release date may still be very very
far off according to 0 to germany HD
see one max will only come in silver but
you black in a red version probably a
few months later supposed to get 20
megapixel sony phone is coming a rumor
from earlier this year suggested selling
would introduce a cyber-shot xperia
phone the upcoming months and a fresh
leak is back in that claim up and a
series of renders required by gsmarena
the images show off what looks to be
your typical Xperia handset that we've
seen over the past several months only
according to rumblings oh it's going to
come with freaking 20 megapixels ice
camera along with a 5-inch full-hd
display it's not really much discernment
from the photos themselves but
information regarding devices internals
codenamed onami addition to the massive
camera and display size the device will
allegedly pack a two-point figured
Snapdragon 800 processor to give you two
Rams microSD card slot a battery between
27 hundred and three thousand million
powers the biggest news obviously is
that'll have a crazy high end out
of luck we do battle with Nokia's
upcoming eros device but Sony's honami
isn't expected to be announced until IFA
in September's we have to wait see if
that device is going to come if it does
though it'll be available through
Japan's NTT DoCoMo along with
international version which hopefully we
