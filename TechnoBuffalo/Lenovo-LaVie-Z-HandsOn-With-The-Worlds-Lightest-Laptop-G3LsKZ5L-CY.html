technobuffalo at CES 2015 I'm looking at
the brand new lenovo love easy it's one
of the first notebooks and convertible
you can see behind it coming out of a
joint venture between Lenovo and NEC in
Japan and I'm here joined by tom butler
from Lenovo is going to walk us through
it because it's an incredible laptop and
I don't have it all memorized thanks I'd
guys are very excited about these
products me what you're looking at or
the world's lightest 13 inch notebook
and convertible the notebook itself
weighs one point seven two pounds it's
really hard to imagine how light this
this product is audience basically we
look at normal lifted normal household
objects we came up with basically two
cans of soda I mean this is about the
weight of course it's distributed across
in a 13-inch three screen so it's even
though it feels lighter weight than even
the cans of soda that's about as close
as we can get from an approximate weight
perspective exciting things about this
and it's super super lightweight 1.72
pounds runs a full core i5 that's
intel's next-generation 5th generation
core products it's a great performance
in a great weight and package and then
the convertible same thing so it's super
light weight the weight of this one is
two point oh four pounds this one runs
up to a core i7 5th generation and then
because of the convertible nature it
does go all the way to a tablet mode as
well so you've got the super lightweight
materials it's made of magnesium lithium
alloy it gives us super strength super
strong but super lightweight results
with these two chasity's so we're very
excited about this deals they'll be
available in May on lenovo com starting
prices are approximate on their
approximately looking at 12 99 for the
milk
and 14 99 for the convertible alright
thanks Thom and guys these notebooks are
so light it's pretty incredible so you
really have to feel that I guess when
they launched in May this is Todd
