to give you a demonstration of tweety a
new desktop Twitter client for mac so
I've been sold it on my desktop here and
i'll put a link to download it in the
info bar you get a sneak preview here my
Applications folder there's the icon
right there tweeting click the check for
updates it is just released today so no
need to check for updates goes ahead and
logs you in and there you go and you see
all of your friends tweets your nice
easy to read fashion sort of like talk
bubbles from the old comics you can
resize the window kinda any way you want
so you're greeted here by just very
simply for icons this one here shows all
your friends messages and that little
dot that was showing up right there but
you know there's a new tweet that is
shown up this does auto update which is
very nice you've got all your @ replies
show up right there and when I'm
clicking those little dots that are
showing up are just from my screen
capture program not that thing I fancy I
have on my Mac all your direct messages
or you can search nice and easy a little
search bar at the top it's a very simple
relatively elegant desktop Twitter
client but you do have a few options and
preferences to customize it as you
choose let me show you what some of
those options are here under preferences
you get your general preferences you can
choose to display your friends
information whether by username or
full-name I don't know people by their
username so that's what I choose your
font size your URL shortening service
although I don't really like any of
these your image service twitpic or
twitter yfrog posterous your account
just list your account name mine is
obviously John for lakers advanced you
can show or high Tweety a new tweet you
can set shortcuts for each of these here
very nice and simple what I new tweet
arrives you can maintain your position
have it auto scroll to the top I'm
actually going to set it to auto scroll
to the top you can dim your previously
select tweets you can preview short URL
it's quite nice to make sure not going
anywhere you don't want to go open links
in the background you can choose whether
the show ads or not show ads unseen
tweets unseen mentions or unseen
messages actually very nice
so in order to disable the ads actually
have to buy it which is a 1495 fee kind
of cheese it for free for a little while
I'm going to go and choose remind me
later but if you do like the program
always encourage you to buy software so
I'm going to use this for a week or so
and if I like it I will purchase it
myself so guys this is really it just
all your tweets displayed in a very
simple timeline I'm moving my hands here
but you guys certainly can't see that
take my word for it that I'm gesturing
towards the screen so just very nice
elegant easy-to-use interface something
I've actually enjoyed using it is
missing some feature some of the direct
message things are as good as i would
have liked them but they're not bad if
you want to make a new message you
actually have to go down to the bottom
to this little icon down here and you
can go ahead and type your new message
and you can use a short URL service
right there at an image right there and
go in and type a post so i will type a
quick post live on video so you can see
what it looks like when you make a post
there and there you go shows up
recording live right at the top and it
shows up in the opposite direction so
you can know which ones came from you do
a simple app reply if I want to reply to
let's say pocket now go and hit that
little arrow right there same message
pops up with just the ad pocket now
tweets very nice and simple I've said
nice and simple probably quite a few
times your but it is a nice way to
describe the tweety desktop client for
mac hope you guys enjoyed if you do have
a mac and you use twitter i definitely
recommend downloading it it's certainly
nice alternative to using the desktop
client which is just a web browser like
i was using before and i hope you
enjoyed for exclusive content follow me
on twitter you know the address john for
lakers I don't see you guys next video
