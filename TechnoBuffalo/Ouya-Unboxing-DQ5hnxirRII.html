technobuffalo it's an unboxing of the oh
yeah this is the android based gaming
console coming very very soon we back
this sucker on Kickstarter it is here
and ready to be ceremoniously unboxed
let's take a look so here is the box for
the Ouya every time I say that nay I
could dig into the kool-aid guy bus and
do a wall yeah so go ahead and open it
up and we've got some bubble wrap and
not package looks like we got the wii a
controller of course already to all
aspects anything but here's the kind of
cross between the ps3 or the DualShock 3
controller and an xbox 360 controller
but it does have a cool touch pad there
and it spells out yeah which is kind of
neat of fuels she was nice to feel a
little bit on the plasticky side but
it's got a good feel to it decent
ergonomics but curious to see how it
feels when i'm getting my gaming on and
mashing some buttons but again touch
panel right in the middle also in the
box i guess we got two batteries or
supposes for that remote control this is
probably the retail packaging for the
via console pull this sucker out there
we go or maybe not the retail packaging
who knows up I'm saying yes on the
retail packaging here it is Rihanna
black cardboard box got sort of embossed
on the side yeah a dream by dreamt by
gamers designed in California at
something that's sounds familiar let's
go ahead and open this up you peel off
the tape place from one side I had any
nails could do this much easier well
that boom do that again on the other
side and see what we've got inside I
have not seen one of these yet in person
I know there's been some issues with
early you eyes but supposedly hasn't all
been fixed and this should work like a
dream at least in theory so if you guys
don't know what the react console is
essentially it is an android based
gaming console thank you for believing
it's probably in here for the
Kickstarter and we've got another
controller oh that's kind of cool they
gave us two so there's the controller
again and here is the react console
itself this thing is
super tiny so it's gonna cost you in 99
bucks be available jun 25th it's running
a custom version of android 4.1 too sure
how it stands like it stands like this
you've got ton of course i'll walk you
guys through here to mention them it's
2.9 my two point nine x 3.2 it weighs a
very light 10.5 ounces it's being
powered by a videos Tegra 3 quad-core
chip it's got a gig of ram it gigs of
internal storage expandable via USB
which you can see that port right there
cords got Wi-Fi a games here are free to
try and you can of course download them
can support for 4 controllers and of
course that controller has a touchpad so
let's take a look at this guy is all
kinds of stuff going on here alright so
i suppose that is where power is going
to go gigabit ethernet but of course
Wi-Fi there mini HDMI out believe or
unless that's a micro USB port there's
the USB port and there is hdmi we got a
ton of stickers on here let's pull all
those off and see what this thing looks
like so a little bit of a fan there and
peel off this blessed and boom this is
the Ouya console so I'll push that down
for just a moment see also you're gonna
have in the box suppose you got to be
something else in here to power it and
there is so here is the power brick
