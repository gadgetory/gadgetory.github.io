technobuffalo here today februari 15
steve ballmer an associate's took the
center stage at mobile world conference
in barcelona spain and unveiled to the
world the next version of Windows Mobile
which is officially being called Windows
Phone 7 series get used to that name
care gonna be hearing it quite a bit
it's a little bit long windows phone 7
series is the name of Microsoft's next
mobile operating system see me look down
so I got some notes in front of me the
conference just ended let's go over some
of the recaps first and foremost this is
not a update to the 6.5 or windows
mobile 6.1 doze phone series that you've
seen this is a complete code rework from
the ground up we've seen her very
similar-looking windows mobile since all
the pocket pc days of years past and
then we had windows mobile five windows
mobile 6 they all look relatively
similar this day complete utter rework
with a entirely new design and user
interface so first we've got xbox live
and doing integration know which is
quite nice they're all sort of done with
these new tile interface and they're
calling these live tiles or smart tile
essentially what they are our little
widgets that update in real time so you
can have tiles for facebook updates you
could have tiles for email it's sort of
these new way that interact with the
phone these are those tiles are
customizable and you can scroll
vertically you can add as many as you'd
like you can add tiles for your friends
and family let's say you've got a girl
friends on Facebook that you have our
own tile and actually update your
facebook profile the tile picture is
going to change you'll see some images
not put up as I'm talking about what the
home screen looks like to get a sense of
what it's going to be interactive the
device it's really got a lot of social
networking integration built into this
tile interface so I'm a bit skeptical as
to how much information you can actually
get on what home trees are gonna be a
lot of vertical scrolling which you know
may be good or bad depending on we think
but you'll be doing that vertical
scrolling on a capacitive multi-touch
enabled screen natively which should be
a big plus for windows mobile fans the
past gone will be the resistive sort of
squishy touch screens so you can throw
those extra styluses out you'll now be
rocking it capacitive screen like the
iphone and android and even blackberry
community has for some time so let's
talk a little bit more about these tiles
like i mentioned there's sort of
stand-alone widgets that will update in
real time obviously we and internet
connection and they'll always be able to
give you information as it's coming
through so your email updates your
facebook i'll update twitter and this
sort of brings all these things together
all the emails and all the contact lists
that you get from you know work email or
your corporate email personal and all
your social networking think of it
similar to Palm surgery on webos that's
also present throughout the new windows
phone 7 series if you've seen what the
zune HD interface looks like that's very
similar to what the menu system of
Windows Phone 7 series is going to look
like which I was a big fan of I really
liked the zune HD interface is very
smooth list based and it worked very
well and I think we're going to see sort
of at same working very well into
windows mobile windows phone 7 series no
more Start menu no more sort of lists
that you saw on the homescreen we're
just a bit of icons you're not going to
get a very immersive interactive
environment of which is quite nice
Microsoft's is also going to put a much
tighter control over the hardware and
software so they're going to be minimum
requirements that each vendor is going
to have to meet in order to run the new
operating systems you're going to see a
certain level of performance amongst all
of phones be quite nice on the downside
if you're a fan of touchflo 3d or
TouchWiz or any other user interface
that has been put on top of Windows
Mobile the past you can be disappointed
because Microsoft is going to be no
longer allowing custom skins on the UI
so depending what you think about the
opportu do a brake system that's either
good or a bad thing sort of on the
positive end you're going to always get
the same experience from phone to phone
certainly the form factor my berry
whether not it's got a qwerty keyboard a
physical keyboard or whatever it might
be the
experience is going to be relatively
similar which I think people may may
like this is another cool integration
they have you can have all your photos
from the web and on your device or to
come into one harking back to that sort
of palm sandy type thing it's everything
Microsoft kept saying your whole life on
your phones everything that you do
online in the digital world sort of be
integrated right into your phone sort of
nice looking package you're going to
sink over Wi-Fi which is another sort of
cool feature there's also sort of
probably most importantly a completely
new browser a new version of internet
explorer or mobile internet explorer as
based off the desktop version which is
multi-touch enable the funny looks like
Microsoft has built a very capable
browser when I can compete with the
iphone mandroids of the world they
showed it off in a few videos they look
to be very very nice there's no mention
of flash aboard although it will not be
supported for some time but Adobe and
Microsoft is both said the flash will
come to Windows Phone 7 series so
overall it looks to be a complete and
radical departure from windows mobile
the past I think it's a very bold move
by Microsoft primarily windows mobile
had been geared at professional so his
aim to sort of the enterprise crowd I
think Microsoft perhaps realized that
that crowd was being diluted by a ton
different operating systems and decided
to put together a package that was more
broad reaching the new OS is certainly
not geared just at the professionals
it's rooted everybody is sort of taking
aim at again at Android iPhone and even
you can blackberry with some other email
integration it looks to be a very nice
package it doesn't look like anything
you'd expect from Microsoft because
anything to expect from Microsoft from
years past it looks see a very complete
feature job brake system which we will
have years and years of support and the
very least a fantastic departure from
the antiquated 6.5 architecture that
we've seen in the past which is based on
their five point 0 architecture which is
based on Pocket PC it's really stayed
the same taking Microsoft a bit of time
to get to this point certainly we're
three years past the production of the
iphone or a couple years into android
and sort of many many years into
blackberry and we had
seeing any drastic change to Windows
Mobile until this point so it's gonna be
a brave new world out there for the
smartphone loving crowd around the
holidays of this year we should start
seeing the first phones rule out prices
and carriers obviously nobody knows
quite yet so what do you guys think
about Windows Phone 7 series it's quite
a lot to say it looks to be a pretty
decent operates and what I'm looking
forward to playing with so what are your
thoughts you to pick up a device you
excited about it you going to wait for a
new phone or do you have absolutely zero
interest maybe you fall somewhere in
between kind of curious what you have to
say anyway I'm John rende you're from
TechnoBuffalo for all your windows phone
7 series up picture check out the
channel and TechnoBuffalo com I'll see
you guys next video oh my</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
