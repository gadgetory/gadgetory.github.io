go further I'm Erin Baker from
TechnoBuffalo and I don't know if you
can hear it through the microphone but
there's some exciting music going on in
the background CES 2013 is not a dance
party though we have to do some real
work and to that end I've got an
unboxing for you friends the HTC
butterfly is in the house or in the
convention center we're going to take a
look at it in a full unboxing
TechnoBuffalo style let's do this so you
wanted that HTC Droid DNA but you didn't
want the one on Verizon or maybe you
didn't like the red colors of the Droid
DNA here is actually the original device
the HTC butterfly now they were calling
it the J butterfly for a while now on
the box it just says butterfly not quite
sure which branding they're going with
but least on the box let's take a look
at this sucker and open it up and
there's the butterfly kind of like the J
butterfly names I'm like it just sounds
just sounds kind of cool and maybe so
while I'm at that special thanks to our
partners at Negri Electronics they were
special and awesome and they helped us
get this device early they're getting it
next week so be sure to check out Negri
electronics comm they're on Twitter as
well
at Negri electronics be sure to check
them out let's take a look at some of
the specifications you've got AK 1.5
gigahertz quad-core Snapdragon s4 pro
CPU a 5-inch 1080p HD display so a full
HD display and when the droid DNA came
out actually when this came out as well
is one of the first with a 1080p HD
display but we've seen so many which
were live on location at CES right now
so many devices that have 1080p HD
display so that's definitely kind of the
buzz feature if you will of 2013 so 5
inches there you've got an 8 megapixel
rear facing camera with 1080p HD video
recording HTC Sense 4 Plus running atop
Android 4.1 also known as jelly beans
it's a really a nice device all around
pull this out here BAM there we go
wide-angle front camera 1080p s4 beats
audio all great features all-around
beautiful device as you can see a little
bit more glossy than the the Droid DNA
on the back that kind of a poorly white
with some I want to say bedazzled but
that's probably not the best word
Bejeweled background here Beats Audio
logo on the front you've got HTC
front-facing camera you got back
home your recent applications and up top
you get your 3.5 millimeter headphone
jack your power button and then your
micro SIM card slot as well and then
down here your micro USB charging port
volure marker on the right side and in
your 8 megapixel camera now again it
looks like you have a notification light
as well while that's powering on let's
see what comes in the box put that down
instructions I can't read end-user
license agreement I can read micro SIM
card removal tool got IMEI stuff and
you've got your AC adapter module over
here
HTC's cornstarch bags got some ear buds
got a micro USB charging cord as well
let's just take a look you know what
this looks like it's nothing new here by
any means we got like your USB and all
kinds of accessory goodness that is also
not anything that I can reborn into our
best here we're gonna open it up and see
if we can switch around the language
which good English United States let's
do that
so you can see here since for Plus
running like I said top Android 4.1 got
the similar stuff you're familiar with
on since 4.17 home screens on this
device at a maximum then you got down
here applications out of the box
you've got dr i-- kkbox
PDF viewer and then of course all the
typical stuff you would expect 5-inch
display device really awesome
coming soon to Negra electronics we want
to get this device in the States
keep it locked in TechnoBuffalo for
continuing coverage at the HTC butterfly
j butterfly what are the heck they're
calling it these days
be sure to stay tuned like us on
facebook facebook.com slash
TechnoBuffalo hit me up on twitter limit
oh you think of this device I'm an
errand C Baker that company's a
TechnoBuffalo
and we'll be sure to cover it much more
in the days and weeks ahead keep it
locked on the site for continuing
coverage and as always we'll see you
next time
I heart Auto is the best way to access
hundreds of radio stations all across
the country we can stream our favorite
San Francisco radio stations went out
here in Vegas or on the go anywhere sync
app link allows us to wirelessly play
those tunes straight through our car
stereo and control the app using only
switch stations like and skip songs and
navigate state stations all without
lifting a finger sync app link is just
another example of how Ford is committed
to going further and keeping you
connected while on-the-go
thanks again to Ford for powering this
TechnoBuffalo CES special
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
