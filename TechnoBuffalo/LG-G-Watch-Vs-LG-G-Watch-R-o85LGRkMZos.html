TechnoBuffalo looks like two smart
watches on the table that's because
there are hearts the G watch and the
brand new g watch are the circular
version orgy watch round as i like to
say of LG Smart Watch it's much more
premium materials you can see the metal
on the sides the bezel edges it actually
looks like a timepiece this unit seems
to have some issues with the software a
little bit but obviously you can see
that new bar comes down there's a button
here for selecting on the side you can
say ok Google and it'll launch episode
is working properly and then on the back
the heart rate monitor and then you can
see just how different they are the
original G watch plastic very simple no
heart rate monitor and meanwhile this
one actually is really really nice
looking and it's supposed to have better
view ability you can see it's so bright
its kind of messing with the camera but
under direct sunlight and and better
viewing angles too so you can just see
the two watches side by side obviously
this is a much more premium model so
super excited just want to show you the
G watch arbors does the g watch this is
