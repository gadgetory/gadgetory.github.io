known from technobuffalo calm and you
know yesterday or I guess it was
yesterday I shot it today I posted it
piece of advice number one for aspiring
tech reviewers and journalists and
bloggers forget your concept of time
because you know you write things today
they get posted tomorrow you shoot
things yesterday they get posted at the
end of the week time zones embargoes
trade shows all kinds of crazy stuff
just just forget what you thought about
time was it just goes crazy for you
believe me but anyway posted this video
answering an email from somebody named
Nick or starting to answer talking about
you know advice for aspiring tech
reviewers and tech bloggers and stuff
and there's some comments posted already
those you who watch the video thank you
those you didn't go watch it and have
some comments posted go watch it I don't
know what that was some comments posted
already asking some follow-up questions
what are the most common ones one of
those common ones was you know tell us
more about how to get products to review
that's a separate topic for another
video I think unless this one comes up
short but I have a tendency to talk a
lot so probably not but one of the other
topics which I want to cover right now
is what gear you what gear to use what
camera to use you know that kind of
stuff
and so I here's the thing about gear
don't let gear get in your way of
getting started and making content okay
to to run a website you need access to a
computer and access to the internet and
and really that's all you need to get
started you can use free programs you
can use you know hosted blogger accounts
or wordpress account or whatever for
free just to get started YouTube it's
free to get an account if you want to
use YouTube you need a camera of some
sort you can use the cam the webcam in
your computer to get started if you have
a cell phone that shoots video you can
use that you know you don't have to go
out and spend a lot of money and let the
technology get in the way of just
getting started just get started that's
what's important because a lot of times
I was like this you know as a kid I
still get all excited about something
I'll spend all this time researching
what gear to get I'll get the gear I'll
use it for a while and then you know I
I'm not interested anymore so you don't
want to don't make my mistake you don't
let the gear matter just just get
started that being said I'll talk a
little bit about the gear that I use
because some of you asked I'm shooting
this on a canon camcorder it's a vixia
m30 I believe what I say here yeah hmm
30 so this is the the newer version of
the camera I used to have when I was at
the phoneDog but I had to give it back
because it's a company camera when I
left the job so I bought this one I in
like November a few months ago whatever
there's not five months ago and I use
Canon camcorders for two main reasons
one is they the files work well with the
video editing software I use the second
is the camera camcorder canon camcorders
almost all of them have a microphone
jack so I'm actually using you can see
here a little lavalier mic which just
plugs right into the microphone jack and
I've had three different camera canon
camcorders I can't say the name but I've
had three of them two of them have been
HD one of them was the fs100 which was a
standard def camcorder it was great for
standard def and even that for like 200
bucks had a microphone jack which a lot
of the camcorders out there
non-professional ones the ones that are
under a thousand dollars don't have
microphone jacks and it's nice to have
that I don't use it all the time but
this lavalier mic is great for getting
good vocal quality I have a handheld mic
that plugs in you know and this Mike was
like 30 bucks off amazon this mike i got
eight years ago for twenty bucks at
Circuit City and serving sitting on
business anymore and it still works fine
but these mics are great for vocals you
know when it's just you you know you're
not interviewing something or getting
sound off with something else they're
also great for shooting out in the field
so at a trade show a press event you
know that sort of thing again you don't
have to use them all the time if you
want to get fancier with it John has a
sony camcorder and he is a bluetooth
wireless bluetooth mic which is great
the wireless is awesome and you know but
that's the kind of stuff that don't
worry about that yet I I think it's a
wise policy I used to not follow this
policy and I got into some debt and I
got out of that now for all the policy
don't go spending a lot of money at
first just do it cheap and easy first
and then if it works then you can
upgrade you know as it's worth it with
phoneDog the first videos were shot on a
little you know $90 point-and-shoot
camera that shot 30-second MPEG clips
and then that led to getting a camcorder
that led to getting a better camcorder
that led doing HD video you know and so
on so there you go I know John quach
shoots video on his digital SLR the
DSLRs now or awesome if I was buying a
new camera right now you know I would
look I do a lot more video than photos
and I'm a terrible photographer believe
me but I would look into you know a
camera that a point-and-shoot maybe that
does video also that kind of thing hard
to find one that has a mic and a
swiveling screen I like the swiveling
screen also so there you go so the sound
very important and you know an external
mic can be really good lighting is also
very important I had a lighting kit
inexpensive lighting kit something broke
on it so I'm actually in the market for
a new one but lighting can be very
tricky shooting outside natural light is
great inside can be tricky I'm not a
lighting expert for sure but sounded
lighting or to Portman things and when
you're shooting videos of gadgets you
know I've got a gadget here I've got a
cell phone and the screens can be very
reflective and you can see the screen is
reflecting back in the you know the
screen of my camcorder and so it's
tricky and
the things about shooting videos of
gadgets with a lot of close-up on
screens in expensive cameras like the
flip cameras and the Kodak cameras that
are really great for shooting high def
video sort of in general some of them a
lot of them don't do well with close-ups
on screens so that's something if you're
going to be shooting stuff with gadgets
you kind of got it yet you have to kind
of be careful you kind of got it you
have to get it you have to gotta be
careful you gotta be careful kids be
careful and find something that's going
to work with screens you're not shooting
the screen so much you know you can get
away with with other stuff and webcams
you know that ton of people do stuff on
YouTube all the time get millions of you
shooting off their webcam so don't
discount that just play around with what
you've got and then if you're into it
and everything like i said then worry
about you know upgrading the gear so
let's take a quick tour around look at
you know some of the other gear that i
use here and I you can get a sense of
you know the tools of the trade i guess
but again you know don't don't let the
gear hold you back from getting started
so here's my desk key things about the
desk you will notice it's got a monitor
i used to have two monitors but I found
that I had one monitor for my work and
the other for email and Twitter and I am
which has turned into distractions and I
was ignoring my work and instead just
focusing on the distraction so I ditched
the second monitor also important I have
a lamp I rarely turn it on but I have it
there anyway just in case keyboard and a
mouse of course now you might you know
you might find it ironic that I use an
apple computer but I have a microsoft
keyboard and mouse I was using the apple
wireless bluetooth keyboard which is
over here and the magic trackpad but I
you know I went back to their good but I
went back to the keyboard and mouse I
like the old style keyboard because I
type a lot like deal style keyboards a
little roomier and has the nice button
action you know sounds like old train
coming down the track what else it's
very important to have at least 25 web
browser tabs open at once it makes you
feel like you're being busy preferably
you want to have a picture of yourself
on the screen or even two pictures of
yourself on the screen at all times very
important also on the desk empty cup of
coffee makes it seem like you really
burn the midnight oil
John's been teasing me a lot lately
about how I drink fancy coffee at a
fancy little cups but it's true I like
the espresso random gadgets scattered
around I've got my nike sportband for
running I've got my iphone I've got the
verizon Thunderbolt you want to make
sure you have multiple no you don't at
all this is just this in my life you
know I review engadget so I've got you
know review phones around I've got this
remote I was trying out for the iOS
devices not not so keen on it I've got
an empty bin I don't know why
rechargeable batteries I haven't opened
speakers I've got the logitech z10 you
should know none of this stuff i'm
showing you except for the review phones
which i send back they're not mine none
of this stuff was like I'm not paid to
user or whatever there's just the stuff
that i personally use logitech z 10
speakers there there many years old now
but no sub woofer so they don't take up
a lot of room when I had a sub woofer I
would always kick it under my desk and
then it the cords would come out
everything so I like these it's us be
controlled sounds good you can find a
pair now they're probably really cheap
this is all hooked up to this is a pro
tip right here if you can get a fancy
computer that's not yours you don't have
to spend money on it my friend you and
let me this computer when he went back
from San Francisco to London it's a mac
pro tower you and thank you it's on
permanent loan or semi permanent loan so
i'm using this my personal computer they
actually own 13-inch macbook pro i also
have an 11-inch macbook air which is
TechnoBuffalo property which I've come
to really like for trade shows because
it's SuperDuper light but point being
that i use a mac and it's just personal
preference i don't have a big thing
against windows or linux or whatever I
just I like the max because I liked the
video editing software which I use a lot
and the music editing software which I
use you know and in my non-work life
well I haven't been playing much lately
I use iMovie to edit all my stuff
because it's simple I don't do a lot of
fancy effects i just do cuts and titles
John quach we got to get John quatrain
on camera because he is a whiz he's one
of the most talented people I've ever
met and one of the nicest guys in the
world and he can talk video production
way more than I can so but anyway it's
my setup the mac pro tower I've got
to external hard drives because it's not
my computer this has empty bays in it
but eventually would have to give this
back so I've got the external drives
with my backups and I use one for video
editing stuff whatever keyboard mouse
there's my monitor 23-inch you know it's
low budget I'd love to have one of those
fancy Apple monitors I'm not going to
spend a thousand dollars on it what else
important stuff here old beat-up
mousepad from an artic art exhibition at
the Guggenheim gives me street cred not
one but two SD card readers because Mac
towers don't have an SD card reader
reader built in blu point-and-shoot
camera which is not a work camera
necessarily it's personal camera but I
use that sometimes to take still photos
and they come out much better than on
the camcorder it's just that this
doesn't shoot good video so I get lazy
and I'd use the camcorder for
photographs inspirational drummer also I
should show the inspirational mug
patients because I don't have enough of
it and my little inspirational card with
a reading from the Dalai Lama because I
have too much pride there you go and
fake paper flowers not just because
they're cool also they don't need
watering anyway broken memory card I
have so many memory cards laying around
it's ridiculous I tried to fix this one
by taping it back together it worked for
a little bit but didn't last a random
stuff gearbag boxee box will come over
here yard you've probably already
noticed there are a lot of chords it's a
very dangerous place I've got a press
bag full of paper case I ever need to
print anything which i don't but i've
got a little personal laser printer
under there I only ever print fedex
labels to send things back this thing if
you're a Mac user who shoots a lot of
video I highly recommend the y el gato
turbo 264 it at HD I like this thing so
much that when I broke it I taped it
back together and it kept working which
is awesome this speeds up the encoding
process so it integrates into quick time
and so when I export video out of iMovie
especially if it's HD video everything I
shoot winds up getting exported almost
everything the 720p
and I kind of tweak the settings to make
it sort of optimal you know small file
size but but good enough quality this
thing speeds up the exporting process at
least three fold so what used to take 25
minutes to export now takes seven or
eight it's awesome it's about 120 bucks
probably hunted for less now and I can't
recommend enough you just have to find
the right settings to dial it in random
stuff you know press releases there's
the box from the elgato thing obviously
I'm a neat freak there's the Samsung TV
that I'm reviewing right now you might
have seen this in the backdrop some of
the videos the TechnoBuffalo logo on it
will turn this thing on there's the
Philips blu-ray player then I'm
reviewing right now you can see under
the table here is just bins and boxes
and things of you know review stuff some
of its review stuff that needs to be
sent back a lot of it is just like
cables and things like that I've
collected over the years that I really
should get rid of her giveaway in fact
you know what there's a bin over here
I'm kind of I can't show you this area
it's too embarrassing hang on all right
so this is just a bin with like stuff
just old stuff from like you know
product samples from trade shows and
things like that and they just kind of
pile up over time you know the eye bags
or better members the eye bags right and
the ipod nano waterproof case there but
then here's you know here's the thermo
pack but then there's an ipad case and
so maybe we should give some of the
stuff away on the site just you know the
stuff piles up and and sometimes
companies go out of business or you know
it's just whatever sometimes it's just
samples you accrue and I have so many
bags from trade shows and all it's crazy
we should just give this away if anybody
wants it and you back over here to the
desktop and so basically again you know
the the deal really is most important
have your own picture on the screen in
as many places as possible at all times
I have lots of other websites including
really fancy high-profile websites like
The Wall Street Journal that now employ
people you know like Tricia who is up
there in the right corner of it but her
picture just changed have that up there
also because that makes you feel
important but most importantly don't let
the gear get in the way
just get started make stuff you know
work on your style your writing style
your video stuff here I'll get in from
the camera you know I mean if you go
back if you go to the crabby crab
channel on YouTube care a vivir y KR v
KR a vivir y KR AV on youtube and you
search by date go in the oldest ones
first and look at the first couple of
videos i did i'm not saying my videos
are great now but those old videos man
it was just trying stuff it was trying
to run I don't know what I was doing and
you just have to try things and maybe
it's video maybe it's writing maybe it's
photography who knows but just try it
and those were shot on you know like I
said that old point-and-shoot camera we
just happened to have that shut MPEG
clips don't let the gear get in the way
just do it you'll borrow a camera use
your webcam whatever start putting it
online you know and then promote
yourself and we'll talk about that in
the next video the promoting yourself
and trying to get stuff to review and
all that kind of thing all right so
anyway I hope it was helpful hit us up
with questions hit us up with comments
of course and I will get some of my
esteemed colleagues on some of these
videos to give you tips because you know
John Q knows way more about video
production and SEO than I do John render
obviously knows a ton about growing a
Youtube subscriber base in a very
different way than how I did it with
phoneDog so you know we want to share
the wisdom if we can because really what
we want to do is we want to find the
next awesome bloggers and steal you and
make you work for us that's what we want
we'll see you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
