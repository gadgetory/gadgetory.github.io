technobuffalo here taking a look at
samsung's just announced wave 3 this is
running bata two point oh I never seen
bada before it's Samsung's proprietary
operating system gotta say it looks very
Android ass I just got a few minutes
we're here so I'm going to go ahead and
try and show you the core of the
operating system so you've got a three
button layout here so I knit the home
button you can see those light up I've
got a back button in your home button
this is sort of your menu selection
button i'll show you all that in just a
moment let's take a look at this first
home screen and sort of a TouchWiz as
class and go ahead and jump from home
screen to a home screen address or crack
as many as you like go ahead and jump
right back here so these are widgets as
we've seen before to go ahead and select
one you can move it around you have to
move around in the confines of the box
be conserved determine where it goes so
go ahead and jump back home on this
other screen here's what they're calling
live and I'll essentially use are just
live woods that are calling an active
information if you hold one down you can
turn them on or off those little toggles
and you can scroll down and see
they have here so this stuff you'd
expect you have a calendar you've gots
dogs we've got searched about whether
RSS is he's got some new selected and
you have some contact and shortcuts here
at the bottom I really do like having
that option at the bottom for quick
dials it's a pretty handy feature let's
go ahead and jump home go over to the
other screen neurons go and jump into
menu so it looks pretty familiar to
touch with but there are some cool
things that you can do here so let's say
you want to make a folder of like
applications let's see we've got gallery
and camera flagpole both to make it
story
I think cradle both I'm trying to film
here try one more time titled both of
them there we go should be able to make
me to a folder at least that was the
that was the idea to try that one more
time
oh there we go all right now we've got a
full
dragon right in that if you hold it and
drag it out there we go you can see
what's in it which is kind of need a
kind of quick way to see what you have
in that folder select whatever you want
and jump right back a very neat thing
here so you've got of course your full
multi-touch browser we don't have
support for flash yet or will support
flash apps evidently i'm speaking of
apps it does have an app store is
samsung apps samsung proprietary
operating system so Samsung is running
the app show here we'll go ahead and let
it queue up with connection over Wi-Fi
it sees them the games don't expect to
see Angry Birds in here but there's a
decent amount of AB selection Samsung
has
pledge developer support for a ton of
other things
see wishlist category top major through
a lot of very interesting things too
see here and bought it so if you go
ahead and hold down home
go ahead and move your icons or drag
around anywhere you want the in terms of
things in the bottom you go ahead in
there go ahead and counter transom
there we go down there now is going to
show up right at the top so I'll sort of
your widget list at the bottom we'll go
ahead and go back home from a spec
standpoint it's a 4 inch super amoled
screen it's being powered by a 1.4 gig
erick ship its bottom OS to point out
high megapixel camera on the back with
autofocus and LED flash does have
samsung can you chat on application
essentially that's a multi OS let's say
instant messaging application so think
of it as like what's happened for
example so you could have chat on on
your potted advice if you have chat on
on your iOS device or Android and you
can chat and instant message friends or
BBM if you don't need the blackberry for
example a lot of stuff you can do with
chat on and the great thing about it at
least then it's completely cross
operating system hopefully it'll cross
all the operations as well it's got your
social hub in musica there's all kinds
of music stuff
alibris the things you'd expect Wi-Fi
b/g/n and bluetooth 30 calling rocker
lives right there on the left metal back
here I'm off the closet received from
Samsung speaker nothing on a tough power
and lock fun and the micro USB charging
port in 3.5 millimeter headset jack on
the block then a quick tour of the wave
