of the review alrighty we went through
the basics now let's check out what else
in the Nokia n900 has to offer I'm a guy
who enjoys the simple things in life a
good movie a cold glass of beer and the
occasional new gadget to fiddle around
with the n900 definitely has that new
gadget appeal it feels fresh enough to
keep me interested but let's check out
the software included on the device so
what do you want access to the program's
been you just tap on the icon on the
upper edge of the screen when you hit it
once you've shown the program that are
already open I'll get to this feature a
bit later but now let's check out the
apps the application menu icons are
pretty much the same as on the Symbian
which surprised me a little bit because
not too big a fan of the Symbian icons
it's a matter of taste of course but
some if you have a screen that's capable
of sixteen point seven million colors
why not use a bit more than just five of
them while the icons themselves are
familiar the program themselves have
changed a bit the instant messaging
program is now called the Nokia
conversations and while we're here let's
type a quick message and take the
keyboard out for a spin the keyboard
actually isn't half bad the top row of
the keys does feel a bit cramped but
typing is fast and precise I haven't
come across a device that beats a
keyboard on the touch pro2 but the
keyboard on the n900 has a very similar
feel to it overall it's an OK keyboard
not great but ok the email application
on the n900 is actually pretty
straightforward and functional you can
add several email accounts which is
always nice I think I have about 5
active email accounts right now so I
need a very good system to keep them all
in check and I think the n900 provides
this the only thing that's really
missing is a push email function ok
let's get into the more appealing
features the camera on the device is
what I've come to expect from Nokia it
has pretty much all the functions of
your average pocket camera and it takes
very good pictures at highlight
low-light shots are a bit grainy but
better than I expected
and the flash that's a very good job in
smaller spaces the photos application
has received a functional update it's
much better than the software on the n97
and flicking between pictures is now
fast and easy and as you can see
portrait mode is available in the photos
application the Miami 5 media player
application is actually a three in one
package
EAL it consists of the music player
video player and internet radio the
icons have a nice look and it actually
reminds me of the cross media bar on the
ps3 or PSP the music player is pretty
basic stuff there's a nice catalog of
cover art and the interface seems pretty
solid the stereo speakers on the device
are a bit mediocre they go pretty too
high enough volume flat some thankfully
the inner ear buds that came with the
device are actually excellent and that
32 gigabytes of storage provides
sufficient space for your music catalog
the video player on the device is
actually pleasant surprised not only is
it very functional it supports divx xvid
and h.264 which makes the n900 a very
capable media playing device this kind
of wide support is very rare for a
built-in player so I'm fairly impressed
the 3.5 inch display within sixty point
seven million colors is very suitable
for video playback and the devices
hardware's capable of handling bit rates
up to five megabytes a second without
skipping frames and losing sync of the
audio for the sake of comparison that
n97 had trouble handling bit rates that
exceeded two megabytes a second a new
and very cool built-in app is the
internet radio where we find a nice
selection of channels from around the
world it only takes a few seconds to
connect to a channel and the quality is
actually not bad the internet radio
application seems to work almost
perfectly so it's a nice addition to the
software line-up of a 900 man this song
locks
the nokia obese tour is yet not
available for the n900 which is a bit
disappointing but the device offers a
variety of downloadable open-source
content through the mono application
manager it's not as varied a selection
as what you find in the Android Market
but there is an ok selection of games
and applications alrighty next is a
feature that I've been getting a lot of
questions about in advance how is the
Mozilla browser and yes you heard
correctly the browser is based on the
Mozilla platform most commonly known for
Firefox the browser has flash support
and handles videos nicely loading times
on the browser are I'd say equal to what
I've seen on the upper mobile browsing
even the heaviest of pages is very fast
but there is some boxing meaning that it
can't always handle the content that
screen streamed in but overall browsing
speed feels solid there's no lag when
scrolling down the page and it's precise
and responsive
there's no multi-touch pinching because
it's an old resistant screen but you can
zoom in by twirling your finger but I
kind of prefer the more masculine
DoubleTap which seems to work ok
multitasking is one of the more
advertised features of the n900
and I'm fairly impressed at how it works
as I mentioned when you hit the
applications tab on the desktop you're
first shown the open programs selecting
between programs is as simple as it gets
and the n900 does it with impressive
speed let's find out how the device
handles multiple programs open in the
background alrighty we now have about 16
applications open and the device is
still trading along nicely some minor
signs of slowdown that's expected and I
have to say it's pretty impressive for a
handset on the other hand closing
programs is a bit trickier hitting the
small X's on the open applications icons
can be a bit tricky with fat fingers
like mine so the stylus comes handy once
again but overall multitasking is made
simple and fast on the n900 ok before we
wrap up this review let's check out one
of the more unadvertised features the FM
radio transmitter the transmitter does
what it's called but transmits FM radio
single split you can pick up on any
radio so you can basically have music
playing off your device and receive it
for example on your car radio so what
you want to do is select a transmitting
frequency and set the device to transmit
and then search for the correct
frequency on
and in this case my trusty old coach
coachy it's simple enough to set up and
it seemed to work great and as I
mentioned it works on any device I was
planning on doing a test on my own
crappy car radio but it was actually
paralyzed by the cold so I had to use
the radio on a friend's car
unfortunately no I don't have an image
LCD panel in my own car I wish I did
maybe nokia could sponsor doing this FM
radio transmitter is fantastic but
seriously it is actually very good it
transmits up to five meters for 15 feet
and the sound quality is surprisingly
good
it's a very handy wireless alternative
if you don't have a bluetooth capable
radio but overall I'm enjoying the n900
more that I like the n97 which I think
did not have sufficient of hardware ARM
Cortex processor makes all the
difference the n900 is very fast in
almost every aspect the mom of five
interface was a pleasant surprise it's
not as flashy and elegant as for example
the HTC Sense but the mime of five UI is
very functional icons could be a bit
more finger friendly but the overall
experience is satisfactory the biggest
fault of the device is the lack of
single hand usability but I recently
found out that portrait mode will be
added as an update and early spring 2010
so we'll see how that turns out even
though it's not a perfect device more
work in progress the speed and
functionality of the interface make the
n900 a very solid handset which I can
definitely recommend checking out and
that's pretty much it for my review
catch you later
