by the quad HD display pack in LG g3
you're probably wondering what's up with
the blue background this is our first
video we're filming in our brand new
office our studio is still under
construction so things for like couple
weeks you're going to see different sets
and backgrounds dropped a pop of course
I decided to wear a blue shirt against
our blue wall here because you're
wondering why things are looking just
weird and different over the next few
weeks that's why and of course we get
the office all set up will do a full
office tour what's up everyone walk back
there sowed of asta buffalo miss John
Rangers to show where you can just ask
me any question you got from the
technology and sometimes outside of
technology this week we're going to talk
about the iphone 6 and 6 plus talk about
Ben gate throw a little bit of
blackberry passport in there talk some
about the LG g3 just a lot of tech
questions this is that's the Buffalo
it's gonna get started our first
question comes from the Nathan l boo s
at john for lakers is the bend gate
controversy over radiat we're a genuine
concern we should have a device's get
thinner and thinner hashtag ask the be
so last week our friend loot
unboxtherapy took an iphone six-plus and
showed that it could bend my thought on
it is that video served a point it shows
the phone could bend but people are
worrying about their own phones bending
i would not worry about your own phones
bending at all it would be a 02 0.00001
concern don't sweat it at all don't
worry about putting your 6 plus or six
and tight pants if you were more worried
about putting a lot of bicycle and your
pants or whatever you're doing don't
worry about it all your phone's not
going to bend Apple has had less than 10
reports of actual phones bending phones
are getting thinner but they're also
getting a little bit stronger and more
rigid I get the phone technically could
bend over the chance of yours bending
you have a better chance of getting
struck by lightning while getting bitten
by a crocodile who also has a piranha
attached to its tail next question
coming from Fernando c2k who asked at
John for lakers have the new iPhone 6
and 6 plus made you switch back
iOS as your daily driver hashtag ask the
Buffalo that's a tough one to say as far
as what i use daily am usually testing
phone so i have a hard time you know
finding a phone actually can just use
when i'm not you know busy working and
trying new feature that on device I will
say that I kind of go back and forth
year after year on iOS first android
2014 is really for about Android jaw for
me going back and forth between the one
plus the LG g3 in the Nexus 5 and of
course HTC One m8 I very rarely used the
iphone 5s I've always said though that I
did want a bigger iphone so we've got
the six bus here I'm gonna try using
that injection with another Android
device and to receive something I want
to use as daily basis I will say though
definitely nice to have my message back
next one comes from paramore underscore
VA us at john for lakers would you use
the blackberry passport as your daily
driver a lot of daily driver questions
so we did an unboxing and hands-on with
a blackberry passport help our review
coming up soon but the answer is yes i
could absolutely use as a daily driver I
think blackberry OS 10.3 is leaps and
bounds better than 10m initially
released they added a ton of intuitive
features you can direct download apk is
from google play you've got blackberries
own app store I think it's really
intuitive it's got a physical keyboard a
little bit of an odd design but it's a
really really good phone I think I could
absolutely use absolutely use it as my
daily driver stop the questions for a
quick second here we talk a lot about
phones and our best reviewed phone of
2014 was lgsg through in fact I review I
called it the best android phone i have
ever used if you haven't seen the review
put a link down below to go check it out
it's got a 5.5 inch quad HD display that
looks absolutely gorgeous it's got laser
autofocus I've got a crawling
one-year-old at home who moves faster I
like army crawling style then I can walk
and laser autofocus I can get a really
sharp picture with him I've gotten
really used to the buttons on the back I
love the way the phone feels the display
is absolutely incredible I still believe
that it is the best android phone
available today haven't checked it out
definitely go your career sorts
available on all major carriers and give
the LG g3 a shot next one comes from
hacen MJ underscore at john for lakers
yo John what is the best Katie iphone 6
and 6 plus now that reviewed some cases
for it so I haven't done like any
reviews really ever have looked at to
the case reviewing professionals but we
did have a ton of iphone six-plus cases
in the office from app but we had to
silicon we had the leather ones I
figured I would just do a video shrunk
it look like and I think that the 6 plus
2 i've been using a little bit on the
slippery side and where it's going to
fall out of my hands so despite me
usually go in naked with my phones i do
have a case on my six plus i have the
black leather case from apple aside from
being just stupid expensive i like the
way the case feels like the way it looks
it's got a little bit of a lip on top so
when you drop your phone or put it face
down asaka be resting on the screen i
mentioned in that video though if you
want to see me do more case reviews let
us know in the comments since yeah just
the feedback on that was incredible so
we'll be doing more case coverage so to
get something new i'll be sure to let
you guys know so you guys for watching
