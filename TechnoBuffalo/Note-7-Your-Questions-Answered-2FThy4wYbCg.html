either in our review or the unit that I
bought myself for eighteen t for the
better part of two and a half weeks fin
and see our review will link to it here
so you can check it out but I've been
getting a ton of questions about
specifics about the note 7 so I figured
let me answer your questions about the
note 7 decide whether or not it's the
right phone for you a big problem with
the note 5 it was breaking the s-pen
Sam's like will not let you put it in
backwards generation so not a worry so
pocket bulls didn't depend on on your
pants but for me and just normal dude
jeans it's totally possible I don't
notice that is really being any bigger
than any other phone I've used recently
as far as using with one hand no problem
at all but Samsung does have sort of
one-handed modes and hit a server move
content over to the right side of the
screen to make a little bit easier for
you so yes to both counts battery life
is probably the weakest part of the
phone I generally charge it once
throughout the day just make sure when i
get home i still have a hundred percent
if you don't charge it throughout the
whole day gonna be struggling for
battery life and samsung it seems like
they know this they have some modes
there you can shut off some features
that will save battery life and it will
last a lot longer we're going to lose
some of the things like haptic feedback
an automatic sort of downloading in the
background so you prepared to plug it in
if you can at least once a day other
minor tweaks versus what's on the s7 s7
edge there's some changes in camera some
changes to the settings menu but mostly
it's exactly the same I've been really
hard on texts in the past but I'm
actually using it on my notes ID which
is a weird thing to say usually I throw
the Google now launcher on that right
away but I'm not minding at all i think
the tweaks are actually relatively
useful
so during our review that note 7 oz on
vacations actually I took this with me
to the beach and you're not supposed to
put in salt water I did it's okay as
long as you rinse it out afterwards but
it was totally fine i didn't submerge it
fully on water i took it into the waves
and it was no issues at all with it i
rinsed it out and had not a single
problem so one take to the beach
wouldn't worry i got some sand on it as
well and worked it right off and have
any scratching issues unless the s pen
and something you absolutely have to
have no I wouldn't upgrade so lag has
been one of the biggest questions that
I've had if you look at how much ram the
apps are using it is a huge amount of
RAM usually where the lag is going to
come from a lot of folks have used a
note 7 have experienced lag I have had
any problems with it at all some
problems I have Pat dome that aren't
really lag related sometimes I'll hit
multitasking button it'll show no recent
apps when I have many recent apps open
and sometimes love to reboot the device
at least once a day to get things to
function like I'll try to buy movie
tickets over the weekend to go see
Suicide Squad and the Fen dango app
wouldn't work how to read with the
device it might be AB specific those are
two problems least that I've run into
with the note 7 this is probably the
second most popular question I've had
the note 7 is quoted fooling Gorilla
Glass 5 i've had sand on and i've had no
scratches on it all but i have two
friends that have both cracked their
screams our own Todd Hazleton bought a
device his correct well in his pocket
I'm not entirely sure how that happened
but while it was in his pocket phone
crack another friend robota device about
a very mild drop and that cracked the
back so i guess not the most durable
phone despite being Gorilla Glass 5
maybe that's why manufacturer moving
away from glass I think the advice would
be if you're worried about it probably
pick up a case so a lot of questions
about the note 7 if you didn't watch
review it boils down to this I like the
phone so much I went and bought one and
I don't really buy that many phones I've
loved it up and using as my daily driver
I'm really happy with how its performing
I wish it was a little bit better yeah
we should have a better battery life
wish I had a little more RAM judging on
how hungry android apps are but I'd buy
it again still I've been really happy
with it I'll keep using it and over the
next weeks or months my opinions change
I'll be sure to let you guys know so
next time jon rettinger from
