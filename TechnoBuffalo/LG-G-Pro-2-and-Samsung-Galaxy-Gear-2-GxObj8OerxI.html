to you by netflix what's going on
everyone welcome back there pisode of
rumor roundup I'm here as jon rettinger
and the show title should probably give
it away but this is the show where we
take the best tech rumors from the week
and a smash and bash them into just one
little condensed block of tech rumor
news of this week you HTC One lovers
might be getting some new action this
time in colors LG G pro two might be
getting way bigger and for you one fan
of galaxy gear the sequel went becoming
in March or April there's rumor roundup
let's start rounding things up the HTC
One I've said it over like a broken
record was my favorite phone of 2013 and
being in the tech world what was
favourite then it gets outdated and old
and new things comin looks like the
successor to the HTC One coding the MA
is coming very soon that's not gonna be
coming in the boring silver color that
the original launched in supposedly it's
gonna get for different variants the
story goes like this very well respected
XD a producer and moderator Sheng he
believes the device is going to come in
a variety of delicious flavors much like
skittles the hex code provided by ye
include red dark grey blue and silver
those makes it quite nice for those
early adopters when the HTC One first
launched you can only get in silver and
then black game and you're like hey
that's kind of nice and then there was a
blue version of red version rose gold of
legit gold phone and all kinds of other
options in the folks that might have
wanted some spice variety we're left out
so if you're looking to be an early
adopter than that's HTC one or the HTC
two or the m8 decide to call it will be
had to get it in a variety of colors I'm
thinking the blue one sounds pretty
sweet so LG confirmed on Monday the
successor to last year's optimus g pro
would show its big shiny face sometime
in February march and early in the week
we got a first look at the device thanks
to a pair of leaked photos which are
always the best kind the pictures come
courtesy of Korean forum DC inside which
as much as I looked on this has nothing
to do with comic books and it appears
that the new phablet will offer the same
rear buds introduced with the LG g2 and
the g flex oh oh gee looks pretty
committed
those rear buttons love it or hate it
they're gonna be there but at least they
got that awesome knock feature you just
double tap and it locks and unlocks we
have no way to know exactly how large G
pro 2 is going to be although I port
from last week claimed advice is going
to feature a pretty big 6 inch display
along with a beastly three gigs of ram
quad core Snapdragon hundred processor
so pretty much spec respect the galaxy
note 3 say for a little bigger on the
screen side 4.4 kitkat out of the box
and will come love it or hate it with
LG's you I right on top it seems to be a
broken record theme but Mobile World
Congress coming up soon maybe we'll see
it in Barcelona when Samsung first
unveiled the galaxy gear it looked like
these SmartWatch battles were getting
ready to begin and then we all tried the
galaxy gear and then we quickly took off
the galaxy gear but looks like Samsung
is committed to making the platform
better thinner and adding new features
the successor to the SmartWatch could
launch the next few months according to
a new report from our friends at ZDNet
Korea citing the best kind of sources
unnamed industry insiders sammy's second
SmartWatch will reportedly launched as
early as March or April in 2014 so it's
a few months away at a press event set
to take place in London so we know the
exact place and it's the same place
that's supposedly we're gonna see the
galaxy s5 announcement so perhaps we're
looking at just some synergy or two
separate press events Samsung does like
to do those so according to ZDNet to the
vice will feature a curved screen using
the same flexible OLED display found in
the galaxy round or LG's g flex which is
kind of cool it makes sense for watched
of contour to your wrist the new Galaxy
gear will also feature its new design to
match its curvy sexy screen so I have
high expectations I've been using smart
watches for a little while now I'm
currently rocking the pebble of course
we tried to talk for a while so I'm
optimistic that perhaps this next gen
from Samsung might be pretty awesome you
step aside exhale for a minute to thank
our friends and sponsors at Netflix at
