hello internet and welcome to the
Buffalo bulletin where we recap five
major stories from our site
TechnoBuffalo calm every tuesday and
friday if you're interested in reading
more about any story we talked about on
the show check the description for links

if you have annotations available and
toggled on I'm Ashley sceva hair your
top stories amazon announced three
updates to its kendall line of tablets
this week the kindle fire HD the HDX and
the HDX 8.9 the base model the HD starts
at just 139 bucks for the eight gig
version which is a super compelling deal
for anyone without a tablet at this
point the HDX and the HDX 8.9 are also
really great values for their specs and
it's obvious Amazon is making a huge
kindle play just in time for the
holidays for anybody wondering when
their samsung galaxy s4 s3 or note 2
might get android 4.3 fear not it
appears samsung is testing 4.3 jelly
bean right now on those devices and will
reportedly be rolling out that software
update as early as next month of course
that's also assuming the carriers here
in the States won't completely destroy
that update process and make it really
really slow but it is nice to know that
Samsung is working hard on that much
wanted software upgrade in gaming we
finally have an official release date
for south park the stick of truth it
came with an exciting shiny new release
trailer where all of our favorite South
Park citizens make appearances including
mr. Hankey the Christmas poo and Jesus
you'll be able to get your hands on the
stick of truth December tenth of this
year and it'll be available for xbox 360
playstation 3 and pc Nintendo's 3ds
handheld console also in the news and
for a pretty epic reason it seems the
3ds has finally beaten the all-time
sales record for the original Nintendo
Wii in Japan the 3d esas numbers crossed
12.7 million units which is a really
impressive feat considering it took four
years less for the 3ds to hit that
number than the wii's 12.6 million units
over seven years nice job 3ds and lastly
our grab bag story if you've ever wanted
to work for NASA but always knew you're
too lazy to be an astronaut have they
got a job for you they're paying 18
thousand dollars to valen
tears willing to spend 70 days laying on
a bed of course there is a catch the bed
doesn't sit up and you're laying at a
slight slant so they can study the
effects of zero gravity on normal people
right here on earth you can apply over
at NASA's official website well that's
