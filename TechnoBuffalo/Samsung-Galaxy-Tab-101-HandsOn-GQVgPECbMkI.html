second of Buffalo and I am here in
Barcelona at Samsung's party and it is a
party the Samsung throws a good event
there's a little subdued last year at
Mobile World Congress I wasn't there but
they had like acrobats flying dancers
and all this crazy stuff today there was
a little mellow where they had a an
hour-long presentation people on stage
was like multi-media behind them the
shoes you know projection screen and
they had an orchestra that was half a
string section and half people playing
music apps on their galaxy tab and
galaxy s devices pretty cool but now
it's all cocktails and topless and
devices they launched two devices
tonight the galaxy s2 smartphone and the
galaxy tab 10.1 funny year what's going
on v.i.c tab 10.1 tablet computer andhra
30 dual-core processor nvidia tegra 2 in
fact 1080p video capture and playback 8
megapixel camera on the back 2 megapixel
camera on the front a massive battery
all kinds of stuff enough to be talking
let's go hands-on who was that guy with
the money years anyway
alright so here it is the galaxy tab
10.1 like we said in the intro it's a
honeycomb based device back side shot
here a megapixel camera with a flash you
can see it's got the with Google
branding nice pebbled texture on the
back on the front we've got a front
camera 2-megapixel that visible yet the
rest of the controls on the front are
all on the screen they're not gonna pass
it touch anything like that on one spine
you've got a rocker switch on the top
here you've got a headphone jack power
swish and what looks like the speaker
grills nothing on this side except a
little device that prevents me from
running home with it and on the bottom a
sim card slot and also to speaker
grilles nothing said about availability
pricing or time wise or you know any of
the markets US and Europe anywhere else
in the world but here's the phone here's
the phone here's the tablet and
basically its stock Android it's not you
know Samsung there's a lot of
customization on their android based
phones with TouchWiz and and all that
stuff but i think it's just stock
android here three dot oh it's a 10.1
inch display 1200 x 1280 x 800 full
eight full HD 1080p video recording and
playback powered by that Tegra 2 chipset
inside that what samsung is calling the
dual core application processor and ten
point nine millimeters thin 599 grams
you know just I don't have an iPad here
there's a gentleman earlier comparing it
to an iPad and it definitely is thicker
and you can see it kind of will this
angle is better you can see the the
profile of the device bows out in the
middle and if you look at the back it's
almost like a little recession in the
center there so I think on the back it's
got the thicker on the side to make it
easier to hold because it does kind of
naturally give the finger something to
leverage against over there but then a
little thicker in the middle there i'm
speculating that because of the battery
I don't know it's got a pretty heavy
battery from letting us in at any rate
this is honeycomb you've seen this
before if you haven't you should go
check out the video i did of honeycomb
running on the barnes &amp;amp; noble nook color
but this is real honeycomb this this is
the actual build and you know it's
basically another android skin I mean
there's a lot going on underneath GPU
acceleration dual core acceleration all
that kind of stuff but in terms of the
UI it's another take on you know an
android skin with the little laggy here
Lou there we go you've got your your
multiple home screens
kind of
yeah maybe maybe this prototype had a
little too much Rioja before coming out
to the party because it's definitely
lagging a little bit we'll go to
settings and so you've got your settings
screen you about your multiple home
screens that you can customize with
widgets and apps shortcuts and you know
photo frames and all that stuff the
three three icons system here for
navigating home back and then you can
get your running apps will go to books
here and it's gotten to the e-reader
built in obviously going to be video
heavy with 1080p recording and playback
and all that stuff let's see if we can
actually fire up the camera
no we'll try it in portrait mode
ridiculous
here we go today our front facing camera
that's me what's up and then you've got
other controls here so we turn the
camera the other way we can clip around
to the back camera which is going to get
nothing because pointed down at the
table but I can lift it up and you can
see all the other people trying to get
their hands on the tab so I should wrap
this up if you got all your controls
you've got you know the new honey comb
through dotto Android camera interface
will go to record mode the video record
mode i should say and you got your video
quality settings you've got a YouTube
setting which is kind of neat and again
it'll do full 1080p so there you go kind
of a first hands-on with the samsung
galaxy tab you know it's a call it an
ipad competitor is silly because it's a
tablet there are lots of tablets iPads
here first so you know not first it was
the first to catch the public
imagination servings and we called my
tap competitor now we're scrolling a
little more easily there you go but you
know you've got the power of android 30
all the optimizations and it's a nice
big form factor I love the front-facing
camera video chat it's a killer app for
tablets I think and then Tegra powering
the full 1080p experienced record and
playback very cool it's the samsung
galaxy tab 10.1 live from samsung
unpacked event in barcelona
