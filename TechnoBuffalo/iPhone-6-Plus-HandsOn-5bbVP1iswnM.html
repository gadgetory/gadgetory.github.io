TechnoBuffalo here and see we are taking
a look at the brand new just announced
iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 plus and six like
the 6 plus for your first so big
differences here quite literally you're
looking at a brand new 1080p 5.5 inch
screen a lot of things are new here
including the design if you've got a
glass that wraps around to make the
swiping gestures feel much more fluid it
feels really nice a lot of questions
about how a bigger iPhones would
actually feel in the hand and it feels
like any other 5.5 inch phone here from
design standpoint we've got an improved
touch ID here at the bottom available
and sort of the now three classic Apple
colors on the right hand side is where
your new power and Lachlan is gonna live
your new nano SIM tray the top this band
here is actually your NFC band and right
above it you've got a new and improved a
megapixel sensor the six plus is going
to have oh is your optical image
stabilization they also have now the two
dual tone flash which is found on the 5s
left-hand side you've got it's almost
recess to volume up and down buttons
you've got your profile switch to set it
to vibrate area I'm happy that so here
on the bottom 3.5 milimeter headset jack
the Lightning port and speaker so let's
talk about the UI you can see it moving
all over the phone now does this so this
is Iowa State as we've seen it before
they're talking a lot about one-handed
use said if you sort of double tap touch
ID it'll drop down to do what you want
if you want to close or if you want to
go to a new website you go ahead and do
that again I'm not pushing the button
down I'm simply just double tapping on
touch ID very very lightly here so go
ahead and look you've got now landscape
orientation a lot of people have been
really excited to get their hands on
that here as well we also have a few new
things here like Apple pay see if we can
find
passbook you can see what that is going
to look like here as well so this looks
like similar
Casanova see in the past but now you be
able to use NFC for Apple tapes right
onboard the front-facing cameras also
been improved everything about this
phone has been improved it's lighter it
really is incredibly thin and the screen
is absolutely gorgeous
