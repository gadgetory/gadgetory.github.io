look at the brand new LG Thrill the
newest 4g 3d superphone coming very soon
to ATT wireless LG is going to give us a
quick tour of the device and registered
specs cool all right this is the thrill
for AT&amp;amp;T couple of real cool things
about it is cool we consider our super
phone so what we do is we think about it
this way 3d is a little bonus on here in
addition to it being a super phone so
it's actually running android 2.2
currently right now it's going to be
upgradable to Gingerbread this year a
couple of real cool things about it it's
very like we definitely have some things
that we added in there such as pizza to
be able to customize it create your own
folders so it's a real cool user
interface it makes life a lot easier
it's also very simple to use but the
great thing about it it's actually very
light other cool things that we've done
with the UI is we've added in widgets
shortcuts folders and wallpapers all
with a long hold on here we do have some
exclusive widgets that we've included in
here such as friends plus finance
favorite contacts weather which is
really cool we've also created a folder
content and the reason that's important
in case you don't want your screen all
cluttered you would create just one
folder on their name that maybe
enterprise applications put anything you
want for enterprise or games all in
there and still have a lot of real
estate and this grid that we have right
here represents spot that you could put
whatever icon you but absolutely yeah I
would tap in here into folders I could
actually drive this into any area of the
folder that in the area of the screen
that I wanted to excellent so let's take
a look at some of the stereoscopic 3d
action this guy's got absolutely what
the device uses is to stairs type of
cameras on the back the reason that this
is kind of important is we did a lot of
engineering and thought process into the
distance between the cameras it's
actually two point four centimeters
which is the optimal viewing for 3d and
that's a cool thing it does it actually
self aligned so every single
time that you're done with three data
will result lend itself to make
absolutely sure you're getting the best
3d experience as possible and those
cameras on the back shooting non 3d
it'll use a 5 megapixel sensor and it
can shoot HD video absolutely it will
see shoot 720p HD video for 3d content
1080p for 2d content in 5 megapixel for
your 3d and 2d shots excellent now on
the device itself there's a couple
different ways to get in the 3d you can
have a shortcut on the screen you could
have a widget or the way that I like to
do is we have a dedicated space key for
3d so once we tap this then we're going
to drop into the menu system I know it's
going to be difficult to see on camera
but what happens is the menu system even
comes 3d as well which is nice now one
thing we do have exclusive on the device
itself is our partnership with YouTube
3d the great thing about that is you can
actually record share and view content
on the device itself but the great way
we can do it is once we record a video
on there we can actually simply go in
and share that and upload that onto you
too so any other device currently on the
market you can't upload video to YouTube
3d directly from the device that's
exclusive to the throw the sharing part
is definitely something exclusive to
this world and i will say that the 3d
viewing angle i know if you guys have
seen stereoscopic theater now you saw my
review on the 3d s or the evo 3d this
one has a much wider viewing angle you
don't have to keep your head exactly the
right spot if you move ahead on your
head a little bit or if you're pointing
a game you move your hands a 3d effect
does still stay and you don't get that
headache that you get with the
stereoscopic 3d at least I haven't had
it yet cool now a couple of really cool
things about the camera features on
hunters well is pretty much whether
you're watching a video playing a game
taking a picture you can kind of create
your own 3d content on there so you can
actually go in and tap over here and you
could actually control the depth on how
much depth of 3d that you want on the
device itself so you can have actually
add depth or take away depth so that's
actually to make the experience a little
bit more personal another really cool
thing about the device itself is the
ability to change from 2d to 3d so if I
was going to
take a picture right now what I could do
is I could actually shoot that in 2d and
then i can actually simply go back into
the viewer here and then i can convert
that into 3d and vice versa oh it's game
which is kind of neat so you don't have
to actually go out and shoot two
pictures you can shoot blend picture in
the top of this back and forth and you
can do that vice versa if you shoot a 3d
picture you can talk about it back to
you absolutely and the great thing about
that is if you're trying to share that
picture with somebody who doesn't have
3d content on their phone then they
could view that picture on 2d as well
and the if we were saying shooting a 3d
movie I know it's got a hdmi port on the
side will it put 3d content al Qaeda
teach in my port to a 3d capable TV
absolutely it is stereoscopic so it will
support passive and active technology
via HDMI and that's actually going to
come out in 720p HD excellent now one
thing to bring up is it is going to be
bundled with an HDMI cable in the box a
microchip full HDMI so that's actually
good value as well I went to dry soil
which is cool if we talked a little bit
as you're going through this about the
specs of a device yeah absolutely a
couple of really cool things to stand on
the device this is what we call a tribe
dual configuration so it actually uses
the new texas instruments omap 4430
dual-core 1 gigahertz processor and the
good thing about that is actually very
very fast but our tribe dual
configuration needs it actually has dual
channels until memory as well so each
processor or core can access the memory
simultaneously as well as a multimedia
processor and we're actually using the
power VR sgx544 our multimedia processor
so each of those can access this
memorized will simultaneously making it
a lot faster so you're going to notice
when you're especially near 3d
experiences there's not going to be any
lag whatsoever you can still have tough
running in the background on the device
itself and still into a 3d just because
of that
ability of the device excellent and this
is going to launch with 3d games as well
pre-installed yeah it will we've
actually got a partnership with gameloft
and they've actually got a lot of 3d
content on the device itself so what
you're going to have on it he'll jump
back in here we'll get into gaming is
we're actually going to have Nova it's
going to be pre-loaded on the device
itself you're going to have let's golf
in 3d and you're going to have asphalt 6
is going to be pre-loaded on there as
well and I know game luff is actually
working on a several other games and no
they're working on spider-man Nova too
so they're going to have a plethora of
games going to be available on their
site as well as into the marketplace
excellent and front-facing camera on
here what's the resolution on that
absolutely the front facing camera is a
VGA front-facing camera and the course
in the back is going to be a 5-megapixel
think we do a quick tour of all the
buttons and speaker grills on here
absolutely you're going to have a front
facing speakers up front we've actually
got a VGA camera front-facing on the
side over here we've got our USB
charging port our hdmi out on the back
are our cameras with an LED flash 3.5
millimeter headset jack this is going to
be a power and standby button and on the
bottom down here we're going to have our
3d space key and then these going to be
your volume controls excellent and this
will support hspa+ correct yes it will
excellent thank you very much you're so
welcome
