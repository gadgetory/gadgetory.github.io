to you by Full Sail what's going on guys
m√§rklin Sangin here from TechnoBuffalo
and today we'll be giving you guys our
full comparison between these two
flagship devices Samsung Galaxy Note 4
and iPhone 6 plus two of the most
popular smartphones out in the market
right now I've been using these devices
over the holiday weekend and they're
both great phones but let's go ahead and
see which one is ultimately the winner
the iPhone 6 plus supports a 5.5 inch
1080p display while the note 4 comes
with a 5.7 inch 1440 qHD display iPhone
6 plus is equipped with Apple's latest
dual-core AE a chip clocked in at 1.4
gigahertz with 1 gigabyte of RAM while
the note 4 is equipped with a 2.7
gigahertz Snapdragon 805 processor with
3 gigabytes of RAM the note 4 features a
3220 milliamp battery while the iPhone 6
plus features a much smaller 2915
milliamp battery both feature
fingerprint scanners though the note 4
features in IR blaster a heartrate
monitor and the S Pen the iPhone 6 plus
comes in three different storage options
from 16 gigabytes 64 gigabytes and 128
gigabyte while the note 4 has 32
gigabytes of expandable storage of 228
gigabyte via microSD slot and the note 4
will set you back for $299 with a
two-year contract while the iPhone 6
plus will set you back for $299 for the
16 gigabyte model and that will go up to
$399 to $499 for the 64 and 128 gigabyte
model iPhone 6 plus of course is running
iOS 8 the latest OS from Apple while the
note 4 is running Android 4.4.4 kitkat
with Samsung's TouchWiz skin over it the
note 4 is a well-built phone and it
sports a similar design language to what
we saw in the Galaxy alpha wood it's
metal frame and plastic back that you
can remove to access the battery the SIM
slot and the microSD slot now the note 4
feels like a premium phone and I think
Samsung did a really awesome job
designing this advice from the metal
frame to the Sham ffred edges to the
faux leather back it's the best-looking
Note smartphone yet and finally shows
that Samsung has the design chops to
keep up with today's power players
they're both equipped with fingerprint
scanners and I have to admit it same
things doing a really good job of
improving
technology though it's not as easy and
seamless as Apple's touch ID iphone 6
plus any other hand is just huge it
sports an all-aluminum curved back and a
glass and a front slightly curved
towards the edge of the screen to give
users a more seamless swipe action
however it's just slippery there are
ugly antenna bands in a bag and that
camera humph it's just not as
good-looking as a note 4 despite the
fact that it sports a smaller 5.5 inch
display it's taller than a note 4 and
it's also slimmer which could also
potentially if you're not careful then
when enough pressure is applied overall
I found a note 4 is much much easier to
manage in its slightly smaller footprint
and rectangular design helps a ton when
using a device one-handed now with
Samsung's Super AMOLED displayed the
colors are richer it's more vibrant and
it's definitely much brighter though the
iPhone 6 plus is IPS display however
chose to give users more of a natural
looking color and much better viewing
angles you won't really notice a
difference in clarity or sharpness
unless you look at these two devices
closely and side-by-side but as I use
the note 4 on a daily basis there's so
much to like about this device and every
time I turn on a screen it just comes
alive and I really like that pair that
with its 2k resolution and it's clear
that Note 4 is definitely the better
screen here now the cameras nowadays are
getting better and better and we
actually did a full camera comparison
between a 6 plus and an O for a few
weeks ago which will link down below
this video but just to quickly touch up
on his topic again the note 4 features a
16 megapixel sensor Widow is while the 6
plus features a smaller 8 megapixel
camera would oh is now on paper it
sounds like the note 4 16 megapixel
sensor is superior in this category but
the 6 plus still holds its own when it
comes to image quality there's no doubt
about it the iPhone 6 plus takes some of
the best photos in mobile and Apple did
a really awesome job in this department
and it processes images better than any
phone I've tried the note 4 is great too
but I find that it still tries to over
process images by over sharpening them
which kind of ruins the shot I
personally think the iPhone 6 plus has
the better camera here despite it having
a lower megapixel count it's fine for
the average person and megapixels really
only matter if you want to be able to
print out large photos let's take a
quick break from this video and thank
our friends over at Full Sail as some of
you may or may not know virtually every
industry relies on software technology
and Full Sail University offers
bachelor's degree program that addresses
the need for skilled tech professional
to curriculum that blends code and
theory would real world experience

again that's Full Sail dot edu slash
TechnoBuffalo these are the two best
smartphones out right now and the note 4
quad-core Snapdragon 805 processor what
it's three gigabytes of RAM is plenty
powerful to do everyday tasks like
browsing the web watching videos and
playing 3d games though the iPhone 6
plus is no slouch either it runs on the
latest a8 chip from Apple and it runs
exceptionally well alongside the note 4
now during day-to-day use both phones
are well equipped to handle pretty much
anything you throw at them whether it's
playing games or just watching movies
both can handle tasks no problem
occasionally I'd experience lag on a
note 4 when quickly switching between
apps or using multi window but that's
not really out of the norm and I can say
the same for the six plus I'd experience
random reboots and apps shutting down on
their own and these are some of the
things that we you really can't explain
now when choosing which smartphones to
buy battery life is usually one of the
main factors that consumers are looking
for the iPhone 6 plus features a 2915
milliamp battery while the no.4 features
a bigger 3220 milliamp battery I would
average about a full workday on both
devices which isn't bad by today's
standards the note 4 however lasts just
a tad bit longer than the 6 thanks to
the bigger battery but both are also
running to different operating systems
which we'll get to in just a second the
no.4 also came with its own adaptive
fast charger which can get you enough
juice in 15 minutes to use for a few
more hours which the iPhone 6 plus
doesn't offer so when it comes down to
performance both are tied and they
perform exceptionally well but battery
life definitely goes on to note for for
this one since they're running different
operating system one is running Android
and the other is running iOS both
perform differently now one of the best
parts about using Android is the ability
to customize your device from the lock
screen so to home screen to the
launchers it's great for making your
device your own but the great thing
about the note 4 is using the no fours S
Pen some people use it on a daily basis
and some don't and that's fine but the S
Pen isn't just for writing notes or
doodling you'll be able to do a lot of
different actions like highlighting
particular section on a website which
will translate that into a text and it
could also give you the URL then you'll
be able to jump straight into that site
with just a click of a button now the S
Pen works almost like a mouse on your
phone and if you're doing a lot of
typing cutting and copying this is
definitely an asset
there's also multi window which allows
two apps to run in split-screen and
there are various motions and gestures
that makes a user experience even better
something that iOS doesn't really offer
now the iPhone 6 plus in iOS 8 is no
slouch either it's different from
androids open and customizable OS iOS
offers a much more intuitive and
user-friendly experience that people can
pick up right away Apple software now
offers third-party keyboard support
widgets and Notification Center
continuity which essentially allows you
to use your iPhone iPad and Mac
seamlessly to make the user experience
better the thing I love most about iOS
is iMessage and FaceTime these two are
the main reason why I use an iPhone not
because of its user friendly experience
but because I can use the stock
messaging app to text other iOS users
for free either using my Wi-Fi or a data
network
now it's integration with my Apple
computers at home and at work is great
too everything syncs automatically and
it's something that Android doesn't
really seem to offer out of the box now
there are some messaging alternatives in
a market but my messages might go to
service iPhone 6 plus with iOS 8 also
features Apple pay a new mobile payment
service that uses the iPhones NFC chip
Apple's trying something different with
Apple pay as it uses a unique device
account number to encrypt and securely
store your credit cards through a
dedicated trip in the iPhone it's secure
fast and it uses touch ID to
authenticate payments which is pretty
cool to see for a mobile payment service
if I were to choose an OS I choose iOS
over Android and that's because it fits
in what I do on an everyday basis I use
iMessage a lot to view text friends
internationally and face I'm using the
phone app works without using a
third-party app in the end the Galaxy
Note 4 comes out on top both on paper
and during real world use sure the
iPhone 6 plus offers a terrific camera
and exceptional app ecosystem but the
note 4 ends up offering more in a long
run especially for the power users the
s-pen Ray's experience to new heights
while Samsung's device also offers a
better screen larger battery and memory
expansion support it's also the most
beautiful Samsung phone yet rivaling
even Apple's all-aluminum flagship Apple
may have gone big this year but Samsung
has been doing this for
years and the no.4 is a great example of
how a super-sized phone should be done
