TechnoBuffalo VR we're taking a quick
look at the brand new iPhone 6 plus in
comparison to the nail diminutive
looking iPhone 5s which is a sail
available for $99 on a two-year contract
so here you can see the size different
to looking at a 4-inch screen versus now
a giant 5.5 inch display here on the 6
plus I've got a Retina Display 2 now a
1080p retina HD display here on the new
6 plus other noticeable addition things
that are different here on the back the
camera is now an improved 8 megapixel
sensor which is going to have optical
image stabilization new NFC band on the
back which should make mobile payments
to Apple's new Apple pay much easier
here sort of a redone Apple logo new
material other than that the design is
relatively similar save for that power
button now lives on the right-hand side
a device removed from the top the bottom
so a familiar array of ports that we've
seen before 3.5 millimeter headset jack
lightning and speaker you can see the
differences though between these speaker
grilles they've been a little bit
improvement now larger and gone are
those second rows the screen that's
absolutely gorgeous around the 6 plus
and now rotates for landscape which only
the 6 plus does that the 6 does not of
course the 5s doesn't add they're just a
real quick first look from Apple's
iPhone 6 event of course check us out
