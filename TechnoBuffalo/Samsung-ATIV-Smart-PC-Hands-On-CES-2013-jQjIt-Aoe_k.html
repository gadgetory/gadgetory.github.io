car of CES what's up everyone John
renter from TechnoBuffalo here and we're
reporting from CES 2013 at the Samsung
booth and we are taking a first look at
the achieve smart PC this is a full
intel core i5 power chip so no RT
running the full version of Windows 8
let's take a look at this guy alright so
here you are with the achieve smart PC
this is a full windows 8 capable device
no RT to be found here feels really nice
in the hand this guy again is being
powered by an Intel Core i5 and of
course the full version of Windows 8 the
latest generation Core i5 processor it's
11.6 inch screen full HD so it's 1920 x
1080 it's full SS DF 256 gigs of memory
so plenty of storage here big windows
AIT's got support for 10 at finger
multi-touch this thing has been sitting
out the show floor for a while and has a
lot of applications open and it is
blazingly fast so we can expect from
tablets running the intel i5 line could
be very excited to design is pretty
simplistic slate we've got a vent grill
on the top spot for micro SD for
expandable storage you've got a
full-sized USB 3.0 port they're going to
prevent it from doing on a rotation you
got a button right there you've got a
power and log button microphone 3.5
millimeter headset jack on the left hand
side of device hdmi out volume up and
down on the right hand side we got
nothing on the bottom is where the
magnetic power is going to connect and
two speakers and it's got one central
home button that's going to take you
right back home to wherever you want to
use this has been a really pleasant
experience it's really surprised at how
fast this worked we've seen some pcs
here on the show floor that have not
been nearly as fast this guy is
absolutely humming along after being
used for a full day dinner Cohen to
smooth accessories as well if you've
been considering maybe this guy vs
microsoft surface you might want to
consider that it's got a full keyboard
option here as well if you like the S
Pen they've got on the Galaxy Note 2 or
the note 10.1 you'd go ahead and use
this guy as well to do all kinds of note
esque things
there are cases for it they can actually
put in the back that will give you grip
on the back so you don't drop it and all
kinds of good features here as well
they've locked down our ability to go to
the full desktop so I can't show you
that pic my word for it this guy works
extremely fast we're in the market for a
Windows 8 computer and you want the
power of an intel core i5 chip but the
flexibility of a tablet this guy might
be all you need I'm John renter from
