TechnoBuffalo here if the HTC One m8 Stu
big for you what I have in this unmarked
box might be what you've been dreaming
of this is the long named HTC One mini 2
and it's ready to make its grand debut
let's go ahead and take it out from its
Gotham like box so this is most
definitely not the retail box for the
HTC One mini 2 it's just the press box
and HTC Sense sne if you look at this
phone saying Oh John I want that no US
release plans quite yet it will be
coming to international market so if you
live at international market or a home
market for you for now on the United
States check with HTC so we'll go ahead
and turn or do an unboxing mostly to
give me a hand on hands on because then
really have seen the box but there is
the phone and it looks like a mini
version of the HTC One m8 which is
probably exactly what it should look
like other than anything else just to
HTC cables nothing exciting there so
here is the phone itself with a screen
protector on which means that is fine
whooshing noise time I was not since
that is fine I'm gonna go ahead turn
this phone on for ya we'll come back
I'll do a quick walkthrough and I'll
take you through the phone and voila the
phone is all turned on and I know it's
turned on because the power button
sticks out a little bit sorry how to do
it alright so let's do a quick tour
before I say anything else horribly
inappropriate here is the volume up and
down on the left on the right side
you've got slots for your SD card and
your SIM card slot boomsound speakers on
top and bottom there just like the HTC
One m8 you now have on-screen buttons so
you've got your home button your
multitasking button and your back button
the device on the back looks really
similar and the phone feels really
similar to the HTC One as it should but
you'll notice that it's missing the duo
camera are right there and you can sort
of see the size difference as well I'll
run through all the specs but this is a
4.5 inch phone versus the 5-inch on the
regular HTC One so ultrapixel camera on
the big guy nut ultrapixels here it is a
13 megapixel camera camera though it's
got a 5 megapixel sensor on the front
HTC is in no way moving away from
ultrapixel are so committed to
in order to keep costs down they want
with a more standard normal mega mega
pixel llege tab camera so I move all
that stuff out go home of course you can
see blinkfeed so a 4.5 inch screen to
720p resolution powering it is a
Snapdragon 400 trip its quad-core 1.2
gigahertz clock speed android 4.4 HTC
Sense 60 you get the latest sense here
it's got 16 gigs of storage 1 gig of ram
but as i mentioned you can expand that
up to 128 gigs if you want to the front
facing camera is 5 megapixel again
that's paired to a 13 megapixel sensor
living right there on the back
non-removable battery is here 2100
milliamp hours so looking at the back of
these phones you'll say they look pretty
identical and they feel pretty identical
to threaten see a difference he turned
over to the side you've got plastic bits
we've got metal on the HTC One you see
it on the tops as well and see it all
the way across through till the bottom
so less metal typically equals less cost
and that's what HTC did here but the
metal that they lost really doesn't
affect hella phone feels it feels the
same it's got the nice cold feeling you
get from aluminium or I'll doing them
depending on where you live in the world
you only notice their plastic bits on
the side a really nice phone HTC has
said that's didn't have any US plans now
would not be surprised to this make its
way to us shores it's a really nice
phone folks that want a smaller screen
aren't concerned about the cutting-edge
specs want a nice phone of course it got
boom sound so the sound is going to be
pretty awesome here I'll jump it to
settings and show you what we're going
to have here but again I mentioned what
it is will go to about will check out
the software information so sent six
android 4.4 point2 all here on board
other than that it's a typical HTC
experience to say it's very elegant
works well you've got as i mentioned
sent six you've got the new blinkfeed
here and all kinds of other goodness
that you would expect from a modern HTC
phone you guys if you want to see more
coverage on this you want to see a full
review or just same phone but smaller
I'll leave the comments down below love
to hear your thoughts on or anything
else you guys want to see on this guy
again be sure to let us know and just
before i leave you let me show you just
a real quick sort of full comparison
tune the two phone so again five inches
versus 4.7 i can see here they are back
to back again
daddy and son and then if we make a HTC
sandwich here I can see what those who
look like right there soon you guys
please heed the comments down below if
you want to see more coverage on the
mini in fact looking at this kind of
hard to see which ones which ready real
quickly which ones I'm moving around so
you can tell which ones which by looking
at real fast ready ready which adds a
mini on go I could probably tell it to
the smaller but fun games anyway again
