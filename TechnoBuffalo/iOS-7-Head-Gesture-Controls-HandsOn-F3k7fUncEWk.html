technobuffalo we're here checking out
head gestures in iOS 7 beta 2 for the
iPad this is a really interesting thing
that somebody noticed the other day it's
actually an accessibility option so it's
not something that you would use in
everyday life but it's still interesting
to take a look at so let's have a look
at what it does so here we are in our
iOS 7 beta 2 for ipad software we're
going to check out settings and from
here we're already in general so we
don't have to go much farther than that
but we're going to go into accessibility
so once we get in there there's a lot of
options that are available to us we can
shut off parallax things like that
there's also a physical and motor option
which is down here so you can see the
very first one is switch control so
we're going to check this out now switch
control lets you use your ipad by it
will actually cycle through and
highlight items on the screen and you
can activate them through an adaptive
accessory or you can actually now do it
through head movements so if we go to
switches you can see we can select an
item so if we want to you know activate
a switch on your input device now or
enable built-in switch so here's
different control switch control by
tilting your head to the left or right
so we're going to pick right head
movement and we can actually add other
switches like select item scanner menu
restart the scanning skip to next item
step two previous item and stop scanning
you can also do system switches so we
can also do that if we wanted to say
activate Siri I use the home button
things like that we would be able to
choose those actions so if we wanted to
do that we could do left head movement
for that so you can see select item is
right head movement and the home button
is left head movements which and if you
had any other accessories for your iPad
that were accessibility based you'd be
able to use them here and add switches
accordingly so we're going to use those
so we have select items right head
movements which and home button as left
movements which so once we do that we
can switch ON switch control and usually
we'll give you a popup menu the very
first time you activate it but we've
already done that so now you can see
that it will start toggling through and
if we wanted to choose something we
would be able to do a turn of our head
which if we want to go home we would go
to the left and then if we wanted to
choose a group of apps we would go to
the right so let's say we wanted to go
into our clock so now we've gone into
the clock setting and we can check out
all of our different times and so you
can see here all your different clocks
and if we want to go back to the home
screen of course we would just go left
and now it's taken us back to the home
screen but it's really basic super
simple but also a nice feature to see on
iOS 7 any time we have expanded
accessibility options it's always great
for people who need it I don't see this
being used for anybody who in everyday
life does not need the accessibility
options but like i said it always is
nice to see those extra expanded options
especially when people really want or
need them and that is a switch control
for iOS 7 beta 2 on the ipad</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
