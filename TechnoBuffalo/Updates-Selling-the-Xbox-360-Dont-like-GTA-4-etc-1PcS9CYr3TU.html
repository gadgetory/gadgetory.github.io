well so i came into a sad realization
today think it's time for me to sell my
xbox you know I've got the ps3 that I'm
using for a blu-ray player I just don't
see you need to have the l3 consoles the
ps3 xbox and the weed you know with the
ps3 having pretty much the same games is
the xbox and the wii being so different
the xbox kind of odd man out i was
thinkin bout sellin the wii but you know
maybe i'll keep it around so for all you
guys that saw my rock band unboxings
whether xbox stuff it's going away at a
dodo yeah i think it's a great system
just using the PSP for blu rays or just
wasn't much of a reason to have both so
I know I'm gonna get flamed by all the
you know the xbox guys and then
something it's a great system it's not a
knock on it I just don't need all three
of them so the xbox going out the window
and on another note i did buy grand
theft auto for the plays asian I'm not
gonna lie i don't like it i never played
any of the other grand theft auto game
so i don't know maybe it was just me but
just not my cup of tea so probably going
to go return to gamestop or one of those
places so anyway guys just did a real
quick update say goodbye xbox play a sad
sound anyway umm Danah thought my
business school essays all my
applications are in so i got some free
time now which is nice haven't had that

some more work on the website with all
my free time and I hope you're doing
well and I will talk to you guys soon
