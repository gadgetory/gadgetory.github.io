to you by netflix welcome back to
another episode of renters rancis to
show where I jon rettinger rant and rave
on anything from the world of technology
sometimes a little bit outside the world
of technology I've been very angry and
past weeks ranting about Android iOS
Windows Phone 8 this week coming up on
Thanksgiving I want to do until a change
of pace and talk about what I'm thankful
for in the world of technology and
outside of road technology this is right
just rants let's go and get started so
there is a lot in this world that I am
very thankful for the world of
technology the first and foremost thing
that I'm thankful for is a technobuffalo
audience for you I'm talking to you
sitting there with your hand and your
head on your left hand I am talking to
you thank you for your support thank you
for watching TechnoBuffalo videos thank
you for reading the content on the site
thank you for sending us messages on
Twitter looking at us on Facebook thank
you for whatever you are doing to help
support TechnoBuffalo I can't tell you
how much I and the rest of staff
appreciates it the fact you visit the
site gives us jobs in fact you watch the
videos keeps us employed food on our
table you guys give us all the
opportunity to live our dreams it is a
very rare opportunity for someone to
live their dream essentially monetize
their passion and I've been able to do
that because of you so first and
foremost I am very very thankful for you
even the trolls out there I am thankful
for you guys as well just this week next
week though not so thankful I'm also
thankful for my tablet the tablet i am
using most as my daily is my ipad mini i
take it everywhere i go i am that guy
that always has the ipad out and about
I'm thankful I lets me watch my videos
catch up on videos and colleagues and
friends are doing watch car videos when
I'm laying in bed I'm happy that I can
take my whole internet with me anywhere
I go that's really true for any tablet
but the one I'm using right now is the
ipad mini so I am extremely thankful for
that guy I've ranted about this in the
past but this is something I'm thankful
for for the crazy number of phones that
come out on a weekly basis I know it's
super sucks for a consumer I was looking
to buy a
and there's 19 versions of every phone
coming out every other month I'd be
super pissed off but I am happy because
it lets us play with the latest and
greatest stuff it lets us share with you
our opinions and it lets us play with
new technology so I'm thankful for the
opportunity be able to play with the new
stuff that comes out I still cannot
believe that companies send us these
products I used to go out and walk
around best buy and play them the store
I walked to the apple store or anywhere
I was going just play at these products
it is just astounding to me I am
especially thankful for battery life
fact that things are lasting longer I
could play video for 10 hours I could
play video for 97 hours whatever it is
I'm thankful that battery life is
getting longer and better I'm also
thankful for wireless inductive charging
whether it's the cheese standard which
is just Qi strange it's pronounced cheat
or any other inductive charging I eat
plugging stuff in I don't mind plugging
in the pad putting my phone right on top
of it I'm hoping that that's gonna make
us way too many many many other devices
in the near future I'm also thankful for
NFC and wireless payments I'm hoping
that's looking to become really the way
to pay i love using Google Wallet tapped
my phone and running out if you can tell
I'm seems super lazy I don't like to
plug the pin I want to take out my
wallet I'm probably gonna be having a
car drive itself in eight years I'm just
thankful for being able to use
technology in new ways I'm also thankful
for new technological advancements in
the world I'm thankful for electric cars
and not for the reason you might think
not for the green reason certain anybody
who says my electric car cuz they're
green buying any car new is not a green
thing it certainly increased your carbon
footprint the carbon it takes to build a
car create electricity depending on what
grid you're on what state on how to
clean the grid is by am thankful for the
incredible ridiculous awesome torque
that goes into electric cars at least
most electric cars most electric cars
that instant torque I'm thankful for
keeping with my tune of not liking to do
stuff I hate going to the gas station I
love that I could plant in my driveway
every morning and know that I've got
essentially a full tank of gas
equivalent I can go anywhere that I want
let me step aside from being so thankful
for a minute to thank our friends and
sponsors at Netflix
