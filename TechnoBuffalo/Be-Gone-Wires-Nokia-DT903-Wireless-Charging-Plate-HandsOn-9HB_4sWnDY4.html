from technobuffalo and today we're going
to be checking out the nokia dt 903
smart wireless charging plate and it
comes in three bright colors white
orange and green the one we have right
here you can pick one up from the
Microsoft Store for 59 99 so what makes
this different from a standard qi
wireless charger well if you're using a
lumia device such as a lumia 920 the
Lumia 810 or any lumia device that
supports qi wireless charging you'll be
able to pair your device either through
NFC or Bluetooth 4.0 and once you've
done that it'll trigger a handful of
cool features within the charging plate
including a neat brief pattern letting
you know you need to either charger
phone or check it for missed calls and
messages now right below the charger
there's a button you can press to change
the intensity of the light and there are
three brightness levels you can choose
from and of course you can always turn
off the light if it bothers you or
people around you but come on what's the
fun in that right now there's also an
app within device hub that'll allow you
to change a few settings like when you
want the lights to turn off and how each
app will behave whenever you receive
notifications now the nokia dt 903
charges via USB cable and what's awesome
about this is you'll be able to use
pretty much any USB hub to charge your
device including your laptop so once
your device is fully charged the
notification light will turn off
automatically letting you know your
phone is fully charged and you're ready
to go the nokia dt 903 isn't just for
lumia devices if you have an android
device that has qi wireless charging
capabilities i have the nexus 5 right
here you'll be able to charge it like
you would on any qi wireless charging
pads you can also charge a device like
the Moto 360 which is super convenient
however you won't be getting the cool
notification pulses whenever you receive
notifications or whenever your battery
is low unfortunately that's only a
Windows Phone exclusive if you're
looking for a very cool qi wireless
charging plate and don't mind shelling
out sixty dollars i don't see why he
wouldn't go with this one it's beautiful
looking and the colors really pop
specially at night so what do you guys
think are you guys interested in paying
sixty dollars for a wireless charger let
us know in the comments down below and
