Apple updated their ipod nano line to
include video camera and video capture
capabilities there's been a lot of talk
about how the minuscule nano is going to
stack up to the king of the quick video
recording he'll the flip minnow in this
case the flip mino HD before we get to
the comparisons and put them
side-by-side see how they look let's go
run through the specs very quickly first
we have the ipod nano which will run you
149 for a gigabyte model or 179 for a 16
gigabyte model it's got a 2.2 inch
diagonal display that can show pictures
or videos whatever you're looking at at
a 240 by 376 resolution records video at
640 by 480 at up to 30 frames per second
does not capable of taking still
pictures by the way that's been a point
of contention so in the other corner we
got the flip mino HD this sucker is
going to run you 199 for a 4 gigabyte
model it's got a 1.5 inch diagonal
display which shows this video at 528 by
132 and it really the most important
feature is that records in HD at 1280 by
720 let's go ahead and put these two
side-by-side first video you're going to
see is the ipod now alright so this is
the ipod nano we're going to use
mercedes again as our test subject so
you can hear the audio you can see the
video quality i'll give her some pets so
she doesn't feel lonely you can see what
it looks like with the nano overall
quality is generally pretty impressive
especially for such a small and
inexpensive device so give another
couple seconds of video here guys can
see again what the quality looks like
she likes me scratch your butt next up
let's take a look at how the flip mino
HD compares to the Nano so here is the
flip mino HD shot in exactly the same
place at exactly the same time of day
with the same amount of lighting you can
see what the quality of the video looks
like and once again Mercedes is our test
subject so you can hear the audio
quality you can see what it looks like
thank you's a little bit shy from being
on camera what do you think she'll of
scratches so here is again the flip
minohd HD
so as you can see there is a significant
difference in the quality between the
nano and de flip mino HD and that's to
be expected the minnow HD is a
standalone video recording device
usually only function is to record HD
video and it does it very well in a very
thin package also has that built in USB
connection the nano on the other hand is
really a jack-of-all-trades even coming
in at a lower price point it's video
recording capabilities as you can see
are actually relatively impressive when
you take in consideration of size of
device you can put them side by side I
mean there's really no comparison as to
how they stack up I think that the video
recording on the Nano is certainly am
not as good not up to par with the
minnow HD I think that the audio quality
on the Nano though is actually as good
if not better than the minnow of HD the
Nano is a lot of things it's an iPod
it's a pedometer it's a voyage reporter
it's now a video recorder it's got a lot
of functionality for a very very very
slim price so if you're looking for a
device that does a little bit of
everything if you want to make sort of
some short YouTube videos you're not
concerned about HD quality then I think
that the well I think the Nano is a
great way to go if you're only looking
for device that records video and you
really want HD quality well then the
minnows going to be a good way to go if
I have to pick one I'm going to go with
the one that I can do everything on and
I gotta take banana so you guys agree or
disagree would you rather have the
minnow HD we'd rather have an ipod and
be a little bit of everything for you
leave a comment or video response if
you're curious as to what you guys think
i'll see you guys in the next video for
