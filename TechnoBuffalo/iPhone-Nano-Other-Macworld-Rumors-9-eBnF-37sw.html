lakers calm here mackerel is quickly
approaching tomorrow which is january
fifth let's give you guys my final
thoughts and predictions on some of the
hottest rumors that are coming out so
the first thing that everybody's been
here about is this iphone nano you've
seen it on cases you've seen it a listed
on websites really there's a lot of buzz
building about a potential iPhone nano
but what nobody's seen are actual images
of his iphone nano all the information
people are going on are just listings on
case manufacturers websites so here's
why I think Apple might make the iphone
and here's why I think Apple may not
make the iphone nanyem so why I think
they might simply market penetration
they can really open up new avenues and
expose themselves to a myriad of new
customers if they come out with an
iPhone nano at an obviously lower price
so let's say there's a $99 iphone nano
you now have much many more people that
are available to buy it perhaps alee be
on another carrier even no one really
knows what the exclusivity clause an
AT&amp;amp;T contract was it may have been
limited to a certain screen size device
or may have been limited to a capacity
device so they may have flexibility not
to bring a device to verizon even
possibly t-mobile or sprint a complete
cdma iphone nano is definitely a
possibility and they would have
conceivably the flexibility to do so so
you never know that's one reason that
Apple may make an iphone nano so here's
what i think they might not make an
iphone you know first of all developers
of the app store everybody's in the app
stores and developing apps with a
certain screen size and a certain
resolution if suddenly there's a smaller
screen none of those apps are going to
work developers would have to develop
two separate applications or ones that
are unique only to the iphone nano ones
that are unique only to the regular size
iphone so also another reason that
they're going to do it is possibly cause
a brain delusion you know you look at
manufacturers like motorola and LG to
have these free $99 phones you know they
also have some expensive
devices but you don't look at them as
high-end manufacturers or these most
consumers don't I think Apple has the
aura of a high-end manufacturer and they
may lose that a little bit if they
really such a low-cost device so i don't
know if Apple is gonna release an iphone
nano certainly I would wager on them not
but i would definitely think that
there's going to be some sort of iphone
evolution coming at macworld whether
they're gonna announce some new features
for software maybe the three-point o
software whether they may even announce
what the next iPhone is going to look
like you're some features of the next
iPhone you know it's not out of the
realm of possibility I think there will
be some significant iphone news maybe
we'll see the features you've all been
clamoring for copy and paste mms who
knows with us what i think is going to
be coming out of map roles in the iphone
marketplace so some of the other hot
rumours here are that the complete ilife
suite is going to go online in the cloud
the mobileme cloud if you will so what
this will enable people to do is use the
great I life sweets if you don't own a
mac so it'll open it up to the PC world
it'll create another avenue for people
to see how great a poner software is and
possibly transition over purchasing
their own mac themselves also you'll
also you may run into problems though
with online storage you know I know in
my imovie here on my imac I deal with
files that are one two three sometimes
even four gigabytes that i'm editing
down be a hard time to upload that
online and then start cutting it and
editing it and also what if you don't
have an internet connection what if i'm
on an airplane i won't edit my videos
you know i want to edit my pictures and
my whole ilife suite is online can I
wonder if maybe there will be a desktop
version and an online version that's
possibly a light version you know I
think that something is going to happen
online a lot of software is moving in
that direction but I wouldn't expect a
fully functional ilife suite to be
available online I think you'll always
be something designated for the desktop
I think we're going to see redesign mac
mini that seems to certainly be few
where the transition is heading it's
going to look at least from what I'm
gathering like a cross between an iMac
and a macbook and a little bit of time
capsule and airport extreme thrown in
there reports are saying it's going to
have a lip around the outside which will
be for ventilation it's also it's going
to hide the CD drive and supposedly the
new mac minis are going to be esata
based meaning you can swap out the CD
drive and put in another hard drive if
you're using it for a server or need
more storage or you just don't need a CD
drive so I would definitely look for
that possibly even do a monitor support
has been rumored so I would for sure
it's a hundred percent new mac mini I'll
also expect to see a redesign or at
least revamped imac it's been long
overdue maybe it'll even have Intel's
quad-core processor you know that maybe
not i think maybe that might go to the
mac pro which I also think we'll see a
redesign but I definitely think the mac
pros will see the quad core imac should
see definitely a speed bump and possibly
new case design perhaps something
similar to what Apple did with their new
cinema display so speaking of cinema
displays I think we'll see different
size of cinema displays I think we'll
see perhaps a 20 inch and maybe even as
big as 30 like Apple used to have I
think the 17-inch MacBook Pro will go
the way of the 15 inch in the macbooks
it'll get the glass back it'll get the
glossy screen the black trackpad and
more importantly the nvidia graphics
card so i would expect that to be a
foregone conclusion we may see new
designs to an iPod shuffle we haven't
seen may seem new designs to the ipod
classic or two very least spec bumps and
possible price cuts so guys are just my
thoughts for what's coming up tomorrow
used to be only Steve knows now it's
only Phil knows but just wants to share
them with you anyway whatever you guys
think might be coming up be sure to go
ahead and leave a message down below or
leave a video response to put talking
about tablets and bigger ipod touches I
don't know about those for certain don't
know about anything for certain actually
but I would say those are in the
significant river category these are
more of the things that I think will be
certain and should be expected so guys
hope you enjoyed jon rettinger with john
