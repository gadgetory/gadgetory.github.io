and from TechnoBuffalo and on today's
episode of rumor roundup we'll be
talking about Sony's Xperia z5 ultra
samsung's new Galaxy Note 5 active
Apple's iPhone 6s and iPad pro as well
as Microsoft Surface pro 4 and new
flagship Lumia devices this is rumor
roundup let's go ahead and get started
last week we learned that Sony could
pack its allege Xperia z5 ultra with a
4k display now a new leak seems to
confirm the company's branding plans for
the super high-definition smartphone
digi well reports that Sony will push
the Xperia z5 ultra as a 4k x-reality
device the company already uses similar
branding for its 4k TV so it's not out
of the question then again we're still
not convinced that there's any real
advantage to packing in that many pixels
unless you're planning on using the
device as a part of a virtual reality
headset like Google cardboard or gear VR
based on earlier leaks Xperia z5 ultra
is also expected to pack a Snapdragon
810 processor and a fingerprint reader
an alleged image of the device also
suggests it will offer a pretty standard
sony design with curved edges in an
overall industrial look however there's
still no word on when the Xperia z5
lineup will actually arrive though it's
possible Sony could unveil a few new
phones next month at its big IFA press
event if that's the case it looks like
the company may be reverting to a six
month release cycle after a pretty messy
launch for the Xperia z4 earlier this
year Microsoft will allegedly in vil a
new surface tablet two new flagship
Lumia phones a second-generation
Microsoft band and more at a hardware
focus event in October previous leaks in
chest a company is prepping a Lumia 950
in lumia 950xl the larger device
codenamed city man could pack a 5.7 inch
1440 by 2560 pixel display a 20
megapixel camera three gigabytes of RAM
USBC and run Windows 10 the smaller talk
man will allegedly offer similar specs
but with a smaller 5.2 inch display as
for the surface pro 4 the design
apparently won't change much compared to
the pro 3 however it could still pack a
sharper display in a slimmer or lighter
form Microsoft is also expected to add
some sort of Windows hello support that
could be a camera for face recognition
though a fingerprint reader may be more
likely we still don't know much about
the Microsoft band 2 we just
hope the company can offer a sleeker and
more comfortable design it's also likely
to run an updated operating system based
on Windows 10 finally Microsoft could in
vail a few surprised devices as well a
surface mini is possible though that may
just be wishful thinking what a river
also claimed an Xbox one mini will be
announced as well but we're not
expecting any gaming console news at the
upcoming event the iPhone 6s and veiling
is likely just a few weeks away and now
we may know when the device will launch
- a new report out of Germany claims
carriers are set to start selling apples
at smartphones on Friday September 18
just a little over a week after the
company's rumored event on September 9
Germany is typically one of the first
countries to get Apple products along
with the u.s. the UK France Australia
Canada Hong Kong Japan and Singapore the
iPhone 6s and 6s Plus are expected to
introduce forced touch to Apple
smartphone series along with a new a9
processor 2 gigabytes of RAM an improved
12 megapixel rear camera and a 5
megapixel front-facing camera Apple
could also be releasing a 12 point 9
inch tablet later this year with a
resolution of 2048 by 27 32 but
according to recent reports the device
won't arrive until the 4th quarter of
the year according to the G times Apple
recently picked sharks is applied to
this place for the iPad pro Foxconn will
take care of the touch modules
lamination and assembly while Samsung
and Taiwan based firm TPK could also
provide some extra hardware to fill in
the gaps beyond its 12 point 9 inch
display Apple is also expected to offer
a stylus to go with the new tablet but
according to KGI analysts maangchi quote
the new stylus could ship is an optional
accessory and offer forced touch support
the iPad pro likely won't arrive until
October when Apple typically reveals its
new tablet so I guess we'll have to wait
a few more weeks until Apple's rumored
event on September 9 to find out more if
you like the galaxy note 5 but what
should pack a bigger battery well we've
got some good news phone arena reports
that Samsung is already prepping a
Galaxy Note 5 active with a massive 4100
milliamp battery the rugged version of
the Samsung phablet would also come with
an IP 68 waterproof rating it's
allegedly set to launch the week of
November 8th as an ATT exclusive and
that's all we know for now though it's
easy enough to make some educated
guesses about the Galaxy Note 5 active
the new device is anything like the
Galaxy s6 active it will
that a sleek metal design for a tougher
plastic and rubber build you may also
get three physical buttons in front but
overall we actually think Samsung's
latest active phone looks pretty nice so
hopefully the company won't change too
much for its note by variant
when it comes to the specs the galaxy
note 5 active will likely offer the same
5.7 inch quad HD display the same Xu no
7420 processor 16 megapixel camera and 4
gigabytes of RAM of course it's possible
Samson can change the hardware a bit but
hopefully we'll learn more soon though
it looks like the new phone won't make
its official debut for at least a few
more months
