lakers calm here with an unboxing for
you of the treo pro by palm it's an
unlocked device it's not out on any
carrier so you have to buy it direct
from palm and it's unlocked for gsm
networks so if you're in the US AT&amp;amp;T and
t-mobile 3g lonely work for AT&amp;amp;T by the
edge will work fine on t-mobile I
explain more of the video enjoy the
unboxing and use it for a little while
and give you guys a nice fat review have
a good one I guess one last thing this
is recorded before the minnow HD so
ignore the black bars over here you
can't see my hands but goes behind the
black bars by yes alright guys let's go
ahead and get to the unboxing here is
the palm treo pro is available directly
through palm and only able to be
purchased as a gsm unlock device meaning
it has not been picked up by any carrier
yet and this is right now a gsm-only
device some real quick specs on it it's
got a 320 x 320 screen so it means it's
square it has hsdpa UMTS so that means
it's 3g compatible it's actually only 3g
compatible with AT&amp;amp;T network you can use
it with tmobile but you'll only get edge
speeds it's got Wi-Fi built-in gps
bluetooth 256 megabytes of memory a 2
megapixel camera removable battery micro
USB port 3.5 millimeter headset jack
have a bunch of other goodies it really
is a feature-packed windows mobile phone
so without any further ado let's go
ahead and get to the unboxing so here's
the box it's got a picture of the device
it's kind of got a weird slant to it
it's actually if you hold it up sit sit
a little bit of an angle it's kind of
neat assign a device just lists list the
specs err on the side of the box the
back back view of the device and the
side some more specs on it it really
does have a very high quality field of
the box since it's being sold directly
from palm they don't have to agree to
any carrier specifications for boxing's
they really were able to do their own
thing and they really did a nice job it
has
very nice feel to it reminds me of
opening an apple product for example so
it's got this sleeve that slides out
here we've got the box again go ahead
and open this up we're going to break
the seal down here piece of tape and
there we are with the device there's
some orange like some orange a styrofoam
up top and presented right here with the
device will put that off to the side for
just a second there's a hard plastic
shelter pull that back I'm getting
started guide with palm with the corner
push in so you can grab it let's see
what's in this getting started guide
here a packaging is really nice
definitely feels like you're opening a
quality product so just some information
on device looks like some information on
Windows Mobile we've got us recycling
program so I'm recycle some old phones
and inside there's a sheet of plastic
here it says palm on it if you can see
and hear all the accessories actually
kind of laid out with this weird orange
paper let's see what we get in the box
we've got a USB connector it looks like
it's micro USB it's not mini USB but
it's nice to see palm go with some sort
of standard we've got like that's where
the power cord plugged in there's a u.s.
one so it probably just pops right in
for charging and they also included a
3.5 millimeter set of headphones which
are palm branded very nice pull that out
of the box kind of slinks out of there
and there's some legal information down
there at the bottom go ahead and take a
quick look at the phone itself it's got
a really nice feel to it just on initial
my first initial a touching of it it
feels very high quality it's got very
glossy looks like it's probably gonna be
a fingerprint magnet you go ahead and
zoom in a little bit here so you guys
can see it all right it's got a full
run facing Cordy keyboard very similar
the other palm devices this is a little
break from palm to go from their bulky
kind of crotch poker design with the
antennas to a really sleek thin design
or they have to give them credit looks
very nice let's go ahead and compare it
to some other devices that are popular
right now you've got the obligatory
iphone comparison and we've got the
just-released blackberry storm problems
for next to each other you can see that
the treo pro really stacks up actually
quite nicely with them all so in a real
quick size comparison the treo pro is
definitely a little bit narrower than
the iphone that looks to be almost
identical thickness wise next to the
storm it's for me a little bit less and
narrow and it looks a little bit thinner
than the storm two as well so guys I'm
going to go ahead and use a device for a
few days and give you guys a full review
on it but I'm very impressed with palms
design on this just on initial
impressions they really did a solid work
with it so let's actually it's walk
through the device reel faster so we've
got a full qwerty keyboard on the front
we've got a send button a end button
you've got your windows button a
calendar button a mail button and an
okay which is essentially a back button
on the top of the device you've got the
obligatory palm ring to vibrate switch
and a power switch on the left side of
the device we've got a volume up and
down toggle and a soft key and on the
right side of the Vice looks like we've
got a voice dialing key on the back
there's your micro USB in your 3.5
millimeter headset jack a little bit
weird is on the bottom and on the back
there is your camera with the nice palm
branding and it's like there's a little
speaker grill there too it did really
nice to see a phone without any carrier
branding on it i really enjoy zinc just
a phone the way it was meant to be so
guys like i said before i'll go ahead
and do or use this for a while and give
you guys review hope you enjoyed jon
