TechnoBuffalo calm i'm here at the US
launch event for the sony ericsson
xperia play which is not officially but
unofficially known by some people is the
playstation phone basically it's Sony
Ericsson's the android phone with a
slide-out gaming keypad and we saw this
in barcelona i was there a couple weeks
ago we did hands-on video a thumbs on
videos we called it with some of the
titles for the phone and this is the
official US launch event come down on
verizon in the US rogers up in Canada
very soon but you know instead of
showing you more hands-on footage with
the device which you've already seen we
got something little special for you i'm
here at the pro gamer this is a this is
Walshy as he goes by dave walsh he's a
pro gamer he's a halo pro he's on the
what do you call it the major league
gamer torrent major league gaming
coaster major league gaming pro circuit
he's got some sponsorships he's living
the dream he's doing the whole thing
we're going to talk to him a little bit
about the xperia play device what do you
thinks of it and also just you know a
little taste of what it's like to be a
pro gamer yes um like you said my name
is a wall shoes I'm 26 years
old grand rapids michigan and i've been
fortunate to make good looking at video
game in the last six years so a lot of
its go to tournaments i'm just going to
step up a bit to reinforce the point you
met you make your living playing video
games yes yeah i living not designing
them not creating them i actually
legitly get to play good be in the video
games so so I'm guessing I'm guessing if
we hooked up on you know on playstation
or xbox live you could beat the stuffing
out of a hollow be honest with it
lightly putting light looking to be much
worse lad fair enough so so what brings
you here to this event actually just
announced the sponsorship with sony
ericsson so i'm going to help represent
the expedia xperia
and it's a great partnership because as
you've known or is it as you've seen
with the phone this is the first
smartphone that actually has gaming
capabilities that someone like myself
would like to see we were talking about
this earlier and the d-pad just having
you know having the PlayStation controls
on it a familiar set of controls where I
you know I know where the buttons are I
know what they do and on top of that
having the analog something that's brand
new to any sort of smartphone having
analogs where if you'd like I could love
gain when you think of a 4 inch LCD
there are a lot of their phones that
might have similar sizes but you won't
give you let utilize that my phone you
know my thumb's are taking up for you
know quarter inch your full inch of the
sides of the screen right I don't get to
use it regret you've got the whole
screen for game and have greater
controls down below it like I said it's
like the perfect smartphone you got
newest Android platform you have analog
sticks which has never really been done
on any sort of home I mean it's just
going to set the standard this is just
gonna cover pretty much go above and
beyond what anyone whether your casual a
hardcore gamer is going to satisfy your
gaming needs it's going to make you
actually want to play games on it or
actually give you the ability played
games that you want to play on it right
right I think it's that last thing you
know everybody whether we admit it or
not we all want to play games we need to
find games you want to play so speaking
of playing games you know if you make it
you make a living playing games what's a
ski for trade secrets or secret sauce
but I mean what's it like to be a pro
gamer you are you on the road all the
time or you plug into your console I'm
on the road about third of the year that
includes laning tournaments sponsorship
appearances
so traveling quite a bit there's a lot
of sacrifice to be paid but i mean i
can't complain i play video games real
ensue so you're out here in San
Francisco right now you're not from San
Francisco no you're on the road where do
