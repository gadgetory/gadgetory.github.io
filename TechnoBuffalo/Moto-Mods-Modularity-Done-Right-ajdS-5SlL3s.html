their modular g5 they're about to get
some competition the modular front with
moto mods for the Moto Z and the Moto
z-force you'd have to remove any
physical part of the phone to get the
phone to be male which means you still
get a light form of waterproofing here
well the Novo did was as pins to the
back of the phone that these mods get
hook onto and there are a few decent
ones at launch we've got a JBL sound
booth speaker with 10 hours of battery
life got a moto instant share projector
the built-in kickstand and of course
probably the one everybody wants battery
packs I suppose unique designs are
designed by kate spade and to me it
looked at clunky they do add
functionality I'm really more excited
about the battery packs for it I'd be
able to sort of keep that in your pocket
instead of having a giant bulky battery
case you can go ahead and pop one of
these things on and be able to get a ton
of extra juice I give an oval credit
they really did a nice unique design for
modularity it's put a tough nut to crack
while still keeping some form of
waterproofing we'll see how these adapt
and what third parties and doing as the
phone gets further into its lifespan or
it's a very least until the novel is set
to release a few more what did I think
about moto mods are you excited about it
if you guys want to learn more about the
motives d the motors you force we've got
you covered with another video until
next time John render from technobuffalo
talk to you guys the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
