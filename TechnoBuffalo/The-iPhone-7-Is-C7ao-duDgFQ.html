one of our iPhone series this is the
iPhone is there's all the positive
things about the iPhone and who it's
meant for if you wanna know the other
side of the coin click the link right
here and check out the iPhone 7 isn't
for all the negatives about it and who
the phone is not for so let's jump right
in you're excited for the iPhone 7 or
the iPhone 7 plus if you already an
iPhone user or perhaps you're using an
iPhone 5s or newer there's gonna be a
significant upgrade if you want what I
think is the best app ecosystem the best
app experience the iPhone is still for
you now none of these arguments are
unique to the iPhone 7 you could have
said that about any previous version of
the iPhone and speaking of apps perhaps
one of the biggest reasons to get an
iPhone 7 or 7 plus or really gets any
iPhone it could do this with Super Mario
run Mario is on the iPhone makes the
iPhone 7 unique are a few things first
new camera systems in the iPhone 7 plus
for example you are getting dual cameras
you are getting actual optical zoom
digital zoom all the way up to 10 times
about the grade in the image too much
you're getting stereo speakers built-in
you're getting new color options you're
getting black and jet blacks which look
really nice in person you're getting a
tactic home button which doesn't
necessarily add much the utility
standpoint but it's definitely kind of
cool you're getting the best battery
life on any iPhone I've got an hour
better than what you had with previous
generation phones you're getting
incredibly fast processing with the a-10
fusion processor if you live inside of
Apple's ecosystem you live with IMF and
you live with space-time it should be
pretty excited about this phone but I
think the biggest reason for an iPhone
user or somebody coming from another
phone that wants to get the iPhone 7
plus is water resistance now you don't
have to shuffle to your car and credibly
fast if you're on a phone call in the
rain if you follow the pool if you drop
in a toilet you are going to be covered
this has been something that's been
coming gradually to android world's nice
to see apple finally adopted I think
that's probably the biggest reason to
upgrade to the iPhone 7 if you take a
lot of pictures you take a lot a 4k
video you're gonna want to definitely
consider the iPhone 7 Apple doubled the
size of the storage option entry-level
is now 32 gigs and you've got 128 all
the way up at 256 I kept a pricing
scheme this
you're getting double the storage for
that same price so at 6:49 for the
iPhone 70 now I'm getting 32 gigs versus
what that same dollar bought you just
few days ago was only 16 those are the
biggest reasons and that's to the iPhone
7 7 plus are for if you fall in that
category upgrade you know what you're
going to get with an iPhone you're gonna
get a great app experience you get a
smooth buttery OS and then get a phone
that's gonna last you for probably 2
plus years so outwardly those are the
big benefits of the iPhone 7 and the
iPhone 7 plus I had a chance to go
hands-on with these phones they feel
really premium in the hand you're
getting great Apple build quality if any
of those things I mentioned are
important to you fall in those
categories go ahead and upgrade or
migrate over to an iPhone 7 you know
what you're gonna get but if you're on
the other side of the argument walk with
the iPhone isn't or maybe a little bit
upset about things Apple's didn't do
that's what it's gonna be for you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
