technobuffalo here when the iphone 4 was
first released great TT just about six
months ago it was met with a very warm
reception however once the Vice has
gotten to consumers hands there was a
giant concern over antenna issues in
fact in a previous video which I'll link
down below you noticed extreme signal
degradation when you held the phone in
your left hand in a particular way and
the problem stemmed from the antenna
design on the 18 TI phone for got one
right here down a set there's a broken
band right there and a broken band right
there when there was something covering
that and bridge these two gaps for
instance your hand you ran into severe
signal issues I actually had to put a
clear coat on mine to cover that so my
finger would never actually hit it now
interestingly enough the verizon iphone
4 has that same antenna gap right there
thought we test to see if Apple learn
their lesson or if the verizon iphone 4
suffers the same fate as it's AT&amp;amp;T
counterpart let's get started
alright so let's check out our signal
strength here first I've got pretty
solid signal strength about four bars
fluctuating here a verizon 3g i'm going
to go ahead and hold the phone in the
manner that usually kills it go ahead
and put my palm right there to make sure
that gap is being bridged my thumb up
all the way to the top and let's hold
this guy for a mid and see what happens
well immediately we saw one bar drop
that could have been just from sitting
of fluctuation and certainly using
signal bars as a gauge of signal
strength it's not always the most
accurate we saw the 3g go away now i've
got the little circle there we go we
lost one more bar let's go ahead and see
if this trend continues so two bars are
gone one bar is gone so we are
definitely having a antenna issues here
as far as holding the phone I've tested
this before and I've never been able to
get it lower than one bar but you
definitely notice the difference when
you jump from four to one let's go ahead
and let go and see if this comes back or
this is just an anomaly so go ahead and
let go and push this down here and let's
see if our signal strength comes back
well 12 bars came back the rebars came
back verizon 3g is here again little
circle is gone so definitely there is
clearly a problem here with the verizon
iphone 4 in fact with all verizon iphone
4s having death grip problems so the
answer much like what Steve Jobs said a
few months ago you're going to need to
get a bumper or some sort of case that
cover the outside of this or you are
going to suffer the same fate as the 80
mg folks so in conclusion yes the iphone
death grip still happens it does hurt
your signal strength I can definitely
drop a call or two while you're using
the phone in your left hand anyway guys
i'm jon rettinger from technobuffalo we
