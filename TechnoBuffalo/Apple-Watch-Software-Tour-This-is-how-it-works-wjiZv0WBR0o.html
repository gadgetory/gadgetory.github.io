TechnoBuffalo here and I've got a
hands-on with the Apple watch this is in
particular the Apple watch sport in the
42 millimeter configuration so be sure
quickly how it works so if you've got
your hand down by your side when you put
your hand up it's going to turn on I've
got my got my Mickey face here if you
want to use it just couple things you
can do with the UI if you want to
customize your watch face go ahead and
do a forced tap and go ahead and
customize and pick the face that you
want to go ahead and slide to one will
stick with Mickey but go ahead hit
customize and it you can't access these
different quadrants so I could hit
weather up there and I can do the one
touch of the crown
I can change it's going to show up and
the same thing down below I can just
turn the crown and different options
will start to show up ending on what I
want to do when I like and go ahead off
tap it again and I can go back and now I
am there so you've got a digital crown
and a button the Crown's are very
similar what you see on a regular watch
they say the best way to use it it's not
to go like this but actually just use
one finger and start scrolling it's a
very natural motion so if I tap that
just one time
I'll get access to all the apps and it's
very simple to move around it's very
fluid go ahead and kick where you want
to go just your finger it's gonna zoom
in or zoom out you go ahead and zoom in
just with the scroll so I've got
Instagram right there on the middle if I
roll up it'll open Instagram if I want
to scroll back and see more of what I've
got and go ahead and do that and pick
the one I want and I can just tap and
jump right in so there's mail for
example if I go ahead and do a simple
tap again I'll go back and if I do a
little bit of a double tap action go
ahead and view the the unboxing if you
go ahead and double tap this button down
below you go ahead and access Apple pay
and of course you can swipe to see which
card you want to use and you are good
but if I don't want to double tap and I
want a single tap that this is where you
can sort of interact with your people
this is where the watch becomes more
personal so you go ahead and use that
digital crown find the person you want
so this guy looks fun I'll tap him and I
get different options I can send him and
I can call him or send him a text let's
say I want to go back even further and
I'll go ahead and do that one more time
let's say I want to go to
about here so she has an Apple watch so
I can do a couple few different things
here I get that new option right there
it's like a finger I'll go ahead and
select that I can pick a color I can say
pick yellow I can draw her face or
whatever I want to draw and seagate
start to float away and slowly just
appear and that will show up right on
her wash I will go ahead and go back
home if I swipe up from the bottom so we
get access to a lot of different things
so power reserve Apple saying about 18
hours of battery life I can see all
different apps you've got in different
settings that'll show up for them so W
Hongkong Instagram and go ahead and view
recent posts can see different times
weather maps anything that you want this
is where it all show up and couldn't
exercise you know a lots been made here
about the activity modern apples done a
very nice job making sure this is going
to be useful for activity tracking and
this is what the watch looks like on
your hand I'm Jen render from
