and haven't hung anything up on the
walls behind me I'm still deciding what
the best picture for the background
should be so any suggestions please let
me know so I was going to make this
video with the intention of doing a
viewer mail bag kind of going through
and tricks with questions that you guys
had but as I go through and read through
all the messages I'm realizing there's
one question that I'm getting more than
any other and that is how do you get
this these gadgets to review where they
come from and how can I do it well good
news I've bad news for you the bad news
is I'm sorry guys there's not a magic
email address or magic phone number that
you call them all of a sudden you're a
technology or companies are sending you
stuff it just not the way it works
unfortunately the good news is that i
can give you some hints and suggestions
to how maybe you can get on the road to
have any product sent to you and be a
professional reviewer so guys as i go
through these and list of steps just
keep in mind these are a few steps you
may find your own way your own
techniques may work a little bit better
they're just some suggestions that I
have some of the tribulations that I've
gone through to get to the point where
i'm at now and some of the stuff i'm
still going through to get to where I
want to be so first and foremost you
have to have an audience if you've got
20 or three subscriptions aren't going
to send you things you have to have a
substantial audience I didn't start
reaching out to companies until I had
about eight thousand subscribers and
even that is a low number and the people
weren't very responsive I didn't start
getting responses until I crossed me to
10,000 11,000 12,000 subscribers so
we're really sorry to get some responses
so what I could suggest at least what i
did was i looked up companies that i was
interested in and punks i want to review
and i sent him emails said hi my name is
jon rettinger a technology viewer I've
got an audience of 8,000 my videos
reviewed however many it was at that
time maybe five hundred thousand a month
I've got a wide variety of viewership
here's what my demographic is here's why
I think he should send me products to
review and be prepared guys for a lot of
rejection
it's not easy and it's not easy road I
also get rejected quite a bit you guys
don't see that you just see the stuff
that I get but just be prepared another
thing you guys want to do is build
relationships so build relationships
with some of your local electronics
merchants so maybe go to your local
radio shack go to your local best buy
tell them who you are maybe they'll give
you products to review show them who you
are tell them what you're interested in
tell them what you want to do make sure
they see a benefit to letting you review
these products you know they have to get
something in return they have to get
exposure whether it's good or bad you
know that's what you have to offer them
never guarantee a good review then you
lose your credibility you know companies
understand that you might not like the
products those long if you prevent not
sorry as long as you present your
reviews fairly most companies will be
okay with a less than positive or less
than glowing review so please something
to keep in mind you know the next thing
I recommend guys after it would be
emailing start off small call some
smaller companies don't have much
exposure if you're into I phones maybe
find a phone number and email address of
a small manufacturer that make cases
drop them and start off a little bit
small show value to one potential
partner so you can build it show that I
to greater bigger partners got nothing
really simple there's no magic road to
follow and a for sure they're like I
said there's no phone number or email
just i can give you guys for all of
sudden your tech reviewer the best
advice that I can give you is to just
build your audience build it up and
people will come to you you know now I
get contacted by companies that are
looking to set your products some might
accept some I don't you know I'm still
reaching out to a lot of different
companies a lot of different
manufacturers like I said earlier i'm
still getting rejected quite a bit so be
prepared for that you know when present
yourself as a professional if you're if
you're young if you're 10 11 12 13 you
prepared for companies to tell you know
it's just a reality of things they might
not want to set products to kids and i
don't agree with that it may not be
right but just be prepared for I don't
want to set you guys up for a short of
disappointment you know but if you are
younger what you can do now is build
your audience so you get
be a little bit older if that's such a
large user base colleagues companies
will have no choice but to send you
products to review now also a lot of the
products that you get don't get a keep
all the phones i have i just get to use
for a few weeks and i send back most
things i don't get a hold on to so if
you prepared for that as well don't
think that because you're getting stuff
suddenly your electronics treasure chest
is going to grow it's just not going to
happen unfortunately some of the
products that I review I go out and buy
on my own and then maybe i'll sell them
later or I'll keep them some get sent to
me by companies you know some are sent
from sponsors you know really get my
electronics from a really a myriad of
different ways you know one of the
things I keep forgetting is sometimes I
still think of myself as just a guy with
a camera who unbox his macbook pro about
two years ago you don't have to try and
change my my opinion on it you know I
guess I've been evolving my audience is
growing and I'll becoming more of a
brand and it's been hard to transition
away from just being dude to maybe being
more of an entity with people that
helped me work with me it's been a
little bit of difficult transition you
know you guys are probably gonna come to
that as well as you start building up
your audience and maybe as you make a
website or you make a podcast it's get a
new come less about you and more about
your brand so be prepared for that as
well and make sure you can package your
brand professionally you know if you
want to be a technology review or you
want to be taken seriously don't tell
dirty jokes don't use profanity be very
mindful of your language don't say oh um
make sure you look directly in a camera
and like I said in my advice for tech
reviewers you know show confidence in
yourself and I think that really will
translate well anyway guys I hope you
found this helpful I'm trying to answer
the biggest questions that I get I do
read all the emails guys so please keep
them coming I can't always respond but
if I'm getting an influx of questions
that are all the same and I really will
do my best to try and answer it anyway
