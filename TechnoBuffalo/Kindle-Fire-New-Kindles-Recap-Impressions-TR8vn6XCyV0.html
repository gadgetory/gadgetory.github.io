technobuffalo here today amazon took the
wraps off a ton of new kindles
highlighted by their sizzling kindle
fire it is an android-powered
touchscreen tablet and these puns just
write themselves is it going to set the
world on fire is it going to light up
the tablet market just keeps going and
going but I'm going to spare you my
awful jokes at least for right now so
let's go ahead and recap what Amazon now
so I've got some notes in front of me
generally I go note free but there's a
ton of stuff as you can see to cover so
if I look down that's where it's coming
from all right let's start with the king
the Amazon Kindle Fire prices that's
most people care about is a sizzling
told you to view more bad jokes 199
dollars a pretty solid entry level price
point but that's going to come with a
few limitations so it is a 7-inch
colored screen with a resolution of 1024
x 600 it is IPS and is covered in
gorilla glass 169 PPI you should get a
pretty nice screen the gorilla glass is
really nice for traveling or the 7-inch
tablet even here want to cram it in your
pocket he got giant sized pockets I
don't have to worry about scratching it
one of the downsides of it is it doesn't
have any cameras on it I also not gonna
have a microphone but it one hundred and
ninety-nine dollars do you really care
you know the first iPad launched without
cameras um I don't use the camera on my
tablet very often for a price point one
hundred ninety nine dollars to get what
the kindle fire is going to do i don't
think that's really gonna matter to
consumers but am I wrong you know let me
let me hear from you so it runs Android
with Amazon's new bookshelf you I it
looks like a kindle but with the fancy
fancy screen you can get access to all
kinds of apps and stuff on there as well
you know that you'd have with any
Android tablet it's running a dual-core
TI OMAP p for processors is gonna have
plenty of power to do your bidding and
hopefully it's going
good battery life Kindles have always
had ridiculously strong battery life
here's hoping that kindle fire is going
to have the same 8 gigabytes a storage
should hold plenty of your books
magazines maybe not so many videos
though why you're gonna have free cloud
storage I Amazon Cloud sofa gigabytes
will help out however it's only going to
be Wi-Fi um so that's kind of tough no
3g option is going to be there but again
for the price point you know do you
really care or would you even use 3g so
from a dimension 7.5 inches x 4.7 inches
by point 45 inches so pretty nice and
thin not overly heavy either pre-orders
are going to start today and it shifts
on november 15th so it's a while to wait
before your fire comes to your door but
you can pre-order this guy today uses
amazon silk web browser all the stuff
you'd expect from a modern web browser
built on android will t touching
goodness on there as well whispersync
includes videos and TV so whispersync
what that is essentially it stinks up
all of your kindle content so if you're
reading let's say a book on your android
phone it'll sync up with your kindle if
reading it on the android app for the pc
or reading on your ipad or iphone
whatever you might be using the kindle
app on it sinks it all up that's gonna
be true now with their video content
you're gonna get one free month of
amazon prime so that's kind of cool buy
all of your amazon stuff for the year
during that one month it's free two-day
shipping which kinda awesome access to
android app store but not google's
android market which is kind of
interesting actually so Android as
multiple app stores amazon has their own
on there they've got a ton of decent
applications in there they've
exclusively launched some of the I think
the angry birds rio launched on their
they don't have the full content though
in the full breadth of content that
google's android market does but where
the nice things about android is that
with the simple link can download almost
all the apps that are in android market
out having to go
android market so you can totally
circumvent at least in theory circumvent
this restriction but is that going to
matter to you so kindle fire way to
think you excited not excited i think
it's going to probably set the entire
tablet world ablaze for lack of a better
pun Amazon's got the infrastructure
Amazon's got the ecosystem so they're
trying to be Apple by kind of being
Apple there now totally vertically
integrated just like Apple they control
a tablet they will control the ecosystem
and look control the content totally
straight down so it's probably going to
make for a really nice competitor if you
liked the iPad because of the itunes
sync and the content on itunes but you
didn't want to be stuck with Apple this
is going to be a great great choice for
you or even if you don't have an
allegiance either side you want
something smaller it's gonna make for
presumably a pretty great ereader be
able to view your video content be able
to get some the great amazon stuff on
there the fire is going to be a pretty
solid choice at a really nice price
point but that's not the only tablet i
don't know why i'm pointing that amazon
announced today the next tablet they
announced is the kindle touch to the
surprise if no one Barnes and Noble has
the Nook touch stand in a color so seems
like there's a natural progression for
Amazon to make $99 with advertisements
which I don't know 140 bucks without
advertisements yay they don't like giant
pop up all over your screen their little
ones kind of bars across the bottom uh
would you want to save 40 bucks get some
ads on your screen kind of curious what
you guys have to say I'm sure some will
say yes some will probably say no so
it's the same ink display we have known
in love at six inches but it's all touch
screen me now four gigs of internal
storage three good bites cream
accessible to the user to month battery
so to pull up a menu you touch the
middle touch the right side to turn
pages left sides to go back it's pretty
standard touch interface no keyboard on
this guy everything's gonna be done with
your little fingers including a
on-screen keyboard there you're gonna
have a new x-ray feature which is kind
of neat that allows you look up
information about different facts in the
book on Wikipedia instantly so let's say
you're reading about dinosaurs and
want to know if the toronto service
Wrexham glue that big badass you can
look up trying to Saurus Rex round on
Wikipedia and it'll say on the front
line yes trying to Saurus Rex was really
that bit of a badass even though he had
these little arms couldn't do much I'm
sure this is getting screen captured
right now with all kinds of bad comments
okay bad joke ah that is the Kindle
Touch there's also a kindle touch 3g
which surprise surprise add 3g 149 bucks
with advertisements 189 dollars without
lifetime 3g a hundred countries you
don't have to pay for that 3g service
other than when you buy it there's no
monthly contract you buy it and you get
the service presumably that's being
powered by ett but not coming from
confirmed on that everything else is the
same as the kindle touch that's not the
only kindle that got announced we now
have the regular kindle um no more
keyboard any more on this guy though
everything is done now with some menu
options and toggling around did you use
the keyboard on the kindle you can still
get the old key boarded kindle um but
you know nothing's new in it so the
kindle 79 bucks with advertisements $109
with out i am as though actually let me
back up here the Kindle Touch and the
kinkle touch 3g pre-orders start today
and shipping is going to begin on
november 21st a little while away so the
regular kindle $79 with ads $109 with
out amazon local deals will be on there
so you get local deals no touch no
keyboard like i mentioned uh to lighter
it's five point nine eight ounces frame
is on cloud storage Wi-Fi and it ships
today no more notes boom so that was
everything that we had in there what do
you guys think you excited about the new
kindles you're not excited about the new
kindles kind of curious what you guys
have to say about all these i'm
personally excited about the kindle fire
uh the touchscreen kindle I don't know I
dry prefer buttons it's easier my
grandfather's side story loves the
kindle he can use the kindle has a awful
time using a computer but somehow figure
use the kindle on his own you can click
a button I couldn't imagine trying to
teach him how to use a touch screen
kindle but I don't maybe that's just me
alright guys we'll have all these
devices to cover for you as soon as we
can get them in our hot little tech
reviewing hands I'm drawn right in your
technobuffalo if you have any other
Kindle Fire puns leave them down below
I'll see you next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
