TechnoBuffalo here with a full review
for you of the HTC Sensation for
t-mobile with a name like that let's see
if it really is alright so in this
review of the HTC Sensation we are going
to cover call quality Sense 3.0 speed
screen battery life build quality and
all the specky goodness that comes in
those categories so let's start with
what matters most with the phone that is
of course called quality the call
quality on the sensation is probably
amongst the best of the phones I've
tested and I've tested quite a few I
actually did a thirty call test as
opposed to my usual twenty and I had
zero dropped calls I've got an associate
about 20 minutes away whose home is
located in a complete dead zone we
hooked up the sensation to his Wi-Fi
calling there and ordinarily where he
wouldn't be able to get reception with
the Wi-Fi calling I was able to pull in
a much stronger signal so if that's what
you rely on to make your phone calls
don't worry the sensation is going to
work out wonderfully for you the speaker
quality here is also outstanding and one
of the cool features of this particular
phone and some of the other HTC built
devices that we want to access this pick
your phone don't have to actually hit
the speaker button you just turn it over
mid call it's going to activate that
speaker for you it's quite loud for you
speaker or files out there which sounds
like a creepy word but it works very
well if you speakerphone in a car in a
meetings you're going to get a pretty
decent audio fidelity you get that
little bit of tinny sounding that you'd
expect from a speaker phone but it does
work quite well alright so now let's
talk about Sense 3.0 this is sitting on
top of the latest version of Android
that's 2.3 Gingerbread and there's a lot
of stuff that's new and unique here this
is the first phone it's actually
launched with Sense 3.0 we've covered a
bit of it in previous videos and
ordinarily in phone reviews I don't
cover the OS skins but since this is the
first time we've really seen it on the
phone I think it's important to talk
about some of the things that it does so
let's start with the lockscreen here is
the lock screen of Sense 3.0 or here's
one of the
lock screens of sense 3.0 and I'll show
you what some of those are so a narrow
lead unlock a phone you just slide
something up or slide to the left to the
right and you are unlocked that is the
same here with sense three Oh however
you can access four applications of your
choice you set icons here and the
Preferences and go ahead and jump right
to them all you got to do is find a jump
to say camera I take the icon I drag it
right to the circle and it's going to
launch that camera for me very quickly
and you can set that for the any
application it's a nice handy feature
you can do a lot of customization here
as well if you go ahead and go to that
customization window you see you've got
lock screen and you can pick from
different HTC choices from what you'd
like all them are going to give you four
options down below for applications some
are going to show pictures so we're
going to show stock prices whether some
are going to show weird chronograph
clock but you have a choice for what
you'd like so you can customize the
device as is the Android mantra any way
you like I really liked the option of
having those lockscreen shortcuts made
it a bit easier you also have some 3d
animations here you can sort of see them
as I scroll along and if I scroll really
quickly you can see them sort of show up
there hopefully I'm not making people
not just but there's a lot of 3d
animations here this is not a 3d screen
just appear sort of be 3d and this is of
course taking advantage of the beastly
processor that it found in HTC Sensation
and that is the Qualcomm built 1.2
gigahertz dual-core Snapdragon which is
pretty beastly and we'll talk a bit more
about that as we go you also have some
quick setting options as well that's
going to be found in Sense 3.0 there's a
lot of goodness here to dig into the
quick settings when you slide this down
go ahead and jump right into quick
settings and you can see what those are
right there nice and simple and pretty
elegant to use I like having those
options readily available all right so
let's talk about what I know you guys
all want to know and that is the speed
does this thing is big a speed gaming as
you would expect benchmarks really mean
nothing to me actual phone performance
is what matters most and this thing
absolutely hauls browser speed
application speed everything is just
apps
lutely lightning fast so we will load up
TechnoBuffalo calm and we are just over
the 4G network cute we're not connected
to Wi-Fi flash is enabled content loads
very quickly and one of the problems
I've seen of Android are at least the
older versions of Android the slower
processors I was it as you did your
scrolling down you got that checkerboard
pattern that would show up for
pinch-to-zoom wouldn't be all that fast
so I'll let all the flash contact
continue to load here you have the
option of course to turn the flash
content off and you get quicker load
times and a bit better battery life as I
scroll here there is no problem with
this phone keeping up with it at all in
fact on limitation is how fast I can
scroll my finger pinch to zoom is really
quick very elegant and just works about
as well as I've seen on any mobile phone
so from a browser standpoint absolutely
outstanding speed on this phone is a
screamer so this is a 4G phone and I'm
quite a speed test junkie so I ran a
decent amount of them you can see what
my results were here and this was on the
4G network with about two to three bars
in my area ranging from about 1.2
megabits per second down all the way as
high as about 5.8 generally hovering on
average between the mid to high twos
with about one and a half megabits per
second up so you're not getting
lightning fast network speeds unless
you're in a faster 4G area this is just
subject to where I am but I found it to
be plenty quick for what I needed to do
so next let's talk about apps
application here launched extremely
quickly as you would expect from device
of this raw horsepower so I want it open
up something like Angry Birds Rio which
who doesn't want to open up Angry Birds
Rio I think Angry Birds are downloaded a
million times per day
I just loads very quickly for things
you're gonna do on this device and go
ahead and get your Angry Birds on you
are not going to have to worry about
speed at all and not really even going
to have to worry about application
management oftentimes some of the issues
novice Android users have a complain
about crashing is due to their
application killers so whether or not
you are what applications are killing or
essential to the court processes I got
have to worry about that so much here of
course gingerbread has that option built
in but you're not gonna have to do much
app management because this thing is
just an apps
beast beast beast of a cellphone
all right so let's talk a bit about
battery life because being a beast of a
cellphone you're going to get a bit of a
drain on battery so we're looking at a
1520 milliamp hour battery life and if
you never using this phone but knew the
specs and you were to guess with battery
life wasn't going to be on it I'm
guessing like me your first thought
would be it's probably gonna be between
normal suck and super suck and the
answer is it's much higher on the super
suck bad of your life here is not very
good so let me give you a summation of
real-world usage generally take it off
the charger around 7:00 7:30 in the
morning about an hour and a half of
phone calls sometimes connect the
Bluetooth sometimes right up to my ear
sometimes isn't that fancy speakerphone
we talked about where you just go ahead
and flip it over on its screen regularly
checking to exchange servers for emails
and doing some pretty decent web
browsing I was dead battery completely
shot by about 4:30 so if you are a heavy
user user of your phone if you got a
phone like this chances are you're going
to want to take advantage of it or if
you play a lot of games you're gonna
need to pick up an extra battery or make
sure you always have some sort of
charging mechanism handy battery life
was just not that good and one of the
big contributors to battery life is of
course and this screen which is a 4.3
inch s LCD and it's an four Super LCD
the resolution of 540 by 960 I was not
overly impressed the screen on the phone
when you look at some of the Super
AMOLED options from Samsung or the
retina display on the iPhone 4 you can
certainly see a difference in screen
quality let's go ahead and jump in let's
look at some text here so I'll go ahead
and back open in the browser it's
probably not to load up the website in
we're super zoomed in so text looks fine
it's not that the text looked bad but it
just doesn't pop the way it does on the
Super AMOLED screens now if you ever
looked it to buy a television you go
into Best Buy or your big-box retailers
and you see two TVs next to each other
tricks are you can always see a
difference but if you pick up the lesser
TV
bring it home and hanging on your wall
that's the only TV you're looking at and
to you that chief he's gonna look fine
and that's very true with the sensation
this is the only phone you're looking at
the screen is going to look fine to you
but having the benefit of seeing a lot
of screens come through here
this is just definitely not one of the
best so if you look at some images for
example let's go ahead and check out
some wallpapers it's going to be tough
to see to translate from the phone to
the camera to YouTube we can take my
word for it the screen just doesn't pop
the way I would like it to especially
with some of the Samsung devices out
there so look at some HTC wallpapers you
can see what some images are here just
isn't that right or vibrant now of
course I've got the auto dimming sets
here so it's doing all of its auto thing
one of the things that HTC is known for
is their tremendous build quality and
that certainly holds true here with the
sensation build quality device is
absolutely outstanding I always love
phones that have the battery almost
flush up against the back of the phone
here you don't get that sort of hollow
feeling that you get from a lot of
phones get that really high quality feel
you've got that metal feeling it loads
plastic in the middle soft touch on the
top and bottom sort of whooshing display
right there phone just feels really
really high-quality interestingly enough
the battery cover which is generally
just the back it's actually this entire
side of the Vice if I pop this up here I
can show you just quickly battery covers
tremendous pain to get off just an FYI
go ahead and pull this off a little bit
you can see where it's pulling off from
right in the corner and that's where
this thing comes off from so you are
going to have a very very very solid
build quality here the camera was
average 8 megapixel camera it can shoot
in 1080p the usual disclaimers here
apply don't leave your point-and-shoot
at home if you want to take a shot of
your kids at your grandma or your date
to send your friends camera is going to
be fine here the front camera right
there is a 1 or actually is a VGA point
3 megapixel so it'll shoot average stuff
if you want to do your quick video chat
you know it's going to get the job done
so overall in a curve encompassing this
into a big package this is a tremendous
phone is definitely one of the best on
the market when you look at a phone
especially it's stablemates
built
HDC you bring something like the evo 3d
your match pretty close spec to spec
with the exception of the camera however
a lot of phones that are going to be
coming out in the future are going to
have the stereoscopic 3d displays the
sensation does not have that now 3d is
generally a gimmick on phone so it's not
going to be a deal breaker but it's
something to keep in mind if you are a
t-mobile customer or you're looking for
the latest and greatest Android phone
that's available that's still going to
be nicely SPECT in a two year period and
even when quad cores coming out it's
still going to be a fast phone this is
going to be a wonderful choice for you
and if you're on t-mobile I can't
recommend this phone enough absolutely
outstanding experience you're going to
get some of the best that Android HTC
has to offer and that really is a killer
combination so guys what do you think
about the HTC Sensation is it your next
phone does deserve a spot in your pocket
curious what you guys have to say I am
