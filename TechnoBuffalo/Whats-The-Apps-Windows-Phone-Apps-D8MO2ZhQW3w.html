brought to you by Jackthreads hello dear
peoples John Q here from technobuffalo
how's it go and hope you guys are doing
swell recently I picked up for myself a
windows phone 7 loaded phone and so far
so good so I thought for this episode of
WTA I'm gonna share with you guys the
apps loaded on to my Windows Phone 7
loaded phone repeating myself a bunch of
times that's fine hitman just a heads up
i'm not going to be mentioning things
like Facebook Twitter Netflix and so on
I want to focus specifically on Windows
Phone 7 apps made for windows phone okay
and to start things off in alphabetical
fashion the first app on the list is
cool tools a great all in one app with
the built-in timer ruler stop watching
more you can totally download all these
things separately and many of them are
actually made by microsoft but if you're
looking for an all-in-one tool pick this
up next gchat this app is only available
on the mango software it works
beautifully and the interface is
seamless with the Metro UI it also has
live tile support awesome stuff next on
the list is gmaps i am not a fan of Bing
for or anything and maps is no exception
gmaps is a great app that provides you
with a similar Google Maps experience
you get from iOS or Android next Metro
tube probably one of the best apps on
windows phone 7 metro to provides you
with a totally wicked and seamless Metro
fide YouTube experience tons of features
including lists from your YouTube
account HD video playback voting
commenting and my personal favorite a
bar illustrating delight to dislike
ratio and searches YouTube holy needs
this on their site by the way the app
also neatly integrates with the native
video player which is always cool next
notes a very very simple note app you
just open it and take notes with it I
personally like this one the best
because the icon is the most native
looking at a ball of them next on the
list is reddit yeah as a redditor I've
gotta have a reddit app unfortunately
there aren't many available in the
marketplace yet but the reddit ya app
seems to do a great job and don't let
that silly name fulya this client is
pretty solid not as future pack compared
to those on iOS
but good enough for casual browsing next
toggle a simple app that allows you to
add shortcut live tiles to like the name
suggests toggle Wi-Fi airplane mode
Bluetooth data and a few more next
weather live I just wanted a simple
weather app with the live tile feature
weather live definitely accomplishes
this at least the the live tile part the
app itself is actually quite messy at
least the lab tile looks nice next when
milk I gotta have a Remember The Milk
client unfortunately there isn't an
efficient one out yet for windows phone
when milk definitely does a good job
though and it basically lets you do
everything from adding tasks to marking
them complete and so on I did find that
it was a little bit laggy and sadly no
live tile and speaking of Windows Phone
I'm a-goin to an irrelevant transition
to thanking our friends at Jack dreads
only suckers pay full price okay if
you're into alternative apparel likes to
see kidrobot and Hurley but hate wasting
all of your cash on them listen up you

wait list to join but if you head on
down to jack threads.com slash techno
again that's jack threads.com slash
techno you'll get instant access to all
of their killer hookups go now back to
windows phone email is a big thing for
me i'm a gmail user myself and here's a
trick that i picked up a few years back
that allows you to set up gmail as an
exchange account on your phone and yes
this is a glow-in-the-dark Snoopy
sticker mmm I rock it a rockets so hard
first go to settings and add an account
and instead of typing Google select
outlook type in your gmail address and
password custom email domains work as
well as long as everything is set up
with google and gmail hit sign in when
you're done it's going to try to sync
and fail that's normal now under
username entering your full email again
and once again tap sign in and like
before it's going to fail here's the
crucial part tap advanced under server
type in m google com sign in and boom
you've now got your gmail set up as an
exchange account just a heads up you can
most definitely do this with multiple
emails from my experience setting it up
like an exchange account helps push the
emails in a little bit
but that could totally just be me I'm a
little sad to say that Windows Phone 7
doesn't handle emails quite as well as
iOS or Android it's like ninety percent
there 98 they can do everything you know
send emails reply to emails attach
things and all that jazz but the issue
comes with syncing okay if I have an
email mark too bad on my phone it's not
marked read on my computer i'll be
marked unread and vice versa it just
doesn't seem to sink one hundred percent
of the time I don't know it did I don't
know but it's just again it's a small
thing and I'm very very picky about this
stuff well I hope you guys enjoyed my
little list of Windows Phone 7 apps and
again i'm a new user so if there are any
Windows Phone app that you love and i
haven't mentioned feel free to share
