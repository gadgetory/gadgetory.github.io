with John for Lakers comm picked up a
Wi-Fi printer on Friday and figured I'd
give it a quick unboxing for you hope
y'all enjoy seen the next one bye bye
alright guys let's go ahead and get
started it's the HP Photosmart c-45 80
it is a wireless USB printer meaning if
you bring a computer in and you hook up
to the wireless network here you'd be
able to print or write to this which is
very handy I've got a few computers that
come in and out of here and people that
come over so it'll be nice to have a
printer that can accommodate everyone
let's go ahead and open this up it's a
picture of the printer on the front it
doesn't look like anything terribly
fancy go wireless icon I bought this on
Black Friday and for those you that
don't know what that is it's day after
the American holiday Thanksgiving it's
always our big sales there's about $100
so it's relatively inexpensive HP
photosmart all-in-one information stuff
sake nothing too exciting basics guide
photo paper and a Mac os10
install CD throw that off to the side a
USB cable some power cable adapter power
brick got to a cartridge here a color
and a black and white one which is nice
they included them they're probably only
half-filled but it's better than nothing
now let's go through and take out the
printer itself
dump it out here alright so here it is
Hey styrofoam take off oh it looks like
almost every other HP printer so this
one's got eight up to eleven Wireless
built in which is nice it's also a
scanner and copier opens right up
put your documents right there it's got
media card slot on the left-hand side
where you can put in your media card so
it'll read it and paramount so wireless
button right there and other than that
nothing terribly exciting back of it
power port and USB port that's about it
just a printer I thought I'd share those
with you guys
hope you enjoy from John Rhett injure
with John four Lakers comm talk to you
guys soon goodbye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
