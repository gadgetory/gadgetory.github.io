TechnoBuffalo show online you're two
hosts for today Sean ani editor and
chief of the site i'm joined by deputy
managing editor Todd Hazleton everybody
on this week Todd I'm good good we're
we're only 50 weeks away from CES 2017
that's right that's how I measure all
time in my world now yeah and we just
booked Mobile World Congress which will
be a pretty much exactly a month from
now good grief once it starts it just
keeps coming doesn't it but of course
you know even though it's only January
you know we need to start talking iphone
7 yes love my segue there I think it
works yeah so the big rumor this week is
that the code for future versions of iOS
state hey no headphone jack yeah it was
yesterday the code and iOS 9.3 beta 1
point 1 which is like a small it was
like the update to the beta 1 for iOS
9.3 that was released a little while ago
um in it it has this line of code uh
headphones have percentage input like so
do the headphones have input know which
is really interesting so this was
published by somebody I believe he was
working on jailbreaking on Twitter and
basically it sort of suggests that the
codes like not looking to see if there's
head put input or whatever at least
that's the way I read it which fits with
all the other rumors that have already
said you know Apple is probably going to
a 3.5 millimeter headphone jack go for a
super thin design you know so instead
you either use presumably Lightning port
which i think the ones that exist now
are already pretty expensive or just go
right to bluetooth which makes sense
music bluetooth for that kind of stuff
but I mean there are so many other
scenarios where like you have headphones
right like i bought these because i can
use them for this podcast and i use them
on the plane and I don't know I feel
like if
just going rights of Bluetooth like okay
you get rid of the wires it's super
convenient but then you also have to
worry about one more thing you have to
charge and I have bluetooth headphones
that I do like four flights but I find
all the time I forgot to charge him or
something like that right and i use bose
qc25 you know i'm not going to want to
ditch my expensive headphones because oh
no my iphone no longer works with
although i barely use headphones with my
iphone its primary with my ipad but
still the idea that we could be movie
now wasn't there a pet in a while back
for an adapter yeah like there was yeah
i think there was or something like that
which would make sense Apple could sell
it for thirty bucks exactly Angkor it
they could sell for thirty bucks of
course there's another freaking dongle
that you have to keep track of that you
could potentially lose another piece of
equipment to carry with you I don't know
a and this brings up an interesting
question from such a Mahal do you think
the iphone 7 will have a lightning port
or a USB type-c port I that I really
think of lightning but they haven't done
it before um I mean they haven't done on
their phones adapted like I mean they
went 30-pin delighting so they didn't
ever go uspc but then you look at
products like the macbook where they
have us bc and sort of we're pushing for
it and acting like they're you know
leading the push because it's the future
anyway um so I don't know yeah I mean
spc makes a lot of sense obviously I
think that's the way they should go and
of course Apple written this anymore
Apple would never you know release a
phone this year with lightning and sell
you an adapter and then a year later
change ill thing so that that adapter
was no longer correct I mean that's not
something Apple has ever done in the
past um uh the sarcasm was thick on that
one folks but uh oh let me address this
real quick from jeff k did we really
piss you guys off with the comment
section no we're not
sure what's happening for some reason on
technobuffalo calm right now no comments
are going directly on the site they're
all going in the moderation we don't
know why we are looking into it we think
somehow a setting got changed but we are
working we are working on it I went
through this morning and proved like 500
comments you know from over the past 24
hours so yes I we are not sure what's
going on the comments are not going away
we are looking into it and hopefully it
will be fixed sometime this morning so
just a quick bit of housekeeping there
thank you for asking about that Jeff so
yeah I mean I think they're gonna stick
with lightning I do think there's a good
chance they're going to get rid of the
3.5 millimeter headphone jack which it
will never it won't break my heart to
never have to say again 3.5 millimeter
headphone jack but I i would i would not
put this past Apple in the least I mean
if you look at their laptops you know
okay they got rid of the optical drives
so they could go thinner they got rid of
the Ethernet port so they could go
thinner they have no hesitation about
getting rid of inputs and outputs to
make their devices thinner yeah I mean
I'm just looking at mine now like
imagine it could be so thin but then you
know the we've talked about this before
the battery life what happens there
camera modules are still large so you
know you still have to I guess you could
have a little bump in the top or
something but I feel like I'm just
looking at it now I mean I'm not the one
who's like oh I wish my phone was
thinner but not as a ella phone that
could be I mean if you look at it it
would be like wafer thin yeah there you
go issue now and even with the oh the
iphone 6 plus you know i put mine in a
giant k so i can hold on to it I don't
think we people with it like you're
doing yes um yeah I just I feel like
even the iphone 6 plus was too thin for
me okay you know it's so going even
thinner it just okay i'll just keep
buying otter boxes hey yeah i'm trying
look at my so here's the Nexus 6p and
like I don't know that's not even the
fattest thing on this like the headphone
jack I mean you've got the camera module
again obviously is coming out pretty far
because it slopes down and then the
bottoms us bc i mean i guess us bc is
just slightly thinner not mean oddest in
I don't know slightly I don't know I
feel like this is good enough let's keep
it thick for the battery life that's the
most important thing hey Jeff I just saw
your message send me an email at Sean at
and with whatever your disgust user name
is and I'll look into that so moving on
down the road to other phone rumors that
we're hearing the LG g5 mmm the okay so
we saw the one yo design that had like
the removable bottom and the battery
slipped out yeah that was funky that was
funky and interesting but now it looks
like they're doing something else yeah
now well there's always been this talk
of like modularity so um with this g5 so
possibly it sounded like there is a
special port or some kind of thing that
allowed you know extra accessories so
like something like a virtual reality
headset which by the way Samsung just
uses the micro USB port on its phones
for that so that seems like I mean
especially at the USBC there's enough
data for that to just work but I don't
know so there was like talk of this
extra sort of part that allowed extra
accessories and that was the modularity
and then we saw that battery thing that
was first published by Cena I think and
it was just like it looked like the
phone was sort of the shell and the
battery would slide in and out like you
could you know oh here's a new batteries
pop it in almost like cartridge which to
me seems like very 1980s tactic you know
I don't know is why would Amanda Lee ro
of batteries exactly like you just have
him around yeah you know you hit the
button it just ejects like a magazine a
pesto lease lap at a new battery I'm
ready to go exactly that's what that
that's what that felt like oh and okay
here it's called the magic
lot I have it up for me that was that
was the the original one that I was
talking about with the accessories and
stuff so I don't know if we have any
examples besides what i think was
virtual reality so that was one and then
we've seen just what we've called a
radical new design which is to say that
LG I think it was very radical when it
first introduced the power button on the
back and the volume controls now it's
almost like going away from that the
latest schematics show just what appears
to be a fingerprint reader on the back
very similar to the nexus 6p and then
the camera module on the back to and
going back to that camera module there
were discussions about it being like a
dual lens set up and right now it's it's
so hard to tell when you look at these
sort of renders and to report on aside
from like what we're hearing in the
rumors because when you look at the back
of a phone like that and you look at the
back of i don't think i have like the g4
on my desk you look at the bag of that
and it's got like that laser auto focus
area like there's so many different
things that you can't you don't like it
looks like two lenses maybe until it
comes out then you just you know you
don't know for sure but that's the rumor
dual lens and sometimes that's good for
you know we saw it on the m8 from HTC
but you know take a picture and you can
adjust it afterward after the fact stuff
like that well we got a question /
comment from jeff k I don't buy the g5
leak of the module sliding up from the
bomb I just think it's too radical and I
tend to agree I just I don't know I mean
LG has definitely gone out on a limb
before like moving the power button to
the back along with the volume controls
I i'm currently carrying a g3 on one of
my lines and honestly I don't like the
power button on the back I'm never going
to get used to it you know yes I know
that's where your finger rests and
that's part of where the problem lies is
I'm constantly hitting the volume
buttons that I don't mean to yeah I
don't know what that's like yeah and so
I I wouldn't put it past LG to try
something radical and different but will
they actually who knows right well the
funny thing is is that it's a radical
redesign from like from what was already
a radical redesign and the fact is I
mean
is not radical it's just back to normal
with the funny thing you know when you
look at these the schematics for your in
on the 18th which was two days ago it
looks like any other phone on the market
almost like an HTC sort of Huawei hybrid
i think i look at it if they do this
though we have to film the video in slow
motion like you always see in action
movies where you know somebody they run
out of ammo and they drop the clips I
guess laughs at a new clip off in the
battery yeah so you know we gotta do
this like slow motion leaping over a
couch ejecting the battery yeah yeah I
mean that's the weirdest thing because
really okay replaceable batteries are
great like I like them too but at the
end of the day I just rather have a
phone that charges quickly and has a
long battery life you know I don't want
to have to replace the battery I'd
rather plug it in for 15 minutes just go
you know where we're at instead of
carrying around like whatever another
battery in my backpack which I used to
do with the galaxy note 4 I guess the
last time we do that I don't know it's
it's interesting there's a lot of
theories out there you know and we've
kept saying that somebody's got to
change up the design they've got a
change you know away from the black slab
but was this where we meant for them to
go I don't think so yeah I don't know I
don't know right now I think I'm most
excited for what you know Galaxy s7
which I bizarre segue there yeah which i
think is gonna be if Samsung sort of
just takes what they have now the galaxy
s6 you know improve the the camera
doesn't need improvement I don't think
but it's like the industry is looking
for that every single year right like oh
you know it make it better even though I
mean I was looking through some photos
last night that I take in this fall and
one I have them on google photos and
they're all mixed up and I thought some
of them were once that I'd shot with my
DSLR but they were mine they were shot
with the s6 edge+ I think and I was like
whoa I mean I'm like that's a great
camera and I was looking at them on my
monitor here which is 32 inches so I
don't think Samsung really needs to
prove that but I do think they need to
add just the smaller things like the mic
OST car especially now that it's
supported natively in marshmallow I'd
love that the next phone and that you
know there's talk of all kinds of other
things that they're doing but we did
have one question about the g5 which has
been asked multiple times from Princeton
Abdul solemn I believe how much will the
LG g5 cause we have no idea no idea more
than a dollar it'll be a flagship price
yeah so probably 600 to 700 dollar range
off-contract summer in there so the
other topic we wanted to touch on this
week was the rise of original streaming
content be it you know any of Netflix's
original shows like daredevil and of
course unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt
ornately black house of cards or house
of new cards house of cards you know and
who lose got into it you know by
resurrecting the Mindy project amazon
has shows like the man in the high
castle so all these now all these
streaming services are coming out with
original content Netflix in particular
is plan on doing over 600 hours of
original programming this year at the
unbelievable cost of 6 billion that's
billion with a B and just yesterday
their earnings report came out how much
did they make wise haha I don't know it
profits we're total revenue was 1.8 2
billion compared with 1.4 9 billion a
year ago fourth quarter so that's I mean
if we're just sticking with the 1.5
because it's the softer number and
easier for math for me yeah you're
looking at like a year of revenues yeah
that's insanity how okay so netflix
doesn't take advertising those of us
that are grandfathered into the old
pricing we're about to lose that which
you know they warned us a long time ago
and there's no how are they going to
make that six billion packet make life
things yeah but i think um it's another
figure they had
I point 59 million net subscribers just
in the quarter so you added you know
five and a half million people and
that's before I mean that this quarter
does not include their global expansion
right which happened at see us right and
will continue to happen throughout the
year so yeah they're going to add a lot
of subscribers but still i mean we're
talking pennies you know over the six
billion and i just i don't i don't get
it i mean i'm thrilled I netflix is
making quality shows yeah you know I had
so many now that I feel like we were
talking about this like there's just too
many to watch I mean it was great but
because it takes you look at em you're
talking before the show and I'll read
this quote but you look at TV these days
you turn it on when I turn I don't even
know why I pay for cable anymore beside
for supports but I turn it on and like I
don't even know what I want to watch and
I could do the same thing on netflix and
be like I don't know what I want to
watch and find something I can TV and so
that's why I like this quote it was from
LA Times earlier this week it's it's a
every single day in my company and I
know in other companies there's a
question of did we do something to build
a monster that will come back and kill
us and that was a quote from NBC
Universal research present now onward
soul which is crazy because it's true it
is it's totally true I mean these
companies saw a quick way to make a buck
on their back catalogue which makes
total sense what they didn't realize
that was they were building up the
revenues of a monster that would
eventually come back and go hey guess
what yeah and we can do it this much
better like i'm finnaly better and in
fact netflix don't forget about this
they still have people millions of
people renting DVDs which blows my mind
cuz yeah I forget it was around horn a
half a million or so yeah yeah which a
more power to him although I'm sure
you'll Reed Hastings to see right boy
will you people please stop writing
Davey days yeah right let's get let's
give her that will remember one what was
it called when he split the company into
their company that was gonna do and he
could have just seen help I care not in
the name of it but it was so bad it was
too early though because every
but he was like what the heck that's so
stupid i think i remember thinking
that's so stupid yeah and now it's like
yeah of course I kill that side of
business you know if you I don't know
what it does for the actual numbers but
me looking into the future like why
would you have that I think he does it
yeah ooh I tried to split them up so you
just kill one later well yeah and we've
got a lot of questions here about Bo
netflix and jeff k brings up a point
here I think Netflix is underpriced
believe it or not I think when you look
at the content you get it's just crazy
that someone could expect to pay less
than ten dollars a month yeah netflix
really is king right now in my book they
just need to update their app on my
smart TV yeah I I know some proper TVs
are way too hot if it's terrible but I
use it all the time but i agree i think
it is sort of under price and I I
wouldn't be surprised to see you know
different pricing tiers in the future
depending on what you want but I the one
feature that I really want to see on
netflix is offline storage I think we've
talked about that before but you get
amazon prime I just want to be able to
save you know like six episodes I think
you know something like what Amazon
Prime does a limit you but um just so I
can get on a plane or you know go
somewhere yeah what wiII happen earlier
this year that he didn't have a good
signal but I had offline storage yeah
before I went to the UK I had watched
the first two episodes of in the high
castle amazon so I know you can do eight
episodes because I took episodes three
through ten with me okay and that was
great you know I was able to watch it
wherever ye on Reed Hastings the CEO of
Netflix I we're not really sure that's a
feature people want you and I have
already done it yeah it's a feature that
I want and actually I talked to another
journalist who had dinner with him at
CES and III asked him also did you get a
chance to ask about like offline
playback and the guys like ah man I
forgot to ask him like that was the one
thing so that's one you know I would
like to to see that featured I I would
love to see that feature I mean because
like when a new season of a marble show
comes out you know I I had to rush
through jessica jones because we were i
was about to leave for the UK
huh I would like to have been able to
just gone oh no problem I'll just take
some of them with me right you know I
understand piracy concerns and all that
but Amazon figured it out yeah you know
so why can't Netflix it doesn't make any
sense to me but yeah such a such a Mahal
asks is streaming the future of TV I
think so I I think the idea of
appointment television is dead dead dead
you know and that happened back EO even
with VHS you know and then into the DVR
and all that but the idea of watching
television when somebody tells you to
watch television or even watching a
season when somebody tells you to watch
a season is so outmoded at this point
it's so weird to even think about it
that way at least for me I don't even
know the last time I sat down to mean
again aside from sports games because
you like watching my view no spoilers or
immediate where and and something like
the debates recently you know like I
feel like that's kind of a life that he
doesn't have to be but it's something
you might sit down in front of your TV
for at a certain time um other than that
yeah it's like I don't know the last
time you know I remember as a kid
obviously you'd sit down be like The
Simpsons are on at this time and you
know tgif and like all these and i was
just all i did well and you know it's
somebody that cut the cord last May you
know now i just i simply think of okay
you know yes the flash airs on tuesdays
on the CW but to me I'm just like Oh new
it's Wednesday new episode of the flash
yeah like you might know the schedule
you know it's coming and like maybe I'll
sit down for but it's like I feel like
there's no their end there hasn't been
for years like this need to sit there at
that time yeah the only thing you know
with hulu is you know they only keep
like five episodes of some shows so
that's not that big of a deal you know i
just i simply make sure you are watching
within the five weeks right the
concerning thing to me is there's this
rumor going around that the CW is going
to leave hulu and start their own app
and the problem is if more and more
companies do that
we're going to have a problem because
it'll be just like cable I I'm not going
to subscribe 218 streaming services yeah
and I think they'll start to see that
and then it'll come together again
almost like that's why I think these
services like Netflix make the most
sense and Amazon and you know where you
just have like if you go to Amazon you
can search for you know various shows
that they have the rights to like that's
like I want to call it a conglomerate I
think it's gonna have to come down to
that for exact same reason you just said
like why would i pay ten bucks for say
the CW app when I when I'm paying ten
bucks for netflix it has like infinitely
more content right it's just they should
just figure out licensing deal
themselves although luckily the rumor
for the CW is only two to four dollars a
month which is probably two to four
dollars more than you should be paying
for the surrender even though i watch
multiple CW shows even I'm like I I just
want to know where the farm is that they
grow all these actors on Yeah right they
have all these gorgeous actors that
you've never seen anywhere else that
just suddenly appear in their changes
and so I just I pictured this Theo
orchard with a tree and they walked out
in on oh you look like you'll be fine
for era things yeah that's it it's
harvest season but oh good group well we
gotta lie questions so let's jump into
him here and see what is going on this
week from Nate vlogs do you think it's a
problem that apple doesn't have 4k on
their Apple TV's not yet I don't think
it's not yet although that does at this
point anything that's not future proof
does concern me yeah but Apple seems to
be that company where people let it
slide with that future proofing stuff
you know it always happens that way but
then and I'm I want to be careful how I
say this because i know i can take
people off but if you look at it like
fingerprint readers right like other
people had fingerprint readers apple did
it very very well when they introduced
touch ID and now it's even better but
then you have companies to come after
apple like look huawei with the meaty
readers awesome super fast okay then
look at 4k apple doesn't really have an
excuse there because like what's it
gonna do to make it better right like it
like everybody else has for Carrie or
some some other competitors have 4k
already and you would say well apples
gonna come in and make it better maybe
but they're not going like there's no
how could you possibly improve on that
and I think that's why it's a problem
that apple doesn't that 4k now because
it's like you can't let that slide yeah
I I'm sure the next iteration and look
we've added 4k something every other
streaming box has had for years now
exactly it's not like but they might you
know they'll try to call it like 4k plus
C no well yeah and but there but I can't
figure what that plus would be right now
to like say ok that was worth the wait
where it has been worth the wait on
things like you know fingerprint readers
or I mean even NFC to some in some
regards because NFC I feel like people
don't really use that often unless it's
for payments and Apple did it really
well with payments at first and I know
people share music and pair of blue
tooth devices and stuff like that like I
use android too but it was saying I
think they did some things better
because they waited and I can't see how
they're gonna do this one better well
we've got a couple questions coming in
over on Twitter today from Daniel
jeweled the new samsung galaxy tabpro s
has USB type-c in a magnesium alloy
frame do you think we will see this on
the Galaxy s7 I don't know about
magnesium alloy frame but I think USBC
yeah definitely yeah I'd be an aluminum
phone again with glass which is nice i
don't think i should change that too
much means galaxy s6 and and that family
of devices are beautiful ya know i think
that uh i think USB type-c is going to
be the buzz word of the year for sure
yeah it's such a lame buzz word to ya we
call it something more fun from such and
haul will you guys be getting the iphone
7 and do you guys believe that i won't
have a headphone jack well we very
dressed the headphone jack as for if
i'll get it I won't make that decision
till I see it
yeah I I mean I guess just because I
cover the phones i usually end up buying
in myself anyway so probably will well
that leads us to our next question I
surprised oh yeah from Jeff k awesome
Todd return anything lately seriously
though it ain't new toys you both have
your eyes on um I'm looking currently at
new bags I have a backpack I really like
from in case that was from the office I
think they sent it to us and when I was
in the office I grabbed it but now i'm
looking for like a messenger bag to join
in so that's what I have my eye on terms
of gadgets and that's because i had i
was looking at stuff like the 6p but
they had them at CES so I grabbed it
there would you get you toy my echo
arrived oh nice here you go I have that
pic also i bought the next bit Robin so
that's like next end be shipping a mid
of next month so I'm excited for that
phone and other than a new sort of bag
for my laptop I'll get a much in I
didn't return anything but excuse me to
the things I was going to return uh the
Nexus 5 and the 1+1 I ended up giving to
my sister they're going to travel and
they needed unlocked phones so I was
like okay good you know so that's who I
was gonna sell yeah I hadn't done it and
I was like oh perfect take tease yeah
absolutely perfect use for those um I'm
looking I'm starting to finally explore
smart homing my house a bit hey oh and
the the echo is the start of that and
we'll just see where i go from there I'm
sure sweet you're gonna go into like
Philips hue and stuff wonder if I don't
know don't do the hue though there's
this uh li FX I don't know how to
pronounce it life x i know they uh they
make some bulbs and they've been getting
better reviews and phillips and I wish
I'd done that because you don't need
Phillip see me like this hub and now
they've updated the hub for home kit and
I don't have the new hub and so I can't
use home kit and like these other life x
bulbs are just Wi-Fi connected bulbs and
they were
with that guy on that guy and that
that's that's the biggest problem smart
home is I'm trying para ok now what
works with the echo you know what
connects with what yeah it's so hard
they and they make it sound like you
know you go new a google i/o or WWDC a
from apple and they make it sound like
they have this one you know like home
kit and whatever Google's is called
Android home or something and like oh
this is perfect it's gonna be everything
and it's not like you go to build it and
then they you know a month later a new
hub comes out a month later new light
bulbs come out you're like this is a
home like these are not things that
you've replaced every year yo you go you
got to buy these things for long haul so
they should make it you know a lot more
all-encompassing in my opinion
completely agree completely agree from
Nate vlogs what carriers do you use I
love t-mobile I after years of being
with sprint I have moved my entire
family office print &amp;amp; onto tmobile and
so t-mobile is my only carrier even
though I carry two phones um but I'm
t-mobile only year aren't you mixed
still yeah well I'm primarily a teensy
but I'm back using I have never turned
it off but I just hadn't been using it
but I'm doing project Fayette because
I'm just getting used to the trip to
Barcelona from a World Congress the 6p
is project five phones so i'm back on
that which i like I had to order a new
sim card just came yesterday but um
otherwise i'm primarily 18t my wife is
verizon a question from jeff k which
applies to my life here what shows would
or do you miss on cable TV I'm hooked on
Impractical Jokers right now and cannot
find it anywhere but true TV well I
don't watch Impractical Jokers but I
would for Brian q um deadliest catches
the was the big one for me because
discovery has like no online presence
except for clips hmm it makes no sense
yeah so I unfortunate i work that into
my budget when i cut the
cord that you know I can by X number of
TV seasons a year right you know and
deadliest catch I'm I'm sorry i just i'm
so hooked on that show at this point
after the it's like the captains are
part of my family so you know Deadliest
Catch was the big one for me and of
course like Todd was mentioning sports
yeah it might the only sports team i
follows manchester united and luckily
somebody has helped me out legally
helped me out so I can watch manchester
united play um that's really about it
though everything else I pretty much
find streaming is there anything you
would miss Todd um it's sports though I
he can stream sports packages to now
there is nothing i'd miss in fact all
the shows i watch now are on netflix or
amazon it's mainly because of
recommendations that i've i've read from
you know heard from you or read that
we're writing about on the site and
stuff like that you know I flipped
through to my co like unbreakable Kimmy
Schmidt I think we've heard about that
like I've heard about the conversations
with staff and that and then I'm like
wow this show is so stupid I can't stop
watching yeah I know it's you're like I
don't know why I like it but I can't
stop watching it right so it's stuff
like that and then I watched um man high
castle love that um I watched making a
murder love that I couldn't stop
watching that and then like it so
everything I look for uh here's my puppy
yep serum skype Collier okay um yeah I
don't know everything i want is is there
so I'm ready to ditch TV at him I'm sure
will actually do it really soon the
thing is last time I tried to I live in
an apartment building with like hundreds
of units and so they have these deals
we're like you know if you're getting
internet and the cable it's almost like
hard to cancel your cable um the same
way that it used to be hard to cancel a
telephone line actually it still is I
think we have a telephone I don't even
know where it is but you pay for it for
no reason so it's kind of difficult like
if you want the deal on the fastest
internet which I need for work then I
need to have some sort of like cable
package
it's really stupid Felicia Day the
actress and author and all that she
yesterday was talking about she wanted
up her internet package with time warner
cable and they would only let her do it
at the higher speeds if she took some
cable channels exactly yeah otherwise it
like cost more it doesn't make anything
I was I mean it does make sense it's
just for them that's a business yeah not
for me from Jonathan Borg wing do you
think USBC will enable tablets to
compete with laptops as a desktop
replacement given software improvements
a multi window with android and and USB
sees ability to use docks to expand
functionality android replacing windows
over time ? um i think the whole problem
with tablets is always going to be the
physical keyboard I think that's going
to be the biggest thing because and yes
I I know you're mentioning yo you can
add attachments on to it but then ok so
now when i leave the house i gotta carry
the hub i gotta carry a keyboard i got
to carry the tablet right you know I
don't know I I keep thinking tablets are
on the verge of you know taking a bigger
bite out of computers and then it
doesn't happen yeah but you could get
look at these keyboards is one from
Microsoft and like it looks like a
little book of that pops open now it's
not easy to type on right yeah used to
it but like you know if you carry this
in a bluetooth mouse in your phone her
ID sometimes than I know okay I could do
I can do work if I really need to and I
don't have my laptop you know like I
could really try yeah try being the key
word there I think if the peripherals
get better i think it could happen it's
just a question of everything falling
into place it's not just the tablets
it's also the accessories i feel right
uh from Princeton uh what do you guys
think of project astoria I am not sure
what project of story i just googled
that it was there it was microsoft's
android app emulation stuff so like
bringing android / android apps over
which is cool it just doesn't look like
it ever really happened especially for
Windows 10 for phones like their they
were supposed to make this bridge make
it easier to bring
these apps / really nothing revenue so
now oh let's see it reminds me a lot of
a blackberry try to do it yeah yeah
exactly it's like the the cheating man's
way of getting more apps on your phone
uh from dan vosges I think if Apple is
game ray the 3.5 millimeter headphone
jack what companies do you think will
make lightning port headphones beats hey
all of them I mean there's already one I
forget it there like 500 bucks are
probably more I think that sells them I
think everybody all of a sudden would
start making him because you know you go
into a radio shack mean or no I'm sorry
once upon a time you would go into her
he just say what but you know you're
walking to a store like a drugstore you
like I just need some headphones like
what do you do yeah they're gonna have
to have lightning course or something
huh yeah that's why I think there's
gonna be a lot of cheap adapters yeah
yeah oh let's see here from brazen
Franco since the v10 still isn't
available here in Italy should I just
wait for the g5 see this is a tough one
because I've talked about it before the
LG said when they introduced the v10 and
it's like the higher end you know this v
family is the higher end for from the
chi for last year so is G for them v10
at the top which made sense is more
premium so technically I would I should
say you know wait for the v 20 or
whatever it's going to be consider stood
the g4 then that's more what the chief
I've is and I still feel like that's the
way you should think about these things
but I don't know when the v 20 or
whatever is going to come out right like
you don't want to wait that long you
want the g5 so I'd say wait for the g5
and see if you're more of like if you're
like oh this is cool but I don't like
plastic and the g5 ends up being plastic
then I'd stick it out for the b20
because probably going to have that you
know steel stainless steel frame or
whatever v10 has that said feet ends
really nice phone and I wish we'd
covered more of it just sort of came out
right before like during slam season
when we were doing everything so um you
might want to just see when that comes
out in Italy if it does
okay from Alex resk and what is your
opinion about android marshmallow um
seems smoother battery life definitely
seems better yeah I like it a lot I
don't use google now for anything now on
tap though yeah my uh my Nexus 6 i
charged it up the other day to do some
stuff and it's been off for charging her
for 48 hours and still has like half the
battery life nice yeah so now overall
I'd like marshmallow I don't think it
was very much about the forward-facing
changes this time though right much more
about what was going on under the hood
so we'll see what happens with Android
in from andreas cotner uh well iphone 7
had wireless charging mmm who knows it's
one of those things were like you know I
don't think so I don't think it's gonna
be until we have a standard click that
everybody uses and like us otherwise you
can all gonna go around doing chi and
PMA and all that stuff and I don't know
I think apples sorted gonna wait you
know especially till it's good i mean
look samsung did a good job last year
with the note 5 improving wireless
charging speeds but aside from that i
haven't seen any other mainstream
handsets that are actually making
wireless charging like fast and a
priority the way they have with wired
charging so I mean to me like if I'm
sitting here at my desk I mean I can't
think of a situation where I'd rather
put it on the wireless charger I guess
at night because I don't have to worry
about the time it takes to charge but I
would always rather have it wired
because it's so much faster same here I
mean it's it just sounds cool it seems
cool the ideas awesome you go to
Starbucks they put it down the table in
a charger you get your car and charges
but what good is that if you drive to
work and you've charged like three
percent like look there doesn't make any
sense to me yeah I still preferred wired
yeah same from Jeff k thoughts on HTC
making the Nexus I don't buy it but I
could see it happen i've read the huawei
i love boys next I bet 6p has been a
good seller so why would Google wants to
a stray away from them so quickly my
feeling is that Google can kind of
bounces around and helps companies that
need help when it comes to the Nexus it
seems weird i mean i don't i don't know
the full story and what they're doing to
select you know other than maybe they
just go with one partner here and one
partner there i mean they've used HTC
and samsung and LG and huawei and HTC
was the very first one the nexus one so
I'd like to see it again I mean if you
see makes great handsets but i don't
know i don't know that google would
would be straying from huawei if if
Huawei felt that way that would probably
be a problem but I feel like it might be
what you're saying Sean like okay let's
have somebody else do it now like I
don't think it's like this oh we're Lee
like we left LG to make the next Nexus
because we didn't think they did a good
job with the last one or we ditch
Sampson like I don't think that's how
google sees it i think there's kind of
going around sand hey you want to make
the nexus is here yeah yeah i think they
just try to spread the love around
basically that's my guess I have known
you know I don't know from Jonathan
bourgoin how will Chrome OS and Android
OS merging effect Apple's iOS and OS 10
I don't think it is at all yeah I don't
think there's they're worried about I
mean one day I'd like to see it first
play with it you know it sounds like the
chroma the pixel see was supposed to be
sort of that first Chrome OS tablet
hybrid android thing but wasn't because
it wasn't ready so let's see how good it
is and then we can talk about it hurting
I os os dead or whatever and we're gonna
go out on a extremely geeky question
from brazen Franco Star Wars phantom
question on the new Star Wars canned
kegs but kylo to become the Darth Caedus
from the new non-canon expanded universe
that would readily I'd oh um I here's
the thing so far kylo is not truly
assists so we don't know if he's going
to become a dart at all he does
I think he's going to be Darth Caedus
like but not necessarily Darth Caedus
himself I just sent that was actually
all in code and I have just ordered a
missile strike on your house Todd I
think I just blacked out so yeah I I
don't know if they're gonna make him a
Darth or not but I don't think they will
ever use the name Darth Caedus anyway
that was a geeky way to close the show
