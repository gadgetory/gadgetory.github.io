TechnoBuffalo show I'm live your to host
for today Sean ani editor and chief of
the site and i'm joined by deputy
managing editor Todd Hazleton hey
everybody how are you doing today Todd
I'm good if they were all I know we're
both waiting for this this news about
Google wireless service yeah well if the
rumors true but I am feeling it is it's
I don't know I I'm excited for it but
also puzzled by it yeah I mean I think
even even when they confirmed it's
coming it sounds like right now at least
they're not going after the you know big
for wireless carriers obviously because
they don't have their own towers and
stuff the idea is to be a mobile virtual
network operator so MVNO and operate on
sprint and t-mobile yeah so it's gonna
be kind of like boost or virgin mobile
they're not going to own their own
network right so oh no be interesting to
see how this plays out you know depends
on how much it costs and able to see if
it's real or not yeah exactly but
speaking of carriers there was some
interesting news this week from one plus
that yeah they now have a carrier
partner yeah that was pretty interesting
we were talking about this yesterday
sort of I mean one plus came out as this
you know startup and I still very much
consider them a start up with this
invite system you know mainly said they
could probably make sure they had enough
units other video they didn't have too
many units right so that they weren't
building too many phones and had nobody
to buy them and then all of a sudden now
they're like they have a carrier partner
in Malaysia they're going to be selling
these direct from a store from the
Malaysian wireless carrier store and you
can buy it with a contract there or off
contract so it's a very much at first
for on plus which you know otherwise
still in my mind is this sort of very
small smartphone maker no successful
very successful but definitely I mean
they have one phone right and the
battery that's great I think that
qualifies as small
but uh no it very successful and it's a
great phone you know but it's just been
interesting that they took this tact for
so long that you know they weren't
working with any carriers and then all
of a sudden they do work with the
carrier and it's one that I i will say
that those of us in the united states
are not familiar with yeah i think it
was Maxis or something like that but
it's the largest I guess in Malaysia you
have to wonder if this means because the
CEOs comments suggest to that this is
the row they want to go down does this
mean we're eventually going to see it
you know start to hit US carriers I
don't know I think it's really hard for
companies to do that even well
established companies like one of the
reasons lenovo bought motorola mobility
was to get a foothold in the US wireless
market so if Lenovo had a hard time
doing it you have to imagine that one
plus can have a hard time either white
but you know I think carriers are
probably going to say like hey this is
successful phone and if it continues to
be then maybe it has better shot yeah I
we love 1 plus we're all excited for the
1+2 whenever that is finally announced
you know and we'll we'll see what
changes are coming with this year and
speaking of such of the hall has a
question related to that what was the
one plus one missing um I don't know I
mean it was a great phone when it came
out right I still look at it like yeah
to me it's sort of losing its its
attractiveness as all these other new
phones come out although it's still
break ice and I love that you know they
continued to update the software and
there's two choices now at the Holly pop
I think the first thing I thought was
missing was wireless charging but I
don't even find that like a huge deal
but it was noticeable to me for some
reason maybe because to me it felt like
I know it's not a Nexus device but you
know this unlock device it just seemed
like it could be something that packed
wireless charging I don't know that's
the one thing that check well I'm
paintable storage / not so much it's
missing I just I definitely hope they've
worked on their battery technology
battery has definitely taken a building
over the am I was never really good
which is weird because I know a lot of
people have said it's fantastic
now uh I don't know it's Esther was
missing I really don't think it was
missing much yeah everything else you'd
be pretty good especially for the price
which is you know I think that's what
they were trying to do like they have
very slim margins so they buy the
hardware put the phone together and sell
it for not much more and make that
little bit of profit off of each one so
I think to keep the price down I
obviously had to make sacrifices and
whether that was you know quad HD
display which was still very new
technology last year this year I feel
like it needs to be added and wireless
charging and maybe a better camera
although the cameras okay yeah oh god
another relevant question regarding the
oneplus from sahal Raja I have a one
plus one and it doesn't have saiyajin at
the back of it does that mean i won't
get the update because i have been
waiting since last week for the OTA and
still haven't got it i'm not sure what
you mean by the back of it the branding
no you should still be able to install
either that or the other software they
release I mean I think you can pick a
choice but I know it's a couple people
Roy Roy one of our editors is also still
waiting on it I haven't gotten it on
mine but I haven't been checking yeah I
haven't rec'd mine's already again you
can tell you what I will definitely be
checking mine later to see if I've done
the update yeah otherwise there's oxygen
OS too but I know if you want cyanogen
urge that right going back to the Google
story we were talking about just a
moment ago from Brisbane Franco is
google gearing up to conquer the world
with and crush every carrier I would
jump in in a blink of an eye if Google
brings international phone calls the
same prices google voice well we know
they're going to be discounted but we
don't know what that pricing is as of
yet yeah we don't know we don't really
know a lot at all except for that it's
supposed to be coming today that's what
the Wall Street Journal just said and
and that apparently internally it was
called Project Phi I don't know if
that's going to be the final whole name
but I guess you know it's supposed to
hand off between t-mobile and Sprint
network switch ever has the best and
then also hand off the wire why
by pretty seamlessly to but I have we
have no idea about what the prices are
going to be like I think you'll pay
pay-as-you-go data we'll just have to
wait and see but I don't think it's
going to go out there to conquer and
crush every carrier because again it's
relying on networks from existing
carriers and course there's also the
rumor that it's only going to work with
the Nexus 6 for right now right right so
unless you own the Nexus 6 you know I I
don't know how many people are going to
be able to jump onto that and I
definitely want to try it and we will
it's just that I'm so afraid I'm gonna
like it and be like oh man another
monthly bill because i already have two
lines of AT&amp;amp;T I don't plan on can't
sleep yeah but I have two lines with
t-mobile and I keep debating whether or
not I really need that second line I the
main reason I have two lines is because
i want one on iOS one on Android you
know to make life easier when I need to
do testing but I'm just like right I
just I don't know yeah I'm exactly the
same way so yeah it's a toss-up but the
other topic that we want to touch on
this week was of course the star wars
celebration was this past weekend in
California and there were a couple of
large pieces of news number one being
the reveal of the latest Star Wars The
Force awakens trailer and then there was
quite a bit of news about Star Wars
rogue one which I don't think anyone was
quite expecting that to be revealed in
the way it was as for the Battlefront oh
yeah and battle for well we already knew
about model from but yeah yeah yeah but
uh as for the force awakens trailer I
think I watched four times before I
could you know form words hearing Hans
voice in do saying Chewie we're home was
just a little bit more than I could take
but boy was it weird though seeing an
old han Solo yeah that was weird for me
too and I went back and watched a new
hope
earlier we can so I'm trying to rewatch
them starting with the first three well
the original three yes originally not a
technical first three right right but
yeah it brings back and I think we were
talking about this too it brings back a
lot of memories you know watching these
with my father's you can I think that's
why it's special to a lot of people some
people I saw on Twitter to talking about
like Star Wars who cares that's a stupid
and then there's like the people who
grew up with it and I feel like it has a
special place a lot of people's hearts
for that I definitely a difference I
mean you know there's a lot you know a
lot of people you say Empire Strikes
Back is the best one yes but as a film
it is the best one but I have so many
memories so many emotions connected to a
new hope that there's no way I can't
consider my favorite of the film's right
you know and I think you're a hundred
percent right I think anyone that grew
up with Star Wars you know especially
those of us that were around for the
original release back in 77 you know
it's there was nothing like it there it
was literally mind-blowing and I'm fine
i SAT there in that theater as my mother
describes that i SAT there with my jaw
open for the entire two hours haha I I
did not move I did not speak I did not
it was unlike anything I'd ever seen yes
I was six years old you know but so it
was I knew I was seeing something
different and so yes it's Star Wars
holds up very are they great films no no
I but in the context of the time they
were something very special now i will
say i'm super excited and I don't know
if you followed this news at all Todd on
Sunday they had a panel about standalone
films that are coming up that are not
part of the main right now I saw that
but I don't follow it I didn't follow
that well what's intriguing to me we
already knew that was called rogue one
they announced the standalone films why
should be called Star Wars anthology
subtitles so this will be Star Wars
anthology rogue one the storyline is
going to deal with the rebels that stole
the plans for the original Death Star
well something we've never known
anything about there will be no Jedi in
the movie and they are aiming for it to
be a war film and that excites me beyond
all reason because I've always wondered
you know we yes we always saw the big
heroes you know we saw han and luke who
were the people that were in the
rebellion right who who were these
people that decided to stand up against
the Emperor and that fascinates me I'm
so excited if they want to do that sort
of thing with the standalone films I'm
there well I know yet I because this is
supposed to it's after the Revenge of
the Sith so order 66 has been given the
Jedi have been wiped out that there's
only a few Jedi in the galaxy at that
time right okay so this is a chant and
the Jedi there's an old Greek term
called dos x mashina which means
literally translates to God in the
machine and it's a writing crutch where
when you can't figure out how to get
your characters out of something you
just drop in something magical basically
the Jedi kinda came to be that oh look
the guy showed up with their lightsabers
and take care of all the problems so
that interests me too they're not going
to have that crutch right okay yeah
there's going to be nobody yo force
choking anyone or right anyone across
the room you know it's going to be
ground troops doing their job so that
interests me it interests me a lot I
don't know how this is going to play
with the general populace though I mean
everyone wants to see lightsabers right
yeah I feel like when you think Star
Wars you kind of think about Jedi and
lightsabers but exactly you know so
while it fascinates me I'm
your heads going to fascinate Joe Q
public walking down the street that ill
has attained gentle interest in Star
Wars right but Anna will see i eivol on
board I'm off mood let's get that movie
going and those are 2016 right i was
earning a little bit about it Ryan yeah
that's December so force awakens is this
December then one is December 2016 and
then episode 8 is may 2016 or may twenty
seventeen so it's only an 18 month gap
between episodes 7 and 8 and only a six
month gap between rogue one and episode
8 nah nice I I think what I think
they're trying to get the ball rolling
to where we will have to Star Wars
movies a year that's awesome well it's I
mean I still can't believe marbles
getting up to three a year yeah that's a
lot of movies to be freely induction any
serious right yeah yeah exactly dare
double just got renewed yesterday for
season two have you started watching
dare w no I haven't but I need to hey
let me play to you this way as soon as I
finish watching it I was watching it
with my family my father goes so we're
gonna start over right ah just rewatch
it yeah he oh he and he's not a comic
book guy he was way into daredevil yes
yeah he would yeah I know it was really
good it's well done show moving on into
some of the questions we've been getting
what do you think of bb-8 now Todd in
case you don't BB eights the ball yeah
the new jern I saw okay and Spiros
making the toy which is awesome yeah
which I'm already like trying to figure
out how many of those i want to buy
hahaha i think it's cool i mean i love
the Doran's I think when I look back at
stars we were talking about this I think
an episode or two ago you know who are
our favorite characters and rewatching
it you know I gotta say I'd probably
change it to Han Solo but I said Darth
Vader because it
always reminds me of Star Wars and along
the same lines through the r2d2 and c3po
they just remind me so much of Star Wars
so I think another girl is great but I
am I computer there's a long power strip
and I can't turn the Cape the computer
around to show you guys so those of you
watching on the show this is just two of
the 45 different astromechs lined up on
the power strip 45 I yeah and I that's
not my entire collection I can't put
them all on the power strip where do you
buy them just as they come out there
just do the regular hasbro toys that's
awesome but yeah and there are no
repeats in those 45 on the power strip
they've released that many different a
stroke victim see you need like a stand
for bb-8 though right yeah i know i'm
not quite sure how you're going to
display bbx so yeah i'm always been
fascinated by RT d and yes I've even
gone online and looked at the
instructions for building a life size
are too unfortunately I would Wike oh
all out which means machining metal
parts machined metal part r2 unit will
end up costing about ten thousand
dollars well you'll notice I have not
built an r2d2 anymore yeah I mean if I
ever won the lottery Oh in a heartbeat
and art beat that I would I wouldn't
just have an art you I'd have an r3 and
r4 and r5 but roaming around behind you
there yeah exactly yes exactly so no I
think bb-8 school I've got especially
once I saw him roll out on stage and saw
that he was a practical prop that was so
awesome yeah but uh from prison Franco I
want a movie on the Delta Squad the
Clone Wars wasn't enough I need more a
dude for the anyone that has never
watched the clone wars they were better
than the the prequel trilogy combined
that was one of the best Star Wars
things out there I watched him as I was
working out here in my office and I I'm
almost tempted to watch all six seasons
again they were that hot to watch them
now too I know you were saying that in
an earlier episode ya know that really
really well written really well written
moving on well we kind of touched on
this already from such a Mahal what do
you think about bb-8 droid becoming a
toy made by sheer 004 it is it you out
by the holiday season I see that yeah
they're hoping for it I would imagine
they'll make it if they make it out by
the holiday season and they'll sell tons
of them right yeah and that's when the
movie comes out to you so yeah disturber
18th not that I'm counting the days I
I'm not counting the days rating I see
the calendar crossing them off as you go
yeah from such a befall of such Mahal
are any of you guys going to get star
wars battlefront and did you guys play
the original two games I played both the
original two games i hated the second
one as most people did and I have every
intention of getting the new one I
didn't play the originals but I do
intend but play this one it sounds
awesome it looks great see the trailer
Rosa creepo know what ya know it it's a
great concept the second game just
didn't work for some reason it just the
first game was awesome in the second one
you Roy ah what went wrong business
which has happened with a lot of series
I mean I can remember call of duty
modern warfare 2 that was my entry point
to call duty I played the jeebies out of
that game I was so excited when they
announced the oh mine warfare 3 I was
like yes I step downs like no yeah what
went wrong
I don't know why I mean yes games have
to evolve everything has to evolve but
why change it to where you mess with the
success I just I know I feel like I try
new things and we've talked about this
with Joey to the first person shooters
where they just sort of all feel the
same and then sometimes they try new
things that just don't work and then
they sometimes back tread on the next
one but it's unfortunate when they don't
work that's happened with battlefield a
couple times too and I love the
Battlefield games when playing them
forever yeah there's some that just
don't feel as good we have two separate
questions that kind of unintentionally
relate to each other from brezin Franco
why did TB have to start make movie
reviews and show all the trailers now I
have another site to avoid spoilers okay
well first off that the Avengers review
was a very very specific incident since
John got invited to the premiere we do
not plan on making that a regular
feature as for trailers we always put
trailer in the headline so just don't
click on that post but we have a
question from such a Mahal where did it
go where'd it go do movie trailers
nowadays give too much of the actual
movie away yes and no see I go going
back to the sixth sense remember
everyone yo after they saw the sixes Oh
your minds going to be blown and I had
the comic book store at that time so
people always would come and talk to me
about movies and they walked you know
the customers came in the other Saturday
after it came out there like oh man
you're not going to believe the twist i
looked at my yeah Bruce Willis was dead
the entire movie oh you went saw last
night i was like no i watch the trailers
they're like how did you figure that I
was like I see dead people cut to a shot
of Bruce Willis yeah right
Oh spoiler were in that sense it did it
give too much away but I feel like okay
for folks and and I know you know our
readers who love the the media content
the movies and stuff like that on the
site Brandon and you get you to like to
dig through the trailer sort of pick up
on stuff but then there's people like me
we're sort of like it's not a spoiler
it's nothing more than saying like this
movie's coming here is what its gonna be
like and so I I enjoy it and I don't see
it as giving too much away but I totally
see where somebody who's really
following it would would see it that way
to make it sort of like like a game
trailer you know yeah oh that's what
it's going to look like that's what you
know no III think you're one hundred
percent right I think the average
moviegoer does not pick up too much from
a trailer because they aren't going to
sit there and discussed it with people
they aren't going to sit there they
haven't been reading all the rumors you
know all that stuff so yeah I when I
watch a trailer I pretty much know in
context everything that I'm seeing but
you know be it a friends of mine that
aren't into movies like i am that they
have no clue right now i will say the
type of trailer that annoys me to no end
is comedy trailers because they involve
job Cindy and evitable use the best
jokes and then when you go to the movie
you're like really you gave it all away
yeah like every funny scene was in the
commercial I hate when that happens I I
haven't gone time I hate that soda mean
we we're looking at like the force
awakens I know Brandon you guys both
worked on it and I read the article was
like and it was covering the trailer
sort of like frame by frame and I was
like this is cool I read that and I had
no I didn't pick up on any of that and
so that's really interesting how people
can we review trailers very differently
we're like i watch him like oh that's
neat look how old pond soloist yeah yeah
you guys are like no look at all this
other stuff and yeah well I mean like
the the first thing I picked up in in
the han solo SI was i looked at the
background because that told me where
that moment takes place I know he's in
the Falcon bo and so that tells me
you're saying we're home okay so you
haven't been there for a while right
yeah and so yeah there's I I do watch
trailers very very differently than
average people I fully admit it uh for
man of 9900 what if one plus could make
one plus two and two plus two were the
two plus two could you watch Mad could
reap for your trains leave floor at
Philadelphia plus could be more
expensive with better things on the
inside with a better display do you
think they can have a high-end and
low-end budget phone yeah I mean that's
what the rumors are suggesting that
they're going to have two phones this
year the one plus two and then one
that'll be a little lower end and it
makes you wonder if then the oneplus 2
will be a more expensive device and I
mean more expensive than that like it's
not even following the same model to one
plus one had where it was like what 349
and you get some previous and specs so
I'm wondering if you know they do a 1
plus i guess like you're saying it
starts to sound like one plus two plus
two yeah like a higher end one plus two
and a lower end one where you just
expect to pay more for the other one and
then the second maybe lower end one is
more you know in line with what one plus
did with the one plus one if that makes
any sense at all but it's 21 pluses oh
well that's what the rumors suggested it
seems to make sense but they did confirm
that they're going to do the invite
thing all over again so expect that and
wait times in all kinds of stuff now
from brazen Franco Sean are you hyped
for battle fern or would you have
preferred 1313 I am excited for bow
front for those that don't know what
1313 is it was a cancelled star wars
game that was going to take place in the
underworld and deal more with the
criminal element of the star wars
universe I will love to have seen 1313
happen but unfortunately for whatever
reason I guy cancelled so
I'm excited for battlefront but yeah I
will love to event 1313 from Shaun the
man 34 will we see Google glass to at
Google i/o this year and will we see
Samsung or google announced a gold watch
like Apple I don't see sick I mean I
know Samsung does try to follow in Apple
steps in some places but I don't see it
doing it gold watch and as for google
glass too there's nothing that suggested
it's coming but Tony Fadell is now in
charge of that he's the father of the
ipod the guy that made nests and soul to
google and so we know that they're still
working on google glass but it seems to
me like it might be a little too early
to see it again but you know i mean
these things could surprise us like
microsoft had hololens right and we
really nobody saw that one coming so
maybe it's been you know in development
secretly now from dominique weber could
you talk about the TB movies channel
where do you get the trailers do you
work with studios or something well for
those of you that don't know yet we have
launched a new YouTube channel that for
right now all it is is we're posting the
official trailers from various movies
including movies that we don't talk
about on the site like we haven't
discussed the upcoming in McKellen movie
mr. Holmes at all but we put that
trailer up by the age of adeline another
movie we haven't discussed we put that
trailer up as for where we get them we
actually have PR accounts with most of
the studios already you know we just
applied for him and they were delivering
the trailers to us anyway as just part
of having accounts and one day I went to
jobs like you know they're sending them
to us anyway why not so that was pretty
much how that came about but uh
unfortunately it turns out in the first
30 days of having a YouTube you can't
you cannot change the name from the
random when they assign you so right now
I can't just say you go to youtube com
back / TV movies but we are putting a
link in all of our trailer posts if you
do want to subscribe to it and like I
said it we're posting every trailer that
we have access to
even going back a couple weeks just to
build up the catalogue of what we have
on there so find it and subscribe and I
think let's see we have another 23 days
to go before we can change the name but
we we will be doing that for quite some
time from kuro u key not sure if someone
already asked us since i joined the
streamlight but what are your thoughts
on the geforce camera from the new promo
with a professional photographer yeah it
looks great and I'm excited we're gonna
be at the event next week where LG's can
discuss it more but it's supposed to be
really good in lowell I we saw some
great pictures and that the only thing I
have with these professional photography
things is and you see it all the time
you know a company releases a phone they
give it to a professional photographer
he goes out you take shots with whatever
you know other equipment at the nicest
locations possible and says here's what
you can do with it and then when we come
and test them you know and Joe me the
regular guy with a smartphone I'm not a
great photographer and so I feel like
sometimes it can be a little misleading
because it doesn't mean that you're
gonna get those shots I mean this guy's
professional he's trained that's why
it's called a professional but I think
hopefully we get some great shots either
way having the g3 took really good
pictures and the galaxy s6 s6 edge too
so it'll be a you know out there for
competition what's up I'm sorry I
started laughing while Todd answers
questions I am listening to am I I'm
also scrolling through for the next
question add this one made me laugh from
Sean the man 34 Todd what gadgets have
you returned this week the only thing
I've been thinking about really is like
whether or not I'm going to pull the
trigger are now well watch because I
really don't think I want want or need
one but then I'm like I just you know
there's screenshots of some apps apps
coming out I think you know that looks
pretty cool well actually i'll do that
and return it but i haven't returned
anything a little bit it just made me
laugh so actually the only the only
let's see the only gadgets i bought in
last week or these little belkin iphone
Stan charger docks that I found amazon
nearly twenty bucks
I wanted one for my desk and for my
bedroom with I have a puppy now at home
and so she likes to go after the cords
that are kind of floating everywhere
which is obviously dangerous and so I
wanted these docs that don't usually the
cords falling on the ground stuff I
warned you about puppies and cords I
know you did so that that's the latest
gadget for a man of 9900 this kind plays
into what you were saying apple sold
live Apple watches you guys like it do
you plan on buying this generation of
Apple watches and when would the Apple
watch to come out what are your thoughts
do you think more sales will happen
what's the future for Apple watch that's
a whole lot uh I I skipped this
generation so honestly waiting a couple
time yeah I mean yeah ton I I'm still
wearing my original pebble Todd and I
both kick-started the pebble time there
just is not enough on the Apple watch
and also I got burned so bad by the LG G
watch yeah they both yeah I I just I'm
not a fan of Android wear I admit it I i
want to see Apple watch mature and I
want to hear a lot more thoughts on it
before i plunked in any money on one
yeah I want to see like when the bulk of
review I mean I know early reviews are
out but I want to see a bulk of reviews
what kind of apps are there and stuff
like that but it sounds like it's
already pretty successful I mean where
the estimates two million orders
something like that 1 million in many
other ways we've heard what a million
we've heard two we depend on the analyst
you ask right and we have to wait for
Apple to tell us and since it's
launching April 24 we're gonna have to
wait until the second quarter earnings
which are going to be Marty april may
june after june so in july sometime did
you hear what Apple watch hills are
officially like unless unless Apple you
know Phil's people in ahead of time we
we actually have gotten several
questions about if we ordered one and so
for all of you thank you for asking you
know but I had to choose somebody to
to and through that one on from Sean the
man 34 sean is your Apple watch coming
on Friday know and we'll take a bustle
have an Apple watch for Friday videos
ours are supposed to be arriving of
course there's always the chance of
delivery problems but yes the the plan
is that our ours will be there arriving
friday morning and we will then of
course be filming unboxings and
everything else yeah we we actually just
brought up that i guess some shipment
notifications are going out from UPS
today so if you did order them be on the
lookout for that but really apple just
gave a shipment window I mean I know
it's supposed to launch on the
twenty-fourth but they said between the
24th and may a so hopefully a lot
arrived on the twenty-fourth including
ours and we have a couple i'll be doing
written review we're going to have it
filmed out not the 1i bought it's a
technical unit because i didn't buy one
yet we'll have one out in irvine we also
bought the regular apple watch in
addition to the apple watch sport so
we'll have a lot of coverage as soon as
they come in from such a mahal off topic
what do you guys do if a company wants
to see you guys product for you to write
about on technobuffalo i just got a
request for a company as send me their
product the vector cup holder which he
tweeted you and I about the other day
but I don't know if I should accept it
or decline it I this is just a great
general question for anyone that once
again blogging because you will be
contacted frequently about you know
people wanting to send you products for
review our policy and policy I've always
had at every set I've worked at is you
can go ahead and accept it but do not
under any circumstance guarantee them
coverage yeah especially if it stinks
yeah I mean you may you accept a product
and it doesn't live up to what they told
you whatsoever and then they could
always come back and go well you told me
you'd give me coverage well no I can't
guarantee you coverage so you can accept
products all day long but it does not
guarantee them cover which it also does
not guarantee them positive coverage
so you just have to exercise your own
ethics and just simply go this is how it
is and you know when you're a younger
blogger and I mean in your career not
necessarily a younger person but when
you're a new blogger you know your fear
is well if I give this a negative review
another company won't send me a product
trust me there are so many companies out
there that want coverage you will never
lack for products being offered to you
yeah well stuff a lot but you do want to
keep stuff in line with your coverage do
you like the cup holder I saw a picture
of it it's not something new and cover I
mean it's just a desk accessory yeah
there's not a curly but we we get
pitched on stuff every day then like
have you ever seen us write about
anything even remotely like this yeah so
yeah it's yeah it's just you have to
kind of play it by ear but just make
sure you never ever promise anyone
coverage let alone positive coverage
from an Ave 9900 what do you guys think
Apple is going to show at WWDC 2015 new
products updates new products updates
what are your predictions that's a good
question I think we'll get our first
taste of iOS 9 will learn about whatever
the next version of OS 10 is and who
knows what they'll call it um I don't
know we and I met oh I'd love to see
that hopefully an apple TV refresh and
if iOS 9 comes with a music streaming
service to which seems like an iOS 8.4
beta which we've tried I have not tried
but it's on the site if you want to read
more about that I appletv refresh this
point is almost a they have to yeah they
cannot delay this any longer mm-hmm you
know I I don't know why they've taken so
long but whatever well my thought is
that the first because they announced
home kit which is like a software
development tools for this
smart home and then those products are
supposed to start coming out this spring
so once the products hit then they can
see like now here's your hub you know if
the appletv really is the smart horner
smart home hub it's a lot of people
think it might be well and that plays
into another question we have from David
DeMille what's the deal with home
couture or are any products quote apple
certified with home kit unquote there I
don't think they're out yet I could be
wrong but they're supposed to start
hitting the market soon so they have the
tools and they're coming yeah yeah so I
I I do think that the apple TV is going
to play a major part in home kit so yeah
I think there has to be I want like I've
started and people have asked me for
like a smart home do we do much with it
i started to because i said i got a
puppy so i bought a drop cam down at the
beach my father-in-law has a nest that i
install which is really cool and then i
have a smart plug for a light in my room
and i gotta say it's weird having like
three different apps for all these
things and i have a folder but i'm
excited for these kits and i hope that
they're you know that there's one aptus
wouldn't manage everything and i think
that's what we're getting and yeah um
Sean the man 34 do you think Star Wars
The Force awakens will become the
highest grossing film and beat out
avatar at number one nothing in this
world would make me happier to see
average her number one spot I i am one
of those people I hate avatar I think it
is a horrible movie I I there I've got
out and publicly said it I think it is a
horrible movie I enjoyed it but I won't
wash it again unobtainium that's all i
have to say uh than the fact that it was
Dances with Wolves with blue people but
I I will never understand how that movie
made that much money ever is like to do
is hyped beyond anything now oh and now
the fact that he has the gall to film
three sequels at once mm-hmm
I'm just like Cameron I'm out I'm out um
I don't know Star Wars has it in it the
whole problem is that films like Star
Wars speak to a very specific
demographic and while they'll have a
great opening weekend they're in the
movie industry it's called front-loaded
they'll be front loaded with a huge
opening weekend and then drop off like
rock so the whole thing with avatar was
the fact that no one had seen anything
quite like it and so had legs from
people speaking to other people had word
of mouth going for it that's always
that's going to be a tough thing to top
and how titanic is the second highest
grossing film is completely beyond me I
remember seeing in a theater the first
time I saw a trade this was pre-internet
days really so I mean I was that's where
you would see trailers I remember saying
there I turned a an old friend of mine
that was watching the movie with me I
was like I don't want to spoil it for
you but I'm going to predict right now
the boat sinks how did you know what I
just I'm that good dude oh goodness
gracious um I am sorry to this person I
am now you're going to try to pronounce
your name its start both to first and
last name start with k's uh hey guys do
you think the next iPhone will include
wireless charging I haven't seen any
indication will I'd love to see it do
something like what Samsung did with Chi
and PMA support and but the only thing
is i guess i don't see in an apple-like
do it unless it works really well and
i'm just saying that in general you know
whether you agree with me or not but
wireless charging is still very very
slow and I feel like unless there's
another way to get it to work a lot
better maybe it's not going to be there
yet you know it's odd I'm not that
excited about wireless charging
I was for a while and then you're like
when you sit there with all the quick
charge stuff which is great and and
you're like well I could plug in and it
can be charged in like you know an hour
or whatever where I can put it on this
pad and you know it's going to charge a
lot slower than you'd start to think why
would I ever put on the pad I I know I I
I think someday the technology will be
impressive but for right now just like I
was plug it in yeah exactly i mean just
get a doc attach it to a quick charger
you know and there yeah yeah the doc
exactly uh from such humble haul off
topic you do any of you guys watch the
show Silicon Valley I have not started
it I want to watch it i just have not
had a chance to get into it yet i have
actually I caught up this week on the
first two episodes and then I went back
and watched the rest of last season that
I hadn't watched yet it's funny I like
it at first I didn't I know I know it's
weird but I had started it when I was
out in irvine we were watching it Roy
Choi and I and and then I didn't really
continue much more and then I saw it
come on after Game of Thrones I was like
that was funny so I mean there's not
that many episodes I think there's like
six and the purchasing them I thought it
was funny the only thing that the kind
of bothers me is working in the industry
all this sort of name-dropping and stuff
at first was just like like TechCrunch
Disrupt and blah blah blah you know
because we have to read that stuff all
the time what it's funny show yeah I'll
watch it somewhere I just have not had a
chance yet we're going to quickly speed
through a couple more questions here
that are actually related technobuffalo
from breads and Franco updates on the
twitch channel the twitch channel is not
dead we it just failed that we have so
much work to do that it's hard to sit
down and play a game on a camera for a
while there I was playing I was doing
like a Saturday morning session and I
quickly realized that when only four
people would show up to watch me that no
one cared to watch me play video games
so the twitch channel is not dead it's
just going through some retooling uh
from Sean the man 34 just want to say
that I've enjoyed the movie news i'm
talking about flow lately hope you keep
posting
those besides tech we have every
intention to continue with that way and
we're thrilled that everyone has
accepted them into the TechnoBuffalo
fold we greatly appreciate that from
such humble hall are you ever going to
have John or other tech con buffalo
staff members on the TechnoBuffalo show
we've addressed this before we really
really want to we have a couple problems
number one being scheduling conflicts
number two the fact that most of the
staff is in irvine so there are two
hours behind and we do the show
typically right when they're coming to
office also they have a really horrible
air conditioning problem it's not really
an arrogant it air conditioning works
great in the office but every time we've
tried doing a podcast with them it
sounds like there's a jet engine though
he is mine and the problem is because
they're in an optical they have no
control over their conditioning they
can't just turn it off right so if we
can ever figure out a way to isolate a
mic enough at the irvine office he'll be
on the show more let's take one more
question why not from David DeMille I'm
looking at at a new macbook pro do you
think they will refresh it in June at
WWDC and should i wait did they just
refresh well they just refreshed it they
I actually have it right in front an so
i'm using it's the new one with the
force touch and they upgraded from 4th
gen intel processors to 5th gen I mean I
guess they can make other tweaks to it I
don't see it coming back quick though
yeah but it's awesome and I befallen
don't feel don't feel bad if you do too
final question from David demille's
TechnoBuffalo going to make an appt
maybe just wait and see pom-pom that's
all I'm going to say on the topic right
now yes we will have an appt eventually
