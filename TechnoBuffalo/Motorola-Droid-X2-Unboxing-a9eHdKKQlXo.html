TechnoBuffalo comm if you saw the other
video you know I came home I had three
packages waiting for me package number
one was this gal the HTC Flyer flower
Wi-Fi so you can check out that video on
its own package number two let's check
it out
all right in package number two it is
the Droid X to the next generation joy
next generation Droid X with the NVIDIA
Tegra 2 dual core chip inside from
Verizon Motorola Google video inside
what do we got here I'm looking at the
tearsheet may 19th available online
beginning May 19th so this one is out
and about 1 9999 with a new two-year
contract it'll be in stores May 26th
it's online now 200 bucks with a
two-year contract that of course means
voice and data the device itself it's
Android 2.2 there's a 2.3 update coming
they said it's got the dual core
processor inside 4.3 inch display
looking and feeling much like the
original Droid X with the 4.3 inch
display but it's got that that dual core
on the inside there we go see that
you've got flash support you've got
mirror mode so you can watch your videos
and your photos and stuff out on a big
monitor via HDMI you've got an 8
megapixel camera on the back 8 8
megapixel with HD video capture what
else can we tell you reading off the
thing here but you know that's how you
do it mobile hotspot available it's got
swiped pre-installed on the keyboard so
there you go it's a 3G device not a 4G
LTE device so you know bear that in mind
also in the Box you get an AC adapter
that goes with the Motorola micro USB
cable and then you get your warranties
and and information documentation and
stuff so the Droid X definitely I don't
know sales figures but definitely a
popular phone I see them out a lot at
least around here in the San Francisco
Bay Area where everybody's a tech junky
but definitely you know the the large
size of the phone I wasn't so sure when
I first saw it but since then you know
the Droid Charge and all kinds of
devices just bigger bigger screens so
4.3 inch again 3G only no 4G it does
have Wi-Fi of course and the dual
cameras and the dual-core processor is
the big Big Kahuna here for sure so what
some will go to you know I always know
Mega Doug's got his games online watch a
little video as well what's good on
these games
this one's letting up
but I don't have keys so I don't think I
can do it go back I know I can do
bowling bowling all these always works
cuz it works off the off the mouse input
so off the touchscreen it's gonna play
some some mega Doug bowling here I robot
Bowl lanes I should really take the time
to select a ball color one of these one
of these times that I play let's roll
now can I scroll this down a little bit
all right
zoom it out a little bit it's a net in
so I was trying to say oh look at that
it's your oh yeah this is pretty this is
very responsive it's going it's going
fast all right so you know what better
idea let's go to flash comm guru.com
flash comment yeah and look at their
full screen flash video demo and see
what we get here well you know
unscientific impromptu Flash Player test
I maximize there we go maximized and
play please there we go
I mean that looks that looks pretty good
little pixely not sure you know the the
source clip here so but the you know 30
impromptu testing of the of the Droid X
2 here you know the keyboard is nice for
typing because it's so big and the
response the ret page rendering you know
when you load up a web page it is the
network speed but it's also the page
rendering and the page rendering you
know really pretty good here things
rendering pretty quickly relative to
them down lighting over the 3G network
too bad it's not a 4G phone but then
again lots of places don't even have 4G
phones but that's that's pretty speedy
performance it it looks like kind of off
the bat on the left side here you've got
your micro USB and HDMI a Jack's on the
right side you've got a rocker switch
for volume and that kind of thing you've
got your for Android buttons on the
front up top three half millimeter
headphone jack and your power lock
switch and then that 8 millimeter 8
megapixel camera dual LED flash HD video
and no front facing camera I don't
believe we'll just make sure here I
don't really want to deal with that
right now
sure let's just look at the settings
real quick yeah no there's no there's no
front camera it's just uh it's a video
or or photo
so there you go quick look at the Droid
X to the new generation of Droid X a lot
like the original with dual core power
under the hood again available online
right now in stores May 26th much much
more on the Droid X - that thing I
showed at the beginning the HTC Flyer is
in the other box and sooner off we'll
find out what was in box number 3 over
on TechnoBuffalo comm so next time my
name is Noah we'll see you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
