technobuffalo and this is a review for
you of the Macaulay bookstand ipad case
this case is about fifty dollars of just
about ten dollars more than the standard
apple ipad case although you can
actually get it from some online
retailers for ten dollars less forty
dollars so really it's the same price as
the apple ipad case you know the rubbery
black one so let's take a look at this
case and i'll tell you what's good about
it and what's bad about it so it's made
out of this micro suede like material
it's synthetic but it's very soft and
it's it looks nicer I think than the
standard ipad case that you can buy from
apple the way that it works is that you
take out the little flap their you flip
it over and just like the ipad case from
apple you have to connect something back
here so that you get it into a stand so
i can rest this on a table and have this
sort of viewing angle or you can turn it
like this and have a more sort of
propped up viewing angle that's more so
conducive to you know watching movies or
looking at the newspaper while you're
eating lunch things like that this is
actually one of the best features of
this case is that you can place it in
this angle and it stays extremely sturdy
one of the problems with the ipad case
from apple that when you go into this
into this angle it gets a little bit
rocky back and forth but this is
extremely sturdy and it even will prop
up on a couch or an uneven surface
because it's a kind of very thick
surface down here that keeps it in place
so that's one of the best features of
the case and of course you can go into
this other angle which is good for
typing but one of the problems with this
angle is that you get a little bit of
rock side to side this really doesn't
bother me one of my friends noticed it
and found it to be a little bit annoying
but most of the time i'm using it in
this vertical angle and so I don't have
any sort of issue with that in terms of
the protection I haven't yet dropped
this which is a good thing i guess but i
think that if i did drop this thanks to
the protection on the corners and the
front and the back the ipad will be safe
there is some exposed area here and and
and on the ipad case from apple you
don't get this
exposed area but again i think if i drop
this it's going to land on a corner or
on the front or on the back so i think
i'm pretty safe with that now a few pros
in a few cons the pros as i mentioned is
that fantastic sturdiness that you get
in the vertical angle another pro is
that the material is nice to the touch
it looks great it looks high quality it
actually sort of looks like real suede
from across the room some cons is that
the construction is a little bit
question of what when you get close up
you can see that this is a kind of cheap
synthetic material I'm a little bit
concerned that the stitching is going to
fall apart after a few months and I also
don't like how you can get creases in
here if you rest it on a a weird surface
a weird textured surface I'm also a
little bit worried about how long this
sort of class boil will last because it
requires that this clasp stays tight to
keep this flap over going over onto the
side but overall this ipad case has
changed the way that I use the iPad I no
longer have to prop it up in some weird
position and I like that it's different
than the ipad case that you get from
Apple so overall i recommend the
mccallie bookstand ipad case i'll post a
link on technobuffalo on how to get it
and it's got my stamp of approval so
that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
