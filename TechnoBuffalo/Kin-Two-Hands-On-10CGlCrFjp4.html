screen it has higher resolution camera
so as an 8 megapixel camera on board as
well as the capability to shoot HD video
so you'll see it's a horizontal slider
so it reveals the full court and
keyboard and it's got an 8 mega mega
memory so this home screen is what we
call the loop and this is where I can
keep in touch with all the people and
all the websites and RSS feeds that I'm
interested in so you'll see my friends
lenee and Heather are on here as well as
I'm a big music fan so you'll see MTV
buzz-worthy that I have I'm I have their
RSS feed in my loop so one of the great
things is that this loop is
automatically updated with the content
coming in from all of my social networks
and any RSS feed that I subscribe to and
say I see a piece of information coming
through here that I think my friends
will be excited about I can do I can
share it using the spot so the spot is
this dot down here and it really is the
new way to share I no longer have to
think about how I want to share thinking
something and open the right application
I just worry about what i want to share
and who I want to share it with and drag
it all down to the spot in one easy
location so i can drag
newsfeed and then I can go over to my
favorite so my favorites are all the
people that I've told can I contact the
most
so while all of my contacts were
imported from my social networks when I
signed it I've actually told my phone
that you know I'm really good friends
with Sam and Justin and Cecelia and so I
want to make these people really easy to
contact I don't have to hunt through all
of my contacts anymore they're right
here and I can tap on them and quickly
call text or open their contact
and if I open their contacts
I can go through and see Sicilians
facebook page and actually it's all of
her wall postings
all of her status message updates and
everything that's going on so I don't
actually have to go to facebook at my
browser it's all right here and for
myspace page as here as well
so I think Cecelia is really going to be
interested in that MTV
article that I found so I'm going to
take her and drag her down to this spot
and I'm going to take my friend Justin
who's really into music and drag them
into the spa
and now all of a sudden I have that RSS
news article that I found and I have the
people that I want to share it with and
then i can hit send and send it to them
via text message and the mass or email
and I cannot go over here as well
we look on board the camera application
that comes with kin is really great so
we found that a lot of our customers are
using their their phone camera in low
light situations so they're going out at
night the club or someplace with low
light and they still want to get good
pictures so we've actually have a lumi
LED on the back of the phone and the kin
to as i said before has an 8 megapixel
camera and shoots HD video so i can go
through and take tons of photos and
they're all automatically backed up to
the studio so the studio is the cloud
for Ken and so I never have to worry
about deleting any photos off of my
phone
because they're all in the studio for me
automatically backed up so even if I
lose my phone I'm not I don't lose all
of the content and I can view all of my
photos on the big screen the studio so
say I want to post this photo that i
just took to my social network again I
just dragged it into the spot which is
there on the camera application to and I
can tap upload and I can upload it on
one of my social networks really quickly
and easily</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
