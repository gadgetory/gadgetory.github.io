Hazleton with technobuffalo we've
already brought you a full review of the
Moto X this however is our custom
version it just came four days exactly
from Fort Worth Texas from when we
customize it online and it came with
this skip the little tool that you can
actually tap parrot using NFC presumably
then Bluetooth tappets unlock your phone
if you have a whatever a password set up
so just want to show you that it's
pretty simple look at pictures online
will try to bring you some more coverage
of it but that's what looks like let's
look at the phone first that's what we
really want to see get a pen here to
open it up this plastic off all right
there's a box that says read me first
activate it yeah we already know how to
do all that stuff you can go through it
if you need to let's see what I got whoa
yes I chose the neon yellow color with
red accents you can see there the power
in the volume buttons and around the
camera and then a black face texting it
can wait this is on AT&amp;amp;T looks like
there's two plastic covers here will
power it on while it's powering sup
playa that's what I customize the
message to be all right in here get
started guide everything you expect you
got the power cable cord here and then
the sim tool for popping in your own sim
card pretty basic alright we've already
seen what's in the box so let's look
here what it's like when you get it
let's get started start in English now I
already put my google account in this it
should yes let's go see it it should
have my google stuff because that's what
i did online when i customized i log in
automatically no we don't care about me
is well i don't know if it's there let's
try to go into hangouts maybe
nope ok so my google accounts not there
and actually logged in so it should have
been here ahead of time kind of
surprising in any case I did choose that
background so we get that let's see
about blow where I'm not sure what's
going to be on the device just a little
bit my AT&amp;amp;T and looks like everything
else migrates there that's that will
help you bring everything over of course
Motorola sis we've gone over all these
features already basically I just wanted
to show you what comes in the box
there's my custom engraving moto 137
sorry for the focus issue there moto 137
that was a joke on an email chain with
us journalists not crazy about this
color to be honest right now it's kind
of hoping his little brighter yellow but
um not too bad again you've got the 4.7
inch 720p display up front looks pretty
crisp for more on that just hit up our
full review i just want to show you what
you get in the box right away when you
get the phone our google account was not
logged in it did take four days to get
here which is perfect that's what they
promised it's assembled in Fort Worth
Texas and this was set up using AT&amp;amp;T the
custom tool called moto maker will come
the other carrier soon but right now
it's just AT&amp;amp;T any case that's a quick
