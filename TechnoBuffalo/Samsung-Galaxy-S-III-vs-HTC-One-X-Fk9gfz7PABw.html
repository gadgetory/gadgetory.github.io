from technobuffalo and it's time for a
smartphone smackdown just to start off
the new year we thought you know what
let's pit two of the highest in Android
phones together and see which one comes
out on top one is the samsung galaxy s3
now it's packing some awesome
specifications and it's been out for a
while and it's got things like a 1.5
gigahertz dual-core Snapdragon s4 CPU a
four point eight inch Super AMOLED HD
display an eight megapixel camera and
now Android 4.1 voice crack included on
the samsung galaxy s3 actually you'll
get the voice crack but we're gonna
pretend like you do they have the HTC
One x+ over here the successor to the
HTC One X and it's packing a quad-core
NVIDIA Tegra 3 cpu a 4.7 inch HD display
an 8 megapixel camera and Android 4.1
which one's going to take it home in the
smartphone smackdown let's go take a
look two of the hottest Android devices
here in the office right now that are
available on US carriers one is the
samsung galaxy s3 this is available on
verizon AT&amp;amp;T sprint t-mobile US Cellular
for 199 dollars but what's really great
about this device is you can find it
cheaper in a lot of different places the
Amazon wirefly all those different
third-party retailers best buy mobile
and more are often selling this device
for less than the 199 price which it
debuted at at least for the 16 gigabyte
version in their respective either
online stores or brick and mortar stores
so you've got this device it's been out
for a while it's available in different
colors depending on what carrier you're
on on AT&amp;amp;T you've got blue and white on
every carrier but on AT&amp;amp;T you have it in
red and Verizon you have it in brown and
in black as well as the white and then
the blue as well so the one x+ over here
at ATT device available for 199 dollars
the killer here is specifications it's
got a 1.7 gigahertz quad-core NVIDIA
Tegra 3 processor a 4.7 inch HD display
720p HD display 8 megapixel camera on
the back with 1080p HD video recording
and HTC's image sense chip then you've
got android 4.1 as well with HTC Sense 4
plus and then over on this side 1.5
gigahertz dual-core Snapdragon s4 CPU a
four point eight inch Super AMOLED HD
display it's also 720p and 8 megapixel
camera on the back with 1080
HD video recording and then of course a
2,100 milliamp hour non removable
battery scuze me removable battery over
here on this one it's a 2,100 milliamp
hour non yes using a non-removable
battery on this device so both of these
devices are incredibly spect they're
great Android devices they're high in
contenders this one what really draws it
though even though only has one gigabyte
of RAM is is 64 gigabytes of internal
storage on this device 64 gigs out of
the gate compare this to something like
the apple iphone 5 which if you wanted
the 64 gigabyte variant you're going to
pay 399 to get it for that price or for
that with that amount of storage so
that's something that's really nice
about the one actually get a great deal
of internal storage for a good price
point then you have this device like I
said over here to galaxy s3 packing some
great specs incredible seller let's take
a look at some of the personalization on
both of these devices but before we get
too far into that take a look at the
build quality on both this one
polycarbonate shell very similar to the
HTC One X that came out earlier in the
year on AT&amp;amp;T in terms of design you've
still got the same micro USB charging
port on the left side the volume rocker
over on the right side 3.5 millimeter
headphone jack and power button up top
your micro sim card slot right back here
in the back that of course your camera
on the back as well then the galaxy s3 a
little bit more of a plastic feel which
you're either going to love or hate some
people love the lightweight feel of it
some people hate it it's got a volume
rocker on the left side power button on
the right side 3.5 millimeter headphone
jack up top and you got your micro USB
charging port down here at the bottom
and then on the front you've got
capacitive buttons as you do down here
three capacitive buttons back home and
recent applications then over here menu
back and then a physical home button
which doubles up in android 4.1 to bring
up Google now and of course your recent
applications as well to get to that over
here press and hold home to access
Google now and then press and hold the
menu button to access your recent apps
you can customize that menu button and
make it your own in terms of if you want
it to be a menu button or recent
applications button all you have to do
press it for menu press and hold for
recent applications if you have that
enable but let's talk about
personalization so we don't get too far
off of the beaten path here you've got a
couple of different options here and
both of these devices do a great job
when it comes to personalization you
have the typical android stuff your
things i love like notification
bar things where you can get all your
all your messages in one place then of
course you have your wallpaper
configurations things like that what I
really like in applications widgets over
here we'll take a look at the widgets on
this device and then just press and hold
the one x+ to access those widgets so
out of the box you get three home
screens on the One X plus you have the
ability to add four more to make seven
and we'll bring those in so you can see
and then we'll press and hold and bring
up our widgets now HTC both HTC and
samsung i should say offer a great
number of widgets on their devices some
of which are obviously stock google
widgets and some of which are
manufacturer based widgets for example
calendar HTC you can see the two
different calendar options you've got an
android option then you have an HTC
option within that you get a couple of
different types of calendar you get a
monthly calendar we got a week of the
calendar and then you've got a per
appointment calendar and then over here
on widgets you've got your calendars in
here to buy three or four by four so you
got some different Samsung options in
addition to the stock Google options as
well so Samsung brings in their own
widgets HTC brings in their own widgets
and the great thing about android 4.1 is
their customizable there we go so I can
customize that make it my own as you can
see they're very similar with the HTC
widget as well so we'll just do all
calendars and hit ok we'll go back home
and we'll scroll over to that widget
press and hold it you can see that it's
customizable as well quickly and easily
which is really really nice so call
quality and battery life are pretty
interesting as well in addition to the
customization both of these devices do
really well in the call quality
department the earpiece sounds nice and
loud I've had no problem with the
speaker phones on either the galaxy s3
or the one x+ and I find that the
battery life is a little bit better on
the galaxy s3 now granted it's a 2100
milliamp hour battery powering both of
these devices and they both have 4G LTE
capabilities on a TMT so you're not
going to get blazing awesome battery
life if you're using this device for
more than kind of light to moderate use
that said I'm finding about 11 to 13
hours on the galaxy s3 I'm finding about
9 to 10 on the HTC One x+ and obviously
that depends based on your personal
usage if you email more than I do or you
watch videos more than I do but I do
find that while the standby time is
incredibly good on the 1x plus the
actual battery life itself could use a
little bit of work even though this is
moving up from the original 1x the
original 1x had an 1800 milliamp hour
battery
this has a 2,100 milliamp hour battery
so a bigger battery but a processor that
consumes a little bit more that battery
makes for a slightly better battery
performance all around but still not
quite a part of some of the other
devices like the galaxy s3 and other
high end android devices on the market
now let's take a look at camera is well
there's some great camera settings on
both of these devices that really make
them useful it's going to applications
will go to the camera and take a look
start a camera well start this one up
and what we're doing that will do this
one as well an HTC offers an awesome
feature on there's their image sense
chip and what I love is let's say you're
at a soccer game or a football game and
you want to take pictures in burst mode
as quickly as possible maybe your
daughter's soccer game you can quickly
take a bunch of different pictures and
then save those and it will bring up a
list of all those pictures you can
choose the best shot you can delete the
rest but you've got 20 pictures to
choose from and likewise you can be
recording and so will be reporting a
video like we are right now and I can
click the button and take still pictures
as well so little features like that I
find particularly useful this is
something that was a carryover from the
original one series The One X and the 1s
that were announced at Mobile World
Congress last year and of course you got
your settings in here as well where you
can change iso white balance continuous
shooting all that good stuff now over
here great options as well you've got
your settings which you can come here
and you can do very similar settings in
here you can press and hold and do kind
of a burst mode of sorts coming here so
you can see burst shot and I can quickly
take and I have the sound turned off but
you get to take 20 quick burst pictures
in here as well and I could choose best
photo and I've actually best photo it
allows me to choose the best of eight
pictures and I could click and processes
and find my personal favorite the one
that I think came out the best and snap
a picture and be good to go which is
really a nice feature so you've got
these features on both devices what I
really like though about the galaxy s3
is the personalization it brings in
addition to Android's obviously Android
has some great customizations and great
personalization choices what I really
like is that they moved it to the next
level with the galaxy s3 so let's take a
look for example let's say going down
through here and you want to take a look
at some of the lockscreen customizations
now you have some lockscreen
customizations on the one x+ as well you
got this typical half circle lockscreen
that you've seen on HTC devices with
sense in the past and there's some great
new benefits to the 1x plus some new
lock screens and new
themes and more we can go into settings
and personalized you can take a look at
some of those skin wallpaper lockscreen
style bunch of different options here we
can change the skin around really make
this device our own where I think
Samsung takes it to the next level as we
can come over here to lock screen
options and you can see some really cool
things that a lot of times I think to
myself why weren't these in stock
Android or maybe this could be a
springboard for future Android options
and stock versions so you've got dual
clock here information ticker you can
set this and really make it your own for
example we can come down here to camera
quick access and turn it on I can hit
okay turn it off and back on and I can
press and hold the screen and as soon as
I turn the device and then it goes right
into the camera so there are a lot of
different cool shortcuts in the software
that really make this device useful and
it's not just with the lock screen it's
also in the main area as well let's go
into settings and not music hub let's
jump in here to settings and we'll come
up here to display and let's go down
here too smart say things like the
screen stays on as long as you look at
it so with smart stay enabled if I'm
staring at the screen the screen stays
on its smart rotation it will detect
when I'm laying in bed for example and
it won't rotate the screen if it sees
that my face is staying in a certain
position that's a really really nice
feature in addition to font style and
font size and battery percentage and
more so I'm a big fan of a physical
battery percentage you do get that on
TouchWiz as well you can see it says
ninety-four percent up here in addition
to kind of the arbitrary battery meter
over on the HTC side you don't get that
level of customization just yet although
I hope to see that in future versions of
HTC Sense so it's a tough call and this
smartphone shootout between two high-end
Android devices both of these on AT&amp;amp;T
then of course the galaxy s3 is
available on a bunch of different
carriers in the US who's going to win so
as always it's a tough call between
smartphones it really depends on what
you use your device for if you use email
more web browsing more there may be a
phone that's more suited to you than
another one that said it's got to be a
winner and a smartphone smackdown on the
winner is the samsung galaxy s3 this
thing has got the best of almost
every bit of the world in terms of specs
in terms of performance in terms of
features and availability across
multiple carriers so it is the champion
and smartphone smackdown thanks so much
