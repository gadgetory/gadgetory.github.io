technobuffalo here with a recap of
Sony's keynote from this year's e3 last
year Sony's e3 brought us a new
redesigned PlayStation slim this year is
all about motion controls and new games
let's go ahead and get started anew me
look down because I got some notes in
front of me the keynote ended just a
little while ago always gotta previs
eight with things like that so let's
talk about the playstation move it's
sony's sort of answer or response to
louise motion controls and i'm saying
competition with microsoft's kinect so
it looks almost like a wiimote with a
little bit of an ice cream cone on top
and they're going to be a few ways you
can actually purchase this we finally
now have release date and pricing
information first you can purchase the
PlayStation Move sports championship
bundle which is going to come with the
playsation I to game with the
essentially wii sports on the
playstation seemed like every console
now has a version of wii sports and the
move controller for ninety nine dollars
we pick up the controller itself or just
shy of 30 bucks 2999 or if you want to
get the ps3 bundle with everything
including the ps3 it's going to set you
back just about four hundred dollars be
available September 15th in Europe and a
few days later September 19th in North
America so playstation has always sort
of been knocked for its PlayStation
Network whether you agree or disagree
it's always been the prevailing opinion
that Xbox Live was better but you're
going you got to pay a premium for Xbox
Live to get those extra features well
sony has sort of taken notice they've
bumped up now the PlayStation Network
which something that's being called
PlayStation Plus slink preface this by
saying this is not going to affect any
of the current functionality
functionality of the playstation network
that is when we made the same and remain
free however for fifty bucks a year or
eighteen dollars for the first three
months you're going to get access to
tons of premium content supposedly
dedicated servers just for gaming so you
won't have to really deal with something
shared servers that Sony's use in the
past you get faster online gaming
experience now get access to two betas
and a ton of more stuff early the first
three months of either those
subscription plans will be free in case
you want to try it out it's going to be
a big benefit I think
sony one of the things that thought was
holding the playstation back was a
playstation network but looks like it's
been alleviated completely and it's look
today very robust platform whether i'm
very excited to try out so let's talk
about games because they announced a ton
of great games graphic wise to
playstation 3 is an extremely powerful
console and developers haven't really
begun even tap into the powers and
multicores that the capabilities of the
device I would just started is home to
see these now mature games that can I
take advantage of everything that the
playstation can do and we sort of solve
these games now announced at e3 let's
talk about what we saw we saw a
remastered Medal of Honor called
frontline will be out October twelfth
for all you you know World War two fans
or just shooting game fans in general
dead space two portal 2 which is an
awesome awesome game portal 1 is
fantastic sequel to it looks even better
final fantasy 14 I believe was what that
X 1 V was I'm gonna see you I new
assassin's creed assassins creed
brotherhood the exclusive content
directly on the PlayStation 3 we're
going to see gran turismo 5 which
actually going to be in 3d it's going to
come on 3d on one side of this and
regular on the back and we're going to
see a new twisted metal game sunny also
talk distance Eastern out about 3d
because it's a big deal with the
playstation 3 thing a 3d capable console
you're going to need a 3d game and a 3d
TV and you'd have to wear 3d glasses but
they are going to be available on going
to be coming very soon so us anything
sort of a large sort of keynote ish
announced for that Sony gave they give a
lot of really cool things that I think
PlayStation fans are really going to
enjoy and their game lineup look to be
fantastic so know what you guys think
about playstation move and as it stands
with Microsoft's Kinect and the wiimote
