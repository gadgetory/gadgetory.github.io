TechnoBuffalo here they review for you
of the first ever touch screen only iPod
Nano let's see this little guy is worth
the money
so if you want to pick up an iPod Nano
of your own it's gonna cost you 149
bucks for 8 gigs or 179 for 16 so first
being an iPod let's talk about the audio
playback it's typical apple and typical
iPod quality comes through very strong
with various headphones I didn't have
any crackling strong bass everything
sounds very good so if you're worried
about how music is gonna sound on this
little guy don't worry it's going to
sound quite good so let's talk about the
main attraction or detraction here and
that is the screen and the operating
system it is a 1.5 4 inch TFT display
the resolution of 240 by 240 and it
looked very similar to iOS so
interestingly enough it is actually not
an iOS device there's no app store here
and it's based on a different source
code but it looks very similar and acts
very similar so your home screen is I
have throw of 2 by 2 or column the 2 by
2 for total icons with pages you can go
ahead and scroll through I'll show you
what your icons are here you have
playlists now playing artists radio
genius mixes podcast settings photos
songs albums composer genres fitness
it's yours for your Nike stuff in the
pedometer and a clock and the operating
system works it might take you like
again much like the Apple operating
systems that you're used to if you want
to move icons around you go ahead and
hold them they do a little jiggly dance
and go ahead and move them anywhere you
like you can use this button on the top
here to go ahead and stop them from
dancing and set on where you are and
also you've got actually physical volume
up and down buttons which is quite nice
so how does navigation work with an only
touchscreen and there not being a real
home button well it's actually kind of
interesting the home button is actually
the screen itself via hold down on the
screen it goes ahead and takes you back
home a little bit weird and definitely
strange to get used to this does have
multi-touch I really the only place you
can see it is in this
rotation and go ahead and rotate this
any way you want much like previous
generation iPod nanos you can sync your
photos to it although the only way that
you can really use multi-touch again is
to rotate them there is no pinch-to-zoom
here things work very oddly in the music
department and let me go ahead and show
you what I mean
so if you want to go ahead and view
artists for example you get your full
artist lists and on this 1.54 inch
screen you have to keep scrolling down
you can do the same scroll on the left
side and get to the letter find what you
want and go ahead and pick it to go
let's listen Jake for example and it
looks very much like it does on an
iPhone or an iPod Touch hit the home
button or trying hit the home button and
it goes back a playlist is very similar
you have the ability to add and create
your own playlist on a fly which is
quite nice I'll show you what it looks
like when you're playing music that's a
little bit different as well so now
playing there's some good to be me
there's no album right here we can go
ahead and scroll through and you can see
if there was album art it would just
show up there and if you want to see the
controls you go and tap the screen and
you get back forth in your typical
playing icons if you see that little eye
in the bottom right hand corner if you
tap a bat you can see other songs by the
band and the album you can scroll
through and even give it stars if you
want right here 1 2 3 4 or whatever you
like if you wanted to go back your
screen you don't have to actually hit
the home button to go back or hold the
screen you can swipe your finger back
that'll take you right back home this is
taking a while to get used to to get
used to this new operating system an
overall wallet is functional I am NOT a
fan of navigating on such a small screen
and if you don't touch it for a while
it's gonna take you right back unless
you pause it I over all it's working
like I mentioned it's functional but
it's very difficult to go ahead and
scroll through I do miss being able to
take the scroll wheel and just keep
going down bound down and spinning till
I get to what I want as opposed to not
having a flick to where I want to go
some nice features and some additions
are the physical volume buttons I don't
have to use the scroll wheel now and
unlock the device to control the volume
I do like addition of a clip on the back
which makes this sort of a nice I watch
if you want to put it in a little watch
after while you're at the gym or
clipping it to your shirt so it is
definitely a bit
positive but there are a lot of glaring
negatives there are actually a lot of
features that are missing from this
generation iPod Nano over even just a
previous generation that came right
before it primarily they were missing
the camera on the back it wasn't the
best camera in the world but it's nice
to sort of have that option if you guys
remember the iPod Nano I was gonna be
the vice that was going to kill sort of
the flip minnow series of devices well
Apple evidently it's really retracted on
that Battlefront and taking out the
camera completely on the iPod Nano
although I suspect it's something that
we'll see on next generations on the
other nice things about this knife pod
now in this previous generation is that
a speaker built-in you listen to the
music right from your iPod you can no
longer do that on the new nano there
isn't any sort of built-in speaker with
just a little bit on the annoying sites
they go to now playing hit play push the
volume all the way up there is no music
coming out and unfortunately so if you
relied on the speaker you like to sort
of have that option not gonna work for
you of course this generation iPod Nano
is fully compatible with all the
accessories and chargers and so I use
the same 30 pin connector but if you're
used to a dock that has a slot for the
iPod fully cut out this is gonna be a
little bit hard to fit in there is a
thickness difference too because of the
clip so it may not work with all your
accessories without is sort of an
adapter to make it work something to
keep in mind
so can I recommend the iPod Nano yes and
no it's definitely a mixed bag if you're
a big gym rat you want something you can
just clip on and have a little bit more
controlling you would have an iPod
shuffle the Nano is going to be an okay
option if you're a big music aficionado
and you're managing a lot of playlists
and a lot of albums and a lot of songs
it's gonna be very very very hard to do
on such a small screen in my opinion
this iPod Nano should have probably been
the evolution of the iPod shuffle not an
iPod and expect a iPod and have a little
bit of a larger screen something like
this even if it was all touchscreen that
would have been okay almost like an iPod
Touch mini I suppose would have been a
nice scenario so well it is very kind of
cool and you get a lot of nice looks
while you're out it's not going to be
that functional for you so I cannot
recommend
this generation iPod Nano in fact it's a
great time to go ahead and pick up a
previous generation iPod Nano which does
pretty much everything - the touchscreen
that the new one does for what's going
to be a lower price now and you get a
camera and a speaker it's very
interesting to see the evolution of this
iPod Nano line from what began as the
iPod mini which actually I have right
here the first-generation iPod mini I
was cleaning out my wife stuff and I
happen to find it you can really see how
things have changed we've gone from this
large thick a spinning hard drive design
to a much thinner flash design and now
to a completely touch only design you
can really see the evolution here it's
like the evolution of man type picture
you see things get smaller smaller
smaller and touchscreen now Apple is
always tried continue to innovate this
may be a case of innovating too far and
doing damage to a good thing so again a
conclusion I cannot recommend the new
iPod Nano make you're much better off
picking up an iPod Touch if it fits your
budget anyway guys I'm John Rhett enger'
