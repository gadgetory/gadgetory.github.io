to you by Linda calm what's up everyone
John render from TechnoBuffalo here
welcome back to the episode of rumor
roundup we got a lot of rumors to round
up this week we're going to talk about
Apple's new watch designs they might
also be getting to your home Google is
looking to buy Dropcam possibly and last
but definitely not least oppo is going
mini this rumor roundup let's start
rounding them up alright so just do me a
favor close your eyes and imagine in
your mind's eye we think the iWatch
gonna look like what shape is it you
probably said like rectangular square
like this pebble I'm wearing but you
might be changing shapes of course the
eye watches points little rumor
obviously caveats apply but one analyst
is saying that Apple is already
developing multiple size options for
what apparently will be around face
SmartWatch before you're talking about
analyst I know most of times they speak
like Ace Ventura which is to say at the
butts but this one has a little bit of
weight to it I think so speaking to a
Business Insider rosenblatt securities
brian blair reveals when you learned
after visiting a supply chain sources
during a trip to the very beautiful
taiwan so apples rumored SmartWatch were
allegedly feature around the splice
similar the upcoming moto 360 unlike
Motorola's first Android wear device
though the iWatch will supposedly sport
is super slim down sexy design we don't
know how Apple is going to slim down and
smart watch all the recent reports have
hinted that they could just cram extra
sensors into the main processor to cut
back on any extra chips hello time you
want extra chips we have a swim pool
party you can just blur also reports
apple released two versions of the
iWatch this year likely targeting men
and ladies separately with larger and
smaller models you can guess which one
might be for which if the rumor is true
it could help Apple appeal to a broader
market I'm like previous SmartWatch
models and really just earned a one size
fit all bang and usually too bulky for
anyone with smaller wrist to where he
also predicts Apple is going to produce
a whopping 18 to 21 million units I had
a van official i watch launched earlier
this year we're not really sure if that
watch I'm going to happen
same pretty likely but if Blair is right
it sounds like Apple might be on the
right track of course we have WWDC
coming up just next week so could know
that sooner rather than later you know I
kind of started to prefer the idea of
around 2 a square screen size an
offering multiple size options to help
appeals more than just the first way of
tech enthusiasts hopefully though you
know not that much longer to wait but
I'm not bleeding anything so I see mr.
Tim Cook walk up on stage and be like
boom i watch fools we know apples
thinking about getting on your wrist but
might that thing in your wrist be a
Trojan horse Apple getting into yo house
so it looks like if you believe the
rumor mill that Apple might be jumping
into the smart home game next week at
WWDC so according to report from the
always reliable financial times reliable
Apple will be launching an all new
software platform at the conference the
report indicates Apple will be
attempting to take on competitors like
Google and Samsung with a piece of
software it's going to turn your iphone
to make control for such household items
like appliance security systems and
lights and whatever else my temple might
get into so apples master plan is said
to include a scheme similar what it does
but the made for iphone brending on
accessories that all the manufacturer to
just slap an apple logo on it to inform
consumers that the purchasing works with
whatever this new system is going to be
called with privacy always super in top
of consumers mind this new labeling is
said to help calm the fears the product
has met Apple secure standards and
protect the privacy for use in their
home which certainly is important a new
initiative is also set to have a
connection to the incredibly rumored
apple television device not Apple TV but
actual set referred for some time now at
the newest iteration of the device would
include automation aspects and if it's
true it would certainly fit with those
rumors it's speculated Apple TV would
act as a central hub for the system to
then sort of drive sales even further
for drank customers into that Apple
ecosystem as well they love ecosystems
is just another one however while the
apple TV is expected to be discussed at
wwc it's supposedly will not launch
until a fall so the Internet of Things
as it sort of come to be known is sort
of viewed as next big marketing
technology and it certainly I feel that
apple will definitely not want to be
left blank ketchup and a smart home
technology has been gardening a lot of
attention this year with Google
acquiring nest for 3.2 Billy and Sam
recently launching its smart home line
of products so there are obviously a lot
of rumors before I talk about the next
one let me thank the good peeps at
lynda.com with and we all want to be
better at something we all can be better
at something I can't draw but I wish I
could so I could probably improve on

thousands of super easy to follow video

a shot try lynda.com free for seven days
by visiting Linda calm / TechnoBuffalo
that's ly ND a complex check my buff
learned something new might find you
like it or might find you have a brand
new skill so while we're on the topic of
home automation Google's smart home
business officially lifted off the
ground and the company acquired nest
earlier in january they aren't
reportedly interested in expanding that
business with acquisition of Dropcam
which is our favor here at the office
we've got like nine of them here it's a
popular affordable video based home
recording system according to the
information and that's it's not like
according to the person like the
publication the information google has
at least some interest in buying Dropcam
although just how far along any rap
potential acquisition talks are is super
easy right now the goal though is
accelerate the push of Google's efforts
into creating a more connect at home
however Google already has two bucks on
the market Nest Learning Thermostat and
nest protect alone protect was recalled
because if your wave at it it just
turned off during the future looks to be
connected homes and drop cam would give
Google yet another consumer facing
product for its connected home business
had a competitor's like app we just
talked about which reportedly gearing up
to announce its own platform coming up
very very soon imagine just like a nest
with the Dropcam in the middle of it how
creepy would that be I thought this
going to happen is yet to be seen we
love drop camps nice to see sort of good
people i know the folks that are star
it eventually make a ton of money but
not it works from the long run for
Dropcam for google obviously a ton of
privacy concerns got microphones and it
can always listen it's always watching I
could see maybe that one cause a bit of
concerns but we will see we will see it
sooner hopefully rather than later what
you guys think dropcap cushion by google
good idea not good idea of deer your
thoughts on leave in the comments write
down blue let's wrap this sucker up with
the TV daddy rumor last week the Oppo
and one mini link its way through the
FCC and earlier this week the chinese
company has confirmed that the device
with a press invitation posted on Weibo
for a May thirtieth events they were
ants inspected to be a scaled-back
version of a baller and one which
launched late last year so based on
recent leaks were expecting the Oppo n1
min to offer a 5-inch 720p display a
rotating 13-megapixel camera 21 40
million power battery and LTE I don't
know what device is going to come in a
San gen mod period please like the
flagship model otherwise the design
looks extremely similar to full-fledged
oppo n1 although it should be typically
easier to fit in your pocket compared to
the 5.9 inch Gigantor it also expected
to follow up with the end to in the near
future but we're not expecting to see
that device unveiled at May thirtieth
outer and much about the new smartphone
beyond its alleged name but it's
probably too early to release any new
flagship model to six months after the
Oppo and one hit the market what are
your thoughts on it kind of cool more
cyanogen phones the better i hope that
we get that I would be super duper happy
thank you guys for watching please
subscribe right here be the first ones
to know whenever new videos get uploaded

tablets cars anything has to do with
consumer electronics that's be plugged
in or uses batteries we review</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
