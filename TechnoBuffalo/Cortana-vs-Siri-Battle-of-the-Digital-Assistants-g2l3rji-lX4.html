to you by Dollar Shave Club what's up
everyone
John rent you from TechnoBuffalo here
every smartphone operating system has to
have a digital assistant now to compete
of course
Apple has Siri Microsoft's nill are
gonna be standing on the sidelines
they're bringing Master Chief sidekick
Cortana into the phrase I want to put
these two digital assistants
head-to-head and see which one comes out
on top so I want to give the few caveats
here that's certainly Cortana still in
beta
not only in beta but now we're using it
on a beta OS on Windows Phone 8.1 now
there are ton of differences between the
two you can type to Cortana Cortana is
going to learn more about you what you
do but I wanted to pull serve a nice
random sample of things at least I
personally use digital assistants for
whether it's been Siri or whether it's
been Google now so I got ten questions
here in front of me I'm going to use
sort of asked both and see how they
perform and past comparisons I've hit
both at the same time let's see what
comes up but I want you to hear the
responses from each I'm going to go one
and then the other so of course
obviously we got Syria here on the left
then we got Cortana right here on the
right running on a Lumia 1020 so I'm
gonna start with the one that I use
everyday and that's what's the weather
outside what's the weather outside
it should be nice between today and
Monday up to 77 degrees Fahrenheit so
when to keep track of how long it takes
to pull up the information both connect
to the same Wi-Fi networks and what's
their information it shows whether or
not color and things along those lines
so for Cortana either can launch Cortana
as a standalone app or just hit the
search button so go ahead and launch the
app what's the weather outside so let's
say Cortana pulled up to information
little bit quicker I think in that
instance I think Ceres sounded more
natural you can see it's sort of black
and white motif versus a color it just
sort of depends on the color scheme and
the theme both different os's let's go
ahead and ask another question
who won the angels game so that gave me
the schedule who won the angels game so
that pulled up the website now before
when I've asked who won it's pulled up
score so I can show that it's not always
going to be the most accurate I should
ask it why the Angels bullpen can't hold
the lead but there you go set alarm for
30 minutes I think Syria is a really
quick job it's quick it's response if
you get a toggle right on the screen to
turn it either on or off go and turn
that off they don't want it to go off
set an alarm for 30 minutes so very
quick shows up there see the information
let's go ahead and set a reminder remind
me to buy milk cancel all right remind
me to buy milk
so there you can see a difference is
asking when you want to be reminded bows
just setting a reminder in a dedicated
app so ones up better than the other but
definitely different approaches to the
same question I'm trying to ask both
using the same cadence same tone of
voice to make sure everything is sort of
fair across the board let's go ahead and
launch an app launch Safari so I was
watched Safari it misinterpreted launch
Internet Explorer so there it goes and
an exporter will fire up so see a little
bit of difference there let's try and go
to a website go to TechnoBuffalo com so
this thought I meant that I want the X
go to location that was called
TechnoBuffalo com didn't recognize it as
a website go to TechnoBuffalo com so
this Lee's pulled up a Bing search I
could select it and go right to
TechnoBuffalo from there let's try a
question how old is Kobe Bryant old so
you can see Kobe Bryant is 35 and it
gives you all of his stats and does a
really nice job with sports pulling it
in from Yahoo how old is Kobe Bryant and
that's all the information that I've got
so I've got his birthdate and then it
does pull in a searches down below
because I want to get more information
so there is that
I think Siri gave more information in
that instance electron move ease show me
movie times for Captain America the
Winter Soldier
so I can select it tells me everything
that's playing and it links to fan deck
okay so I want to buy tickets show me
movie times for Captain America so then
it just pulls up a web search to go to a
website bang the mobile fending go in
this instance and try and find tickets
in there let's ask two more questions
what is the national animal of Scotland
so that pulled up a web search in case
you don't know the National almost
Scotland is it's kind of funny what is
the national animal of Scotland
so I actually showed it and told me that
Unicorn is a national animal of Scotland
we take a quick second to thank our
friends and overall good people at
Dollar Shave Club look this face clearly
I hate shaving it's mostly because
buying razors kind of blows you got to
go the store you got a gas the manager
with the zits for the key to a plastic
razor thing then you got to shell out
just crazy bucks or some asinine shave
tech that you probably don't need my
razor
honestly worked fine before it got a
vibrating hands on a laser pointer a
little Lucy does love laser pointer
razors but fortunately though there is a
company that's doing away with all of
that silliness and getting down to what
matters it's called Dollar Shave Club
and it really couldn't be simpler for
really just a few bucks a month Dollar
Shave Club ships pretty awesome quality
razors and other bathroom goodies right
to your door and their blades are just
as good as other big shape companies at
a fraction of the price which is good on
your wallet and your face they've got
things like dr. Carver's easy shave
butter to make your shave even more
buttery smooth appropriately for the
name and you also got to try one wipe
Charlies the new pepper mint infused
wipes for men listen we all do it this
way you'll come out of it feeling all
fresh
smiley shave time shave money join
Dollar Shave Club now go to
dollarshaveclub.com slash TechnoBuffalo
now back to the video
let's Riley for some images show me
pictures of buffalos because I'm into
that so it pulls actually images from
Bing so you got the Colorado Buffalo and
pick
Buffalo's show me pictures of buffalos
and there we go
so I wanted to show here is give you a
comparison of both not necessarily to
say one is better than the other but to
make the point that Siri which has been
around for a few years so well formed
and works well in Cortana which is sort
of new to the game is a viable
competitor right now in its first
iteration Microsoft certainly waited
many years you could argue should have
had this out several years ago but the
fact that it's here now and worked as
well as it does is really impressive it
doesn't do everything Siri does but then
again it does some more things that Siri
doesn't and I think it's sort of six or
half dozen you know they're really close
I think they both do excellent job so
what you guys think
Cortana Siri they do sort of different
things but do them kind of the same way
I'd love to hear your thoughts and see
which one you would pick up if you're
basically decision just on digital
assistants which one would you go
forward to Cortana and press you is Siri
what you think you'd go with I really
want to hear you guys dots please leave
them right down below
