TechnoBuffalo here at the for review for
you of the latest from Samsung this is
the galaxy s6 edge almost identical to
its galaxy s6 counterpart save for some
very curvy sides let's go ahead and see
if this phone should be the right one
for you as I do with all my reviews I'm
going to give it a giant disclaimer I
use this phone for five and a half days
on t-mobile and most of what I'm gonna
say here applies also to the galaxy s6
we've gotten a separate review so if you
watch that it might sound a little bit
familiar if you want to see that review
though put a link to it down below
I'm and with the score and a buy not buy
recommendation kind of something you
haven't done before previous phones we
gots the lightning round at the end
where I answer all of your questions
that couldn't really fit in a section so
with the Galaxy s6 edge there were four
things I want to know about when I first
got my hands on it so we're gonna hit
those four things just right out of the
gate I want to talk about screen edge
build quality and TouchWiz this is
hands-down the best screen I have ever
tested on a phone and I've looked at
pretty much everything that's come out
over the past four years I can't
overstate enough how gorgeous the screen
looks things look bright natural colors
look really rich the blacks look really
black it's got really solid outdoor
visibility it's got good viewing angles
everything about it just looks good as I
mentioned in the galaxy s6 review a lot
of people have been saying coach look a
bit overexposed that's more on TouchWiz
aside and how it displays the icons
other than anything else and you put on
a third-party launcher screen is going
to look absolutely gorgeous I kind of
get qHD now I don't really know if it's
the 2560 by 1440 resolution or just
Samsung's wizard tree here but the
screen just looks gorgeous
if screen is the main determining factor
for you and buying the phone then just
the stop here right out to the store and
go get the s6 or the s6 edge cuz they
nailed it so obviously the s6 edge has
that extra word at the end the edge
because it's got those two edges so it's
really curious about it the moral here
is they really add nothing functionally
at all the contact quick dialer I almost
immediately forgot about and also less
they have to be only
on the edge it seems like that could be
on the s6 also the information ribbons
were neat but I also just kind of
stopped eating them after the novelty
wear off but it did wear off relatively
fast I did most of my testing on
vacation and when I was on vacation the
clock that we had in our hotel room was
on my wife's side of the bed so I
thought hey great time and test out the
night clock functionality what it does
is it turns the screen almost off and
you can see the time on the side that
would be absolutely perfect but because
this is one screen now to set the screen
on the side like we've got on the note
edge essentially it has to show like a
black image on the screen and then you
can see the clock on the side that
creates its own light issue and we've
got my insomnia if you guys don't know
that the screen is actually brighter
than I expected so I to turn off that
nighttime clock mode so really all the
features of the edge I didn't use but
hot damn does it look good and that's
really to me what the edge is about it
looks really nice it looks like Texas
scrolling in from nowhere you're
scrolling on the phone and everything
about it just looks cool bottom line
though you aren't getting any more
utility out of the edges used in my
opinion you are pay connection hundred
bucks for the design and there is
nothing wrong with that
I liked picking this phone up I liked
looking at it I like the way it looked
from the side and the profiles tiny bit
of glare on the edges were a curved
around but I could deal with that in a
heartbeat
so I've been really a hard on Samsung's
build quality for a very long time
simulates since the Galaxy s2 it seemed
at least like used to design just one
device and then just make different
sizes of it every few years the same
around note it is completely different
and Samsung I think nailed it the
aluminum edges feel great it is a little
bit sharper due to the edges when you
pick it up you got to kind of wrap your
fingers around it be a bit little tricky
not difficult I ain't used to it all
around though it just feels premium
gorilla glass on the front and back I
like a little certainly when you drop it
or if you drop it might have some
difficulty is I don't know how a case
can perform on this I didn't have a case
to test how it's gonna impact the edge
but if you are a case fan you might want
to wait to see what comes out not
although is perfect in the design world
it does have a gigantic unnecessary
large galaxy s2
edge on the back that's a bit much
you've got that branding you got a
Samsung logo on the back and a Samsung
logo on the front Michael just wear a
shirt that says I'm using a Samsung
phone Billy plus I at least on t-mobile
variant you live any carrier branding so
that's kind of cool last thing I should
mention the bottom of that phone looks
I'm just gonna say it
vaguely familiar to something else so I
can admit when I've been rough and to
say that I've been tough on TouchWiz in
the past I think would be a monumental
understatement here admittedly a month
the biggest TouchWiz fan you can dispute
the usefulness of TouchWiz Samsung
really since the galaxy s3 has taken the
software approach to just throw
everything at you and oak that you like
a few of the tweaks so you really can't
call it a skin anymore it's almost a
straight brand new carrier version of
Android and it's straight TouchWiz
through and through this version tries
so very very very hard to break from its
old habits but can't quite give them all
up here first and credit needs to be
given the annoying reapz bloops and
water droplet so you got and turn on the
Samsung phone you and the immediately
tried to disable those are for the most
part gone so that was a positive
experience from day one you can also
disable most unwanted apps here which is
again another positive thing if you
don't want to see them TouchWiz is also
now 40% lighter so you're probably
saying what does that mean John it means
a lot of things you'd have to go through
a tutorial to learn how to wave your
hand over it to any calls and that kind
of stuff you don't have millions and
millions of apps to scroll through
Samsung's happy to let you download
those from the Galaxy store but they're
not here it does still retain kind of a
cartoonish look and feel of the icons a
theming engine is now built in which is
a really welcome touch a lot of people
have been asking if you can still use
the theme pleasing a third-party
launcher and the answer is yes well
mostly you'll still see the theme of
your choice notifications and the
settings another server various screens
the more although TouchWiz finally grew
up and now it doesn't detract an
experience doesn't issue the ad all that
much either but if not taking away from
the overall joy of using Samsung phones
I would exclaim though that it was
nova though through moves this reveal
there's been a lot of noise on the
internets about same condition
replaceable batteries you got to ask
yourself a very serious question say
self am I the kind of person actually
carries a spare battery to when you
travel or go out and about if your
answer is yes you're not gonna be so
happy the 2600 milliamp hour battery
which case you're wondering is 50
million I'm bigger than what you have in
the 6 is not the best in the world I my
normal daily usage at end the day around
20 to 15 percent we did though run some
drain tests and the battery was good for
about six and a half hours of on-screen
time pretty much identical to the galaxy
s6 I would played HD video with
brightness set to auto and no volume so
a few battery caveats to mention it
charges ridiculously fast
I went from about 20 percent it's almost
80 percent in a little under 40 minutes
when I was plugged in with the included
AC adapter so if you gots like a minute
to plug in you're gonna be able to get
some that battery life back another way
to get better life back is with wireless
charging which now is pretty much every
standard built-in so I mention camera
earlier hidden behind dat hump is a 16
megapixel sensor that delivers great
results outdoors looked absolutely
awesome really low noise excellent
exposure and image quality colors are
accurate in the details surprisingly
kept even when zoomed in oh and he went
to the low-light though wasn't great it
was a little bit on the warm side
definitely better than what we've seen a
lot of recent smartphones also
wide-angle lens on the front so get all
your friends in your selfie for way more
on the camera we'll talk more about four
capabilities and that kind of thing
again link will be down below to full
written review in addition to non
removable battery
girl so don't have expandable storage
anymore and this is an issue for a lot
of people and for me is a bit hard
overlooked than the battery one so I
know the argument that it's fast man
without having to read an SD card a
night I guess that but Samsung at least
in their commercial has always been
about choice and that choice has kind of
been taken away with the galaxy s6 and
galaxy s6 edge oh we've got now or
larger storage options out of the box
built in memory for 30 to 60 428
personally micro SD cards not really an
issue it doesn't bother me but if you're
the type person that needs a card likes
to swap out cards
seriously consider whether that you can
live with built-in storage and that's
not something that I can answer for you
the s6 in the edge also the first time
we've seen the Exynos make its way into
the u.s. Shores initially feeling what
that is it's two differently SPECT
quad-core processors kind of merged and
mellowed together to essentially make
one octa-core processor if you get guess
octa-core and 64-bit
this thing is crazy fast and looked me
in the eyes when I say this come closer
there is no lag here at all no lag
nothing is going to lag for you game
scrolling everything is ridiculously
fast here you got that and three gigs of
ram you're not gonna have any slowdown
issues open apps you heart content
scroll until your finger gets sore don't
worry about it things are going to be
buttery buttery smooth but don't take my
word for word I know you guys love
benchmarks we ran the n2 to five point
six point two and I've got a pretty
whopping 64 thousand 691 so I'm gonna
wrap this up with a kind of a new
segment for the galaxy s6 line of phones
just got a random facts based on thing
as you wanted to know that I didn't
really fit into a category so think of
it as a lightning round the speaker is
now found on the bottom not on the back
and it is way louder than before in call
volumes also a bit lower than I'm used
to I don't usually think that much
better in call volume but the fact that
I noticed it means it was definitely
lower than what I've seen before even
with the camera humped when you put the
suck around a table it's not going to
wobble when flat this was a big one for
me can charge wirelessly when powered
off so yes for that thumb prints to
unlock is way better than previous
Samsung versions and got even better
over-the-air update for a t-mobile unit
so super usable also it runs kind of
warm so if you start to feel a burning
sensation and in this area don't run to
your doctor just take your phone out of
your pocket the screen also seems to be
pretty fingerprint resistant nice I'll
be a phobic coating on it the back is
well but that might be due to the fact
that we've got the white one this one's
kind of weird when you have your
fingerprint sensor enables unlock your
phone let's say it doesn't work for some
reason or you got gloves on and you got
to put a password to unlock it you can't
just do a simple code you got to do a
combination
of letters and a number in there so just
kind of bear that in mind also the apps
that you might have been using on the
note edge don't work here's entirely
different set of API so if you got the
note edge and like oh I'd like this cool
thing that it does might not be
supported here so just kind of bear that
in mind so what's the verdict on the
Galaxy s6 edge I usually base on my
phone reviews but that I could use it
for two years let me tell you this I am
ordering one of these for myself I'm
going to buy one and I'm looking forward
to using it as my daily driver if that
tells you absolutely anything I've got
access to pretty much every phone out
there from build quality to software I
think Samsung actually hit this one out
of the park I know they use that analogy
quite a bit
yeah the edge doesn't we add in the
additional functionality if that counts
to you but it looks really really nice
and that mattered to me if that doesn't
matter to you say 200 bucks 50 galaxy s6
you're gonna get exactly the same
experience you're also gonna get a very
good phone final score it is getting a
nine the same as its non curvy
counterpart I didn't get any higher do
the extra cost but ask yourself a
question trying to pick which phones for
you
but I care about the design or I'd
rather just save 100 bucks you're
getting functionally the exact same
phone spec wise almost the exact same
phone I like picking this phone up like
way I felt when I scrolled but that was
just me for this 800 bucks you're still
gonna get a great phone either way both
of these devices are really strong buys
and I'm excited to use this for the next
year or so and I think you guys for
watching out to your thoughts on it is
the galaxy s6 for you the galaxy s6 edge
