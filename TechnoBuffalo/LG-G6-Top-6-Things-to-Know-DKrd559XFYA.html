speculation we finally have the LGG six
isn't a final production unit so I can't
do our full review but I have been
testing and using it for about 48 hours
and there's been a ton of questions in
the comments of our video down the
article about the phone so I took the
six biggest questions because LG g6
things like six things make sense so I
hope you guys understand the phone and
what it can do and not do a little bit
better so the first big one is the scree
resolution it's 18 by 9 and I had the
same question the video is why isn't
just called 2 to 1 so I asked LG but
what the heck and they said people are
used to that 9 number so 16 by 9 makes
sense so calling it 18 by 9 just made
sense to people but I like to do
division so for me it's 2 to 1 but
that's at least the reasoning behind it
but more importantly in the reasoning is
what that's going to give you at least
what LG claimed it's going to give you
so it's a really long screen or it gets
kind of wide if you could turn it that
way it's great for multitasking which is
sort of native now to Android nougat
which indeed just has you almost get to
square blocks if you are multitasking
which is a really cool way to see two
things at once you know watch a video or
replying to a text or an email and also
obviously LG did a lot of stuff in their
own software take advantage of the
unique screen real estate their camera
app for example you get a full carousel
on the left hand side or the top pending
on how you're holding it so you have to
click a button to see all of your photos
you take and you can see them right
there also they have a square camera app
so you can see your Instagram pictures
going to look like before you take them
there's a lot of things that it can do
that maybe you couldn't do on
traditional 16 by 9 or 3 by q aspect
ratio so the question that I saw a lot
was about the curved screen it's not
curved like the s7 edge the screen
itself while flat is curved in the edges
are curved that's to make the phone a
little bit more durable so if it hits in
the corner you can sort of dissipate out
that impact point there also a lot of
other durability things that went into
the phone it has pretty much all the
guerrilla glasses so the front screens
guerrilla glass three over the lenses is
a Gorilla Glass 4 and then a curved
piece around the back is acrylic glass 5
so really all the Gorilla Glass family
is is on board here as well and I'll
gels talked about about the structure
the phone to make it more durable for
drop so not that I'd suggest you drop
your phone but if you happen to drop it
you should be alright perhaps the
biggest question was about the battery
3300 milliamp hours if people were like
what the heck
other flagships have bigger batteries
and I mentioned in our hands-on video
LG spent a long time talking about the
battery they could have put a bigger
battery in but they left space to make
sure this thing is safe you could tell
that them probably every other
manufacturer out there is terrified that
what happened with the note 7 and wants
to make sure they avoided that so they
tested this battery at normal heat
levels 130 140 degrees it gave it room
to swell they just want to make sure it
wasn't going to smoke explode or catch
fire I think you're going to see a trend
amongst manufacturers sort of followed
that route so that's why the battery
well big isn't as big as perhaps it
could have been or maybe would have been
I feel 7 didn't have its issues that
said LG does claim pretty good battery
life and in my two days of testing
battery life has actually been pretty
solid but more I use it
Marla Jean oh another odd question was
where's the power button on the thing so
the fingerprint reader on the back can
actually push it in and that's also your
power button so you guys love high
quality audio so good news bad news the
DAC on the LG g6 not here we live in us
instead LG opted for the two wireless
charging standards PMA and Qi but DAC
will be there another market so we need
your digital analog converter you might
want to look to import device but at
least for wondering and asking what's
going on to DAC night up and last
definitely not least this was the
comments that I saw a ton of was and I
could be eating the bowl of boot loops
with the g6
I know LG's had issues with dating back
as far as the g4 with boot loop issues
they didn't spell it out and I asked
them about it and they wouldn't sort of
comment on if I'm using the phone at
least might personally have any boot lip
issues so don't worry about that
get another serial and you guys should
be should be alright so there's six
combined things to know about the LG g 6
anything else you guys want to know
about the phone let me know as you
continue to test and build up to a
review you wanna make sure use the phone
for a while to sort of talk about it and
the phone can do and it does a lot I'd
be pretty impressed with it but things
can change after only two days so let us
know in the comments down below what you
guys want to see and we'll talk about it
and I'll comment to the day it was from
our g6 hands on it was a very thoughtful
comment from Darwin 0:02 who says no
bezel my ass are you on crack or meth
and the answer is neither happily
neither what I meant was
besides the bezels are very small you
went from like zero to a hundred super
fast but because it's a conference a day
and I got it you know if you want to
check them out link to them down below
probably don't but if you do that's
where they'll be you wanna be featured
never come it comes today it's obvious
leave be it see you guys next</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
