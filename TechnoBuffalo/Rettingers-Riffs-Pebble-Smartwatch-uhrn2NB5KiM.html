to you by netflix what's up everyone
welcome to the debut episode of renters
wrist the show that used to be called
rettinger rants that one had about a
year long run to the realize I'm not
really an angry person I didn't have all
that much to write about every single
week if I didn't have anything it didn't
feel genuine to just make something up a
second doing a video so the new series
is write yours rips where I just talk
about something that's going on in my
head that's do with technology every
single week it up this week is the thing
that's loaded on my wrist the pebble
smartwatch let's go ahead and get riffic
so I didn't do a review in the pebble
smartwatch I just picked it up probably
about three weeks ago I want to see what
all the fuss was about people really
interested about it there's a huge
Kickstarter campaign I don't have been
sort of the go-to for smartwatches so I
bought one not a review units or picked
one up on my own I've got a lot of
opinions on it you're the kind of person
like me that Cecily has to check your
phone for email notifications I can be
quite rude to constantly be you know
going in your pocket pulled out your
phone looking at it make sure it's what
you need or don't need and putting it
back in your pocket on the table got
away if I got a baby at home and show us
ur it gives me that sideways glance and
only only women can do and they're like
you know you did something wrong always
got that now I get notification on my
wrist I can look at it say okay I know I
have to respond or don't respond right
away I never have to take that phone in
my pocket so i can turn steal a glance
at my wrists was like for notifications
it's really that's about it there's
nothing really new the watch does the
phone's not gonna do but the pebble does
it very very well so if you things i
like about it let's start with that
first is the weight i was really
surprised and how lightweight the pebble
actually feels you look at it it's
relatively big watch but it weighs
epsilon nothing don't even notice it at
all on your wrist that was quite nice
the buttons are really well placed easy
to find whether you're in a dark hood
movies for example just want to see
what's buzzing on your wrist really
really easy to find now they redid these
on the pebble steel coming out and
figured again with the pebble steel
coming out is probably good time to talk
about this guy before it became
antiquated and I like that you can
change his faces I like that slowly open
source and you can download a ton of
different watch faces and kind of
apps and the new pebble saw for coming
out there going to be an app store it's
going to work with this I also like that
pebble is keeping essentially the
hardware the same least internals of the
pebble in the pebble steel so it's sort
of not to piss off the early adopters
everything that skill can do now this
guy is going to do as well say for being
a little bit thinner not having gorilla
glass on the outside battery life we've
had sort of mixed results Ashley's got
one said she can easily get through a
week Ralph's got one usually about five
days I tend to get me bigoted
mortifications in most but I tend to get
about three and a half maybe four days
on a full charge and i turn it off at
night so i have had a few issues with it
bluetooth wise first if you want data to
show up on you i've got whether online
see how beautiful is in southern
california 77 degrees you gotta download
a third-party app called HTTP pebble
that creates another a bluetooth
connection from your phone so i paired
it now to an iphone 5s sometimes the
connection doesn't work with them the
drops out even if I'm standing right
next to it that can be a bit annoying
but on the plus side the Bluetooth range
is crazy far least in our office I can
be three offices down and still have a
nice clear Bluetooth signal slight
notifications right on the wrist so
again I kind of like it i also like they
use a standard watchbands if you want to
get a new watch but you can do that i
like the idea of the charger so it's
magnetic so it just sort of charges
right on their plugs in via USB and you
can charge the downside though is that
this thing comes off super super easily
so you have a hard time you know making
sure it's always hang on there's no
external way of seeing if it's charging
now they fix that in the pebble steel
the only way to see this as charging is
actually digging to them then you and
see the little icon from a software
standpoint i wish that i could go back
into my previous notifications once i
click out of it and I'm back from the
home screen those notifications are gone
gone or ever often times you take a
while for the text on email to actually
show up you get maybe a line and you see
the loading below it blue Jets enough to
know who it's from and see if I have to
pull out my phone it's actually worried
about responding to it I like that it's
kind of waterproof ish up to 5 ATM so
you know I wouldn't take it in the
shower you know with necessarily but if
you're washing your hands you don't
really have to worry that's probably why
you use that
connector these a magnetic connector
rather instead of actually having a
micro USB cord because you know stuff
can get into that I've actually really
enjoyed the peg one other smartwatches
but you're used to a very that's
something we're going to find useful
than you know maybe look elsewhere if
you're on the fence with it you might
want to wait until the pebble steel
comes out in the new OS comes out which
I work with both smartwatches you can
see what the apps you're going to be it
supposed to be totally open source and
the whole pebble store so kind of cool
things coming but I don't to share my
opinion it's kind of a mini-review just
general thoughts on the pebble
smartwatch you guys think if you tried
one a bit not tried one you can get them
at a nice discount right now if you know
where to look on the game was on
sometimes has been discounted best buy
had it actually where i got mine they
had a nice deal right before the
holidays on these so you can get up for
pretty cheap price before the pebble
steel it comes out pretty decent about
two hundred thirty bucks for that guy
pick this one up if you're lucky for
about half of that cost and i really
like it i'm excited for this deal but we
hard to get this guy off my wrist and
