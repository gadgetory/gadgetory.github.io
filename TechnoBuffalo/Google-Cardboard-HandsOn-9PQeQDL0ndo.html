from technobuffalo and today we'll be
taking a look at this awesome thing this
is the google cardboard from google i/o
take a quick look at what's inside then
about a week since Google's i/o keynote
where the company talked about
everything from Android L to Android TV
but the thing that stuck out to us even
more than android wear was Google
cardboard although it looks like
something a ten-year-old made at school
the project is actually really exciting
it could become an important part of
virtual reality in the future although
it doesn't seem like much Google
cardboard actually offers a fully
realized virtual reality experience it's
not quite as immersive as something like
oculus but what Google isn't it
certainly impressive using everyday
components Google is making virtual
reality accessible to more people pretty
much anyone with an android phone before
you need an expensive specialized
hardware to even think about using
virtual reality but would Google
cardboard Google is putting the world of
VR at everyone's fingertips kind of like
an old-school stereoscope Google's
cardboard used by convicts lenses and
these prevent distortion around the
edges and viewed in front of each eye to
focus 0 users eyesight on to evenly
sized windows on a smartphone this
creates illusion of viewing 3d content
it doesn't sound like much but it works
surprisingly well in addition to that
cardboard takes advantage of the devices
sensors allowing you to explore virtual
interfaces along with a ring magnet the
rest on a closure side the magnet
essentially allows you to click inside
of demos this works by pulling and
releasing the ring your friends of
nanometer will then detect the changes
in a magnetic field thus allowing you to
easily interact the demos inside a
cardboard app these demos include Google
Earth which allows you to see Earth from
space or swoop down into certain cities
and there's also street view where you
can drive through famous cities around
the world carb or may not seem like it's
in the same league as something like
oculus or even project Morpheus but
given the piece that are there there's
already a lot to like appreciate
Google's more inclusive approach to
virtual reality with interest in VR and
an all-time high cardboard is making
technology more accessible to developers
and enthusiasts we were lucky enough to
snag Google's pre-made cardboard
packages io google has laid out
instruction on its website which will
link down below this video detailing how
to create your own pair not only that
anyone can use the experimental VR
toolkit to create their own software to
that means anyone can make the rallis VR
dream a reality Google cardboard is
still in the very early stages so we're
not expecting any miracles just yet but
the more people that use it
we will get a company like oculus
started off small and now look where it
is now what Google is doing isn't
particularly new the cardboard
represents a commitment to pushing
virtual reality into a mainstream and
that's very exciting we can't wait to
see what kind of fun apps developers
create down the road what do you guys
think of Google cardboard are you guys
gonna get one let us know in the
comments down below and as always I'll
see you guys in the next video thank you
guys for watching if you have it yet
please subscribe will be the first one
to know and every upload new content
we've got new stuff coming every single
day we want to make sure you see what's
new in the world of consumer electronics</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
