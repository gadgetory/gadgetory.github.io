while you're talking and then you're
saying you're snapchatting get it Wow
John joke mid-con we go to a cocktail
party he's talking someone you're like
hey I'm snapchatting shut up okay races
we're good we're good what's going on
everyone John render can TechnoBuffalo
here and i'm joined by ron frida also
from technobuffalo arcuately from the
damn no Buffalo how weird would bring
back I guess not asked about the
Buffaloes as added the borough knows
with questions yes and we've got
questions for Ron who has been dubbed
the video surgeon Rhonda did you tell
yourself the videos were no neven did he
said I'm the video surgeon I'll take it
cuz i use the razor tool got ya boy you
can't dance jesuit in the doorpost first
question comes from the awesomely named
silly Steve who asks at John for lakers
all the speculations and moments do you
think the iphone 7 will be a turning
point for apple and a good or bad way we
were just talking about this too about
the direction Apple is headed in like we
should have filmed our conversation
we're I don't know we're not that hyped
on the direction apples headed in their
earnings just came in to write like
literally a couple hours ago yeah
earnings just hit so it's funny for
Apple even when they break records
people are still dissatisfied so they
still had record iphone sales but
somehow still sales the iphone are
slowing i think apple is coming up to a
point where their backs are almost up
against a wall for apple so to speak the
iphone 7 has to be has to be a right and
i'm optimistic you know I've been saying
this for years widget widget and
wireless charging I feel like eventually
stayed outside as an umbrella every day
and yell it's gonna rain it'll all know
one day that it rains do be right you'll
be a genius next question comes from
nobody awesome people like to describe
themselves all right very modern their
twitter handles human models know us
buta start TV from the ground up all
over again how would you make content
and how would you market it i like to
think that i started taking a buffalo i
was just naive enough to think i could I
newly just enough about business not
enough to know what I was getting myself
into if I was starting it now I think
the barriers to entry are so high yeah
any big critter youtube channel but to
get
noticed there's so many more people out
there than when I started I mean there
was really nobody nice not that it was a
great time I think what was at two
thousand six to two thousand eight was
looking a really great time for YouTube
because it was just so fresh and you'd
get seen and then if you have the
ability to like if you were you know
charismatic and good and information
lots of you would stick so I think it's
a different game now though so holding a
game now you have to almost market
yourself based on like well either would
hear you have or a weird style or like a
gimmick type video collaborations are
huge from what I've been hearing a lot
like collaborations are a great way to
grow just like do videos with other
channels and sort of cross promote next
one comes from a mr. Hughes 07 sounds
like a maybe like a middle school
teacher what computer does Ronnie's for
mobile editing note the surface book pro
for Allah has vid so what device so I'm
kind of like in no man's land I mean we
used if you guys watch the surface book
review that wasn't impressed I mean it's
a great product before video editing it
wasn't great I still use a macbook pro
and i use the top of line macbook pro
the only thing that it doesn't have is
the one terabyte piece a hard drive so
it's good if you get the job done I
don't expect too much from mobile
editing in terms of a computer but I
mean I wish I could expect more than
just isn't that many options out there
the new razor 2,000 years later the new
razor blade stealth that one with the
core with the deal with the dedicated
GPU separately that I'm really pumped
about that seems to be like the ideal
setup like we were just at CES we were
talking about that like it would have
been great to just bring one of those
and dock it when we were at our at our
little work area to yeah so but right
now use a macbook pro next one's for
four on two again two questions in a row
ron @ g metzger 16 asked why do i rid of
the fs 7 replace it at the a7 s2 oh man
um which is what were filming on by the
one yes we have we have to we have two
kits uh the main reason was because we
just figured it was kind of overkill for
us I mean we upload to youtube so if you
guys know like YouTube go through a lot
of compression and that's on top of the
compression you go through after
exporting so we're not premiering on the
a trickle screen of any kind it just
didn't make sense for us the XQD cards
are really expensive so it was issued on
SD so the media form was
journal 4k internal 4k so the problem
with the a7s previous to the mark 2 was
that you needed a Shogun and that
Michaux gun so this brings the body size
down there cheaper so now we can have
two kits instead of just one the episode
was pretty large and large and in charge
so it just works better for our needs
we're not saying they 7's mark use a
better camera it just depends what
you're doing but for our needs web
content light run-and-gun these are
probably the best cameras on the market
I think this is a personal question from
be James do Tanner who asks did you trim
your chest hair after that video John
did you crying emoji and then monkeys
like this emoji because he was crying
when he saw the chest hair and then he
had to close until he couldn't handle
the Chester no i am not trained my chest
hair no manscaping I'll patcher al dude
oh the sad what your answer is how much
I don't press yeah yeah buried the
married life kids we keep your Aires or
Dollar Shave Club just I don't know
that's what they had a vine for shaving
boy big J in my chest exactly oh same
guy our friend also asks how did you
find Ron or is your way to apply for TV
that's a good story so basically like
it's just it's honestly all but i think
it's about two things hustle and adding
value i think those are really two
things like life in life yet to succeed
at anything so i think it's really
Universal advice i personally was doing
automotive commercial work just
freelance and stuff like that and i'd
been a fan of technical for a long long
time you guys had done a car video it
was a serious club driven right and then
i kind of reached out and I was like hey
look i think i could add some value here
and i remember in the subject line of
the first thing i wrote something really
like pretentious but it's purely to get
john's attention because like I'm sure
you get the ton of emails so just try
and be respectful to time and it was
okay like I make videos I think here's
some of my work I think we can do some
better work I think we can you know for
its value so and from the other side of
it so when he receives a lot of emails
when Ron presented himself it was very
professional to the point it was here's
Who I am here's what I can do and here's
that can provide value it's hard to
argue with any of so if you're looking
to reach out to somebody for a job well
yeah it was so
it was synced concise to the point he
provided stuff that you had done pretty
blush no I'm Brown I can't blush not
true brown people don't blush I don't
think you can't tell like cuz why people
like turn red what are you talking about
so they can't see Andrew you have the
camera Kendra's as white as it gets yeah
it's about an interview with tan and
you're so white he could be a human
bounce board we agreed on that with two
weeks ago and I'm see through the next
one comes from my friend and youtuber
you should check out at super sad who
asked anything that is sorry what did he
ask his great stuff yeah he does which
phony was excited about I'm not a huge
rumor guy but based on what you've said
like the iphone 7 probably just excited
to see what Apple does next and I
totally jacked your don't better let you
go first I know I find her go first
though John it was John der phone I'm
sorry I think the iphone 7 plus
different phone I was excited every new
generation like every number change like
it's gonna be the one this is what we
get everything that I wanted yeah and I
can be like hey it's it's good you're
right thank you guys for watching along
or different more buffaloed pass test
about though I buffalo hope you guys
enjoyed we love making these videos you
like the style let us know get the video
of this guy a thumbs up mash that button
lets us it makes us feel good about
ourselves so my self-confidence is
deeply rooted in the comments section on
YouTube where we're all in the internets
who were all little self-conscious yeah
so mixes cool it gets feel better about
ourselves exactly tell tell ron he's
pretty but um make him make him feel
good I'll take it and I will see you
guys next
