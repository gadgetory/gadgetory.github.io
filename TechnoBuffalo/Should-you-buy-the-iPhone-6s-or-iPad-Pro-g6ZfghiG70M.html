TechnoBuffalo and I am just back from
the Apple iPhone iPad some other stuff
event that I wanted to share my thoughts
about it we did hands-on with all the
new products yesterday so if you want to
see those we'll link to them here put
links down below but now that I've been
a bit removed from the event and the
reality distortion field has dropped I
want to just give my thoughts on most of
the new phones and the iPad pro the S
models have usually been pretty exciting
save for maybe the 3GS this generation
though I don't know how excited I am for
it
so first the rose gold color looked nice
in person it's very shiny looks exactly
could expect certainly a bit more on the
feminine side of color spectrum but it
looks nice
the big story though is 3d touch or
force touch and again hold video
demonstrating it it does work completely
as advertised force touch and things
happen it's kind of cool to have a sort
of secondary input to make things work
on the screen so last night I got home
and I was trying to explain to my wife
what force touch is I showed it our hair
hands-on video and she's I going to get
this straight if you force touch on the
phone icon it pulls up your favorite but
yeah but not all your favorites she's
like well if I just tap the icon it goes
I can pick all my favorites I look yeah
but she's like let me show you what male
can do so I showed her the video where i
hold down male you can edit and create a
new new email and she's like well if i
just opened my mail app i I can do that
too
and sort of when you do force touch for
the phone for example you force touch
once and then you tap again on person
you want to call for example it's the
same thing with the normal phone you tap
the icon then you tap the person you
want to call nothing magic is happening
there I was like yeah but anyways I had
no response
so yes it's neat it works as advertised
it's really cool to see first touch on a
phone didn't get me that excited to go
run out and camp out to necessarily buy
a new device I was way more excited for
the iPhone 6 and the 6 plus
announcements I really was like just
wanted a bigger iPhone this one I'm less
enthusiastic about it also was a little
on this fishy side didn't mention
battery 1
I'm during the iPhone announcement
usually they'll say always new hardware
Plus same all-day battery life big
didn't following the event Apple
released a full product video where we
saw that the battery and the phones are
about 100 million hours actually smaller
than the previous generation so that or
how that's going to impact battery life
but certainly is probably not going to
make it much better the battery life on
the iPhone certainly was was not an
issue so as far as the phones go for
such as need iOS 9 is nice doesn't have
any sort of widgets that I personally
would have liked I don't know if I would
be running out to go upgrade in all
honesty for coming from two generations
ago so may say you're on a five astir
older absolutely if you're die oh s
users can be big upgrade if you've got
an iPhone 6 or 6 plus I don't know if
it's worth it if I didn't do this for a
living if I didn't review devices I
think I'd probably sit this jet out and
just see what happens but of course
we'll have them here and we'll try it
maybe my mind will be blown that I can
update my facebook status from just
using force touch I don't know but that
was my initial thoughts on it next let's
talk about the iPad pro and from the
videos that we did and from seeing what
Apple announced I think it's like a
magical device and it's really a twelve
point nine inch iPad it's a big iPad you
know exactly what it is it looks and
feels like an iPad air it's a it's a
big-ass iPad with a beautiful screen
high resolution everything but it's a
big iPad I can't stopping a hard time
figuring out who it's for so they now
it's the Apple pencil which was
weirdness sorta like this the Apple
announced a stylus that was a very
strange thing to see they're really
pushing hard the idea is for a graphic
designers they had graphic designers at
the event they showed him on stage if
you're a graphic designer and I'm not
one so maybe I'm wrong here and if you
happen to be one chairman in the
comments but if you want something
really exact to draw on where'd you pick
up like a Wacom tablet it seems like
they've been doing that for years with
much more accuracy than on the screen I
tried to pencil down it didn't work
really well I got almost kind of one to
one motion but I'm not sure what the use
cases doesn't come with the tablet it's
next 100 bucks doesn't have a place to
dock it or push
magnetically attached anything so I saw
the hard time realizing what the iPad
probably gonna be for although I'm
excited for for the only reason accuses
a big giant teleprompter so I have to
like squint when I'm looking it so like
yeah what does that say but that is not
a common use case but it's also super
expensive but again we'll have it here
and we'll try it but I don't know I was
also disappointed we didn't see an
update to the iPad air and they
mentioned the update to the iPad Mini
for like eight seconds on stage I'm just
my thoughts and ramblings on the event
I'm I was kind of excited day of and I
thought about it got home we watch her
videos and I was like really I think the
next-gen maybe might be the one to get
maybe iOS 10 will be the one that we
finally get widgets I would have really
liked some sort of quick charging I use
that on my Samsung devices all the time
it's like a magic trick wireless
charging every new iPhone I like this is
the one we're gonna get wireless
charging I'm like a guy who stands
inside it's an umbrella saying it's
gonna rain it's gonna write every day
today it's gonna rain today it's gonna
rain one day I'm going to be right and
on that day friends I will be a genius
uh Android is offering a lot of really
great options Android OS it's got a
really good marshmallows around the
corner you have a tough decision to make
with which phone that you want to get if
you're loyal iOS user try Android see if
something you might want to use if
you're an Android user maybe try iOS try
the other side sometimes nice the grass
actually can be greener I personally I
carry two phones usually I've got a an
Android device and an iPhone I have apps
that I use on both like the share
folders on iCloud but usually my sim
lease recently has been more in the
Android device another one I use is my
own personal phone but we'll see we
that'll change once you get the new
phones in and the last thing that I
wanted to talk about the phones it's a
16 gigabyte option you're going to
announce 4k recording live photos nos
it's going to probably take up four so
gigs they're going to a 16 gig phone
that's crazy
I can't a 16 gig phone if that
expandable storage not starting at 32 is
asinine to me people who buy a sick sink
they maybe it's all they can afford or
it's the least expensive way to get the
new hardware are going to get a limited
experience we had a whole article is
saying why you shouldn't buy it but apps
are getting bigger and bigger and bigger
apps are regularly a gig size you
install a few of those and you phone is
useless
don't forget about storing pictures
locally on your device forget about
storing any movies on your device you're
gonna have no space for it I cannot
fathom a 16 gig phone but of course
there other option 64 and 128 which will
be nice but I judge can't see why I just
even 60 Gigot exists so don't buy a 16
gig go for the 64 128 that's that's my
advice and what do you guys think you
agree disagree with my thoughts I'd love
to have a dialogue on it be nice to each
other in the comments any time there's
an Apple event there are always two
people that comment one that our Apple
fans and it'll sort of say anything
Apple does is great and the other are
the Android fans who will just say
everything Apple does is horrible try to
be in the middle look objectively at the
products not what you feel you have in
your pocket and let's have a discussion
on it so next time I am shadow Ranger
from TechnoBuffalo so you guys make
video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
