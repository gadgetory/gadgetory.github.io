to you by netflix welcome back to the
episode of rettinger shreds to show
where I read didn't even talk about
anything from the world of technology
and sometimes a little bit outside up
this week we're going to talk about
smart watches and if Apple should get to
that business of what my opinion on
smartwatches is hint ain't good this is
rector's rants it's gonna get started my
opinion of smartwatches they stink they
stuck don't do it stay far far away from
smartwatches at least as they stand
right now smartwatches and we've seen
them from Sony we've seen one from
pebble if you had a chance to take a
look at there are extensions of your
cell phone I can't really do anything on
their own they just give you
notifications and that is really just
about it and on top of that they drain
battery like crazy because you're
constantly connected via bluetooth so if
you're having battery life issues it
ain't worth it now having that being
said smartwatches they exist right now
aren't my cup of tea I can see why
people might like him though if you
don't want to pull your phone out or if
you keep a phone in a bag or backpack or
purse yeah I could see maybe you might
want to check in they go look I've got a
new email I should check that email now
the rumors are that Apple's looking get
into this world but I wouldn't assume
that apple would just make something
that's an extension of your phone at
least I would hope not Apple
long-rumored trying to get into a curved
glass display they wanted evidently to
put a curved display on the initial
iphone actually we saw those documents I
got relief during the Apple Samsung
lawsuit technology wasn't there yet now
allegedly the story goes Corning the
maker of Gorilla Glass today Apple we've
got curved glass technology why don't
you come to us instead of fighting its
way on a new iphone I suppose you're
gonna make its way to a watch now here's
where I think Apple might be able to
succeed Apple makes as much money on
itunes and app sales as most companies
make on all of their hardware so really
for Apple getting people into their
products is just herba Trojan horse to
get them to buy application if the
SmartWatch get people to buy apps it's
gonna be profitable for Apple certainly
they're not known to make products for a
loss so some ways I think it could be
kind of interesting camera
we haven't seen a camera built into a
watch I know it could be kind of weird
sort of going like this but I can see it
perhaps being a secondary display for
your iphone they're taking a picture
you've got it set up somewhere else I
want to take a selfie you could use your
phone to sort of make it do stuff for
you you want to make a phone call for
example perhaps would be a Bluetooth
speaker they're like Dick Tracy style
facetime would be another cool bike to
see a SmartWatch be useful sort of talk
to your wrist you know as you're walking
and supposed to holding your phone up I
could potentially be something
interesting I feel look at my wrist
right now raining Nike FuelBand sort of
a new rage of sore Fitness technology
Nikes has long worked with Apple they've
been in Apple products before so perhaps
having nike+ or FuelBand desk technology
and Apple apps does on their own might
work out and sort of give you that value
added and nothing else has done before
has also been rumors swirling that Apple
is in talks to buy pebble startup that
was crowdfunded which is just starting
to come to market in a few months they
already had the technology what kind of
features would you want a SmartWatch to
have that would make you want to buy it
throw me this video I sort of had a
struggle at think of like what could it
possibly have that I would need but I
will say this so I never saw the need
for a tablet before I user one now i
totally get it so maybe a SmartWatch it
be the same category it seems useless
until you actually have one then you
realize how did I live without this
thing let me step aside from the renting
