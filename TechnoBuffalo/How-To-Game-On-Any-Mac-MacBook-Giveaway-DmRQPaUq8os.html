the office have been playing
battlegrounds after-hours here and I've
got the latest gen MacBook Pro and I
can't play cuz you know Mac Canton game
the folks in Nvidia have an answer with
GeForce now I want to tell you about it
but I also want to give you a chance to
win a pretty awesome prize pack first
you could win a MacBook like this one
but the one you can win will be will be
Space Gray can also win $100 Blizzard
battled on a gift card and you can also
win a Logitech mouse and a headset combo
they're not together but like the combo
of like one of each so GeForce now is a
pretty badass way to use that Mac even
if it's owned to get your game on at max
settings at 1920 by 1200 so it's pretty
easy to do first it supports over a
hundred games it supports cloud saves
too which is awesome so if your late
night gaming session at home you can
pick up right where you were during like
your lunch break at office on your 2009
or newer MacBook the games are gonna
install unless in a minute so you're
pretty much click it like take like 10
deep breaths and the game is installed
and ready to go so you've got 7 server
farms set out all across the u.s. so
want to probably be close to use you
should get pretty close to minimal
latency it's in beta right now and only
for us users and it looks like you are
gaming on a high-end desktop it looks
really awesome it sounds like too good
to be true that you're busted on Mac can
now play pretty badass games but it's
true and again it's free so you should
absolutely give this a shot the
requirements are pretty broad to use
GeForce now you just need a Mac from the
2009 or newer and they say it'll work
with a 25 down internet connection but
50 is recommended and that's pretty much
it so I mentioned the beginning we're
giving stuff away if you need a new
computer that you could use GeForce now
or other stuff they've made it really
easy so first this giveaway is open to
anyone in the world Long's live on this
planet hit the link down below get the
