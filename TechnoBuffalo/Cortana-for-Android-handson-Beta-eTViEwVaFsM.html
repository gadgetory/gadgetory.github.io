Sangin from technobuffalo and today
we'll be taking a look at microsoft's
personal voice assistant Cortana running
on android the APK was unofficially
leaked last week and we've been playing
around with it over the weekend is it
any good well let's go ahead and take a
look setting up cortana was fairly easy
just answer a few questions enter your
name log into your Microsoft account
agree to its terms and that's it after
that you'll be up and running open the
app and crotona will be at your every
beck and call katanas interface is very
simple matching the same look you fine
on windows phone a lot of black
juxtaposed by neon colors it by no means
looks finished but there's enough here
to get a taste of what Microsoft's voice
assistant has to offer it looks strange
seeing Cortana on a different platform
but she surprisingly feels at home on
Android you can either use your voice by
tapping on the mic icon or type keywords
in the search field you'll be able to
ask her questions or pull data on
upcoming events locations nearby weather
and news grabbing search results is a
little slow right now though that could
be because crotona on android is
currently on beta crotona can also
access your notebook where she lists all
the information she has on you from
places you'd like to visit your home and
work address to your favorite contacts
however if you're uncomfortable with
Cortana having this information you'll
be able to opt out but you'll only be
able to get the full experience if you
go all in by giving crotona your
information the service will be able to
proactively provide information before
you even ask for it unfortunately one
big feature that's missing from the
android version is the ability to say
hey Cortana you also can't ask rotana to
send a text message which is a bit
disappointing crotona does a weber
provide location-based reminders for
example you can ask Cortana to remind
you to buy eggs when I'm at the store
and crotona will automatically pull up a
list of grocery stores nearby where I
might want to buy eggs and then remind
me when I get there the leaked version
of Cortana is pretty stable so far
though it definitely needs some polish
and because it's not deeply integrated
inside of Android it isn't better than
Google now Google service is renowned
for offering information before a user
asks for it and in Android M which is
launching for free this fall it'll be
even better with now on tap from our
brief experience with Cortana she
doesn't appear to be enough for Android
users this is an unofficial leak so we
can't really judge the app too much
based on this early apk hopefully we'll
get our hands on the official build from
Mike
soft soon since Windows 10 is just right
around a corner anyways thank you guys
so much for watching and if you guys
enjoyed this video give it a thumbs up
and we will see you guys in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
