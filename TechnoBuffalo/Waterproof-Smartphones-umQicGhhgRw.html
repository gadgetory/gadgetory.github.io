to you by full sail university what's up
everyone welcome back there pisode of
rettinger riffs i'm your host jon
rettinger is to show where i talk about
anything that's going on in my mind
world of technology and sometimes a
little bit outside of it up this week i
want to talk about waterproof or water
resistant phones and what they do to
those gorgeous gorgeous HD screens i'm
not a fan let's start riffin so for this
video I want to put Sony clear in my
crosshairs I haven't been that high on
Sony smartphones in the past the Xperia
z1 then the Xperia z2 which just
announced they were fine phones they
respect while I think Sony's UI is
pretty well done but the screens always
look dull and washed out like I put on
like 17 matte screen protectors on them
it just didn't look as bright as a
screen should Sony's got incredible
screen technology they got really true
deep blacks I got the Bravia Engine
these screens should have look
absolutely gorgeous but they didn't
because Sony decided to make them
waterproof ish water-resistant so
there's a whole learn it's on top of the
screen and then I saw the Xperia Z ultra
that ridiculously giant monstrosity had
probably one of the best looking screens
I had ever seen and I knew what so he
was capable of I wanted to know why make
it waterproof just let us have the
awesome gorgeous stunning beautiful
screen and the hope like normal people
we don't drop our phone in a puddle or
make a waterproof variant for folks that
are maybe more accident prone or those
that live a more active lifestyle or
live from where it rains and looking at
you Seattle can have a phone for them
but it just diminishes that gorgeous
screen technology also maybe this is
gonna make sound petty I hate to have to
just undo little flaps to charge savings
and open little flaps a plug in a
headset there's so many little water
resistant flappy things go into these
Tefo ins I'm finding it very annoying
galaxy s5 same thing it's got that water
resistant stuff you have to have a flap
to charge it which I will probably just
rip off I haven't yet seen in person
with a screen looks like Todd is in
Barcelona covering it for us so you got
a chance to do the hands-on with it but
i'm hoping the screen still ends up
looking gorgeous but so waterproof
crazed I hope goes away of the 3d foam
craze of about a year ago where it sort
of there in your face and forcing it on
you and then it kind of dies slowly
waterproof cases if in your waterproof
phone and you choose to have your screen
look less than awesome fine with maybe
I'm way off base here maybe I don't
leave to go anywhere i get my phone wet
can pretty much go from the office to
the house the back again and various
degrees of grocery shopping in between
so i don't much of a chance to get my
phone necessarily wet but if i'm wrong
tell me why I'm wrong but I just think
Sony screens are so gorgeous and they're
not living up to the potential to
getting a Ferrari never taking out a
fourth gear you know it's there you know
it's got the ability to be awesome but
you never used to its full potential I
got interrupted episode with a quick
little shout out to full sail university
obviously apps are huge right now
they're absolutely everywhere followed
those little ideas that make you stay I
should totally make that and code it but
then you realize I don't know how to do
that well full sail university is online

actually make that appt from concept to
post launch and even to all the market
goes into it even better you can do the
whole thing from the comfort of your own
home sit on your couch in your jammies
with full sail university is online
education program the full sails mobile
development program you can learn both
sides of app development for iOS and
Android creating your app with advanced

managing the business of your app once
it's ready to go but John probably ask
yourself I don't have a good enough
computer to do all those crazy lines of
code it's from 1997 and it's like a
celeron plus all expensive GUI say don't
worry about it because full sales

maybe don't make all your phones
