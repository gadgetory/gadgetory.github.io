TechnoBuffalo here every now and then I
like to sort of take a break from
technology and keep you guys some
updates is what's going on with my life
and going on with me personally I get a
lot of personal questions over email
primarily these type of videos I'm going
to be putting in my other channel inside
John's mind which I'll put a link in the
sidebar if you want to check that out
you'll get a very different sense of my
personality I suppose but what they give
you guys a bit of some updates what's
been going on with me and sort of some
things that have been well on my mind so
this isn't a technobuffalo video this is
just a standard video where I just want
to talk to you guys for a few minutes so
enough of that boring intro um some of
you guys might know I got engaged back
in August and I get probably a few
requests today asking one we're getting
married we are getting married august
first in southern california very
excited she and I have been dating for
about seven and a half years will be
dating eight years by Tommy get married
absolutely fantastic and I couldn't be
more excited to finally be getting
married so you know that's kind of fun I
don't think that I'm going to record it
for YouTube I think she'd probably kill
me it's probably not the best way to
start off a life by making everybody
sort of the background what but you know
sort of doing that at a wedding might
not be the best way to start although
we'll see maybe you guys will see some
sort of clips that I'll get up there
censored the big guys going on wedding
planning um I had no idea what it took
to plan wedding um no idea whatsoever I
just want to get married if it was up to
me I'd be fine getting married in her
parents backyard whatever dad at City
Hall but yeah she kind of want to do the
bigger wedding thing and went it's a
wedding mode very quickly and takes a
lot of planning to put a wedding
together I really had no idea so I'm
very impressed by sort of all the work
that she's been doing I've been trying
to help but I'm not a much use you know
I had no preference on flowers or table
cloth cover what kind of chair to use so
mostly I just kind of say okay turn
along the big things of life changing
decisions I'm also sort of been looking
to possibly buy a house and I figured
getting married Steve's in time to start
yeah what's available so if you guys
never look to buy a house before I can't
even begin to describe how stressful
that is you start thinking about
mortgage how much you're gonna have to
pay and it just start to become a little
bit overwhelming at times that's sort of
where I'm at right now I'm just
extremely overwhelmed with the wedding
in the house but there's a tax credit to
the federal government's giving out if
you're sort of in escrow by the end of
april sort of fast-tracked looking since
it is my first house to find something
available and it's been a bit hard to
handle in addition some of you guys may
or may not know you know I run
TechnoBuffalo as well as my primary job
but I'm getting my master's degree at
night I'm getting my MBA so they've got
school works for a couple Don top of all
that so it's been a lot of crap not
trying to complain just sort of keep you
got the sense of what my day-to-day
stuff is like good chance to know me a
little bit better I've had a unique
opportunity get to know you and I
thought was only fair to share a little
bit you know about myself as well
nothing scripted here just for all off
the cuff stuff in addition sort of one
of the cool things that's going on I am
a finalist for a shorty award it's an
award that's given out to creators of
short content I'm in the tech category
there's some fantastic competition the
great soldierknowsbest it's me Morpheus
a couple of others are all the finalists
voting ends tomorrow which is the fifth
of January at noon eastern time so I'd
appreciate your support if you guys want
if you like my videos that I've been
doing if you have a twitter account i'll
put a link in the sidebar for where you
go to vote super easy just sort of tweet
out I vote for you know at job for
lakers and you'll see it only but I I
appreciate your support if you guys have
the time and if you feel so inclined um
yeah no pressure so what's what else
been going on a thing well other than I
guess the wedding house and sort of
trying to run a company that's been fun
i'm sort of finding time to enjoy life
and get out there i'm at Southern
California here the weather has been
beautiful I did wait I just booked a
honeymoon we are going on a 10-day
Mediterranean cruise we're going to go
to board and Rome and we go to a few
places in Greece we go to even a place
in Turkey and
Grubnic and then we end in Venice we're
going to spend a few extra days in row
at the beginning and few extra days in
Venice at the end I've never been on a
cruise you never been on a cruise I have
no idea really what to expect on a
cruise but it seemed like good value and
you know I think we're going to get
chance to see a lot of a lot of Europe
so I'm excited so any advice for me as
far as going on a cruise I really have
no idea what to expect I got us a
veranda room of course obviously know we
can do so hopefully that will be nice I
think we can get like 24-hour room
service so that should be that should be
fun I think I just want to sort of make
a fun video talk to you guys and for the
most part these videos will be on the
other YouTube channel inside John's mind
you can kind of go ahead and check those
out I'm more than just a stodgy tech
reviewer i'm also a stodgy vlogger
yester to get a sense of the other side
of my personality so anyway check it out
if you want to i'm jon rettinger and
i'll see you in the next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
