from TechnoBuffalo here with a full
review for you of the Samsung built
Infuse 4G for AT&amp;amp;T Wireless let's go
ahead and see if this guy deserves a
giant place in your pocket alright so
before we get to the review let me
remind you about the specs of this guy
and it is packing quite a punch first
and foremost is its giant 4.5 inch and
that's 4.5 not 4.3 Super AMOLED plus
display the resolution of 480 by 800
it's being powered by a new generation
of second generation if you will 1.2
gigahertz hummingbird processor it is a
4G phone and that's 18 T's HSPA+ variety
this is the first cat 14 device which
can get you a maximum speed of 21
megabits per second down
it's got HSUPA support that's cat 6 oh
you should get pretty fast uploads it on
the back is rocking an 8 megapixel
autofocus camera with LED flash and
shoot video at 720p that's not the only
camera the front is going to give you a
1.3 megapixel shooter it's got an FM
radio and this big guy is rocking a 1750
milliamp hour battery
it's got Android 2.2 but TouchWiz below
the hood alright so now let's get into
the review doesn't matter what the specs
are it doesn't matter how big or little
the phone is it's not gonna make good
phone calls it's not going to be much
used to you so when I review phones I do
a 20 call test throughout my area of
Southern California now these results
may vary obviously depending on your
service area but they are representative
at least of the Southern California
location call quality was a little bit
on the tinny side about a quarter of the
time when I was making phone calls
people were able to tell that I was on a
cell phone they said it was okay and
they could hear me fine but it didn't
sound as crystal clear as other phones
have and that only happened about a
quarter of the time during that 20 call
test I had no dropped calls that's made
it very strong and 10 action I was able
to pull in pretty solid HSPA+ support
you can see right there wherever I was
and generally other HSPA+ phones I've
had be able to get maybe three or four
bars sometimes two this one was able to
pull in a very strong signal which also
is going to lead you to believe that if
you're
in a fringe 3G area or if you don't get
the best service in your home you might
be able to pull it with one or two bars
least to make phone calls if you're in
not the best service area so nice
antenna a speakerphone is actually
pretty decent I'll give you guys a quick
demonstration your speakerphone is
really important to me I figure it might
be important to you guys as well so I'll
just do a quick six one one call and
then going to cover this up because
people's phone numbers like to pop up
there we go we'll go six one four that's
not gonna work but at least you'll hear
some all right speakerphone was really
loud quite nicely comes out through
those two little speaker grilles down
there so if you are a speakerphone user
if you want to use this for conference
calls or even while driving which I
don't recommend this is going to give
you a nice nice sound so now let's talk
about the hardware when you look at this
thing it's a big phone it's a big phone
because of the screen certainly not
because of its girth which is always a
funny word
it's got a four point five inch screen
you think that's gonna be giant but
really it comes out to being a very nice
size and feels good in the hand we'll
talk about that in just a minute the
screen here though is absolutely
beautiful Samsung's new Super AMOLED
plus display addresses all the concerns
that I had the AMOLED screens and Super
AMOLED namely you got a bit of greyish
blue tint but keeps all the awesome
things you're gonna get great visibility
in direct sunlight you're gonna get rich
colors you're getting a dark blacks on
text is gonna look awesome but I should
probably just show you what that looks
like instead of talking about it so I'll
go to a screen here it's go ahead and
jump in and show some of the wallpaper
so you can see what images look like
we'll go ahead and check out the
wallpaper gallery you see I've got a
launcher pro on here one of my favorites
text and images here just look
absolutely beautiful and really pop if
you're looking for a phone to show
pictures to your friends or for whoever
this is going to be a fantastic device
for you and you're getting almost tablet
size in a phone four point five inches
is really huge so maybe not tablet size
you're getting a really big phone with a
great screen let me show you what text
looks like on here and what
about the browser in a minute here we
are in TechnoBuffalo text is very very
crisp you see you don't have that sort
of color tint in the back especially on
a white background so this is one of the
few phones that so you actually could
read an e-book on without killing your
eyes because it's so much bigger so the
screen is pretty high on the awesome
scale the next thing it's gonna be
important is speed so you're not gonna
set the world on fire with your stock
rom quadrant scores I love to benchmark
things I generally got a score of around
1100 it is only a single core processor
the next day only it's a 1.2 gigahertz
process in here and it's very very very
fast I will say this thing just felt
really really zippy while I was using it
applications loaded really fast I had no
problem watching games I no problem
multitasking this is a very very very
quick phone I didn't have any issue or
miss it extra core this is gonna be a
very fast device for you throughout the
duration of your two-year contract
that's the way you choose to go but
that's not the only way that speed is
going to matter
this is also an HS that's actively HSDPA
the first cat 14 which is really capable
of supposedly super fast speed so I
mentioned that I'm kind of a
benchmarking junkie so let me go ahead
and show you how fast this is I'm gonna
go ahead and launch speed test and go
ahead and restart the test and I've got
a pretty nice HSPA+ signal here and
let's see how fast we're gonna be if we
can come anywhere close to their Max 21
megabits per second now AT&amp;amp;T hasn't been
that forthcoming about where their HSPA+
4G network is so speeds are definitely
going to vary again it's only
representative of where I am in Southern
California so 2.99 is about what I've
been getting in the low three areas and
generally I've been getting a little bit
higher than one megabit per second up so
you are getting kind of fast speeds but
certainly not at least where I am again
as fast as you would hope so you can go
ahead and let's check out some results
you can see some previous speeds here so
generally in the
what I've been getting my upload speeds
not only tended to vary a lot this is
going to be just a generally quick
device let's go ahead and load a webpage
here so here we on TechnoBuffalo I
notice that I've got flash turned off
even with flash content turned on
pinch-to-zoom and ever you wanted to do
really just worked very quickly overall
the device just felt fast so let's go
ahead and just go we'll do a refresh
we're not connected here over Wi-Fi at
all this is straight I guess you could
call it 4G service or HSPA+ so there it
goes content is loaded you can read it
images are now showing up you can see
where Flash content is I've got it set
to ask me essentially if I want to use
any plugins so there we are
this is only Android 2.2 and I say only
because a bit disappointing I certainly
would have liked to have had Froyo but
it doesn't really make that giant of a
difference at least to me the phone just
worked very well and Samsung's own
widgets and the touch was attempted to
make up a little bit for the stuff that
was missing in Gingerbread I like their
default application manager you'll
notice that I have launched a pro on
there I'm not the biggest fan of the
look of touch was the weighting capsule
weights tap the screen all the weight
encapsulate icons like this some would
say kind of Apple like I think Apple
would certainly say that so using
third-party launchers as a way to
eliminate them one of the great things
about Android you can customize the heck
out of the device so I didn't mind that
at Froyo that much I would have liked
that if you know just I have the latest
build of gingerbread and but supposedly
that will be coming so with a phone this
big and a phone this thin my first
question was how is battery life going
to be in this 1750 milliamp hour battery
it's a big battery actually was able to
get me through a full day really easily
and that's with checking to accounts
connected to exchange servers a lot of
phone calls huge amount of web browsing
this thing really got through a full day
of heavy use with the ballot almost 40%
of the battery
so you could technically probably get
through two days if you used it
judiciously I was really really
impressed especially powering a phone
this big with a screen this massive
really kudos at the Samsung for giving
it the battery life that it deserved
camera quality was fine they generally
say in phone reviews you're not going to
replace your DSLR but if you want to
snap a few pictures of your buddies at
the club you know this will be fine
so if I was an 18 T customer which I had
to happen to be and I was looking for a
phone I could definitely tell you that
this would be the phone that I would get
I can't recommend this phone enough
certainly would have been great if it
had dual cores it would have been
awesome if it had gingerbread but those
are really minor quibbles of what's in
very very amazing phone if you are an
Android user or even if you're not an
Android user you just heard about
Android and you want to get into the
smartphone world this is going to be a
wonderful way to go in and try it
whether you're a hardcore hacker and you
want to tweak the ROM inside those
applications whether or not you're a
novice user just want a film it's going
to work
this one is going to work very very very
nicely so I know a lot of people have
been making some fuss about how Samsung
does their final management I didn't
have any slowdown issues when I juicing
the phone and I wouldn't expect that you
would have that much either that is
something to keep in mind sort of these
short non dirty definition is the way
Samsung does their file storage you
could have potentially at least have a
bit of slowdown but I didn't experience
that and I haven't experienced that with
any of my Samsung devices that have
tested this phone gets definitely a two
thumbs up
those are my thumbs this is one that
again I would really really recommend to
anyone out there looking for smart phone
