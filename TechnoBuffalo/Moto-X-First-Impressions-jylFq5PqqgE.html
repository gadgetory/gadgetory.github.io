technobuffalo here I've been using the
Moto X for about two and half days my
daily driver not enough time for me to
confidently do a full review but plenty
of time to do a hands-on and first
impressions let's get started so the
Moto X has been kind of a polarizing
phone since it was announced last week
we've got this guy all decked up and
kind of boring black on black a lot of
you said the comments John why would you
order a straight black phone answer is I
didn't order this one this is the unit
that Motorola was kind enough to give us
a we conduct our review if I had ordered
probably would have blue on the back and
maybe crazy gold accents on the side I
don't know but that is one of the
positive things about the phone let's
start there at the customization over
2,000 options for your phone just pretty
neat usually limited to a few colors
white black sometimes blue and red might
come out a few months down the road but
not that many optional the way customize
your phone really was via cases so i
love what Motorola stun be able to make
your phone absolutely yours and that's a
really innovative thing that they've
done and I really enjoy it I'm hope that
people take advantage of they use it and
they get a phone that suits their
personal needs the next thing I like
about this phone is the build quality it
is absolutely outstandingly build phone
it's got plenty of half to feel
significant and it feels like you are
using a premium device I liken it to
what the iphone 5 feels like what the
nexus 4 feels like you know that you're
using a premium device and I really felt
that here with the Moto X a lot of
people are making a big fuss about the
specs and a lot of ways I get that it's
not a quad-core phone for signing a
two-year contract you want a phone
that's going to last you for you know
presumably the next 48 or so months so i
can understand those concerns i will say
though in my test this thing has
performed as well as any quad-core
device that I've used I've thrown some
really heavy gaming at it I'm not going
to reveal my benchmark score yet i'm
gonna do a few more for i do the full
review but it's about performed pretty
much everything and performed on par
with any other quad-core phone i've
tested and certainly outperforms any
other dual-core phone that I've used out
there now if you can get past that spec
war also some other cool things that it
does so it looks on the surface like
stock Android it's got some really neat
features my favorite thus far is the
google now feature and I've always loved
Google now since its first announced I
use it
the time this one I'd have to talk to it
so check this out ok Google now what's
the weather in irvine california phone
wakes itself hook it's 24 degrees in
partly cloudy and irvine pretty freakin
nia that ever happen T really touched
the phone I could call my wife I could
send a text message I could do anything
that I want which is especially handy
while driving cuz you should not be
looking at the phone so that's kind of a
really cool feature that they've done
here with it another cool features on
the software side it's something called
moto connected to send to receive text
messages from your computer I love that
idea that with ichat when i used an
iphone and i like that to do that again
with another android device so one of
the other big knocks on this thing is a
price it is a hundred and ninety-nine
dollars that is expensive for it's
essentially a mid-range device but
here's kind of the rub people want
phones that are made in America you have
to pay more for devices that are made in
America there are Union cost labor is
more expensive so that's really the
reason that this thing comes in at 199
the question though is going to be in
the hands of consumer do you want to pay
that price for an american-made product
you have a choice if you want to pay
that price for making me a product
you've got an option to customize it get
what appears to be a pretty sweet phone
if you don't want to pay that price you
could pay something lower depending
where you go for an HTC One or galaxy s4
and the option in the choice is totally
yours that's one thing that I like
consumer as of a choice no one's forcing
you you don't handcuff on you and making
you buy a moto x 42 years you have the
option and i love that there is an
opportunity now to buy American at least
American assembles device which never
existed really before so you know I give
my hats off to Motorola for that I think
it's kind of a cool thing that they've
done so another issue 720p screen I am
listen I'm a screen horror I'm going to
knit it I'm more of a screen whore than
i care about specs 720p screen here
actually does look pretty good now i can
tell by whole two side-by-side but it's
not 1080p but i didn't take this home
i'm looking only at this screen it looks
really good i like it it to me dropping
to a TV you go into your store you see
two TV side by side and one clue looks
better than the other but if you buy
that less expensive maybe less quality
one you hang it up on your wall it's
gonna look great too got nothing to
compare it to side by side same thing
here the 720p screen looks really good
nothing was pixelated nothing looked
washed out the blackout was really dark
that was a really white everything just
looked really good overall about the
phone to the screen let's have an issue
for me than I thought it was going to be
but one thing that I really don't like
them on-screen buttons I don't mind how
they work they perform well but they 4.7
inch screen Mary taking up so much
precious space I wish I could use all of
that space on the phone to do whatever I
want to do I would have loved to have
capacitive buttons here on the bottom
but that is not the case I'm design
standpoint really thin bezels I'd really
like that as well and then enough bezels
when I want to hold in portrait mode and
top or bottom my fingers aren't going to
touch anything but still really thin I
haven't done thorough test yet of the
camera I haven't done full battery life
test yet but I will say it's been pretty
a solid performer usually I have about
forty percent in today with most phones
act tested this has been right on par
with that at least thus far I'll use it
for a few more days then I'll do a full
review anything else do you guys want to
