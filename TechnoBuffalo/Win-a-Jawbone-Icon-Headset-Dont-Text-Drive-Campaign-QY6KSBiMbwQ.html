technobuffalo here I've got a very
serious topic to discuss with you today
so why don't you come a bit closer it
too close that's just about right
texting while driving and driving with a
cell phone up to your ear with a headset
or bluetooth or a wired headset is
really a big problem I can't tell you
how many times I've been driving and
I've seen kids adults old people texting
while driving drinking while driving and
both soda and alcohol putting on their
makeup while driving shaving while
driving the only thing you should be
doing while driving is driving because
you're not only endangering yourself
you're also endangering those around you
this is a very serious topic that's kind
of friend that was at a car accident due
to driver neglect something that sort of
hit me a little bit and can definitely
hit you guys as well so on that note and
to sort of perk things up a bit I have
teamed up with AT&amp;amp;T Wireless to do a
giveaway to promote don't texting while
driving so what we're giving away is
actually pretty cool I've got a jawbone
icon headset to give away because this
is what you should be wearing when
you're talking on the phone in a car
however we've got a pretty big audience
here we're 80 thousand plus and growing
so I didn't think that one headset was
going to be enough to give away so I
thought maybe two would be enough to
give away but you know I figured you got
anything new to grow it a little bit
more and there are a lot of people I'd
like to give stuff to so how about three
jaw bone icon headsets that still wasn't
enough folks at AT&amp;amp;T agreed and they
sent for jawbone icon headsets those are
the brand-new Jawbone's probably the
top-of-the-line bluetooth headset on the
market with really world-renowned
ambient noise reduction comfort really
probably the best method on the market
but AT&amp;amp;T and I both agreed that for was
enough to give a way to give back to the
audience so we actually have five this
is a fifth one I can show you
here if I can pick them up five jawbone
icon the silver bluetooth headset this
is the thinker a ditch in case you're
wondering to give away to help promote
safe driving and dump texting while
