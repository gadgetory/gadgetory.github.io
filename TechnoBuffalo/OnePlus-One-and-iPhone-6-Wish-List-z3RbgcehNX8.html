to you by gamefly what's up everyone
welcome at the episode of asta buffalo
this is one of my favorite shows because
I get to talk about absolutely anything
and I get an answer questions whatever
is going on in your mind holes up this
week it's all about the oneplus iphone 6
and I answer a few personal questions
this is asked the Buffalo start asking
the Buffalo the first question comes
from sodas name I can't say that
laughing Rogan your Seth asks hi John hi
Rogan yourself do you think that the
oneplus one will be the catalyst at
promised a big boys to release high in
flagships with mid-range prices no no I
do not unfortunately think that I think
it's a great idea you're probably going
to sell a ton of them they probably have
razor thin margins but it is not going
to change a paradigm at all Samsung HTC
Apple will all continue to sell premium
foam to premium prices they'll sell
mid-range films with mid-range prices
and low-end phones with low-end prices
it's really just business so I would not
expect that paradigm to change anytime
soon as much as we all would want it to
hope that helped ain't your question
next question comes from Twitter gabster
360 asks at jump for lakers with your
hopes for the iphone 6 my big hope
something I say every year like a broken
record is redesigned iOS don't make
icons flatter redesign no freaking OS
let me see information quickly something
like widgets were live tiles I don't
have to sort of open up an application
to see it I need more than just that
little badge thanks I'm tapping in that
app I know there's a pulldown shade but
doesn't really offer that much
information at least for my case on the
hardware side I have longed for a bigger
screen iphone 4 inches just doesn't cut
it yes I know that's what she said 4.7
sounds awesome but I am hoping for a 5.5
inch I thought when I love big phones
and I would love to have an iphone
phablet just taking up way more space it
should in my pocket so my pants look
weird I got to explain that that's not
me it's actually just a rectangular
shaped phone that would make me super
happy obviously it'll have more power
probably more RAM
battle itself goes without saying hoping
for a new design we've seen leaks that
show it's going to be thinner and sort
of have the back band similar what we
see now on HTC One and made apple does
an awesome double use with your design
so I just let Apple be Apple to design
and give me a bigger screen and redone
iOS 8 i'll be pretty happy but maybe at
NFC in there because I really like that
wireless charging I would really like
wireless charging that's my wish list
iphone 6 what is your wish list for the
iphone 6 so that's the Buffalo is kind
of a fun show you can ask me anything
you want from tech or outside attack it
sometimes I'll answer personal questions
and I've got a couple personal ones
right here first question coming from
Josh hey John hi Josh when you aren't at
the TV headquarters what do you do for
fun go to sporting events with your
family and you hang out and watch some
TV so that would have to be a
before-and-after question I've got a
seven and a half month old son so I
don't go much of anywhere usually when i
leave work I try and get in early so I
can leave between five and five-thirty
so I can spend some time with them
usually put them in for a bath around 6
30 or seven so I don't get to see him
that often and then can't really go
anywhere because the baby sleeping
upstairs so usually I'll just sit on the
couch and watch TV I used to try and go
the gym and that kind of stuff I don't
leave much anymore so I wouldn't got an
elliptical machine so I can feel like
I'm least doing something on the
weekends and my wife and I love to go
see movies but we can't we do that
anymore because you know we can't bring
a baby to the movie so I wouldn't those
good nods not as exciting but before the
baby I used to love to go to Angel games
Laker games love to go to sporting
events I saw movies all the time I was
way more active than I am now and just
like to go hang out friends and
fortunate having a chance to do much of
that okay I don't answer question I'll
take a quick break exhale for a minute

goto gamefly.com slash tech debuff loads
pretty sweet again it's gamefly.com
slash TechnoBuffalo back to the video i
think of my son let's answer the last
question comes from sashan banal who
asked hey John how much of an impact you
think you'll love of Technology will
affect your son and Nathan's life you
think you'll have the same passion for
technology as you do so totally funny
story my mom makes a joke that I can't
tell Nathan what I do for a living until
he's like 12 like you know my house
we've got xbox and Playstations and
psp's and all kinds of other fun stuff
laying around just wanted to be
distracted biotechnology an apartment
ways kind of thinks he's right let him
grow up like I grew up go outside and
play don't you know sit at home on a
tablet but I recognize that's totally
ideological of me it's not going to
happen so I can do some to technology
gradually so maybe show him with
technology can do and let him decide if
it's a passion or not I don't want to
force anything on him in fact I'm one of
those parents it's like he's not gonna
inherit the family business got a sort
of earn his own keep whatever it is he
wants to do I don't want to totally sink
get you can screw around in school and
I'll always have a job because dad owns
a company not the case for sure not the
case so you have to make his own way in
the world if he finds away technology
then great if not then hope whatever he
does he can support himself and a family
and be happy doing it next question
comes from six moody doors to ask toes
TechnoBuffalo story but ever answered
number one question have you come up
with the name solicits just I was
talking the story I've told in the past
I went to school in upstate New York
University of Rochester brighten your
Buffalo technobuffalo boom the real
answer is that it was an available URL I
looking for something with techno in it
and something that was easy to spell and
something to easily identify before i
started doing all this stuff i was a
marketing guy still sort of have a
marketing brand i want something that
was identifiable its strong easiest
spell that can market the buffalo which
is something that sort of popped in my
head in a particular reason for it one
way or another and i thought i could
spawn spin off of their site so it gets
two reviews at buffalo name and make it
very iconic certified technobuffalo fast
we first launched the site we did a
contest to name the buffalo if you know
what we named the buffalo if you
remember what the buffalos name was
