to you by goto meeting welcome back to
another episode of ask the buffalo i'm
jon rettinger this is the show where you
can ask any question that you have from
the world of consumer electronics this
week we're going to talk about the crazy
futuristic google glass we're going to
talk about when the best time of year to
get a new cell phone is and i'm going to
answer some personal questions about my
life and what brought me to being a
consumer electronics journalist this is
asked to Buffalo let's get started so
our first question comes to us from
Esteban Hernandez who wants to talk
about google glass he asks hey John what
do you think about Google's glass
project do you think will be as good as
a video suggests so we first saw a
google glass last week it's been rumored
for quite a while that Google is going
to take advantage of augmented reality
technology essentially try and put it on
a little tan a futuristic screen you get
aware in front of your I think
Terminator but without trying to kill
you we haven't seen augmented reality
sort of fulfill its promise of being a
useful everyday tool but Google glass is
really trying to take that to next step
so what are the uses for going to be and
that's really going to be the
termination of success without the
developers can find awesome uses for it
so certainly you could you know look at
a restaurant and see Yelp reviews right
there you know that's one way you can do
it you could wear it while you're
driving and see directions actually on
the road the potential for it is
incredible there's also potential to
look super silly well we're in this
thing over your eye and talking about
John Connor so I think it's going to be
a success I think it's going to be a
paradigm-shifting a device about how we
use information so yes I'm excited I
think it's going to be awesome and I
can't wait to look like a cyborg alright
so our next question gets away from tech
for a minute and talks a little bit
about my personal life in my history
that got me to where I am right now ben
de Angelo asked John what did your
in-law sink when you told them you're
going to start making videos for a
living I've been pretty candid about my
life and I've been very open about what
brought me tier if you guys don't know I
was working in software development I
was running a marketing department back
in 2009
making videos as a hobby I've always
loved technology consumer electronics
has been my passion and something I
realized that there might be a way to
use what I love and do it for a job I
hated what I was doing it got to the
point where I almost hoped I got in a
small car accident every day so I didn't
have to go in nothing serious just like
maybe I'd hit a stop sign where no one
would get hurt but I had an excuse to
call in and not have to show up so I'll
never forget when I had to sit down with
what was going to be my future in-laws
my wife and I weren't married yet we
were just talking about getting engaged
and tell them that I was going to leave
my job it's 2009 so super bad economy to
make videos for a living you have to
think about what people thought about
YouTube then has really changed all that
much people thought YouTube was a place
for posting videos that people getting
kicked in the business and cats playing
piano I was pretty much what people
thought about YouTube so she was and my
father-in-law worth I mean just aghast
about it on that sort of shown the
adaptation the change in perception of
new media and how YouTube has become a
viable business tool just over the past
three years and created a whole new
class of career ah they were very
supportive they were shocked they
probably didn't tell many friends what I
did for a living for for a few years but
you know just kind of goes to show you
that jobs change careers change and if
you find something that you love pursue
it because you never know if you could
find a way to make it a career I wake up
every day with a huge smile on my face
getting to talk about electronics for a
living this is my passion is what I love
and I think the audience for giving me a
chance I make my mother-in-law for not
killing me all right so our next
question comes from here who wants to
ask John when's the best time of the
year to get a new cell phone seems like
cell phones come out every time you
blank soon cell phone 8 comes out few
months later you get cell phone a tu
cell phone a 2 HD cell phone a 2 HD max
with 2 x's it's hard to pick the best
time of year to get a new phone you
don't have to get a new phone the day
your two-year contract and you can wait
traditionally it's been hard to predict
when the best time of year is however if
you have to pin one month or a 30 or 60
day period it would definitely be around
the holidays November to December is
definitely the best time to get new
phones usually we see updates to Apple
products of that at that point androids
flagships have usually just come out
whether their Nexus devices seeing new
operating systems get teased whether
it's an update to Android or Windows
Phone perhaps Windows Phone 8 will be
out that's when the big rush to buy is
November December is definitely the best
time to wait to get a phone which might
not be the answer you want to hear now
that we're in April and you're looking
you know nine ish months away to get a
new phone but it's definitely going to
be the best time for you to pick one up
so technobuffalo whea staff all over not
only the country but the world we got
junk watch who's filming this in Canada
but he's here right now we have folks in
Europe and in South Korea sean is
literally in the middle of nowhere
Missouri it's hard to keep track of
everybody and see where people are at

last question goes away from technology
and talks a little bit about me and what
got me to where we're at right now and
where I am this is from twitter user de
precios mode who asks hi John not really
tech but what do you like when you're
not working on TB generally i'm working
on TV all the time if i'm not in the
office i'm thinking about TB i got
buffalo on
the mind but when I'm not thinking about
gadgets generally I like to do is I like
to watch a lot of sports you can
probably guess that by the for lakers
part of my youtube name I'm big into the
Lakers angels Southern California guy
mostly i wish i could get into hockey I
respect the athletes but I'm just not
interested in it I feel the same way
about soccer football depending on where
you are I think it's one of those sports
you have to be good or grow up with I
played as a kid but I just can't watch
it that much anymore I like to some sort
of boring I like to sit at home with my
wife and my puppy and just watch TV I
like to go ahead and here we can I like
to talk to Ralph on occasion and see
what Ralph has going on and what he's
doing and how he's feeling on an
emotional level and see if he needs
counseling I like to inquire about
Ralph's lucky plant and find out why
that plant is so lucky to Ralph I like
to watch TV when i get time i like to
try and go stuff shut at me when i get
time i like to go to the gym try and run
a little bit keep my heart rate up and
going try and pump some weights no big
deal yeah i'm not the biggest guy in the
world but like to try and stay as much
in shape as I can mostly that's about I
like to read when i get a moment but I'm
generally pretty boring and i usually
have tech on the mine hopefully that
helped answer your questions this has
been another episode of ask the Buffalo
