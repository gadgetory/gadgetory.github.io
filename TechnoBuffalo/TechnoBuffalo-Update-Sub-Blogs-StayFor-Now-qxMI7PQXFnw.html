technobuffalo here the past few days
many of you have gotten a chance to
check out the new TechnoBuffalo two
point oh so you've seen it goes live
many times we've been testing it quite
thoroughly over the weekend when I
announced aside a few weeks ago I tried
to give people enough heads up to let
you know that the sub logs were going
away however since we've been testing
there's been an outcry from the audience
to keep the sub blogs for just a few
more days so people can migrate their
content over to another free web hosting
option and an effort to best serve the
audience despite high excitement and
exuberance to show you guys the new site
we're working on it so hard and I really
just want to share with you I will not
do it at the judgment of my audience
despite my own excitement so we are
going to keep these sub blogs which
unfortunately means the current sites
didn't get a stay of execution oh we are
leaving at least I'm leaving for CES
tomorrow which is monday or depending
what day you're watching this the third
so we will hold off on be launching
until I get back from CES so probably
you know day or so later the show runs
just about a week so if those you that
have been asking for a few more days to
migrate your sub blog content over you
now have that we really do try to listen
to our audience even when it's at all my
own detriment so I really want to show
you guys the site but rest assured we
will be pushing the site live when i get
back from CES so please if you haven't
migrated yourself blog over please let
this serve as a final warning definitely
do so when i come back we're gonna have
a ton of awesome giveaways you can see
some of the things that I'm thinking
about giving away right here we got some
iphone 4s and a ton of other really cool
stuff to give away for you guys i'm
really excited about CES and I just
wanted to sort of share my thoughts and
sir let you guys know what was going on
so the sub blogs are going to stay and
we also have a few more fun surprises in
