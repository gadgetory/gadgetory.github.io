from TechnoBuffalo here at the full
review of the HTC EVO 4G LTE for Sprint
let's go ahead and see if this is a
legitimate successor to Sprint's crown
jewel let's go and get started alright
so before I jump into specs and talk
about all the stuff this phone can do
let's talk about the most important
thing when it comes to a device like
this call quality it's gonna depend on
where you are what part of the country
you're in and all that kind of business
but where we are in Southern California
and where this phone was tested also in
Louisiana call quattro is absolutely
outstanding during her xx called tests
we had no drop call and was absolutely
crystal-clear and we're excited to take
a look at Sprint's HD voice coming
sometime towards the end of 2012 so
worry not those who are concerned about
call quality it also found the antenna
to be pretty strong compared to other
sprint device though and run through the
specs that I promised this guy's packed
to the gills with the latest super phone
goodness so first availability it was
supposed to be May 18th but then some
Apple injunctions with HTC have pushed
that date back so available some time
it'll be $199 the two-year contract or
549 if you just want to go out and
purchase it it is running Android 4.0
Ice Cream Sandwich with HTC Sense 4.0 on
top of it I'm going to mention
standpoint we are looking at five point
three inches by two point seven inches
by a nice and thin 0.35 inches and it's
going to weigh up 4.7 ounces the screen
that's about all the risks of this phone
is just scream
that's a 4.7 inch always measured
diagonally HD Super LCD screen with
Gorilla Glass in the screen here is
absolutely beautiful as you come to
expect from modern HTC devices if you've
seen or had a chance to play with any
devices in HTC's One series I've got
AT&amp;amp;T s and One X here the screen looks
almost identical absolutely gorgeous no
sort of blue hue that we've seen on some
em OLED devices the screen is probably
one of the best in the business it's
being powered by pretty beefy
non-removable 2000 milliamp hour battery
that sprint claims gonna be good for
about 7.5 hours of talktime and that's a
little bigger battery than what we've
seen anyone excellent as well powering
this behemoth is a 1.5 gigahertz
dual-core Snapdragon s4 which is a very
very capable processor and it's got a
gig of ram here augmenting it it's got
16 gigs of internal storage and HTC has
given us microSD expansion so you can
add another 32 gigs to this guy from a
camera standpoint 8 megapixel shooter
right there on the back that can shoot
1080p video and a 1.3 megapixel shooter
that can shoot 720p video this guy has
compatibility for Sprint's LTE network
but we don't have LTE yet so at some
point I'll have support for actually
able to use Sprint's LTE network and one
of the other cool things bad it will
talk about is the kickstand back from
the original Evo alright so we've run
through all the specs let's go ahead and
talk about the phone let's start with a
design and that just mentioned the
kickstand which surprisingly I found
very useful brought back from the
original Evo it is here and all of its
kickstand glory made of aluminum it is
going to make sure your phone can stand
up unlike the original Evo which could
only use the kickstand in one direction
which meant you couldn't use it while
you were charging this guy came using
multiple ways so use it like that go
ahead and turn it the other way and as
HTC is very keen to tell me you can
actually use it like this as well and it
works very well ok that looks like in
all those directions the kickstand
always seemed a bit gimmicky but the
more I use the phone that works out
myself actually using the kickstand so
give it a shot something that's very
handy so very different looking than the
HTC One X and I'd presume that it needed
to be very different looking than the
HTC One X so it wouldn't be any deal
with AT&amp;amp;T exclusivity and certainly
keeping a line with the red hues of the
Evo so some differences you know you can
see them right there we've got sort of
soft touch feel on the bottom that red
ribbon where the kickstand is and you've
got a fingerprint sort of magnet e
plastic back right here I got that red
ring around the camera the design though
felt very nice to me actually I wasn't
the biggest fan of this plastic top but
it definitely grimy the phone feels
really
the hands actually you can feel where
that kick stands out having to turn it
around so you can pop it out without
having to take the hassle to twist your
phone around something kind of nice
right there another nice design kid HTC
has added a physical camera button which
is really nice especially you got a
camera like this which can take pictures
very fast with that you know supposedly
zero shutter lag if you guys want more
information on the camera or more
detailed review definitely get the link
down below we've got a full written
review of the HTC One X you could see
image and some samples of what this
camera can do but suffice it to say
concede take pictures of Mario very very
quick I came away very impressed with
the camera which is a carryover from the
HTC One X line alright so let's talk
about software is running Sense 4.0
lover hate it this phone is very sensed
out to the gills one of the big
highlights here or lowlights opinion he
asked is multitasking there's been a lot
of controversy about how Sprint is
handling multitasking whether or not
they're killing apps prematurely but how
they skinned the multitasking view from
Ice Cream Sandwich I've created its own
bit of stir you can only see one app at
a time a you can close it by just wiping
off the screen but I much prefer to full
list going down or I couldn't see
multiple applications now I can see what
others are I can close it from the side
I would like to see more than one in the
center at the time sort of keeping true
with that full Sense UI look and feel
you've got the widgets which are
accepted accessible by a long press you
can see what all those widgets are here
and they're vetted quite a bit go ahead
and view different widgets that are
available when you find one that you
like you can drag it right to the home
screen of your choice by long-pressing
and bringing it right to that screen and
that's where it's going to show up
seeing I've got no music available this
phone also has support for Beats Audio
so you can get a little better audio
fidelity depending on what headphones
you use and you no longer have to use
Beats headphones in order to get that
little better sound and I'm no sound guy
but nothing there was a difference with
the Beats Audio turned on so other
difference is here you've got through
the HTC looking application tray and if
you look at settings as well you can
know some other differences here HTC has
something called a personalized which
we've seen with previous versions of
sense you've got different scenes and
skins which let you customize the look
to your phone not really sure the
different tuned scenes and skins are but
if you want to go through and sort of
customize it for work or for friends or
whatever you want to do those are gonna
be options to do it it extends all the
way down to the pulldown menus as far as
what other things you're looking at so
you can see what Ralph is up to HTC
media link if you've got a media link
connected it is always going to be their
media link is away this sort of airplay
content from HTC device to your
television you want to access that you
take three fingers and ya push it right
up and it's gonna try and connect to
media link now we're back in the home
side home screen
it works well if you have a media link
device but that you cannot get rid of
that median connection so it's always
going to be there taking up space in
your pulldown menu this phone not
surprisingly is very very fast a
powerful processor here the Snapdragon
s4 it really handles everything with
aplomb whether it's those animations or
gaming we played a lot of Temple Run on
this guy I games look absolutely
beautiful on here as you'd expect for a
modern super phone what's holding this
phone back though is Sprint's Network
there EVDO 3G network is absolutely
abysmal and by AB is let me show you
what some adults wear it's obviously
going to vary depending on where you are
but on some tests we got point oh one
megabits down a blistering fast point Oh
for was our fastest 0.02 and 0.02 and
upload speeds were just as bad so
depending where you are obviously but
here we are in Southern California we'd
expect much faster speeds this is very
much the tale of a phone in search of a
network once we get LTE presumably it'll
be able to blazingly fast get through
everything but while you're stuck
dealing with Sprint's very very slow 3G
network it's very much a phone in search
of a home so if you are on Sprint and
you're looking for a phone to to
purchase and you want to stay on the
carrier this is definitely the best one
available
if you're looking to make a switch to
sprint for this device you're gonna want
to look at AT&amp;amp;T HTC One X Verizon is
incredible 4G or the 1s for t-mobile to
get the
faster networks we don't know you know
what cities are gonna be next on the
list after the initial rollout city is
for Sprint's for LTE we don't know how
to network it's gonna perform
under Network pressure so it's a tough
phone to recommend it's definitely well
expect it's well constructed and
everything about it just works well it's
got decent battery life on our tests we
got just below that 7.5 hour talk time
at about 7 hours so everything about
this phone works very well except for
the network that it's on that's a
decision you have to make for yourself
whether or not Sprint is where you want
to be if it is where you want to be
you're not going to find anything better
than this
if you're looking to get the best phone
available on the best network you may
want to look elsewhere again for a for
for more detailed explanation of the
phone everything it can do which there
