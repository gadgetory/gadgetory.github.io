to you by full sail university what's up
everyone greetings humans hey guys it's
ashley and John we're here is the show
floor CES things are kind of quiet cuz
its kind of winded down for the day but
we're doing ask the Buffalo but now it's
asked the Buffalo duh do you fight the
urge to say we're here live is every
video is technically live right you're
here alive but you're watching it for
days later so it's live to tape like it
is we're at some point we were alive
when we filmed this the whole thing so
we've got some questions from you guys
for CES and this so this is our CES
extravaganza ask the Buffalo so let's
get to it alright we have many questions
so we have all the questions so many
questions about ces I do have a question
from one I believe his name is joey
davidson is that you're sure it's not yo
e yo maybe the J is saying yeah it
silently that could definitely be a
hashtag ask the bee why is Joey always
excluded from group events CES and
office visits well at the twofold answer
it is a two-fold answer first we hate
you second Delaware what I wish you had
agreed look at look at us so hard look
at us Delaware I will say this on camera
to Joey should you choose to try to
venture out to sunny Southern California
to live we would love to include you in
a big huggie embrace this is from Levi
Smosh he says how are you guys at
TechnoBuffalo keeping clear of the CES
plague at CES 2014 also develop your
glasses which PS prescription need them
to see don't care if anybody hates them
love them they're my favorite you
actually got recognized because of the
glasses I do i do get recognized has
glasses also i need them to see so so
why don't you take the CGS plague answer
CES like okay so last
our editor-in-chief got hospital sick he
had to go to the ER 103 fever like zach
is a Tuesday afternoon she's really bad
done hit him like a big rig in the
middle of street pedestrian stop is
really bad this year fortunately it's
only one day before the end of the show
but fortunately no one has gotten sick
and here's why we have gallons of Purell
everyone is basically d like germs when
they come into the booth that we have
you know when you see like you go into
like an Intel room and they have to like
spray you with everything getting we
pretty amination we can have any pretty
much have a dry room yeah I actually for
me um I don't use like Purell and stuff
I don't let it feel like it dries weird
i actually just have a timer on my cell
phone that tells me to go wash my hands
every hour because when you're in the
throes of CES you forget to wash your
hands all the time and you also forget
how much people are actually touching
all of the tablets and phones that you
are also touching um so it's easy to
kind of forget to keep your hands clean
but yeah that's what i do i use a timer
and for me I just had one trick with the
exception of right now i just ate away
from ashley CES style this is from eric
will born on twitter what's the product
you've liked the most that you feel
needs more coverage oh that's an easy
one for me the LG clear and mirrored
places we're absolutely absolutely
incredible i'm thinking about singing in
windows and practical applications and
businesses and homes all i want is for
every window in my house to be an actual
just transparent display but the cost
has to be the equivalent to the class of
a regular window so it'll be a while
imagine just looking outside and be like
oh let me just buy something from amazon
are you see my email coming through them
it just seems like a gnat's the future i
really like that um i would say because
i'm obsessed with it i can't stop going
over there and staring at it is i the
sharp 8k 3d glasses list TV you stood in
front of that I did I talked at it they
have these like dots on the ground and
then when you stand in front of the TV
there's a little kind of gauge that you
line up the dots like as you move
then when you line them up you can see
the 3d affected it is amazing they were
playing Life of Pi and it was one of my
favorite things I've ever seen and but
it's so hard to show on camera cuz it's
like how do you do that thinking shoot
camera something I shot in a camera that
you're gonna in turn look through yeah
it's not 3d so it's really hard to
actually do actual coverage on it but to
see it in person yeah amazing it's an 85
inch televisions and see it doesn't
translate also I really like this year
that that 3d wasn't just crammed down
your throats everywhere you went I think
is a little bit of a fad like I mean
we're still gonna see it and it's I
think now filmmakers are deciding to be
a little more immersive and smart about
3d which I appreciate so but I would
love to have that 85 inch 3d feel 4k TV
or 8k it's an 8k TV so many k's mini
case its cue case oh the case um and
have like play gravity at home feel like
watch the majesty of space disaster that
just seems like a lot of fun you would
never sleep again no no I wouldn't I
just keep watching TV all the time of
you so excited I gotta interrupt our CES
episode with a really quick little shout
out to our friend and sponsor Full Sail
University obviously apps right now are
huge they're everywhere and we've all
had those ideas that make you say uh I
should totally be a nap I have to make
it right so full sail University's
online mobile development bachelor's
degree program can teach you how to make
that appt from concept to post launch
marketing even better you do the whole
thing for the comfort of your own home
via full sales online education platform
with full sails mobile dev program you
learn both sides of app development for
iOS and Android creating your app with
advanced programming languages and then
launching and managing the business of
your app once it's complete oh but
Ashley you're telling me I don't have a
good enough computer to run lines of
advanced Kota can't afford all that
expensive software hey listen that's
okay because full sales project launch
box program gives you a macbook pro
preloaded with industry software plus
iOS and Android devices so if you're

better I like prescribed baby time ago
but you're not getting a baby onesie
attack one for me no know what I'm
sitting there with little Nate I mean
I'm just I mean I'm focused on him but
I'm usually thinking like can I get a
picture of this oh so yeah you're always
thinking about it hey I can't help it
it's it's it's literally in my DNA yeah
I feel the same way usually I always
want to be connected but then there are
times like a few times a year my husband
and I go out to the desert and we shut
off all of our phones and laptops and we
just play music and have a great time
and hang out and we really like it so
I'm a big fan of the California desert
you just did one of those recently and
you were like I am not answering
anything no no I just I'm like I'm off
the grid please do not contact me there
don't bother cuz I just we don't take
anything with us and i love it like it's
nice to sort of come back and you feel a
little more appreciative of what you
have and like be connected but i don't
miss it like I don't leave and go to the
desert and go oh I wish I had my phone
I'm going crazy I'm just like oh I don't
have my phone like that's great it's
kind of liberating I need the day like
that Oh me you should take a day
like one day a month is a good it's a
good time I'm just gonna make it like a
