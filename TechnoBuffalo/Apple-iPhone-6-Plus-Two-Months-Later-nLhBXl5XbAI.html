to you by citrix gotoassist
the number one global market leader in
remote support what's up everyone Jon
Ranger from TechnoBuffalo here it's been
about two months since the iPhone 6 and
6-plus hit I wanted to share my
impression to vi plus having used it on
or off for the better part of two months
there's an old school style video no
notes no prompter we're going to go
right out of my mind out there mouth
hole it's gonna get started so two
months have passed since Apple unveiled
their giant and giant er iPhones I've
used the iPhone 6 for a while in the 6
plus we'll do a separate video with the
6 we're gonna focus just on the 6 plus
so the things I talked about initial
review I think are still valid some
gripes I have I think I still have as
well first the freaking pencils on this
thing are ginormous I get the bottom
bezel because it's got to have that
touch ID home button I can accept that
but the top bezel is absolutely huge
this is almost the same size as a 6 inch
phone like you've got with the Nexus 6
and larger phones like you've got with
the Galaxy Note 4 it just seems crazy at
the phone is this big it's still a great
it's a problem
I didn't earlier video say I was gonna
use a case on it because it just seems a
little slippery on the back I couldn't
quite stick with that ended up ditching
the case about a week and a half later I
just I like my phone naked I like to
feel the metal well it sounds creepy but
I just I would like to have no cases on
my phone haven't quite dropped it yet
fortunately I'm not in the drop test
kind of guy so I'm not gonna go ahead
and do that but durability does seem to
be fine having it out of my pocket I've
got a few sort of Nick's on it my son
likes to grab the phone and kind of drop
it on the carpet so yeah it's got a few
scuffs and scratches but overall I think
it's held up really nice and absolutely
no bending issues without a case let me
just reiterate that no bending issues it
seems to died off don't don't worry
about it I don't know if your phone is
bent you can't tell it's super-easy put
it on a table have it extend out past
the camera hump so you can put it down
and you can see if it's bent and you're
fine speaking of camera umph I still
find that super annoying
super-annoying I can kind of accept it
on the iPhone 6 plus because gato is and
ones they got to go in and out but on
the six doesn't have that what the heck
so I still find that very annoying but I
do really like the camera the camera is
really good on this phone I wish I had a
little higher megapixels I could zoom in
a little bit more but it's not doing
much zooming the camera has been awesome
in the low-light it's been great it's
got a really quick shutter I got a
fast-moving kids to be able to snap
recalled pictures at once have been
awesome I like taking the slow-mo videos
I've sort of done a few of those
although usually it's like Lucy licking
peanut butter which is creepy or Lucy
running mostly just just videos of Lucy
but I like having it it's really nice I
don't miss having 4k video on a phone I
think it's a nice feature to have maybe
but takes up so much storage space you
know but if you're the kind of person
that wants 4k video it's probably
something to consider if you're looking
to get an iPhone battery life is still
ridiculously awesome on the 6 plus it's
actually gotten better over the weeks
that I've used it with both phones with
my normal use in to generally get around
40% end of the day that's fun like
generally have about 60 to 70% battery
life which is absolutely awesome
my wife has also this explosion very
rarely uses her phone checking interest
in Facebook by time she plugs her phone
at the end of the day it's at 75 percent
which is absolutely awesome obviously
usage is going to totally vary Becky my
screen brightness around 75% I got two
emails Bing checked phone calls the
YouTube videos all the rest of that
battery life is super good so for that
my fina phone it's gonna last you quite
a while we're not talking like droid
turbo battery but really really good I
wish the iPhone 6 and the 6 plus battery
life that would probably be the perfect
size well I'm going to tell more iPhone
stuff to talk about real quick I want to

month so here's kind of a fun fact with
the iPhone you might not know if you go
to the Apple Store not the carrier you
pay full price for
either a t-mobile phone an 18 t phone or
Verizon phone you're gonna get the a-15
2 to model if you look at the back of
the phone you can see the model number
that is the exact same phone for all
three carriers it's the same phone 18 T
cells same phone t-mobile cells and same
phone Verizon cells they just lock it
down for them so if you buy an unlocked
phone you can easily go between carriers
and that includes Verizon with the CDMA
bands CD bands are in the device they
get locked down or locked out when you
have it sir with another carrier but
getting off device you can easily use it
I've used this with AT&amp;amp;T is with team
won't won't use it with Verizon which
I'm using currently with no issue at all
everything works visual voicemail works
voiceover LTE works absolutely
everything so if you want advice it can
have inter portability it's a great
choice the Nexus 6 also does that same
thing by the way case you're wondering
if you're with Sprint their networks a
little bit different so you got to get a
totally different sprint phone with
those three carriers just go and switch
phones have been really really nice to
be able to do that so when I last on the
review Apple pay wasn't out yet Apple
pay is now out it works exactly as
expected I mean it's a neat feature
whenever it's available I'll use it if I
have my iPhone with me but doesn't it's
really changing the way I shop maybe in
a year will be different but it works
well it's kind of cool I wish had more
useful energy bands oh that would be
really nice to give NFC bands I still
don't like the way this phone works I
still think Johnny I haven't company
kind of phoned in the design of the
phone but kind of it is what it is I
wish those bands weren't there or maybe
a little less prominent I think the
space gray model hides it best and I
still sort of think Tazz I did from day
one so when Apple unveiled bigger phones
they are sure facing the same problem
and race we're facing for a while app
fragmentation apps still aren't getting
updated yet in fact whatsapp just got
updated this week to support the bigger
screen size so some people don't dig
that I don't know the best I so I like
that things look just giant huge but I
can see how it might be annoying I've
been surprised actually how slow the app
support has been for the 6 and 6-plus
but it's getting there and getting there
slowly then your processor and then
everything seems fine it runs fast like
every iPhone has I've had no issues with
lag I've had no she's running any of the
latest games everything just works the
way it should still disappointed though
with iOS I wish it did more answer the
iOS 8.0 point one debacle really mean
to install any updates that come through
from Apple
I still have weird issues on the
software side if I try and rotate it one
always rotate or the keyboard will be in
the wrong orientation by trying search
using spotlight search apps you know
it's selected setting sometimes apps
won't show up there's solar a lot of
bugs and more bugs than I ever had with
previous iterations of iOS so quote a
control for Apple man
step it up I am finding myself using the
witness Notification Center quite a bit
I like to check the weather the morning
sports scores is kind of really nice to
have in stocks and there's been a really
kind of a cool addition I didn't think I
was gonna use it at all in fact I kind
of was looking very Blom I first
announced it but I found it to be kind
of useful I still like that what got the
profile switch on the side that's been
really nice but overall my opinions on
the phone haven't changed that much
since the really really we do so while
we spend a lot of time with phones
before we go to review really like to
get to know them the screen is great I
don't notice much of a difference
between this and even some of the qHD
screens out there they all look good to
me but it's still one of the better
screens available if you're looking for
high resolution they'll definitely want
to look elsewhere than the iPhone 6 or 6
plus but overall it's been a nice
experience it's Apple through it there's
like ecosystem I like to share pictures
you know with iCloud you like to share
your documents with iCloud you can use
iTunes Match them inside of apples
ecosystem a great choice and it's still
the best iPhone ever made but I still
maintain it's a good phone but it's one
of many good phones out there there are
so many great Android options out there
now there's so many great even
blackberry options out there Windows
Phone options out there
iPhone used to be head and shoulders
above the rest that was probably four
years ago now it's kind of just one of
the many faces in the crowd thank you
