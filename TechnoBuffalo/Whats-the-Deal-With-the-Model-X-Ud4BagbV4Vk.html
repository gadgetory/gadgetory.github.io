weeks now and I've had a ton of
questions from you guys about it I get
it because it's kind of a weird car the
doors are strange it looks weird nothing
about this car is sort of a typical
cards it's really a piece of tech that
you can drive so we put out questions
and all our social media to see what big
questions you guys had about the Model X
I'm doing my best to answer each one of
them this one comes from snapchat I'll
to hear a bit more about the sound
system and phone connectivity can it
store a library for offline play so I
ordered the cars upgraded sound mostly
because that's only way to get satellite
radio it's XM built in but if you are
into music you do get things like Dolby
Surround you get more granular control
over the speakers and you get a better
audio experience it also comes built
into some streaming options you've got
slacker and TuneIn it's got an LTE radio
integrate into the car just use that to
stream and that's free you don't pay for
any of the data at the cars using at
least four four right now it doesn't
have any built-in storage sort of
offload stuff to but all the streaming
options make it really nice and of
course Bluetooth connectivity for
connecting the phone though you don't
have to have it plugged in in order to
stream anything from your phone and do
that via bluetooth but I do have a quick
dock Lightning connection built into the
car I had a choice of either lightning
or microUSB didn't have a USBC option so
I figured things moving away from micro
have a lightning in there just in case I
ever I'm using an iPhone for them so
what is the average range of the car
there are few different options you can
get I got 275 d2 75 mean it's got a 75
kilowatt hour battery the D means dual
motors there is a 90 kilowatt hour
battery pack and then there's a 100
kilowatt out about hour battery pack on
it's going to give you more range as you
move up the advertised range in the 75
237 it jumps up 257 for the 9v and about
289 290 for the hundred kilowatt hour
battery pack
that's a few charger battery up to 100%
it's not good for the car it generally
charged up 200% so I'm doing 80% charge
which usually were I keep it most of the
time I have a range of about 207 miles I
drove up to Los Angeles as past weekend
so I kicked it out got 90% and I had a
range of 217 miles built into the car
I've been using autopilot if so is your
experience with it been so I got this
car with autopilot 2.0 hardware what
that is it's eight cameras all along the
car and enhanced censoring ability with
a huge supercomputer built-in that's a
plus side the downside of that is does
have any autopilot abilities right now
so I can't even do it autopilot one cars
can do Elon Musk assay that's coming by
and get this week and probably when
you're watching this video I'll already
have general autopilot
stuff right now I don't have it we've
got a ton of cameras that will work in
the future but things that I should
expect by end of the week I should
expect the enhanced lane keep so
essentially I can drive hands-free and
look can to keep me in the lane and
follow gradual turn ultimately though
this car is equipped for full level-5
autonomy meeting I get in the car in the
morning I go to work I can go to sleep
in the back
Elon Musk and Tesla have said that
should be around the end of 2017 but
that's barring some gigantic regulatory
approval also oddly with the car though
the autopilot sensors control things
like automatic headlights wipers being
able to detect when Deranian things like
that so I don't even have that stuff
working in this car you don't know what
Tesla gets over there updates when I say
get that ability just like on your phone
I'll get a push notification on my
screen saying I have a software update
I push install it's only the cars gotten
features former intern Dan Gillis you
had the wings hit anyone or anything I
have not the way he's actually been
really sensitive and have not hit
anything I have a pretty tight garage
and they open up just far enough for me
to get in and out never hit anything in
the doors themselves I can control the
front doors from the touchscreen and
open those up they have sensors in them
as well and those stop from hitting a
car which is which is kind of cool from
Instagram why don't you pick the Model X
over any other car what makes it special
to you I was driving a Model S before
this and I really liked the performance
of an electric
car I like technology into it and I like
driving electric overall so when I got
that car I didn't have kids
I now have two kids which means I'm
hauling a lot of people a lot of stuff
and strollers I Drive my son to school
on the weekends I'm generally driving
both kids around so I wanted a car that
could grow with us if we end up having a
third kid I could be able to have car
seats installed I didn't have that
flexibility necessarily with the Model S
so I figured let's try the exo in bit
nervous by how those doors are gonna
hold up but I will say the doors have
been working great and ensure that you
get to get kids in and out and that was
another big reason that I wanted to get
the MS has an impact your monthly energy
bill so I've got a second meter
installed at my house I can set the car
to charge off hours so for me after nine
o'clock the rates dropped down to 11
cents a kilowatt so I just did it to
charge at 9:05 generally for a thousand
miles of driving Universal end up
costing me twenty thirty bucks you know
depending if I charge at public stations
or discharged home very middle impact on
my lectric feel at home so how long does
it take to charge a good question so for
my home I've got a 240 outlet installed
I think I have it set for 30 amps that
charges at 27 miles per hour so you can
do the math right there generally less
than 10 hours from an empty car fully
charged I don't generally drive to
almost zero like a cell phone I plug in
at night I come out in the morning I
unplug it and it's fully charged
I can't go to Tesla supercharger though
and I get eighty percent charge in about
twenty thirty minutes
so lots of questions on the test so we
covered a huge amount on the doors if
you have questions about that watch the
video link it up here and down both sort
of goes over the doors I thought about
the delivery experiences like we did a
video kind of documenting that as well
but generally I'm really happy at the
car I've had no issues you know quality
problems you know we'll see how those
Falcon things hold up over the course of
a three-year lease but I'm hoping I
don't have any problems but we'll see
thank gosh watching hope you enjoyed if
you want more Tesla videos - I'm going
to putting a ton more up on our
secondary channel inside Jon's month be
