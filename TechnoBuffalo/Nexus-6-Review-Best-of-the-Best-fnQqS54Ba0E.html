TechnoBuffalo here the three of you for
you of the latest Nexus device from
Google this is the Motorola built Nexus
6 I'm really excited to review this
device Motorola crams really every
flagship spec you could think of from
screen to processor and RAM into one
phone so go ahead put it through its
paces and see if there should be the
device that lives in your pocket for the
next year to two years it's going to get
started sounds like to do with all my
reviews I want to give a disclaimer I
use this for six days before doing this
review and brand Nick is there written
portion of it used it for four days if
you want to hear anything more about I'm
gonna talk about hit the link down below
got a ton more details including full
photo galleries when you get to the
camera section we have an unlocked blue
model that's sent to us from Google we
tested it in Southern California using
AT&amp;amp;T t-mobile and Verizon same phone
works fully on all networks let's jump
right in with design let me just get
this out of the way early this is a
really big phone it's like really really
big think of this phone like Shaq and
they'd be with our phone out there like
a high school freshman point guard
saying something is big by today's
standards really mean something in a sea
of five inch plus phones this five point
nine six inch Titan stands above them
all literally and figuratively
I like big phones in fact pretty much
every device I've used over the past few
years so my daily driver has been five
point two five point three inches or
bigger
if you've held an iphone six-plus though
and thought those bezels are absolutely
gargantuan this is about the same height
a little bit wider I say that not to
compare to the iPhone at all but give
you a lease of a size reference this is
the first device since the galaxy mega
that can I think is it too big go to a
store see it and hold it and see how it
fits in your pocket it barely fits it's
normal do jeans but it does fit I'm
certainly not deducting any punched in
the score for the size but you should
definitely know how big it is going in
see if it's the right phone for you it's
not going to suit everybody alright I
got that in my system so what the screen
size here's the thing the size is very
big part of what makes the Nexus 6 so
appealing to people what seems big to me
might seem pretty normal to you though
Google and Motorola very consciously
chose the Matt
of six inch qHD screen because big
phones are just what people want
nowadays to be fair the size is both a
curse and a gift a curse because it can
be difficult to use one-handed and
Google really doesn't do much with the
software to make that even easier to do
a gift though because the display size
is absolutely perfect for watching
videos and playing games on when plopped
out on my couch after a long day YouTube
videos look ridiculously great on that
five point nine six inch screen and it's
the size you begin to wonder if a
tablet's even necessary you might not
use Nexus 6 to watch a three-hour epic
maybe you want to watch the new Hobbit
movie but it's really difficult to catch
up on episodes of The Simpsons Bob
burgers of your favorite show might be
an android 5.0 lollipop snoo material
design is a perfect fit for larger
canvas all the fancy new animations
bright colors and slick visual tricks is
definitely a sight for sore Android eyes
as for the screen itself the Nexus 6 is
5.9 six inch qHD AMOLED display looks
fantastic Scott a resolution of 2560 by
1440 which means it's got a 493 ppi so
as you'd expect text looks incredibly
sharp videos are clean everything just
looks really nice the pleasure to look
at this device colors might not be as
vibrant and saturated as they are and
something like the galaxy note 4 but I
take nothing away from the screen on the
Nexus 6 the screen is terrific and with
all the rich deep black typical of
AMOLED displays out in broad daylight it
can be a bit hard to see what's on
screen that's kind of case with most
phones but otherwise it is just a
beautiful delight on my eyes fortunately
though there's much more than Nexus 6 s
design and then it's simply being a big
device it essentially looks like a
larger current gen Moto X got the same
rounded back same aluminum frame same
camera placement and the buttons are
more or less the same to place carefully
on the right side for easy access and
using the one hand power button
incidentally still has a really nice
texture to it and I can't overstate how
nice that little touches make it super
easy to find easy to press the volume
rocker meanwhile is clicky enough
without feeling kind of chintzy and
cheap overall the Nexus 6 feels really
solidly built and really strong as is
the case with almost all current gen
moto devices but it's all I'm not rosy
in Nexus world
I wish the back side of the phone was
made
something different the soft touch
matted plastic looks great and
complements the contoured aluminum frame
pretty well but the midnight blue model
that we've got in the office attracts
oil and grease like no other phone I've
ever seen now tested a lot of phones a
nexus 6 looks great in the box but as
soon as you start touching the thing the
device looks like it's had an encounter
with McDonald's fries right actually
came out of the grease no matter how you
try it the device is nearly impossible
to keep spotless or even clean for that
matter it seems to wear like the leather
back on the new Moto X without the added
benefit of actually being leather as
great as the front is the back though
not so much so you might want to put
this guy in a case which might make the
size even bigger but for you to sideways
not that's going to be an issue the
Nexus 6 is front-facing speakers are
super loud crisp and clear Chin's are
abusing Nexus 6 probably with headphones
or on a quiet area anyway but the
speaker's don't disappoint if you use it
for that oh you're not the strength
listen to the speakerphone you'll
certainly have no issue at all hearing
video music or just your mom yelling at
you on speaker the addition of motos
turbo charger is certainly handy for
give you the Nexus 6 a quick jolt to
juice we actually tested this feature
out extensively and found it does indeed
charge fashioned traditional charger not
like crazy turbo fast but enough that
you'll find it kind of useful in a pinch
it's worth noting though that your
battery needs to be drained almost
entirely for the turbo charger to work
the charging rate will actually slow as
charging progresses and some sort of
consistent all the way through I'm not
entirely sure if the six hour battery
claimed in 15 minutes 100% accurate the
turbo charging does provide a quick way
to get the Nexus 6 back on his feet with
batteries especially low so we're at an
airport plug it in there pretty good so
let's talk about software we've covered
lollipop pretty extensively already but
it bears repeating here Android 5.0
lollipop is easily the best version
google has ever put out and it looks
absolutely gorgeous that one go just
look good it's just kind of fun to use
to the Nexus 6 is largest play is a
beautiful showcase for the fans material
design lollipop what a great though
probably on any screen size it'd look
great on the nexus 9 about Google's new
design philosophy kind of it with
grid-based layouts responsive animations
and transitions and depth effects makes
it the best looking mobile out there no
question from my perspective make
previous versions of Android eating kick
just look outdated archaic simply
navigating the homescreen jumping into
an app drawer digging through the
settings is just a fun joyous experience
lollipop looks wonderful in motion but
it's not just how the lollipops designed
it also comes with an extensive list the
new features really cements Android
status is one of the most powerful OS is
out there security improvements
multi-user support screen pinning
multitasking overview ok Google from
anywhere a new priority mostly the
lollipop just an awesome experience
overall that was just a small sampling
of the tons of new features found in
Android 5.0 so eventually this the Nexus
90 of you but this just bothered me I
include an email app it just redirects
you to Gmail just get rid of the email
app it's a little thing but I just found
it annoying alright next let's jump into
that guy the camera so to put it kindly
Google had a lot of forcing you to make
their Nexus line competitive in the
camera department the LG Bilt Nexus 5
when it launched had and a bismal camera
that gradually got better this time
around them and with Motorola - hello
Google just is not messing around
so all that kind of history with the
Nexus line of cameras makes the Nexus 6
is 13 megapixel camera with oh is even
more important the good news is that any
concerns about it don't really have to
worry about it
we took a lot of images on the Nexus 6
over the past few days and weeks and a
large majority of them look absolutely
fantastic which is in itself isn't
something you wouldn't usually say about
Nexus device least historically we put
it in among some of this year's best in
fact focuses quickens consistent shots
are detailed and properly exposed for
the most part and colors are really
accurate the camera software is also
pretty terrific but probably really new
that the UI is minimalistic settings are
out of the way and you can be swiped in
once you need them turn the flash on or
take high resolution panorama just a few
swipes and taps away tap the shutter
button you've already snapped the
picture the shutter meanwhile is
extremely fast - in firing off shots
happen in instants hold it down though
and you will get a burst of images it
does better mention though that low
light quality despite having optical
image stabilization was not great so
least bear that in mind
video quality is also solid in creeks or
4k video had thirty fittest
means frames per second which is a
really nice touch I don't know many
people who insists on recording home
video in 4k since the file sizes are
just ginormous I probably would
recommend it but the future is there if
you decide your kid's birthday party
just needed that 4k touch regular 1080p
which as the layman's are probably used
looks really sharp and balanced which is
all you can really ask for I'm
smartphone camera brendan has a ton of
images in the written review again hit
the button down below to check them out
including some those low-light samples
alright next let's talk about
performance if there was a flagship spec
to be had Motorola and Google pretty
much just crammed it into the Nexus 6
the Snapdragon 805 and three gigs of ram
make everything predictably hum along
really really really well no stagger
stutters or anything just really fast
performance I know you guys like to know
this we do it on all of our Android
tests the quadrant score was at let's
play a game
guess was it over 12000 if you said yes
you'd be correct you got a score of
13,000 440 there is no lag here at all
multitask to your heart's content you
are not gonna run into any memory issue
you could play them as powerful games
Android has to offer without any stutter
this is one of the best SPECT most
powerful phones on the market because
though it's so swell spec so powerful
how's the battery life gonna be on it
Motorola's been killing it recently
bringing some of the best battery life
around looking at you droid turbo not
surprisingly though the 3220 million
power battery performance pretty
admirably and that's with the q HD
screen here you'd be able to get through
a full day my usage usually I had around
35% end of the day came off the charger
around 7:00 7:30 female accounts being
pulled down every 5 minutes I don't
believe in auto brightness I keep my
screen usually at 75% but two hours of
phone calls a lot of gaming video
viewing and it's always tends it's a
Wi-Fi either at home or at work and I
was again able to get to about 35% so if
you turn your brightness down or use
Auto you're probably added under 15%
better like that so you might be able to
reach out to two days but easily one day
without having to do any battery
management which for me is what matters
I'm home every night I can plug it in
very so what's the conclusion here on
the Nexus 6 if you can't tell I really
like it this is one of the best phone
I have ever used in bare mind I've used
pretty much every phone and tested every
phone on the 4 major carriers over the
past four and a half to five years I
would happily sign a two-year contract
for this phone I think it'd be great for
two years it's got a lot of future proof
specs in it and getting a qHD screens
three gigs of ram a cutting-edge
processor you're gonna get all google OS
updates over the next few years you're
getting a pretty good camera not the
best one out there you're getting pretty
decent battery life you're getting a
great screen sure the back might not be
perfect but otherwise it's a pretty
close to perfect device anything
negative I can say about it is kind of
just nitpicking definitely bear in mind
before you order it sight unseen try it
see what the big size I'm gonna figure a
lifestyle if it is you will not be
disappointed this phone gets a really
solid nine on our TechnoBuffalo score
and a huge recommendation if you like
