technobuffalo here's an unboxing of the
forest ps5 thought I wouldn't be able to
say and say that for another 10 years or
so speaker from for this is my third DTS
play-fi speaker that I've unboxed I'm
trying to get speaker setups throughout
my entire house of God a 16 month old at
home and I want to play music in his
room at night when he wakes up so I
don't have to go in there speakers like
this let me play music in his room while
also playing a different song downstairs
I don't listen to the best of Disney in
all of my speakers so here is the forest
bigger can set you back about two
hundred twenty nine bucks but check with
the retailer prices are changing all the
time I'll walk you through all this
stuff here but it is crossed OS
compatible so Google Play amazon kindle
fire iOS or Windows PC here it is for a
speaker we got some stuff on the back
about DTS play-fi but walk you through
all that and why I chose to go with DTS
play-fi speakers let's go ahead and open
this ma'am a jam up I will bring in my
unnecessary friend the large unboxing
knife and if you're thinking about
getting a speaker setup for your house
and you don't want to have to worry
about getting a set receiver for
everything or your different speakers
anything that's got DTS play-fi Tech
will work so you could pick up a speaker
from polk and a speaker from forest and
any other brands that support it to make
it work it makes life really really easy
so go ahead and slice that open let's
slide this sucker out come out of there
speaker there we go and we are greeted
with the information on it quick start
guide for the gigantic pictures ps5
speaker we're also gonna have in this
box hopefully the speakers in here
somewhere ah found it there it is let's
go ahead and take this guy out here
alright so super fast and boxing alright
so why did I pick the force first it's
got dual band Wi-Fi so i can stream
lossless audio and every room in my
house which is what i was going for with
DTS play-fi can also send songs with
airplay or high quality bluetooth with
app text and AAC which is really nice
something you can do with you got a mac
or pc you can use the best codecs that
either are going to support so i'm
trying to be an audio guy but if you are
a pure audio file the PS 5 does support
hi streaming resolution 24 bit 192
kilohertz flac audio files so pretty
high quality audio can come through this
without really having to use any wire
other than to plug it in as I mentioned
it's pretty multi-platform the force
android app kindle fire app and iOS app
widget controller speaker obviously play
music from your own library or use
things like pandora Songza the BBC ESPN
Radio Disney which I will definitely be
using you can also use sirius XM deezer
QQ music or exit connected DLNA music
server which i don't have yet set up but
tell me the idea of doing it so I
mentioned Wi-Fi let me tell you a little
bit more about that it's multi room so
you can play the same song every room or
different songs in different rooms which
is what I'm going for here what I like
about this is no bridges needed speaker
just connect wirelessly via your home
Wi-Fi network which is a big deal for me
it also keeps costs down the audio
fidelity is pretty awesome play fight is
loss of transmission so you get that
high quality audio that you'd expect
it's open platform too so you know you
have a Hulk speaker at home will have
the forest one here you have to pledge
allegiance to sort of any brand at all
as long as it has play fight technology
you are good to go so from a port
standpoint we of course have audio in
case you want to plug in whatever you
want USB in case you want to power
you've got micro USB and you've got
where your power cord is actually going
to plug into alright so we've got the
PSI which are kind of like saying all
setup setup is pretty easy as I was
really any of the play five devices i
just plugged it into the wall the Wi-Fi
light starts blinking i was able to go
into settings find that Wi-Fi network
this putting out connect to it did a few
updates and that was it final kick the
bluetooth is a Bluetooth button you just
do that directly to and all
of course there's audio in in case you
want to play music through the speaker
so in addition to all those wireless
technology it's also got a pretty sweet
dual-core DSP and Class D digital
amplifiers so it should sound awesome
from a teeny tiny little package alright
so as I mentioned reviewing speakers and
letting you hear what i hear is pretty
close to impossible because it's got to
come from here to my microphone and then
gets all compressed and comes out of
your speakers ever you're using let's go
ahead and try this live and you take my
word for it how it's going to sound I'm
gonna stream music from my own library
but you've got access as I mentioned
just a ton of online streaming options
so in the past I've done these videos of
lip synced my way to some Saved by the
Bell a little bit of frozen let's go old
school with their song let's play some
Kansas some wayward son this is actually
for funny story what I sing to my baby
when I put them to bed at night seems
appropriate
all right so listen I know I cannot
dance but a tiny little speaker fills up
the room I was playing music from my
phone via play-fight DTS technology
right to it could use bluetooth could
have plugged it in worked pretty well
for 229 busting get a speaker it's going
to fill up the room sticker you can
control from your phone if you have
other DTS play-fi speakers you play
whatever you want and then you room you
on that a bridge it seems really nice
and this is hopefully please going to be
able to low my baby to sleep with
wayward son ever else it had to play
through it and I think you guys for
