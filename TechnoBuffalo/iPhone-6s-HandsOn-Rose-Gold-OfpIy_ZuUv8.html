and TechnoBuffalo here and I am at the
Apple Keynote
where Apple just took the wraps off
their latest iPhone this is the iPhone
6s and it joins its larger sibling the
iPhone 6s plus so a lot is new here
aside from this new fourth color which
is rose gold so the phone might look the
same got things are familiar spots
you've got your power and lock binder
familiar spot you've got your profile
switches volume buttons all where they
typically are but everything is new here
at least that's what Apple saying
underneath the hood let's start with
what's on the back series 7000 aluminum
to make it much stronger and the
strongest glass Apple's have never put
on a screen on the back the cameras
improved you got 50% more pixels now
it's up to 12 megapixels that can out
also shoot 4k as well as taking live
photos what that does you take a simple
photo at the same Club megapixel picture
record the second a half before heck
second and a half after you can play
that back kind of cool effect but for me
the big story here built into iOS 9 and
the iPhone 6s and 6s plus is force touch
and we saw that debuted with the Apple
watch but it is now here renamed 3d
touch so if you go in and touch on icons
a phone for example and go ahead and
push in a little bit more you now get
more menu options so you go ahead and
pick who you wanted to talk to to go
ahead and jump into mail for example
quick force touch you get a real quick
taptic feedback and you can see what's
there on the screen so you can search
VIP an inbox make it much simpler and it
works with most apps as well jump into
music for example and I was also working
with third parties to make sure it works
as well so a Facebook for example you
can go ahead and search check-in take a
photo or update status I talked about
Dropbox quite a lot to multi-has will
for example put a bit of pressure on the
left hand side and you can go ahead and
see it start to creep in you can see
what other apps you might have open a
lot of other new things here under the
hood as well as you got faster Wi-Fi
support for more bands and LTE a present
configuration is still the same for the
outgoing model pre-orders are going to
go live on September 12 for both phones
for more on the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s
plus of course check us out at
TechnoBuffalo calm until next time john
ret enger' see you guys next video
