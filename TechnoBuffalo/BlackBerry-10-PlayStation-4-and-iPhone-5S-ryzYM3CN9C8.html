brought to you by audible.com welcome
back to the episode of ask the Buffalo
this to show you could ask me John
wrench or any question you've got from
the wine were the technology if you want
to ask a question every tuesday on
TechnoBuffalo calm will put up an
article where you can leave your
questions in the comments so up this
week we're gonna talk blackberry 10 the
next xbox 360 and the playstation 4 to
iOS visits and some samsung galaxy all
thrown into one disaster Buffalo let's
start talking so our first question
comes from the awesomely named Vegard
lockness yes hey John do you think
blackberry OS 10 has something to battle
the other more mature smartphone OS is
with does it have a chance yes I think
it absolutely has a chance does it have
a chance to be first place or second
pledged to take that crown from iOS or
Android no absolutely not it's a battle
for third place with Windows Phone I did
think blackberry 10 brings a lot to the
table I've been using it now for just
about a week and I'm really enjoying it
I want to probably another three or four
days before I feel comfortable doing a
full review but it brings a lot of new
features it brings a lot of intuitive
features but it's also a bit tricky and
it certainly are some things that fall
short so I'll talk about all that in the
full review but the moral is guess I
think it absolutely can compete and if
you're looking to get a smartphone
definitely go and check out one of the
blackberry 10 devices that hope we'd be
out by the time your contract is up
Tyler saddington John you think that
Samsung makes too many Galaxy devices
yes absolutely i'm not saying samsung
makes too many phones that's a whole
different conversation but that galaxy
line is really their flagship and to put
that galaxy name in front of non
flagship phones i think really dilute
the brand i think releasing phone after
phone that same galaxy name definitely
diminishes so not sure he's saying too
many Samsung devices that's a whole
other ball wax but yes way too many
galaxy phones twitter user who's I'm Mia
three at John for lakers are you excited
about the new ps4 and the new xbox what
we will know more about the ps4 in just
a few days februari 20th is coming up
and Sonia is presumably going to unveil
everything that is going to be the ps4
we've covered in the past we're
expecting eight-core some crazy
controller that's got a screed in the
middle as far as I'm Microsoft's get
announced we don't really know but
presumably you know that much longer to
wait later on the year when III comes up
but it comes to the current generation
of ps3 vs the xbox 360 debate I'm always
a tough one to sell I thank you for
looking for value and to get the best
bang for your buck you're way better off
going with the PS store you're getting
the latest blu-ray player firmware
upgradable any new features that Sony
issues with the blu-ray format the ps3
is going to get it now that being said I
do almost all my console gave me on the
xbox for a few reasons first and most
importantly to me I just prefer the
controller I liked away the xbox
controller feels over the DualShock
sixaxis controller that have been on the
PlayStation consoles in the past I also
prefer the UI on the xbox but if you've
never used either and you're not really
partial to one control over the other
it's a way better bet to go at the ps3 I
think you're getting a little bit better
graphics at the very least you get more
storage space on the blu-ray than you do
on the DVD on the Xbox both gaming
experience they're going to look pretty
good we're looking to get sort of the
best bang for your buck ps3 is going to
be a great way to go be interested to
see though if that holds true the next
generation of consoles I to known that
much longer to find out so if that
helped into your question this one also
comes from twitter user real Gary
sawhney asks at John for lakers what are
you expecting in the upcoming ipad mini
2 and the iphone 5s this year let's
start at the 5s I don't think it's going
to be a giant hardware upgrade think
it'll look exactly the same as a Phi a
little bit faster processor not probably
be about it I think we're the big things
we're going to see with the 5s is on the
software side hopefully hopefully
hopefully we're going to see iOS 7 I
don't think it's gonna be ready to be
released when the 5s comes but hopefully
we'll see previews of it which fingers
crossed is gonna be a complete
rethinking and revamping of iOS I want
to come to the ipad mini 2 it's all
about the screen expect a much better
screen a Retina display the higher PPI
in the current generation iPad so the
ipad 4 and of course the ipad 3 before
it what are you guys was excited about
iphone 5s you excited about an ipad me
too
next generation galaxy phone and you not
even care about any of that leave your
