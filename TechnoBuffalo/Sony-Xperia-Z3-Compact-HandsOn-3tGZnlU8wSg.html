Hazleton from technobuffalo checking out
the Xperia z3 compact I'm gonna run
through real quick here we're super
crowded as you can see here at Aoife in
Berlin but this is an awesome new phone
four point six inch display a little
smaller and what you guys an experience
e3 but still a 1280 by 720 pixels which
looks actually really sharp here right
in front of me and you also get that
20.7 megapixel camera on the back
dedicated camera button there on the
right for that Snapdragon 801 processor
2.5 gigahertz it's Bach for Adreno 330
GPU two gigs of ram and then 16 gigs of
memory which you can upgrade up to 128
gigabytes additional 128 gigabytes using
this micro SD card saw on the left-hand
side here I just going through it real
quick it almost looks metal probably to
you on camera but it's actually like a
sort of clear soft plastic but it feels
really light and awesome and easy to use
in the hand which I really really like
power button volume keys here easy to
use you've got 3.5 millimeter headphone
jack up top and then the front casing
front facing camera rather there too so
really awesome and obviously one of the
cool features here that is access to the
PlayStation application which will allow
you to stream your games over your
xperia z3 compact or experience III or
z3 compact tablet or tablet compact
rather so that's really awesome too but
