today we're looking at a very
interesting piece of hardware namely
Nokia's new high-end bluetooth headset
the bh 905 while this can be categorized
as a cellphone accessory it's definitely
a departure from nokia standard offering
it's always nice to see bigger companies
stepping outside the box and creating
something new nokia was once the
spearhead of mobile technology but it
seems over the past few years they've
been getting a bit too comfortable with
their market leader status so it's
definitely a nice change to see Nokia
once again develop brings new and
interesting technology later this year
they're coming out with their new miami
linux device the nokia n900 and they're
also coming out with a netbook pc the
nokia booklet but back to the headset
what makes this particular headset very
interesting device is that it has 10
microphones eight of which are dedicated
for noise cancellation but let's free
the device from its encasing the headset
comes in an extremely high-quality
leather case it's quite hefty and you
can feel that this leather case is made
to last also inside the box we have the
3.5 millimeter extension cord and a
pretty thick operations manual alrighty
let's open up the case the headset
itself looks very impressive and it's
nice to see that the case is packed with
a nice set of accessories as well let's
put the headset aside for a sec and
check out those accessories so we have
your standard Nokia charger and the
divisive battery is good for about 25
hours of music playback and 24 hours of
talk time we also have another 3.5
millimeter extender cable and a
microfiber cloth for keeping that
brushed steel finish clean and there's a
very nice collection of gold-plated
adapters for pretty much any kind of
device you can think of I'm quite
impressed with the accessories but I
guess for this price you can expect it
let's put the case aside
and check out the headset itself it's a
relatively lightweight product but it
feels well built and it looks awesome
it's definitely an impressive looking
handset the brush steel on the earpieces
are especially a nice touch the right
hand side ear piece of the headset is
equipped with large easy to press
buttons we have a multifunction button
and all the essential playback buttons
as well on the side we find a volume up
and down rocker and the noise
cancellation button is equipped with a
light that turns on when the noise
cancellation is enabled also inside the
device we find the array of microphones
which are located on both earpieces and
both sides of the headset and because
this is the bluetooth headset I'll be
focusing on the Bluetooth capabilities
so let's poke this baby up like most
Bluetooth accessories the headset is
extremely easy to set up just hit the
multifunction key and pair with any
bluetooth capable device and you're
pretty much good to go works great with
of course Nokia's own devices like the
n97 but it's also very simple to set up
with any other Bluetooth device I tested
the range of the headset and the
Bluetooth connection is good up to about
eight meters or 25 feet and I have to
say that thanks to the design and soft
cushions the headset is extremely
comfortable on the ears I've worn plenty
of headset over the years and the nokia
bh 905 is definitely one of the most
comfortable headsets I've ever worn
there's next to no pressure on the ears
and it doesn't feel like a burden on
your head but I think it's time to test
out the most advertised feature of the
device which is the noise cancellation
let's fire up some music and put this
baby to the test
the BH 905 has built an active noise
cancellation technology from wolfson
microelectronics which is a leading
manufacturer in high-performance audio
technology so as I mentioned the device
has ten microphones eight of which are
dedicated to noise cancellation and two
microphones for capturing speech and
loud surroundings okay maybe I went a
bit overboard with the noise but I have
to say that it did handle the chainsaw
better than I expected there's a huge
difference when turning on the noise
cancellation when tearing it up with a
chainsaw I'd say that the noise
cancellation filter is about eighty
percent of the noise but I took a stroll
down the street today with the headset
on at a relatively low volume and it
definitely filters out most if not all
City noises and the noise cancellation
does wonders as well when using the
device as a hands-free device when
driving around in your car it filters
out the sound of the engine and traffic
making better hearing for you and the
person you're talking to over the phone
and if you're a particularly bad driver
the device will filter out most of the
honks and profanity shouted by other
drivers setting aside the noise
cancellation sound quality of the
headset is excellent the highs are rich
and the lows are nicely balanced and the
dynamics are sustained even at low
volume levels and is great to hear that
the device can really produce a decent
amount of decibels if you pump up the
volume to the max you will hear the swan
song of sound cells dying in your ear
but what is surprising that the sound
quality and dynamics are sustained even
at the max volume levels which in my
opinion is an extremely impressive feat
for a wireless Bluetooth headset I've
tested out numerous Bluetooth headsets
over the past few years and the nokia bh
905 really blows the competition out of
the water so if you can afford the 400
buck or 300 euro price tag you'll be
getting one of the best if not the best
wireless bluetooth headsets on the
market right now and with it great
accessories and a pretty snazzy leather
carrying case unfortunately they aren't
letting me keep this headset so I'm
gonna have to devise a scheme hahaha
they won't notice a thing catch you
later LP signing out
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
