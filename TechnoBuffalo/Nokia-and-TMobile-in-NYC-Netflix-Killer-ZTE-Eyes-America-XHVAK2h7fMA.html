to you by netflix nokia and tmall go
throwing a party in new york city next
week who's gonna be the special guest
I'll give you a hint not me a company
you know and might be a customer of is
preparing a netflix killer who are they
I'll give you a hint their name rhymes
with horizon and horizon and horizon and
what company who you may never heard of
but whose phones you've probably used at
least once is eyeing the high end of the
US smartphone market for next year
you're hungry for the answers aren't you
well they're coming right around the
corner it's Tecna Buffalo's rumor
roundup run up hey what is going on
everybody and welcome to the roundup I
really want to say Feliz Navidad but
we're not quite there yet so you know
what SDS happy Friday everybody welcome
to the roundup for the week ending today
Friday December 9th 2011 I'm no Kravitz
editor-at-large for TechnoBuffalo in
this episode of the rumor roundup on
revision3 is brought to you by our
friends at Netflix they've been my close
friend lately but spend a lot of time
watching some stuff on netflix anyway
let's get right to the rumors wrap them
up first off there's a party going on in
new york city and i'm not going but
audrianna lee is next week wednesday
december 14th nokia and t-mobile are
throwing a big party they've got some
crazy rock band clap your clapper your
hands say yeah they're going to be
performing it's going to be in night
time so it's good we're setting
audrianna cuz she looks better an
evening gown than I do truck just just
trust me on that one so who's going to
be the star of the show well all
indications would point to the Nokia
Lumia family of Windows Phone devices
headlining the event why well they just
came out they haven't yet launched in
the US and no he is going all in with
Windows Phone so it makes sense we've
got two devices currently on the market
in in the UK the Lumia 800 and the Lumia
710 both of which I got a chance to
check out as it our own emily price back
at nokia world when they launched
John and I also both had the good
fortune of spend some time with the
Lumia 800 it's a quality quality to buy
some really a big fan of the Lumia 800
that being said some documents that
leaked earlier this week on the FCC
website point to a t-mobile branded
version of the Lumia 710 but didn't say
anything about the 800 so it's kind of a
mystery as to what we'll see at the
event next week most likely will see the
710 I think we'll also see the 800
because I don't think Nokia would throw
throw a big party like this so close to
the holiday season you're in the holiday
season so close to to Christmas and
Hanukkah and you're all the other
reasons people buy presents I don't
think they'd come so big just to launch
the 710 seven tons of fine phone but
it's a low-end device and for the first
Nokia Windows Phone device to hit the
u.s. I think they really want to bring
their flagship does that mean we might
see the rumored high high-end Lumia with
the 4.3 inch display I don't think so
soon I think they're saving that one and
whatever else they might have up their
sleeves for a bigger stage like CES in a
man that's less than a month already
cheese one month from now I'll be in
Vegas Viva sorry nevermind i was invited
to party anyway my money is on the 710
and the 800 next week in new york city
whatever it is Adriana will be there
bringing you the devices you know
probably a little bit of the lifestyle
scene from the party as well so stay
tuned to technobuffalo for that one
Netflix has seen its share of bad news
in the latter half of 2011 and it looks
like the beginning of 2012 isn't going
to be any better for them they are our
friends their sponsor the episode we
love you Netflix but it looks like
you've got some more competition on your
hands in the name of verizon reports
this week have come out that Verizon
possibly or probably in partnership with
red box is prepping a streaming TV and
movie service to take on netflix that
will launch in the beginning of 2012
details that are a little sketchy
nothing's been confirmed but it looks
like verizon is going to team up with
red boxes that company that has those
big red boxes where you can rent movies
you know on disk at the grocery store or
shopping mall wherever it is you go you
set up an account you get your disc to
get a home watch it drop it back off
that kind of thing
and apparently what they're going to do
is set up a service that's going to rely
heavily on back catalogue stuff little
light on the new release those kind of
like Netflix does it's going to stream
over the internet it's going to be
separate of verizon's fios cable TV
service so you won't have to be a fios
subscriber or subscribe to any other
verizon stuff to use the new service and
it's going to go out to a variety of
set-top and portable boxes or on set-top
boxes and portable devices including
android/ios you know all that kind of
stuff so we'll keep you updated as
details emerge and you know especially
when anything official is announced but
looks like Netflix will not be the only
streaming game in town as of early next
year if the rumors pan out stay tuned
for that one hey let's take a minute and
watch a movie or at least think about
watching a movie while we talk about how
awesome Netflix is with more than 23
million members Netflix is the world's
largest subscription service instantly
streaming TV episodes and movies over
the Internet members can instantly watch
thousands of titles on a vast array of
devices streaming TV episodes and movies
like Microsoft's Xbox 360 Sony's
PlayStation 3 console and the Nintendo
Wii as a Netflix unlimited member you
can instantly watch as many movies as
you want anytime for one low monthly
price there are no late fees and no due
dates which is key for somebody like me
trust me for a limited time as a new
member and TechnoBuffalo viewer you can
get a 30 day free trial to netflix just
go to netflix.com slash buffalo that's
netflix.com slash buffalo v uff alo make
sure you use that URL to get your free
trial and so they know we sent you and
last but certainly not least ZTE is a
brand name that's big in China maybe not
so well known here in the United States
although if you've been using a cell
phone from more than the past five or
six years odds are at one point you
either owned we're talked into somebody
else's ZTE made phone the company has
traditionally relied on lower end
devices you know less features but
cheaper to produce mass-market stuff
that kind of thing but in an interview
earlier this week they announced that
they're eyeing the high end of the US
smartphone market beginning as early as
next year apparently they think that by
2015 the US will be the place to be if
you're trying to sell smartphones
that'll be
more smartphone usage in the US then
China anywhere else in the world and so
they're getting on board they're
prepping stuff and we're here in a
couple of rumors we're here in Android
which makes sense because they've made
some Android phones already we're also
hearing that they may be prepping
Windows Phone devices for sale in the US
and specifically devices with LTE now as
of right now windows phone does not
support LTE which is one of the reasons
we haven't yet heard anything about a
Windows Phone device coming to verizon
apparently that's a sticking point in
negotiations but I future releases of
Windows Phone will have to support LTE
to stay competitive it looks like ZTE
wants to hop on that train windows phone
with LTE and probably Android with LTE
as well as early as next year will be
interesting to see how they fare in the
US market that's been dominated by the
likes of Apple Samsung and HTC a little
more Apple and Samsung really in recent
months all right kids that'll do it for
this week the rumor roundup brema who
was brought to you this week by netflix

more TechnoBuffalo episodes on rev3
