to you by netflix the iphone is coming
the iphone is finally coming or at least
we think there's a rumor it's finally
coming what's up with all these new HTC
phones bound for t-mobile starting with
the letter R and did Microsoft can a
product manager because he tweeted about
an unreleased Windows Phone 7 device
from Nokia and only gave it an 8 out of
10 hey what is going on everybody and
welcome to the roundup my name is Noah
Kravitz I'm editor-at-large for
TechnoBuffalo and this is the rumor
roundup for the week ending today Friday
September 23rd 2011 this week's episode
of rumor roundup is brought to you by
the good folks at netflix iphone rumors
can't live with them can't live without
them don't really have a choice but we
may finally be seeing this year's
episode of what's the new iphone going
to look like when's it going to come out
be drawing to a close reports earlier
this week from the wall street journal's
all things d blog finally have a date
from a reliable source for the iphone 5
or whatever it's going to be called
launch now this is just a rumor which is
why we're talking about on this show the
show's not called official press invite
roundup is it it's just a rumor but
we're looking at October fourth for the
iPhone reveal whether it's called iPhone
5 iPhone 4s we have both models we have
more models than that I don't know what
we're looking at October fourth as the
date when Apple's new CEO Tim Cook and
his compadres will take to the stage in
San Francisco California to take the
wraps off the next generation of apple
smartphone speaking of phone rumors
what's up with not one but two new
phones with code names starting with the
letter R supposedly coming from HTC to
t-mobile USA I guess it's only two but
it makes for you know it makes our nice
little thing right the our phones the
our brothers our sisters the HTC ruby
and the HTC radar 4g are said to be
coming to t-mobile USA in the very
short-term now the Ruby is a phone we
actually thought or at least hoped was
going to be unveiled at HTC's press
event this past Monday in New York City
instead they took the wraps off of the
HTC rhyme oh it's another our phone the
HTC Rhyme phone for verizon wireless
that went under the code name bliss for
a while and you know it's supposedly a
female friendly phone that features this
external charm notifier thing you can
read all about it on TechnoBuffalo but a
rate the ruby not released yet so still
in the rumor mill it's an android based
phone with a 4.3 inch qhd display you
know kind of upper end specs the whole
shabiha mile hudson must incorporate
what was the thing from lorenz surely
anyway whatever the whole shebang
high-end Android phone said to be coming
to t-mobile USA in the very very near
future now we're also seeing photos on
the Internet of course courtesy from our
friend mr. blurry cam really mr. blurry
cam should step aside and let his cousin
mr. Steadicam take over because I'm
tired of these like shaky hand leaked
photos I want some say you know what if
you got an awesome new device and you're
risking your job or your reputation or
whatever to leak it use a good camera
steady your hands get a tripod to the
good photo anyway I the radar 4g Windows
Phone 7 mango device also said to be
coming in the near term to t-mobile USA
and some shots of this one showing the
boot up screen showing that it's a 4g
device showing that it also is running
and apparently will ship with mango and
tango not to be confused with tango &amp;amp;
cash mango and tango tango being the
two-way video call system that is going
to be unleashed upon the world on the
next generation of Windows Phone 7
devices running mango because these
devices will feature front-facing
cameras as well as rear facing cameras
so t-mobile USA customers and fans keep
your eyes peeled for the Ruby and the
radar 4g whatever they're called when
they finally launch because I don't
think that's going to be called coming
in the next i would say 22 to 24 to 26
weeks with more than 23 million

last is really not least staying in the
realm of phone rumors with the letter R
involved in them that was a stretch of a
Segway sorry who is Joe Marini and why
did he lose his job Joe Marini is or I
should say was a principal product
manager at Microsoft in the windows
phone division why'd he lose his job
well Microsoft won't confirm the
specific reasons but they have confirmed
according to publish reports that he is
no longer with the company apparently he
resigned perhaps resigned before he
could be fired over a series of tweets
from his personal Twitter account at Joe
Marini what were the tweets about the
tweets of course were about an
unreleased cell phone apparently Joe had
some things to say about an upcoming
nokia device running Windows Phone 7 and
he started out by talking about how
great the device was and then took it
down a notch only giving it an 8 out of
10 first he said I just got a chance to
try out one of the slickest looking
nokia phones i have ever seen soon you
will too hashtag wp7 then he was asked
to rate the phone on a scale of 1 to 10
he replied overall I would say an eight
solid feel good camera responsive UI and
nice little touches in the body
construction then he went on because you
know if you're going to start digging
your own grave may as well keep digging
then he went on to explain why he gave
the phone in 8 and not a 9 or even a 10
yeah the camera was good but I didn't
have optimal lighting I'd like a larger
screen too so you're gonna leak a tweet
about a device that's really really your
company you work for a huge company
you're a product manager on the line
that this device is coming out of it's a
big deal and you start out talking about
how it's the slickest thing ever and
then when asked to explain yourself give
it an eight out of ten talk about how
the screen isn't as big as it should be
probably not a smart move probably why
Joe Marine is looking for a new gig now
good luck Joe I hope you find one and I
hope you think twice about your tweets
next time something that I probably
should do actually something we all
should do there you go I
and the nokia windows phone 7 devices
expected to launch nokia world in London
end of October those HTC phones the Ruby
and the radar you know could be any day
now couple of weeks probably for the
Ruby a little bit further out for the
radar the next iPhone October fourth
