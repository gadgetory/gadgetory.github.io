okay the ipad 2 is here Steve Jobs
unveiling Apple's updated version of its
tablet computer of course yesterday at
that huge event in California the models
are faster thinner too yes two cameras
and it comes in white mark appel start
getting a push higher over the last
couple of days thanks in part to that
announced and plus the fact of course
that Steve Jobs turned up for the event
which took a lot of people by surprise
and made them happy can Apple continue
its success and what should investors
and techies everywhere take from the
apple event this week andy hargreaves is
a senior research analyst at Pacific
Crest securities and jon rettinger is a
blogger with techno Buffalo thank you
both for calling us Andy let me kick off
with you are a great new model thinner
two cameras whereas before there were no
cameras and lots of additional features
nobody seems to be talking about margin
here presumably the Apple two is more
costly to make than the Apple one iPad
does that not pull margins down well
yeah I mean usually with their product
transitions you're going to see a little
blip in margins but they've been better
than anybody at the world at managing
the supply chain from a component cost
perspective and I don't see anything
going on right now especially with their
recent component pre-purchase deals it's
going to change that John a lot of
people credit the bloggers as being as
accurate if not more accurate than the
analysts on Apple where do you see the
stock going you know you were talking
about margins a little lower margin can
certainly be made up with bulk sales
Apple moved 15 million iPads in 2010
steve jobs announced they're speculating
can move as many as 40 million in 2011
so why would that take the stock in your
view certainly up i think would be the
idea logical explanation the market is
very excited for the tablets very tablet
hungry certainly Apple's been a beacon
of innovation in the past the ipad 2 is
dude a bit more evolutionary than
revolutionary but still bringing a lot
of features that people were expecting
and hoping for
I guess the market is is a significant
pun intended core of apple buyers we're
up by whatever the company comes along
with our thing you know there are always
the dedicated Apple fans will go out
there and support the company regardless
but I think what you're going to see is
a huge influx of buyers that we're
waiting for this generation of iPad
those that were waiting for the new one
to come out you here to countless Lee at
apple retail stores you're at it
reported online people want the thinner
people wanted cameras and they were
looking for faster well it's not a
revolutionary design or anything that we
couldn't have predicted the two times
speed increase in the nine times better
graphics pilots potentially are going to
be a big boon to consumers let's get
some awesome Andy on this whole thing
Andy what do you think it's going to be
an apple ipad 2 well you know it's time
i mentioned the white ipad 2 is probably
going to sell a shocking number as well
no just it is why got thought wow what's
this Michigan have white it's not that
well to me but apparently do a lot of
people it is you know I step back again
and always look at the ecosystem
advantage that these guys have and
there's just nobody that can match them
on content and apps and really the
hardware the hardware improvements are
nice they are evolutionary but it's the
it's the software that's the software in
the ecosystem that drive sales and I
don't see anything changing the momentum
that they have why do you think the salt
will go to md we think it goes to 420 in
the next well actually by the end of
2011 and that's based on a multiple that
I think is pretty reasonable considering
the growth rate right now gentlemen
thank you both andy hargreaves and jon
rettinger thank you thank you thanks up</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
