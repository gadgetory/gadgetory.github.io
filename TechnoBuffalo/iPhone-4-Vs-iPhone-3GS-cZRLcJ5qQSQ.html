TechnoBuffalo here and I want to give
you a hectic comparison of the two
current iPhone models the iPhone 3GS and
the just-released
iPhone four eyes are considering whether
or not the upgrades worthwhile or maybe
are waiting in line or maybe you're
thinking about switching over to 18 T
for an iPhone these are the two choices
you're going to have so it's a lot of
things we can cover but today we're
going to cover specs app speed camera
size and a few miscellaneous things so
let's jump right into the specs
price-wise the iPhone 4 is going to set
you back either $1.99 for a 16 gig model
or $2.99 for a 32 gig model the iPhone
3GS now only comes in a gigabyte
configuration for 99 bucks a processor
wise the iPhone 4 uses Apple
system-on-a-chip
a4 processor the same one that's found
in the iPad whereas the iPhone 3GS uses
600 megahertz cortex a8 architecture
chip the same 3.5 inch screens at each
however the iPhone 4 has a resolution of
960 by 640 whereas the iPhone 3GS has
one of 480 by 320 so a huge difference
there that does that screen make a
difference does this new Retina display
the afford about really in reality
affect the way you view things and help
you view things let me go ahead and show
you even by looking at the phones right
now you can probably clearly see a
difference between the two the iPhone 4
just looks sharper let's look at some
simple text first we'll go and open up
notes same things written on each it
just says text and you can see I think
very clearly hopefully that hopefully
this translates the video that the text
is clear the backgrounds are richer and
things you just look a bit easier to
read
however just seeing one word on a notes
application maybe isn't going to be
enough proof for you let's go ahead and
jump into a webpage for example we've
got TechnoBuffalo queued up on each turn
we're going to come back these webpages
to talk about speed a little bit later
let me go ahead and zoom in so you've
got some text right there I'm go ahead
and zoom right in here and then you have
some text right there as well now you
may not be able to see the difference
there on camera or maybe you can but the
Retina display and the new display on
the iPhone things just look crisper and
it's live
easier to view documents I've had much
less eye strain leasing the day that
I've had reading documents on the iPhone
4 so whether or not that's going to sort
of keep true as you use the device more
and maybe we'll get you swings
so get that ice ring it sort of has yet
to be seen but in your viewing pictures
or documents it just looks a little bit
brighter on the iPhone 4 actually I made
a video comparing the two displays the
iPhone 4 and the iPhone 3GS you can
check that out put a link down below in
the sidebar if you want more on the
Retina display let's go ahead and keep
moving along so we got a lot to cover
here let's go ahead and just move on to
camera because there's a lot to discuss
in the camera realm here the iPhone 3GS
has one camera and that camera
resolution it's a 3 megapixel sensor and
it can actually shoot video as well at
30 frames per second and as some basic
video editing built in the camera on the
iPhone 4 is a 5 megapixel camera it can
take 720p video at 30 frames per second
and you can have so the optional iMovie
download edit your video let's go ahead
and see what these cameras look like and
at the end of this video I'm going to
put in some demonstration of the video
and still quality in fact I mean edit in
right now so you can see sort of what
that looks like I'll put in some more at
the end
okay it's not eating the camera quality
let's go ahead and check out the
difference between the camera interfaces
so there's a lot to talk about here in
addition to just the rear facing camera
the iPhone 4 has a front-facing camera
which you can see right next to the
earpiece which shoots at VGA resolution
which you can use for video chat called
FaceTime which we'll talk about a little
bit later let's go ahead and jump right
into the cameras on each so the iPhone 4
you're immediately greeted with a few
other options on you right now have a
flash sexualy has a built-in LED flash
on the back whereas the iPhone 3GS does
not you can serve at just how that flash
works so it's got an auto right there I
can choose to have there have it on or
off also there's a new icon in the upper
left hand corner which will let me
switch cameras to the front facing
camera you can now see me leaning over
the camera which is using the VGA camera
on the front so you do have a few more
often you can see the quality on the
iPhone 4 is definitely much improved
both have tap to focus you can use the
LED flash however on the back of the
iPhone 4 with video or still and
actually have zoom now built into each
for still pictures let's go ahead and
exit out of this so a lot has been made
about the processor in the iPhone 4 is
it really that much faster well let's
check it out
I'm going to go ahead and close all
running application you can see what
this looks like DoubleTap the home
buttons on each close everything up I'm
gonna hold down an icon there's a little
jiggly dance and I can shut it off so
dealing with sort of the same apples to
apples tech test so to speak
screen trying to open up different
different applications here at the same
time and see if we have noticeable speed
difference let's go ahead and try
calendar for example and see how that
affects everything so a little bit
faster on the iPhone 4 I'm going leave
every program that we have open open as
we continue the test so calendar opened
a bit quicker let's go ahead and open up
let's say the App Store so once again
quicker on the iPhone 4 and these are
both using the same Wi-Fi network
tell you so once again things are a bit
quicker let's go ahead and open up let's
say stocks and once again just a little
bit faster on the iPhone 4 I will do one
more program and I will do a quick
browser test let's try and open up maps
for example you can see how quickly it
pulls down our satellite location so it
sort of found the general area where we
are and this is another way if you can
see the difference between the Retina
Display as well you get a lot more crisp
images and less text pixelating on the
iPhone 4 so actually the iPhone looks
like the home picked up about the same
time sort of at the same area I don't
have the exact location baby we're not
outside let me zoom in and show the
speed here the renderings oftentimes
that's a big difference
so panning around there's a bit of a
weight panning around here you get a
little bit farther and the page is sort
of load up a little bit quicker on the
iPhone 4 although admittedly not that
much faster
zooming in zoom in a little bit you can
see how quickly pages render and I
quickly pages render here on the iPhone
3GS and looking at the text tool you can
serve it the more you zoom in you can
see the difference between the Retina
display so we'll go ahead and close this
let's see how fast the webpages load on
each again we're on the same Wi-Fi
network well go ahead and refresh
TechnoBuffalo TechnoBuffalo loading up
on each so then go ahead and stop this
and stop this here and we'll do a
refresh and this page has been loaded on
both so this will be a pretty fair test
to the site that you visit on a regular
basis so I'll go ahead and just hit go
on each at the same time alright and we
are often actually have not tested this
before so this will be sort of new
results to me as well and it looks like
there's a pretty clear advantage there
between the iPhone 4 and the iPhone 3GS
it looks like the iPhone 4 is actually
done and finished a little bit quicker
than the iPhone 3GS so there's another
example of how where the speed comes
into play is anything giant is there a
huge three difference where it's ten
times as fast the simple answer is no
it's not but doing general things is a
bit quicker
there's 512 megabytes or
and double what the 3ds has if you keep
more programs open and running around
going to see a bit of a difference
something to keep in mind there as well
so let's go ahead and talk about size
this is a lot of difference here between
the size as well as the general sort of
designs of the phones so the weight the
new iPhone 4 is 137 grams to grams
heavier and 135 grams 3GS dimensions
we're looking at 115 point two by fifty
eight point six by nine point three
millimeters on the iPhone 4 on the 3GS
115 by 62 point one by twelve point
three millimeters which means the iPhone
4 is about a quarter thinner and that's
sort of hard to see when you look at the
phone side-by-side because the iPhone
3GS sort of tapered edge whereas the
iPhone 4 does not but it definitely is
thinner and the design is really one
spot where I really see a huge
difference between iPhone 3GS and the
iPod for the solid steel bands around
the side of the iPhone 4 which actually
used as antennas as well give the phone
a much higher quality industrial feel
and it feels fantastic in the hand the
iPhone 3GS on the other hand now feels
plasticky and cheap
after having holding the iPhone 4
doesn't have that same sort of durable
feel that the iPhone 4 has so something
to keep in mind as you sort of weigh
your options and try to figure out which
phone is better for you now the big
feature here and one that really sells
the iPhone 4 to me is a front-facing
camera ability to do something called
FaceTime and it again did a video
demonstrating how this works that would
be down below as well
buttface not like to do video chatting
it's real video chatting the quality is
fantastic
it doesn't use your 18 teen minutes or
ever cure you're using actually
transfers to a voice over IP client so
you don't use your man's at all it's a
very seamless transfer from regular call
to FaceTime call unfortunately it is now
just over Wi-Fi only for me to keep in
mind sort of some other specs to keep in
mind the iPhone 4 has 802 11 n so that's
a B G and n whereas the 3GS just has
being G still get fancier data transfers
if you're using
a wireless and network something to keep
in mind the iPhone 4 has an
accelerometer compass and a gyroscope
whereas the 3GS has an accelerometer and
compass now we're not going to see much
use to that until developers put it to
really good use Bethel means you go to
sort of see things moved around in the
three-dimensional access so as opposed
to just accelerometer where it's left
and right playing a game on the iPhone 4
in addition to being able to go left and
right go to go forward and back and go
to sense that movement so let's see how
developers will implement that whether
or not something that's important that's
really sort of the big gist between the
two the cameras and the front-facing
design the LED flash on the back the
better display the FaceTime built-in
software a faster processor there's a
lot to like about the iPhone 4 and
probably the biggest upgrade that we've
seen in the entire history of the iPhone
sort of from the iPhone generation 1 to
the iPhone 3G we saw different design 3G
network the iPhone 3G to 3GS we saw no
different design really just a faster
phone overall from the 3GS to the iPhone
4 but they most things have changed on
it so that's the same iPhone look but
it's got a very different feel to it
something to definitely keep in mind is
worth the upgrade I think it most
certainly is then getting something like
built record HD video replaces a flip
camera or ever other using for portable
video then d5 90 pixel sensor really
takes great pictures now you might be
saying well why is it just five other
phones have eight megapixel sensors well
the quality of the picture isn't just
about the negatives of the camera it's
how the camera handles the image and the
iPhone is a fantastic job of handling
images and you'll see some copies of
stills at the end of this determine
really which one is better for you but
it does handle pictures very well what
it replaced my standalone camera it
might for regular shooting further for
vacations and stuff I still want a
dedicated unit so guys what do you think
about the iPhone 3GS which of the iPhone
4 is worth the upgrade for you are you
upgrading all right around the fatso
waiting to see what comes out next we'd
like to hear what you have to say leave
your comments down below anyway I'm John
