or like stretch pants at Walmart you're
starting to see them everywhere and it's
tough differentiate yourself but the
folks at wall way I think have you
covered here are 5 things to know about
the huawei mate book the mate book is a
12 inch two and one running Windows 10
that feels eerily similar to an iPad pro
looks like one too but it sort of does
like the hybrid of an iPad pro in the
Nexus 6p like they had a weird hybrid OS
lovechild you'll immediately notice the
design features from both of those
devices including the chamfered edges
and a pin dock for the keyboard 12 inch
display is a 2160 by 1440 resolution
which is less than both the surface pro
4 and the iPad pro but it is definitely
enough the screen looks really good the
display is reminiscent of a Samsung
Galaxy Tab with the really slim bezels
in fact the slim bezels allow for 84%
screened to bezel ratio or the surface
pro and the iPad pro hover around 77
this feature I really like I'd like to
see it on more tablets and laptops in
general got a 360 degree fingerprint
sensor it's actually the same one in the
mate 8 takes unlocking your PC from 3 to
4 steps down to just one and it's also
it's also a power button so like most
tablet II things you can get an
available stylus with it and will always
got when they're happy to sell you
called the mate pen this guy go feels
very cheap mostly because it's really
light got a micro USB charging port
hidden but it also features a laser
pointer so come on mess with your dog or
pointed things it's a good option it's
really obvious here the hallway went
extreme the Apple of the design I prefer
the added weight and heft of the Apple
pencil here the pen doesn't work pretty
well
it offers 2048 levels of pressure
sensitivity and it's going to cost you
60 bucks when this thing launches so
pricing this bad boy is kind of all over
the board it starts at 6 99 for the
baseline model it comes with 4 gigs of
RAM and a core m3 chip there's no full
powered 6 gen intel chips here it's all
core and 120 gigs of storage the
keyboard dock and pen have to dish out
an additional $129 $89 and sixty bucks
respectively maxing out the mate book
with a geek ceramic or m7 chip and five
pinch poke gigabytes of solid-state
storage is going to run you if you said
$15.99 you'd be correct but that price
does not include accessories well that's
an extremely full-featured tablets also
not a cheap tablet I wouldn't worry too
much about the EM in the 6 gen chips
here unless you're doing really hardcore
video editing or deeming it or should
perform pretty well for daily tasks
if you want to convert Belinda's fit
almost non-existent into your backpack
look good doing it touchscreen windows
you really should look at the huawei
mate book what I think about the design
you love it you hate it you want to
leave it I would like to hear your
thoughts on it leave your comments down
below and let us know just go ahead and
just go a Mon the thumbs up button we
surely appreciate it until next time
John Ranger from TechnoBuffalo touch
guys next video there's a lot of things
you could do with your mate book one of
those things is collaborate with
coworkers or friends on a new project
all over the world and the folks at
Atlassian have you covered you can
assign track and manage tasks with JIRA
and create and share organize results
with confluence you can chat with each
other say what's up with HipChat you
could test and review and manage code in
real time with bitbucket get Atlassian a
shot try them out go to Atlassian comm
