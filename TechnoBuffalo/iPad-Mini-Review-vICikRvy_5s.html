TechnoBuffalo here is a full review for
you of the iPad Mini you know what it's
got but should it grace your backpack
let's go ahead and put it through its
paces and see if this is worth your hard
earned tablet behind all right so here
is the iPad Mini before we get to the
full on review let me remind you what
this guy's got from the spec department
so pricing is gonna range from 329 all
the way up to 659 depending on whether
or not you want cellular and how many
gigabytes of storage dimensions it is
seven point eight seven inches by five
point three inches by 0.28 in weighs a
very thin 0.68 pounds the screen which
you're going to talk about quite a bit
is a 7.9 inch affair it's LED display
with IPS technology and a resolution you
know it you love it you might hate it of
1024 by 768 that is 163 PPI keeping this
guy burnin is a 16 point 3 watt hour
battery giving you about 10 hours of use
we'll definitely talk about that 1
gigahertz dual-core a5 chips got a 5
megapixel iSight camera 1080p video
recording FaceTime 1.2 and 720p you can
get it on 18 T Verizon or Sprint all
jacked up with LTE alright so we quickly
ran through the specs let's go ahead and
talk about the iPad so before I do all
of my reviews there's been a reason I
waited so long to do this I like to take
all of my preconceived notions and
opinions and keep them off to the side
and try to be as objective as possible I
like to always be honest with my
audience I can't do this video
objectively if I was to do an objective
review the iPad Mini be very different
to the video you are going to see and
I'll tell you why I have irrational love
for the iPad Mini some about it from the
spec standpoint and performance I should
hate it but I absolutely love it I've
actually found that there are four
typical four stages of iPad Mini
ownership first time take it out of the
box you hold it stage one is love I
can't
now then and how light it is then turn
the screen on we should be living in a
retina world with the iPhone 5 or an
iPad 3 or an iPad 4 and then the next
step is Dan that screen resolution sucks
1024 by 768 we start to see pixels that
you didn't see before and then you move
it to stage three acceptance all right
screens bad but it feels so nice in the
hands maybe I can deal with it and then
you go to the last stage which is
finally just love and you start to love
the iPad Mini those are stages that I've
found most people that have used a
Retina display Apple product tend to go
and I went through that same as well the
screen here is not awesome if you
haven't used it Retina display screen
that's gonna look fine to you but it is
not gonna blow you away a text
definitely looks a little bit pixelated
but when you go ahead and watch a video
things to actually look pretty good used
an iPad 2 is going to look pretty
familiar to what the iPad 2 looked like
video not a problem at all it's good
actually gonna look pretty solid
pictures as well also look relatively
decent really timely only going to
notice that low resolution screen is
when you are reading text so bear that
in mind
experience it's been a really enjoyable
experience I always thought with 7-inch
tablets that I liked they existed but I
didn't think that they were for me I
preferred the bigger screen size that we
saw in the larger iPad but the more I
used the iPad Mini the more I found I
liked it I found that it was portable
off take with me everywhere I went I
could fit it in the pocket of a hoodie
and I really liked the size even while
having a new iPad for I haven't used it
at all since the iPad Mini came out this
has been my dedicated iPad take it with
me now almost everywhere I go so I
finally become that guy the experience
has actually been pretty good with it
it's not gonna blow you away in the
specs department or Geekbench scores
which is 762 by the way but if you just
want an iPad 4 you know browsing the web
checking emails the portability of it
I've absolutely loved a lot of questions
about ok it's got a smaller bezel what
happens is when I put my thumb's where
my thumb's going to go and actually it's
not a problem if you put your thumb even
resting right on the screen I actually
will ignore that accidental press you
can still use the tablet as you could
before depending on which time you're
using it's really not going to matter at
all so folks were worried about that
worry No
more battery life apple claims ten hours
they are lying even with brightness at
about 50% I generally get about seven
hours on a good day not going to get the
full 10 hours but the nice thing is it
discharged kind of quickly all of its
brand-new Fingal the Lightning port on
there which is one of the big reasons
that think Apple released an iPad Mini
trying to get lightning on absolutely
everything that they have from a ram
standpoint I've actually experienced
some RAM issues there is a program that
I use called Prezi it's a fancy web
version of PowerPoint trying to open up
a Prezi presentation told me I ran at
around how to close applications so if
you use a lot of RAM intensive things
you may not want to pick up an iPad Mini
I also look past an iPad Mini if you're
really big into gaming I don't do many
graphic intensive games on here really a
bout or two of bad piggies or some
temple run actually my extent of gaming
on the tablet so for me it's been fine
but we do some really graphic intensive
games you might want to look at the
larger third generation iPad or iPad 4
to get that better performance but it's
not here on the iPad Mini so who is this
tablet for if you like to travel quite a
bit you want something light you can
browse the web check emails and do just
regular sort of passive computing the
iPad Mini is going to be great for you
if you want something is going to be
more graphically capable going to be
better for media creation if you want to
edit a lot of videos on using iMovie or
another video program on it pictures are
you're going to want to look past the
iPad Mini I really enjoyed it
I've loved the size I love the
experience of it and I can't put my
finger on it people ask me why I like
the iPad Mini and I can't really tell
them why it's why I serve preface by
saying I have an irrational love for it
objectively though if I was going to
review the iPad Mini I say the specs are
very underwhelming and the screen is
very underwhelming they're probably
better off waiting until the next
generation iPad Mini which Apple
recycles have been very close together
and hopefully we'll get that improved
Retina display if you put a Retina
display on this guy you upgrade the RAM
to you know one gig I think you're gonna
be much happier and probably get an
awesome experience but for now I can't
tell you why I love this
everything about it should say I should
hate it but I do I love that comes with
me everywhere it is my baby so try it in
the store go in put your hands on it see
if you like it don't judge it just
based on the spec sort of a very weird
tablet and listen I admit I know that
it's irrational I know that I shouldn't
love this tablet but I really just doing
I'm being honest with you I could come
on camera and completely lie and try and
appease people you know get called all
kinds of names but Alice opinion is I
really like this tablet and it worked
very well I think is gonna work very
well for you guys as well so keep that
in mind a lot of accessories gonna be
available for it I've got mine covered
in wood a TechnoBuffalo branding our
friends at the toast did that for us so
plenty of ways to protect your iPad
plenty of smart covers and smart cover
knockoffs available I think you're gonna
really enjoy it overall if I was gonna
give this a final ranking it gets an 8.0
lack of RAM and low screen resolution
definitely take some points away I can't
give an editor's choice but I can't give
it a John's choice
so we've recommending a tablet for
anybody or tablet for a gift iPad me top
my listen I'm just not sure why so do
you guys agree disagree in my way off
base am i smoking the Apple pipe I love
to hear what you guys have to say leave
