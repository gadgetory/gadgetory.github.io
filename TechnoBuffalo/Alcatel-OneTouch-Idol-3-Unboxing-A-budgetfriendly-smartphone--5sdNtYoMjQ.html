technobuffalo here and I'm guessing you
can tell we are unboxing today this is
the idol 3 from alcatel this one's got a
lot of unique features especially you
consider its price point of 249 bucks if
you preorder or 279 if you decide to
wait till its release usually with
budget phones you're dealing with
budgets specs but really not so the idol
three you're getting a lot of
awesomeness crammed into its 5.5 inch
frame this original take a look at the
box this is a press box it's not what
it's going to look like unfortunately
when you order it from amazon or pick it
up from the store you've got a
non-functional the kind of cool slide to
unlock let us know that we are unlocked
we will unsheath the beasts that serve
gotta the magnets down below telling us
to unlock the unexpected to assume
they're sort of referencing what you get
for the price so go ahead and open this
up and it's telling us that it's got
dual front-facing speakers featuring JBL
audio unlock bright probably gonna talk
about the screen 5.5 inch Technicolor
color enhanced display I like the phone
already because it's got a Lucy right on
the front of it unlock moments probably
talking about its camera its 13
megapixel camera with sony technology
and they're sitting in the box is the
phone will go ahead and pull that out
just real fast push it off to the side
for one quick second and take a look at
the accessory pouch you're going to live
under here you've got a wall wart with
the USB port we've got a teeny tiny
little thumb drive i think it's probably
the press kit so you will not get this
in your box but there's got to be like
the world's smallest swivel ii thumb
drive that is inside of it you've got a
micro USB charging port i hear the
headphones they've got some different
sized ear gels in case you have large or
small ears and much like the speakers
these are JBL branded headphones so
probably my short you're going to get
with a typical phone and that friends is
all we're going to have inside the box
so let's fold this sucker up take a look
at the phone here is the idol 3 all
dolled up with stickers first day I got
a deal let's peel these suckers off
alright so now that i have d ugly it
with stickers it still got some room in
it's stuck on there but here is the
phone and nothing about this phone serve
makes it feel like a lower-priced phone
you've got nice materials here it is
plastic but the battery behind it does
sit flush it and let me sort of give
that as you push it around let's go
ahead and power this sucker on power
buttons going to live on the left side
the first thing you'll notice is that
it's got front-facing speakers which
will supposedly simulate surround sound
which is quite nice on left hand side
you've got your power button and I
assume that is either the simrekt OST
tray on the right-hand side that you've
got your volume up and down top 25
millimeter headset jack microphone and
the bottom is your charging and also
microphone aight see you are looking at
a 5.5 inch 1920 x 1080 p screens got a
401 ppi so no 720 to be had here keeping
it humming along in the Snapdragon 615
chip which is quad-core that's got
chickens Aram you're looking at android
belief 5.9 point 2 16 gigs of internal
storage but you can expand that to via
microsd up to 128 really nice camera on
the back alcatel didn't skimp you've got
a 13 megapixel camera and they also
didn't skip on the front I've got an 8
megapixel which is much higher than
usually we see on even some flagships on
the front keeping this guy running
hopefully all day is just about a 3,000
milliamp hour battery a lot of people
always curious take a look at some of
wallpapers are going to give us also go
ahead and jump into that I always get
questions at what kind of wallpaper
you're gonna be built in so you can see
what those are right here I've got some
Google ones and some alcatel ones so all
the specs aside this phone is one killer
feature that I've never seen before on
the phone let's say you're out and about
you've got your phone on a table and you
want to pick it up you just grab real
fast usually getting pick it up like
this bring it up to your ear but
sometimes you pick it up upside down you
can hope this phone anyway you want and
you be able to make a phone call as long
as the screen is facing your ear so
upside down right side up it's not going
to matter you can take advantage of the
speaker microphone set up on the top and
bottom and answer and make phone calls
either way so really cool at all cartel
has done that something I've never seen
before on any other
phone I think you guys for watching hope
