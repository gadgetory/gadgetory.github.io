Hazleton from technobuffalo i'm here
with Lenovo checking out the brand new
yoga 3 pro sir new core m based laptop
super thin and light here you can see
I'm holding it with one hand you'll
notice right away that there's a brand
new redesigned hinge which bends fully
360 degrees I'll try to do it with one
hand here you can see relay and flat and
it's super super thin super light it's
running Windows 8.1 right now and you're
looking at a 3200 x 1800 pixel display
super sharp of course that's Windows 8.1
you can jump the desktop really quick
like I said core em under the hood
you've got Intel HD graphics eight gigs
of RAM up to 256 or 512 gigabytes of
storage rather with an SSD integrated
speakers here from JBL audio those are
on the bottom just pick it up real quick
you can see just how light it is and
then moving around I've got the power
controls a volume button and a USB port
on the right and then on the left you've
got another USB port HDMI out an SD card
slot and then what's really cool is the
power cable actually uses a form of USB
so it plugs in and can charge but when
you're not charging you also can take
advantage of that as a third USB port
real quick here it's 1.19 kilograms and
measures 320 x 220 eight by twelve point
eight millimeters so just twelve point
eight millimeters thick i'll just bend
this town well you can see how super
thin it is and it's really really light
pretty amazing considering everything
under the hood and how powerful it is
and you've got that amazingly sharp
display so look for this in time for the
holiday season that's just a quick look
