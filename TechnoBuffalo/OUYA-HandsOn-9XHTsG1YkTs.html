checking out the Ouya updates there was
a big software update last week we
actually had a video ready for you but
then changed the game and they changed a
little bit of what you see on your
screen so I'm going to take you through
the new software update which went from
one point zero point four to one point
zero point five let's take a look here
it is this is the interface we're used
to this screen right here but before if
you click on play you get this sort of
two row list of games and this is what
your discover tab also looked like you
were you couldn't really see a lot of
things at once and it was sort of
difficult to discover games and and find
things if you wanted to but if we go to
the discover tab now we have this
beautiful section of games for us to
choose from so we have featured we have
VIP room only on oh yeah so we have some
exclusives here we have showcase game
dev Brian Fargo's playlist so this is
kind of cool there they're asking game
devs to make and curate lists of their
favorite via games also founding fathers
so people who have been with us since
the beginning showcase couch gaming with
friends so these are games you can play
with your friends which is kind of fun
and trending now genres and sand box so
you can see there's some emulators in
here which is really exciting and also
of course your standard genre list one
of the things that I did not care for in
the previous software build was that
when you went to download a game it
would give you no indication as to the
progress of that download unless you
stayed on the screen the entire time so
now if you choose to we can go to
Saturday morning RPG and if we want to
download it we can click on download and
we have this sort of progress bar
underneath the word downloading but if
we go back to our main discovery page
you can now see that Saturday morning
RPG is grayed out a little bit and you
have a progress bar on top of the game
so you can continue to browse and
download more games and know what the
status is
of the games that you're currently
downloading so that's a really nice
little update there something small but
something that I felt was sort of
important the make tab looks pretty much
the same build software and news so your
basic developer options you can also
manage your notifications the network
you can pair controllers you can look at
your account here's the account window
you have your name and email your
payment info and you can also log out so
if you are loaning out your Ouya to
somebody you don't want them buying
games once once paid games go live you
can do that you can log out here's the
system information so the console info
you can see we now have the software
version 1.0 point 5 second line to the
bottom there and beyond that we can
check for system updates we're totally
updated so it's going to tell us that
and if we want to go to advanced will
actually get our Android because leah is
built on the Android platform will get
our Android settings menu so I'm going
to just show you guys really quickly it
is in fact running jellybean so if you
go to about console you can see it is
running Android 4.1 point2 so we are we
are in the money on this honestly it's a
really good update in terms of game
discovery and obviously that's the
number one thing you want to have on the
es the ability to find great games and
there are a lot of developers that I
didn't even realize made games for oh
yeah that I'm now able to find on the
system so always a good thing when you
can find more games than you can play at
any given time I'm really excited about
seeing the emulators kind of come to
life and get populated especially the
NES and the Neo Geo so that should be
really cool and here's one of the genres
so if we wanted to see arcade and
pinball games we have this lovely
populated list and much better much much
better from what we had last week and
I'm much happier to show you this
version of the Ouya software as opposed
to last week's version because it was a
little sparse and a little bit
depressing but lots of promise here with
the Ouya and we're excited to give it a
spin when it officially launches later
this month I will be in retail stores
across the country and also available
online to anybody who was not a
kickstarter backer but that's the ues
software update 1.0 point five see you
guys next time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
