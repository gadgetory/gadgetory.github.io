coming days I'm going to be doing a ton
of storm 2 coverage each one of those
videos is gonna have something to do
with the sure press screen thought
before I got into a series of videos
where I explain the keyboard compare it
to other devices and show the browsing
thought it'd be important to talk about
the technology behind the storm to
screen and give a demonstration on how
it works and compare it to last gens
storm one so backing up to the storm 1
the sure pressed technology was
definitely an infancy with this device
there's one sensor in the middle as
we've seen on tear downs of the device
so anywhere you pushed on the screen you
were still just hitting that one sensor
so whether you're hitting the middle
right where the sensor is it was pretty
accurate but if you're going into the
bottom left corner or the bottom right
sometimes clicks wouldn't be registered
or they would be extremely inaccurate if
they were another problem with this sort
of implementation of technology was
there was a lot of time to wait for the
screen to pop back up which he knows if
you're ascending a long text or email if
those do that use the storm 1 you're
definitely familiar with this so let's
think about it the storm ones technology
let's call the sensors the stack of
quarters
and we'll use a MiFi device for an
example of the screen so if I stack this
right on top I'll move it a little bit
in frame if I'm pushing the bottom left
or the bottom right it's still just
acting on that one sensor so if I push
in the middle you know then it's gonna
be a little bit more accurate but
there's a lot of time for it to go back
down and come back up
like there was on the blackberry one now
on the storm 2 they actually are for
sensor to take advantage of a technology
called PSO technology which I'm not
going to get too into right now but I'll
explain a little bit it's got four
sensors one in each corner so I put the
MiFi on top of it anywhere that I wanted
to push there'd be a sensor so I'd have
a lot of increased accuracy it certainly
you're not seeing this click but
hopefully this illustrates the point
so a couple of cool things about the
share press technology found on the
storm 2 and taking advantage of that
piece of technology when there isn't any
power running through the device
particularly powered running to the
screen I can't push it so let me go
ahead and lock it and I'll give you a
demonstration so right now the screen
has been locked I cannot push it at all
it feels like I'm tapping a capacitive
touchscreen like on the iPhone or the g1
and you can see it's not budging at all
but as soon as power comes to the screen
suddenly I can click away and I'm
getting just a much higher degree of
accuracy with this implementation of the
technology so this actually is very cool
for a few reasons first when you had the
storm one in your pocket over time get a
lot of dust that would collect sort of
in the creases along the device and that
dust would add up and add up and add up
and eventually you couldn't push the
screen that was the case with a lot of
people with the storm - you don't really
get that border along the edge the whole
screen almost appears flush there's a
little bit of an edging but not much at
all and when it's in your pocket the
screen is not going to be pushed in so
you're not going to get that dust that's
going to come in the four sensors and
the PSO technology really make for a
much more accurate experience with the
storm - and as you'll see in upcoming
videos demonstrating how the keyboard
works I think is the prime example of
how the storm 2 is just worlds above and
world's better than the storm 1 so guys
