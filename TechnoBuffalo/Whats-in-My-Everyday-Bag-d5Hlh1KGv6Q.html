here from TechnoBuffalo
and today I want to walk you guys
through what's in my bag my bag that I
take and carry with me seven days a week
and what is in it the actual bag that
I'm using is the icon backpack from in
case it's big enough to store a 15-inch
MacBook Pro which I'll get to in a
second it's fantastic in its navy blue
color I'm a big fan of the way it looks
and feels just overall an awesome bag
next we have the big guns of the bag my
15-inch MacBook Pro this is nearly SPECT
up to the top only things I skipped on
with a processor and I did not upgrade
to the one terabyte hard drive that
being said it's very fast gets the job
done very very fluid I've had very few
problems with it
to accompany my macbook pro I use this
250 gigabyte SSD the Samsung t3 which is
very fast really superb to work off of
next we have the phone that I'm using
day to day it's the Nexus 6p not much
here great phone really liked it I also
keep with me an external battery pack of
varying sizes just depending on how long
I'm going to be gone for if it's a
day-to-day thing it's usually a smaller
pack if it's a longer trip I carry
around a bigger pack other items include
a moleskin notebook just for writing and
taking notes is pretty basic nothing too
crazy next we have the physical book
that I'm reading the reason it's an
physical copy and not on a Kindle is
because I like my art books my
photography books to be in physical form
just because I like the way the print
looks and feels and I think you get a
better vibe for the book itself rather
than just staring at a screen for all my
other books that are not art or
photography books that I don't need an
physical copy I keep on my Kindle I also
tend to carry around a pair of
headphones with me sometimes they're a
little fancier sometimes they're just
pair of ear pods depending on how much
space I really have in the bag and
that's really what you're going to be
finding in my bag on a day-to-day basis
along with a couple other knickknacks
like chewing gum chapstick hand
sanitizer and that kind of stuff my bag
does change however if I go camping or
if I'm only going to be doing some
document text work legal work whatever
it might be or from just doing a video
trip strictly so my camera bag is a
little bit different let me know if you
guys want to see those bags as well
maybe we can turn this into a little
Series in the future leave me comment
down below with what you think give us a
thumbs up if you like this video we
appreciate the support so thank you so
much for watching and I'll see you guys
the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
