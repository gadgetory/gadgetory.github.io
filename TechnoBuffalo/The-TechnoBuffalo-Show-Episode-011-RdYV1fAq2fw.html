the TechnoBuffalo show online you're two
hosts for do today Sean ani
editor-in-chief of the TechnoBuffalo and
i'm joined by executive editor of mobile
Todd Hazleton everybody joey is not with
us this week because he is currently
trying to sell his house and there is a
house showing going on right now and
he's in a starbucks so i don't want to
spend his entire morning going shut up
i'm on a podcast i think a little bit
funny it would've been funny but
probably we've gone through an asteroid
ikea uh i think even starbucks as a
level of okay sir you know I sleep when
they're with full computers I think a
microphone I look natural have you
you've seen someone in there with a
desktop yeah well it was us when I was
at laptop magazine used to do funny
stuff like that for like pictures and
you know like how far is too far you're
using a computer in public and then he
would like take a picture for the
magazine but I've seen people with
full-size martyrs and stuff oh that's
that's amazing ah so a couple different
topics we want to go over today the
first one is of course the big news of
the week the microsoft surface pro 3 and
tons as you were there a person you
you've touched and held a surface pro
you know was it as exciting as they were
making it up to be on stage i mean i
think it was really exciting in a really
nice product like don't get me wrong on
all that i think it's the best surface
I've seen Microsoft make yet and that's
saying a lot fun it's the same recipe
that they dawn will pass two iterations
and I don't see anything really changing
here where consumers may be like oh now
i need a surface like it's still
expensive at seven ninety-nine with core
i3 and no keyboard that's another one
hundred thirty dollars and like i said
in an editorial yesterday now you're in
macbook air range which microsoft
clearly i mean they want to go on
against the macbook air but i don't
think you're doing it right like this is
it's a tablet with a keyboard it's not a
laptop and that's what what they're
trying to say that it is a laptop look
like me i want
laptop it's like rigid and I and I have
it with the keyboard it's a really
sturdy on my lap and Microsoft's trying
to say this is with the view maggots and
stuff but it's still not even close and
then and then it's like a 12 inch tablet
which is too big for me and they said
ninety-six percent of people with an
iPad also have a laptop and it's for
that reason I want my ipad mini and my
macbook or whatever mm-hmm I don't want
like the combo and I don't think
consumers in general do mean let's just
sales have proven that so well hey there
is a surface man well you know and you
were you said it's a a tablet with a
keyboard but I think we also need to
point out that it's the tablet is sold
separately for 129 99 akhil back yeah so
that's a price you're paying on top of
the surface just going to drive that
price even higher now I I do what I
tease this yesterday on Twitter I I have
to debut my a new word first there were
phablets would you get home tablet this
is al applet the laptop tablet I know
it's exciting I might hold your applause
everyone la they kept saying it in the
lap ability ability that sounds like
like a dog lapping up water or something
I apparently that's my puppy Thomas who
is possibly the loudest drinking dog
I've ever met but his lap ability factor
is way up there huge but that's the
whole point and the fact is yes they oh
well we start the price at seven ninety
nine and seven ninety-nine for a core i3
with only 64 gigabytes of memory yeah
exactly and I have said that yesterday
core i3 is not that powerful and even
Intel builders like this entry level
processor in the core family below core
i5 and core i7 that's made for web
browsing and word processing and stuff
like that I Ron core i3 on my desktop it
is not not powerful I have a really nice
graphics card for gaming and that helps
a little bit but that's about it like I
really can't do much and and I think
most people will find that at core i3 is
not they're doing much put it eight
hundred dollars where you can get
keyboard I don't think I think it's way
overpriced and I think that will see
that Microsoft sales and surface have
haven't been doing well and I think
it'll continue that way which is weird I
can any weather going down this path
again exactly and I mean we have to
remember that two years ago they lost 1
billion dollars if they took a 1 billion
right off on the original surface don't
have the final numbers for the surface
too although we know they were not good
we know they took a loss at what point
does Microsoft say okay this isn't
working yeah and maybe they never do
maybe they think this is the future and
there is gonna keep pushing it but I
think I would have liked to have seen
Microsoft look if they know that people
have tablets and computers why not
create a product that fits the tablet
category and and that could have been
the surface mini and I don't think look
rumors were it was going to have a fall
compras certain windows RT I don't think
that was a right path to go either
because Windows RT i think is a terrible
experience I don't think there's enough
apps etc but I think it could have tried
to do something pro maybe put a core i3
one of the smaller ones or any Intel
Atom processors say price it right maybe
just above kindle put it in the 200
allah range three hundred dollar range
then microsoft has this mass consumer
tablet that people aren't going to be
afraid to buy as it's cheap they'll
finally get an experience with Windows
that they haven't been using if you
before and maybe it's this complementary
system that can be used with your kool
Windows 8 PC I think that's the way it
should've won instead of this hybrid
product well you kind of answered
without me putting the question up there
yet but David kerkovich was asking what
does Microsoft need to do to make the
surface successful and I I think you
everything I agree with everything you
said Todd it's I can't understand why
Microsoft can't seem to grasp you know I
like you said with a laptop you know I
want stability and I don't care what
they say about magnets or anything else
that thin little keyboard is never going
to give me the stability where I feel
comfortable working with that thing in
my lap yeah you know if you watch during
the demonstra
yesterday at least on the livestream I'm
sure we had a better view than you did
you could tell he was so nervous about
how he was sitting know her that that
thing did not fall off his lap yeah it's
just weird I mean why do you have to
worry about a kickstand and I know that
look they need the kickstand for when
it's in tablet mode but why worry about
this kickstand and the keyboard and you
have to get the bend the keyboard up so
the magnets it you know just below the
displaced a lot of work right and and
when I have a macbook I just or whatever
any kind of life that just open it up
you start working then you close it and
on the subway home I reach in my bag and
I pull out my iPad and it's small and
portable it's not this 12-inch thing on
my lap and I think that's why people
have two devices and I understand by
Microsoft is fighting so hard to make us
have this combo tonight I don't get it
either I don't give a like I don't think
ence Microsoft I think people like this
is just my opinion and I'm not saying an
ego yeah people were gonna like it sure
well you know I sleep and I I want to
make that clear as well I mean I
honestly right now in front of me I'm
not going to hold it up since this is
also mainly an audio podcast I i use a
Microsoft natural keyboard I use a
microsoft mouse I own every iteration of
the xbox I this is not a hatred of
Microsoft this is just a question of
what the heck they're doing yeah you
know and we are going to review the
surface pro 3 and it's not going to be
toddler myself it's should be arriving
out in the urban offices today and I
believe Brandon and jon rettinger will
be handling the review on that device
but you know so please don't take
anything that Todd and I are saying
today is we've already determined hey
and locally I'm talking about Microsoft
strategy doesn't mean yeah I'm not
saying the product itself is bad mmm
maybe it's great i used it for briefly
before i put it in mail John I just
think the strategy yeah dominique weber
was asking if we did get a surface at
the event we did we immediately
rupted in a box and overnighted it to
John an Irvine so John will be filming
videos with it I believe today doing
hands-on and all that so yes we do have
a surface in our possession and it will
be showing up on the site shortly and
then probably late next week we'll get
to the review because like unlike other
sites that believe in a 24-hour review
period we actually like to use products
are a few days yeah and so everybody
knows it so we got a core i5 version
which is mid-range cool so that's what
okay I didn't know which version we'd
yeah I it's actually funny they gave us
the devices they just handed us the
tablet and the stylus and the keyboard
he's handed it to us right and then on
the way out you got the box and the
charger so you had to like sign yeah
they gave us that at the end did you
have to sign the loan agreement I guess
that's how they were managing it and
then I checked them so i was able to
check the box on the way out that's very
solid are you dead but here's my
question why not just had you a boxed
product yeah with like this jeans and
stuff right there i don't know maybe
they didn't want like boxes floating all
over there I can't believe that when you
told me that that they handed you this
thing at pieces is like you hear me I
pay the labor to assemble this package
for yeah it's kind of fun we'll just and
aegean parts and yeah so do it yourself
DIY surface attach the keyboard well you
know I and you brought this up a little
bit already I thought it was so odd that
they decided to you know they brought
out that scale and all that and they
made a big show about let's weigh it
against the macbook air at the core
these are two very very different
products this was literally comparing
apples and oranges us yeah it would have
made a lot more sense to me if they had
brought out an iPad yes I understand
they were trying to say well this is a
laptop replacement all right fight
weight against a macbook air then weigh
it against an eye
had as well show us both because you're
trying to say that this replaces both
stacked both of the ipad and the hair on
one side and then stack the surface yeah
good point just weighing the surface
against the macbook air of me no sense
yeah and I I think I know what they were
trying to say to like it's the thinnest
core product then it's probably you
could buy with an intel core processor
which is me and it's really nice and
really high quality the building stuff
just I don't know I don't wives
comparing it to apple I thing and you
know people are going to do that now and
they're going to see that you know first
single price you can get a macbook air
configure it in such a such way I think
at both the high ends with core i7 the
macbook air is still like 200 bucks
cheaper so always that like speaking of
medical care you know since this is what
Microsoft decided to take on yesterday
you know now we're hearing rumors that
we are going to see the new macbook airs
at WWDC do you think it's just going to
be the addition of a display or that
seems cool it's a 9to5 mac today said
that there's going to be you hardware at
the show and I don't know Apple has
promised us new product category this
year and a lot of people have been
sitting around waiting saying hey this
is gonna happen and we're kind of
waiting on an Apple TV refresh may be
waiting on an iWatch what you got a
number of things but it sounds like
macbook air with retina display seems
the most likely their apples going to be
talking about OS x 10 10 might as well
introducing with a new laptop tight so
macbook air retina display that would be
sweet I hope I mean price is going to go
up and I think right now that 799 is
pretty sweet a lot of consumers bolt
yeah yeah the UH you know I am a little
concerned about Apple though while we're
here you know Tim Cook has gone on
record vehemently saying that you know
Apple had all these amazing new product
signed up for 2014 and he specifically
said plural new categories and here we
are going into June and nothing yeah I
mean me we're waiting
oh yeah yeah I mean all right all right
is he seriously going to release
everything pre-christmas I don't know
wouldn't that be crazy let's talk about
killer quarter well it'd be a killer
quarter but it would also be
cannibalizing his own products because
if you release everything at the same
time because remember at one time we had
figured out a that they were working on
a quarterly system and they seem to have
abandoned that they were trying to
released one major product every quarter
said that they always had a flagship
product for each quarter to help with
their revenues they seem to have abandon
that and gone almost to this let's put
all our eggs in the fourth quarter
basket yeah it's starting to seem like
right you said I don't remember last
year but yeah I mean I think there's
going to be a lot of disappointment if
wewt comes and goes if there's just
software clock I think a lot of people
really want to see something new and
tangible come out of Apple well do you
think it's III think this may be part of
the problem is that when they had the
ipad and the iphone out of sync that
always meant one of them was behind on
iOS yeah and like in features right like
we have the iphone 5s now with the
fingerprint reader touch ID and we don't
have yet on the back that's tough yeah
so they were even more out of sync
though and the problem is now that
they've tried to make this this family
look to all of them if they released an
iPad before the iphone that would give
us a hint to the next iphone right so
they kind of painted themselves into a
corner and that they had to put the
those products together but you know
we've been hearing all the rumors about
the Apple TV we've been hearing all the
rumors about the iWatch forever you know
you hear rumors about the apple
television set by ain't at this point
i-i've almost given up on that one but
the the iWatch is I mean they've hired
too many people in that sector for that
not to be a real product and you have to
wonder when it's coming
yeah I know and like I said before it
seems like wwc would make sense because
they have all the developers in the room
they have all these workshops I was
going over the schedule all these
workshops throughout the week where and
right now it's sort of just less like we
can't tell you yet and follow-up are the
names for each workshop and you know I
think those would be perfect times you
get developers right there figuring out
how to create stuff for the eyewash so
they want you to sign up for these
workshops but you don't know well like I
have the schedule right here it's funny
it has great up real quick because this
morning this app was updated that's
where we saw that the keynote takes off
in am on to second so you have stuff
like tuesday at 9am called this one is
sealed where she can't tell you yet or
it's under wraps to be announced and
announced still our secret that's
Wednesday at ten-fifteen you'll find out
in a few days it's still confidential
we're not telling so it's all like these
different names for the events during ww
see because obviously it's gonna be good
all that's awesome me yeah that's how I
want to schedule my trip yeah I don't
even know when I'm participating I am
milk oh yeah wait why is tim cook on
stage with crochet needles what's going
on I mean with with a full revamp look
in OS 10 and you know it is expected or
whatever then maybe a part of it has to
do with bad in hand getting actual
desktop apps to look familiar I don't
know so there's going to be a lot of
reasons why their sessions in our game
but maybe some could do with the iWatch
were developing for Apple TV stuff like
that speaking of Apple secrecy since you
brought up what those sessions are
called Dominique webber asks i know this
is highly unlikely but how clever would
it be if Apple pushed the dummy units
out there to get a reaction before the
official launch this if you could alter
but this is actually the theory that
kind of started last year with the 5s
and 5c leaks
they were everywhere they were
everywhere and there are times where you
kinda have to wonder because I we know
for a fact that some companies and we
won't say who have done controlled leaks
in the past mm-hmm now Apple when you
think of Apple you don't think oh they
have to drum up you know coverage and
everything else but you do have to
wonder sometimes if a they're trying to
get feedback on what they're doing be
potential misdirection that one would be
difficult but this one almost feels like
a misdirection you think you think
they're purposely like like 47 then are
no it's weird how would I can't tell i
was like maybe what if somebody just
like me these schematics and i sent them
out there then everybody is building off
it I don't know though that's exactly
because all these dummy units are built
off of those schematics and we still
don't know the provenance of those
schematics yeah be really funny I mean
Apple right now I mean Tim Cook maybe in
his office just cackling yeah remember
when the company case made and I think a
few others but they had all these cases
that they look like closing on their
site and stuff the teardrop yeah and
like those were based off of schematics
two and those were wrong so it's
happened before it just seems like this
time the free detailed yeah I know and
looks about right it looks about right
you know but there's still a part of me
and maybe it's a hopeful part of me that
would like to still be surprised but I
in my gut I feel this really is the
iphone 6 but at the same time i try to
be at least a little bit skeptical yeah
everything comes from these schematics
that we cannot prove where they came
from yeah exactly let me we should
always be skippin yeah I we always have
to be skeptical in this game I mean we
got sent a link to something yesterday
that Todd I Damon share it with you
I was like I was like yeah no homo SAP
now not real something funny yeah it was
one of those ones were you looking like
mm-hmm that's not right yeah contrary to
popular belief we do actually no try to
determine what's real what's not and
there there are there are times where
some come through the drill like wow no
yeah for those that joined light I see
rockster 103 asses joey is working today
but unfortunately is working from a
starbucks because there is a real estate
agent currently in his house showing his
house and so that's why he's not on the
show he could not podcast from starbucks
he will be back though now i wanted to i
want to talk about this one topic it's
outside of our normal field on the show
the idea that Google wants to run
advertising on the nest thermostats
crazy I wow so like but this like this
this article came from a wall street
journal today it's talking about Google
they're writing to the SEC I guess right
I think that's it was um and saying like
look we want to put that or there's a
possibility that you're going to end up
on wearables bars on thermostats and the
funny thing is I think this is before
they bought yes right absolutely well
okay now here here's my I've got a
couple main questions here just because
well first off because they said you
know maybe thermostats doesn't mean
they're necessarily gonna do it right I
want to know though who would purchase
that advertising space because how many
times a week do you actually look at
your thermostat yeah and all right but
who knows maybe maybe it's like her a
competing power company or something not
usually live in areas if you have to but
yeah I only have one option here
so I think I think yeah I think the
general idea is that look there's going
to be screens everywhere and we can make
money off that now I mean I could see
kids there are some refrigerators with
screens and I'm advertising there makes
sense to me yeah that does make sense I
mean especially if it's a grocery store
saying what's on sale exactly yope show
me you know the the late the weekly
flyer for you know the specials at the
safeway for the week I I think that's a
great idea yeah and as we have smart
frigerators you know it might know
what's running low maybe you're running
low on Pepsi it's like kept cheese on
sale might as well pick some up now
exactly that kind of stuff that one
would make a lot of sense to me and I
actually don't think I would find it
that offensive yeah when you're like oh
okay you see it's kind of a win-win
situation you know it's kind of like I I
see a lot of people saying you know I
don't want to ever buy a kindle with
special deals on it yeah I every kindle
device i bought is with special deals i
gotta tell you they are the most
unobtrusive things in the world are the
good deals i've never really pay
attention to them they never seem to be
with you yeah when the Kendall's first
lunch with special deals they were I
mean it would be like get a ten dollar
amazon gift card for five dollars but
now it's a lot of like yo saved their
descends on downey yeah but but you know
there are places where I don't find our
advertising offensive and I would not
find advertising offensive on an LCD
screen in my refrigerator on my
thermostat I would just question who
thought it was a good idea to buy that
advertising space yeah right well yeah I
know well if it's like sitting on your
wall and glowing like oh jeez oh now I I
will admit my thermostat is behind a
swinging door so I don't see my
thermostat except for when I'm cleaning
the dust bunnies that I've collected
behind the door yeah see I don't even
have a thermostat as we go unit in my
windows are building nah I'm
the joys of apartment living yeah uh
like I say that like I've ever lived in
an apartment I actually have never lived
in an apartment oh yeah it's not it's
not really I take that back i lived in
an apartment all of six months old but
no memories of it not really had a
choice in you yeah exactly you mean you
can't just buy a house no you could you
buy a brownstone group 10 million
dollars Oh with what John pays us by
doable why not uh well Before we jump
into general questions here let me see
if we've got anything that is well here
is one from rockster 103 how accurate do
you think the dummy units at the apple
iphone 6 are to the real one we and we
already kind of answered that I and I
really do feel it's the real thing
there's a lot of me though that I just I
wish it wasn't the real thing because I
miss being surprised yeah me too and
part of me feels like it's kind of ugly
and not up to Johnny high standards
that's what I've got a like and can't
tell you like the antenna bands running
around really the antenna bands they are
the key reason that I still question it
yeah it just doesn't look like something
he'd let slide so maybe there's another
way that you know we're not seeing this
in the schematics that that's for the
cover girl and you know the schematics
aren't built with aluminum and the real
materials at Apple's using so you see I
have no problem with all of us as being
unapologetically plastic but I do have a
problem Jenna be unapologetically giant
into Ben's that was my really bad Johnny
I've impersonations please do not throw
tomatoes apologetically antennas uh-oh
let's see here a job we got one from
going into general questions we got one
here from Rockstar 103 and this is one I
you and I really haven't had a chance to
discuss you know what are your thoughts
on the HTC One Prime in the Samsung s5
prime um look I don't really like the
way that these products kind of come out
after the fact like I think Samsung fans
and smartphone enthusiasts are going out
and buying these products that they
think are the best and they're going to
be the best for a while and for a
company like Samsung to come around and
say hey actually that's not the best
this is it's kind of rude and mean to
consumers so I think if there really is
a samsung s5 Prime and that's the way
they market it then they should have
just made that the galaxy massage that's
my no I I totally agree with you it's
cell phone enthusiasts are you know it's
not like we can just okay well i just
got the s5 but oh no the s5 prime is
here i'm sorry you can't just swap
phones when you're a general consumer
it's just not possible yeah and so I
can't quite figure out what the
marketing plan is behind these companies
doing this you know why not release the
s5 and the s5 Prime at the same time
yeah you know the s5 becomes a slightly
budget II phone and I say that by likes
you know it's $52 love us in the prime
you know and that would actually drive I
think drive sales harder for the prime
yeah people can make their own choice
the thing with these I'll see one prime
I talked to Jason Mackenzie US president
of HTC and he kind of mocked like look
what you're not going to see a one hand
made Prime in the sense that there's not
going to be this better version of that
form and what the HTC one problem it
seems like that's going to be either the
max 2 or yesterday and gadget had a
picture of the One m8 and reference that
that might be the Prime and that's the
one mA it's the plastic body to the
metal in which case you know it's not
like there
creating something and making any better
they actually the screws yeah I from the
pictures we've seen of the m8 Prime it
doesn't feel like it's a better phone it
but the s5 Prime does look like yeah
like it's going to be more premium
mm-hmm and sort of problem so yeah I
mean with with HTC One I we need to see
the specs before we you know say what
are you doing because it may just be a
naming issue but with the s5 Prime
everything we're seeing it really does
feel like it's a better version of the
s5 yeah but maybe you know maybe comes
out it's like super expensive and
limited like a couple markets and then
okay that's not that big either but if
it comes out and it's sold on every
carrier as like this better version of
yes by this time now i agree to it they
need to do something so your average
customer do just by an S 5 doesn't feel
like they've made a mistake yeah exactly
otherwise why should they buy your next
phone yeah exactly exactly another
question from Rockstar 103 do you think
Google glass might become a mainstream
product in the future nope yeah no I
think so really i don't know if it's
going to be popular but that's google's
plan is to bring it well no yes it will
definitely it'll come to consumer
markets I don't think we'll ever see a
day though where you're walking down the
street and ill everybody he's not
wearing Google glass haha yes actually
not in its current form right but maybe
if it's like well they could make it
that'll be more fun and they actually
just tired Ivy Ross was a Ivy Ross she
was an executive at we bring up we had
an article longer well I'm gonna say if
they can make it look like the range
finders from dragon ball z I might be
more on board and I tell me everyone's
power levels I looked at them she was
brought on to lead a google glass and
she's
former chief marketing officer artcom
but she also worked at and this is this
is a sign that we're going to go
mainstream because of google why we're
did old navy the disney store coach gap
Mattel and even bosch and lomb the eye
health company contact solution stuff
like that so I think look you get
somebody with that kind of experience on
board it seems pretty clear that who
you're targeting right letting this
person will for cavities Oscars well I
part of what i think is going to happen
I I almost think that some point it's
kind of go the way of the segway and
that you know you go to airports nisi
segways everywhere we haven't cops have
them on their signals hey I could be
cops real I emergency responders I could
see them very easily just taking the
glass like crazy um I read a story oh I
don't remember it was a few months ago
about a fireman who actually worked on a
glass app that allowed his fire
department to they could wear the glass
under their their masks and they could
pull up blueprints for buildings from
the city on the glass when they were
going off that's awesome brilliant
absolutely brilliant I think that's the
sort of situation that glass is
absolutely perfect for and so I don't
were like showing like oxygen holes oh
yeah there's all sorts of uses for an
emergency when when your hands have to
be free this is perfect yeah but for
your average consumer I just I don't
know if they're gonna take to it yeah
I'm curious too yeah but I mean I mean
weren't google last for like a couple
minutes yeah yeah my grandfather was a
fire captain in Phoenix in the 70s and a
oh I i I'm somewhat familiar with fire
procedures and I can I can think of an
endless stream of uses for fire
departments you know cops you know
somebody says their name to you and you
could pull up their arrest record or
their warrants
yeah you know it could be amazing so
glass is going to be around for a long
time I just don't know how deep it's
going to get into the the general public
that's where I I wonder yeah uh the this
just makes me scratch my head ah firm
vassal Stefan off would you buy a smart
couch if someone makes it what would be
more cash I I that's more I I'm just
kind of trying to how would you make a
couch smart I don't know this one it is
sure I better not a room couch map mode
yeah couch turn on the TV no because you
can already do that with your xbox right
exactly oh my ah let's see here uh from
David Nunez true false the z1 compact
comes to the United States mike geary
bike Barry gets bought out this year
Apple goes back to their One flagship
phone model and kills iphone see line
technoboy will hire simply and in kb HD
with had one hears time wow great man
see you want a compact i don't think
there's any us plans blackberry gets
bought don't see it happening this year
apple goes back to the one flagship
phone model I don't know look if they
killed if I see fine but I think you're
supposed to have a 55 inch iphone 6 to
you that maybe HD that's up to John I
don't think about the discussions right
now oh good grief from Rockstar 103 I
never got to see this product at see us
but I know a bunch of you were going
nuts over it we have seen the Smart
Touch mirror at CES but do you think it
might become a successful product was
that is that the toshiba thing yeah I I
think John went over looked at like four
times
yeah that was me wouldn't that be cool
the thing is I mean I think it would be
neat if you had it like your bathroom II
saw the weather and stuff but what it
costs really want to plug in your mirror
I don't know I could see high-end hotels
exactly in the places where you already
see TVs in the mirrors and stuff like
that like you know their sports bars
that have like the soccer matches
football during ipod behind me behind
the glass so maybe help you japan has
some of the weirdest technology and
bathrooms and I the first time I stayed
at this particular hotel I got out of
the shower of the first night I looked
at my mirror and wondered why there was
a perfect round circle of no steam on my
mirror where and I i just touched a
little bit there was a heating element
it was guessing he that's awesome yeah
there is a heating element that kept the
circle of the mirror steam free I was
like see that's useful thats whats going
to school it was it was useful but it
was so there's like a washcloth it was
so hot yeah so I mean yeah i could see
like hotels yo high end hotels jumping
all over that but for a mass consumer
product no i think that's that's one
thing we see a lot of products that are
awesome and they appeal to people like
us or you know the viewers of the show
but there's so many times where I I just
sit back and go did you talk to any
regular consumers yeah yeah and I think
a lot of it's like proof of concept we
can do it so we did it we brought it to
CES and check it out this is good yeah
yeah it's I don't know from rockster 103
do you think the concept of dual camera
will catch on in the future
I don't know I mean these days I feel
like people want the megapixels and I
know that you know larger pixels in the
sensor brings him a lot more lighting
yep better low-light photos and stuff
like that but the duo core like we're
actually kind of moving around an object
and like there's neat effects and you
can blur the background stuff like I
think I don't want to call it a gimmick
but it's not I don't think it's a
mainstream thing that consumers are sort
of clamoring for but I think it's cool
car than one m8 and I think Zoe's are
cool part of another one ND and the one
m7 for that matter but I don't know that
it's you know something it tumors are
like I need this from David berkovich
should vanillish replace Pikachu is the
mascot for Pokemon yes Yeah right you
got a hoe c'mon joking exactly even if
Joey's not here we saw before my joke so
yes vanilla should become the new logo
of pokemon that's just the way it is uh
here's a question from Sasha Mahal I
always like to throw in a little bit of
behind-the-scenes stuff as well hey sean
how does your role at technobuffalo
differ from John's role you are editor
in chief and he is present some websites
have just an editor in chief also if I'm
the only one a part of my own blog what
title should give myself okay well as
for how John's and my jobs differ John
focuses more on the business aspects of
things like negotiating the advertising
contracts working on any sort of
sponsorship deals and just in general
making sure that money is rolling in so
that we all get a paycheck which we all
appreciate ah and then as for my role I
yes I'm technically editor-in-chief I
every post central air traffic
controller is probably a better term for
me yeah because I not only do I manage
you know what's being written but I also
handle a lot of the scheduling deciding
of which post go at what time slots I
also keep track of where everybody is
physically at all times which I'm sure
I'm sure my employees rather I'm not
constantly where are you going how long
we be what are you doing then I also
which is a very odd thing for an
editor-in-chief to do but I don't mind
doing I actually kind of enjoy I deal a
lot with the development and servers and
making sure that everything is working
as its supposed to and so I do a lot of
different things if you're the only one
running the site editor in chief okay
yeah it's a title everybody understands
let's see if it happens on technobuffalo
Sean knows about it I try to agent even
with even when i'm on vacation the
United Kingdom and I call in to the
staff call just about your minds happy
now they're leading I just happened to
be in my room change you need to go out
to dinner I was like I'm totally calling
it to the staff call their minds ding
you can't talk about me when I'm solely
from Brantley Jensen do you think flappy
bird will be as popular rank comes back
in August I never played the thing I did
a stupid I think he was stupid for
killing I don't know maybe it will be
popular because people are like well
flappy birds back but I think in the
first place like it was popular because
what BuzzFeed an article on it or
something there yeah the thing we did
was on it been on the app store for like
11 months yeah viral and so yeah I mean
that's the funny thing everyone thinks
this is an overnight sensation sensation
no it was on the app store for ages I
think that when it first comes back
there will be a massive mad downloads
because you know this aura has built
around it yeah and then I think
everyone's gonna go well that was fun
for 10 seconds yeah and that was I mean
look the first one was not like I can't
believe the guy that create it was like
it's too addicting you know I should
stop playing this game what it wasn't
addictive it was like
really stupid and boring no what's too
addictive and I will sunday beat Joey
for introducing me to it this please
yeah that's a good game oh that guy has
owned my life okay well I just
developers like I got it I'm gonna take
it down because people are getting too
addicted to it bought us like a new one
has a cool down feature something like
come on man seriously I think where
people were playing in on the subway for
like five minutes I don't know just cuz
people are talking but it doesn't mean
they're like losing their lives yeah I
don't get what happened with flappy bird
at all but yeah they'll be like you know
a car wreck mentality when it comes back
here you're gonna slow down Oh what's
going on over there and you're going to
try it and then you're going to go I'm
done yeah yeah so wha there's a lot
better games like it well Todd and Joey
I've got me hooked on her stone now so
yeah that's a good game I'm enjoying it
I'm enjoying it it's it's not horribly
addicting but you're eight I will say
this for a free to play game I have felt
no compunction to buy cards yeah exactly
look you don't feel like oh crap I gotta
spend a dollar here dollar five dollars
there because you heard how do you earn
the money bags you can oh by like doing
completing quests yeah yeah when you 20
or 100 tokens you get a pack of cards
yeah which is cool yeah I've felt zero
need like oh I'm being beaten I need to
go buy a pack of cards no yeah so hey uh
well we are at 45 minutes so we need to
be heading out of here on let me see
real quick if there's any alright
rockster has asked us for two weeks and
so I feel like we should fight where do
you see Apple in 2020 I have no idea six
years from now wall alright let's see
iphone 6 6
yeah 10 and they called the iphone x no
I I think we'll be up like I phone 8s

iteration here's my question will there
ever be an OS 11 I don't know how long
