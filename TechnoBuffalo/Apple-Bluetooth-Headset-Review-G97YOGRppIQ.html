for you of the apple iphone bluetooth
headset if you don't know what it looks
like you'll see in a minute or check out
the unboxing so i've had about two weeks
with the headset here and i've been able
to really get a sense of how good it is
how it works compared to a couple other
headsets which i'll tell you about so
first how it fits in the air there's no
ear loop if you'll notice it just fits
right in fear included in the Box are
two kind of spongy covers that help up
in your ear some people like it some
don't I did fits in my ear no problem
doesn't come out it's pretty secure as
you can see shake my head up and down or
rock out to music no problem it's very
very very light would either often I
forget that it's even there and I walk
into restaurants or work with the
headset and I'm that guy with the
Bluetooth headset because I forget it's
so light call quality is very good
really no static when it's near the
phone which is nice it rings actually in
the ear when the phone rings which is
also very nice when I'm wearing jeans
that have it in my pocket though there's
a little bit of a little bit of static I
tested it with some other headsets
including the Jabra JX head and had the
same result so it leads me to believe
that just the iPhones bluetooth may be a
little bit weak but it's not bad at all
it's hardly noticeable static double
just being a little bit nit picky people
on the other end they could hear me no
problem often people didn't even know
that I was on a headset which is good
and I can hear them fine as far as
battery life it charges in less than an
hour think charge is really quickly and
I have no problem letting it go for for
the whole day and still have battery
when it's done and that's with it being
powered on you know if you look at the
headset you really can't tell any
buttons Steve Jobs hates buttons but
there is a button right there actually
you push it that's the only button you
have it turned it on that turns it off
answer the phone call call waiting the
whole deal ends a call tell if the
headsets on actually push the button
should get an angular can see a light
went on to turn green that's saying oh
the headsets on that's that was off he
pushed a button I think what happened so
as far as battery battery life goes it's
great the battery on the iPhone usually
I'll get very very drained very quickly
leaving the headset on but after the
software update about a week ago the
battery is almost 80% fully charged by
the end of the day so that update seems
to fix any Bluetooth battery leakage
issues so no troubles there one cool
thing about Ted said I want to show you
is that it charges in this dual dock and
I'll show you the minute what that does
the I the headset goes here and your
iPhone charges here now since there are
no buttons or screen on there how do you
know when they have such charged well
I'm gonna show you all right so I just
plugged the iPhone and the headset into
the dock here as you can see orange
light there indicates that the charge in
green means it's done now one thing that
it does it is very neat is if you push
the button on top the iPhone you can
actually see how far charging the
headset is which is really neat and you
sees right there it's all of about
three-quarters left and that's after one
day of use it's 3:30 here Pacific time
I've had the thing off the charger and
on sand 6:00 in the morning
so really I'm pretty good with with
battery life there take it off here so I
can show you some more about it like I
said call things you care about most
call quality and battery life for
excellent no better or worse than any
other headset I've had but I've had very
good headsets in the past so I think
I've been been lucky in that regard so
so far so good there there are a couple
really annoying things about the headset
don't have to do with the dock and
charging the headset will charge in the
dock the dual dock by itself thought the
iPhone and they're no problem and it'll
charge obviously with the iPhone in
there
only when the iPhone is on so meaning if
you want to turn your iPhone off at
night and charge your headset your
headsets not going to charge just really
knowing you got to either put your phone
into into sleep mode or airplane mode to
let it charge but fortunately charge is
very quickly so you can almost leave it
on for 10 minutes something will be
fully charged when you're done which is
nice that's really annoying and that's
really my only gripe about the headset
other than that I love it it's
lightweight it fits comfortably in the
ear it's about great reception for the
most part and you know its design is
design is gorgeous it's typical Apple
design it is a little bit expensive
though I think it runs 130 bucks but if
you're on your headset a lot you know I
think it's worth it one last cool thing
is actually the pairing method it paired
with your iPhone you can use this
headset with any Bluetooth phone no
problem but it pairs automatically when
you put the headset and the Bluetooth in
the dock you don't have to do anything
no entering codes anything it's actually
very cool so guys that's pretty much
review of that set feel free to ask
questions or anything else that you want
to see and that's it guys enjoy I want
to go make some phone calls bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
