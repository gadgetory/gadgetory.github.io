TechnoBuffalo here's an unboxing for you
of the latest headphones to come out of
the beats apple company these are the
latest iterations of the solu to this
time it cuts the wire these are the
solo2 wireless go ahead take a first
here's the box for the beats solo2
wireless this is as you'd expect a
wireless version of the solo twos
they're going to be available in a few
colors available in black white blue or
red which is currently exclusive to
Verizon trying to pick them up you got
to go to a Verizon store some more stuff
and some pictures but we're gonna run
through all that stuff so you don't have
to bother reading here the price they're
letting you know $299 May for iPod
iPhone and iPad but of course you can
use them with anything that's not Apple
based despite Apple owning beats $100
Premium versus the solo - a big
difference versus the studio wireless
these do not have noise cancelling
capabilities in them so bear that in
mind I will go ahead and use the
unnecessary knife to try and cut this
open and not shave off a piece of mouth
finger there we go get this all opened
up so here is the box go ahead and slide
this outer sheath off you've got the
beats logo there pull this off change
the way you hear sound alright so we've
got a carrying case certainly at those
headphones inside and I think that is
gonna be about it
we've got a booklet this is designed by
Apple in California then you should
definitely get some stickers in there
too um we're going to have inside some
beats books QuickStart guide and you
puck each you how to pair and that kind
of stuff since our Bluetooth they
probably do a little bit more we've got
one wire connection it does have inline
mic and volume controls and then we've
got one charge and sync cable which is
micro USB you're probably get yourself
self why is there cable when these are
wireless if you want to keep using a
headphone that the battery guys and go
ahead
plug it in this does have controls for
your music or phone calls but the
headphones themselves also have those
controls built-in so we've got just a
neoprene case it's not a hard case they
not much that's going to protect your
headphones sort of like to have seen
Hardware keys include especially for
that very premium price that beats is
charging so here are dead bones that's
about it nothing else inside a little
bit of cushion on the neoprene and that
is about it so here are the headphones
to take a quick look around them on
first blush they look almost identical
to the beats solo2
sticker here letting know that there are
indeed buttons volume up and down on the
bluetooth button on the bottom of one of
these sides there we go there's a power
button if you go ahead and hold that
down for a few seconds to get to put
pairing mode you're just happy to see
how much battery you've got left so the
ear cups and the way the headphones fit
should fit again almost identical to the
solo2 wireless that is to say relatively
comfortable they are adjustable if
you've got a larger sized noggin I was
also a bit of Bend and flex to the
headband the ear cups also have a bit of
a newer ability to to make sure it fits
your head pretty nicely these are not as
I mentioned noise cancelling so they're
not gonna get any sort of active or even
passive noise canceling aside from them
just covering your ears letting you know
that these are wireless there's where
your charging ports going to be again
that's micro USB and that is where your
headphones are gonna plug in if you want
to use it this does have a mic built-in
as well so you can take your Bluetooth
calls if you're jamming out to some
tunes with this case you were wondering
this uses the SBC bluetooth codec not
the apdex and a lot of people are really
excited about so bear that in mind if
you're considering picking is up of
course will test them put them through
the paces and see how they compare
especially how they compare to the wired
beats solo2 or tried to put these things
side-by-side you probably couldn't tell
difference you got a very patriotic
table here with the red white and blue
they look almost identical the same
cushion on the top of the headband as
well that we saw with the non wired
version of the headphones and you guys
