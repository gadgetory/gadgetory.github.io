TechnoBuffalo here last week I give you
a tour of my office and a lot of people
were requesting to see what my main sort
of media entertainment setup looked like
so I'm going to walk you through what I
have and what I look at every day when I
watch TV what I use for the internet and
all that business so what you see right
now is my 52 inch sharp aquos LCD 1080p
ton of hdmi ports it's a great TV I
really liked it I bought it from costco
about six months ago when my old LG
plasma blew up for the second time and i
don't mean blew up i mean it sounded
like a gunshot went off inside the thing
so i had to replace it so i picked up
the sharp right below the sharp on the
left-hand side is my apple TV that i use
for mostly renting movies it's a great
way to you know watch some movies almost
on demand some of the new releases and
stuff as well and its twin to the
right-hand side is my airport extreme
that's but what I use for internet that
thing is a lifesaver I can't recommend
the airport extreme enough it's crashed
on me one time in about two years which
is so much better than you linked us one
I had that would die I have probably
reset that linksys one I'd say once
every six to the eight days this thing
has been great i love it highly
recommended so if we move on sort of
below that we've got my playstation 3
fat which pretty much now just use as a
blu-ray player i do play some games on
it but not that much I think I've got
the force unleashed on there and I
believe I have madden 09 for the
PlayStation 3 other than that that's
really the only games that I play on the
ps3 moving along to the left side there
is my xbox 360 that I do use for games
play a halo wars halo I haven't had a
chance to play as many games as i would
have liked but i do want to get back
into the gaming side of it and that's
the black elite console right above that
is my DVR it's a motorola unit provide
it to me from my cable company which is
cox that always makes me laugh and
that's about it guys a pretty nice and
simple easy setup
right behind the TV actually you can
sort of see it right there peeking out
is a voice over IP unit that I've got
plugged in to the airport extreme so i
use a voice over IP client for a home
telephone anyway that is it a short
unboxing a shorts or a demonstration of
my home theater setup i really would
like to get surround sound setup but i
don't have it yet but I'm looking for
what the best options for uh surround
sound home theater system would be so if
you have recommendations please leave a
video response or text down below for
