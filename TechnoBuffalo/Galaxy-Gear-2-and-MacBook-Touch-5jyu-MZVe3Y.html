to you by godaddy what's up everyone
welcome back to the episode of rumor
roundup I'm your host Jon Rangers to
show work wit obviously we take all the
chapters from the week we serve them up
to you on a silver platter of rumors
have an idea of what could be coming
what might be coming what is potential
to possibly come sometime in the near
future up this week next generation
galaxy year might be ditching and Riaan
going Tizen the galaxy s5 is going to be
getting fingerprinted for a whole new
reason and faking a fingerprint e a
macbook touch my be coming sooner than
you think so rumor roundup let's start
just rounding things up in our
pok√©balls google has allegedly been
cracking down on samsung and it's
heavily modified version of android kate
even call it a skin anymore just a whole
different version it looks like the next
generation galaxy gear could be the
first bit of leverage Samsung has to the
market to fight back by using its very
own Tizen OS on its next iteration of
its SmartWatch virtually no other
details are provided though the rumor
would suggest and songs ready to make a
bigger Tizen push the open-source
software has endured let's just say
rough ish start but Tyson has gained 50
to nucare partners around the world
including sprint in the u.s. indicating
a pretty big push could be coming
relatively soon so the story goes
according to report from late January
the first tizen smartphone isn't
expected to be available until the
second half of 2014 with Samsung's
unpacked 5 press conference set for next
week though perhaps forget the first
glimpse of what Samsung might have in
store clearly the gear hasn't been set
in the world on fire so it does stand to
reason that Samsung wants to bring the
big guns out fresh next iteration it
looks like ties it might be packing some
serious heat so what you guys think I
know you might like sideloading apps
entering galaxy gear turning into a
full-fledged naked Android but those
days might be long guy I might look back
at a first generation galaxy gear
wistfully and all of its hacking
awesomeness and think what is this
operating system presumably though
attire got to talk to Android and back
and forth since it obviously would work
with their Android smartphones but
perhaps some crazy galaxy s5 powered by
Tizen w
android fans are out of luck that's that
one's not going to happen not going to
happen I'm gonna be interesting to see
what Samsung does they sort of walked a
line with two operas dumps were there
its ties in or Android even perhaps a
windows phone with rumors of a new
Windows Phone device coming from Samsung
relatively soon so who knows Mobile
World Congress you'll see if the theme
trust episode is coming very very soon
so cue the Apple did it first comments
sources speaking with Sam mobile have
confirmed the galaxy s5 will sport a
fingerprint sensor built right into the
home button priyesh report suggested
that the sensor would actually be built
right into the actual screen would you
could just push your finger anywhere on
there but sources say that's not going
to be the case maybe we'll see you at
the next generation so the sensor is
going to include in the handsets home
button suppose we will work in a swiping
manner meaning it have to swipe your
entire pad of your finger like this
across the home button ferred to
register similar like you've seen on the
iPhone 5s so likely five st echoing
flagship will allow users to register
multiple fingerprints and Sam mobile was
told that even they decide different
fingerprints different tasks such as an
app shortcut which actually sounds
pretty awesome as using your thumb to
launch you know to unlock the screen and
your forefinger to launch another
application be kind of cool to see this
implementation will also allow as 5 you
to take advantage of a new personal
folder and private mode which are
designed with security in mind so use
your finger open your own stuff so what
else uses their finger if you give
access to them they can see this a blank
phone so supposedly to open and close
your personal folder in private mode you
need to swipe your registered finger
over the HOME key after tapping on the
home key and Sam mobile went on to
explain they've apparently have pictures
of this house movement flinton but
conveniently they don't want to share
them they don't to spoil the excitement
for unpack 2014 which again is coming
very very very soon supposedly also
we'll see actual physical buttons
instead of on-screen buttons in the
galaxy s5 so I'm kind of happy more
Congress only a few weeks away so we'll
know for sure soon enough it makes sense
fingerprint scanner is going to be the n
vogue thing and Samsung likes to sort of
be least if not on that cutting edge
near that cutting edge having a blow to
the screen would have been awesome but
certainly something cools got to be for
the next iteration and so it looks like
galaxy s5 I will bring some extra
security in the form of this guy
sorry I fingerprint magnet might as well
put it to good use Apple is so far been
pretty reluctant to add any touch base
pay on suits macbook line or MacBook Pro
and instead relies on the super heavily
multi-touch trackpad supports gesture
controls different functions but and
bear with me what if you're able to
interact with computers texting
different commands like launching an app
controlling your media and really
anything else you can do with your
computer what if the area where your
keyboard addressed is actually a blank
space and you moved close enough to
touch it which point a keyboard could
just appear by magic up recently applied
for a patent that may make these options
a reality now we've seen the sort of
dual screen things before it's ever been
done very eloquently first spotted by
the sluice over at Apple Insider the
patent titled housing as an i/o device
described using the entire area of a
computer's body as an area that can
accept touch input throughout the entire
thing so the one or more sensors can be
configured to sense inputs such as
through touch or via wall of the housing
Apple's Patton says the patent gets way
more technical I'm not going to bore you
with all of my new details but it
could seem kind of cool so imagine sort
of a keyboard that can interact the
application that you're using so imagine
having iTunes open all your music
controls are right there imagine wanting
to type in your fingers get near a
keyboard shows up so one of the problems
obviously lose the tactile quickness of
actual buttons but it could be really
awesome for music creators you know DJ's
for example video editing perhaps pen
input all kinds of other things are
really really really cool I could happen
with this Apple may never implement and
these options although although we see
its least considering adding more
controls to its laptop computers than
already available just kind of nice to
see so patents get out all the time I
wouldn't hold your breath is gonna come
to market but macbook touch it does
sound kind of cool maybe we could go
along with a macbook air and a macbook
pro new third line we used to have you
know the macbook the macbook air the
macbook pro so apples done three lens
before perhaps this might be the one
that does some touchy screens and maybe
they'll be make it in black I did love
that old black macbook and I guess what
do you think would you use a macbook
touch we do not use it it seems kind of
crazy to me but you know a touch screen
on my phone seemed crazy to me a couple
years ago too so things can change take
