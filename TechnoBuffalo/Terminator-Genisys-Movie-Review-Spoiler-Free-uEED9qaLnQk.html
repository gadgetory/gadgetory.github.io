technobuffalo here and as I like to do
from time to time I've got a movie
review for you I had the opportunity to
go to the Terminator Genisys world
premiere here in Los Angeles I wanted to
share my thoughts and opinions on the
movie and I'm going to do my best to go
completely spoiler furry I'm only going
to talk about plot points that you can
see in the trailer so I'm going to
assume that you've seen the trailers at
least I can talk about things that are
least in there and give my impressions
on the acting a plot and really whether
or not you should spend your money to go
see it terminator genisys so let me give
the preface that I love terminator
movies I love the first Terminator
always remember when my dad took me to
do see terminator 2 I even was like
marginally ok with Terminator 3 I kind
of lost a little bit of interest in
terminator terminator salvation the
trailers for Genesis looked absolutely
awesome so a couple cool things about
the movie first it was cool to have
Sarah Connor back certainly missed the
Linda Hamilton badass from t2 but Emily
a Clark does an average job in it you
can definitely hear her accent coming
through a little bit and it was also
nice to not see her wear just a horrible
blonde wig nice to actually see her
normal hair color watch Game of Thrones
you know I'm talking about that wig that
we looked bad it looked very very bad
Arnold's who I think was a weaker part
of t3 was actually really good in this
movie they made accounts for him aging
and looking old they may joke too bad i
had a sense of humor he was the arnold
of old the arnold that we all loved in
arnold that we all grew up with he was
probably the best part of this movie
completely so the general plot I guess
that I can sort of talk about and give
away of course there's Judgment Day
which is when Skynet could go senti it
and four blows up the world if there's a
battle team humans and Skynet and
ultimately the timeline that we saw in
Terminator one Terminator 2 and I guess
Terminator 3 I don't even count
salvation gets reset there's a brand new
timeline which is obviously they're
setting up for many more movies there's
a trilogy planned so a new series of
events a new date for Judgment Day
everything you knew about the previous
Terminator movies has been completely
reset so forget all of that the acting
is relatively decent Jason Clark as John
Connor at that was pretty good hi
Courtney or Jai Courtney as Kyle Reese
thought was great if you guys used to
watch a Spartacus TV show he was
read the blonde curly hair I couldn't
figure out where I knew him from how to
go look at IMDb immediately while the
acting was fine the plot of the movie is
beyond silly and taking out the part
that involves time-traveling robots the
plot just made no sense talk about
trying travel there just like time
travel words Nexus and things have been
reset they make no account for things
not making sense there's just plot holes
that you could fit well I guess like a
t-1000 through making the movie very now
made hard to follow but really hard to
appreciate foot is 0 and actually move
the action scenes were awesome special
effects were great I will say though
there's a t-1000 here which was same to
1000 that we saw on t2 it looked as good
as it did in t2 which is to say that
things looked awesome back with him whom
you first came out but it was neat to
see that again to sort of see the liquid
metal stuff happen the whole plot point
about John Carter nice Alice in the
trailer so don't yell at me sort of
being a robot esque was weird and I
don't know why they give that away in a
trailer I was sort of the big turning
points or making him kind of the big bad
guy I was interesting but there were
scenes of the movie where Skynet is
talking like Skynet itself is like this
talking I won't say what it said but
that is just it was just weird didn't
make sense as a fan and kind of I guess
a purist of Terminator movies I wouldn't
waste your money the theaters for this
one I'd wait till it comes out on on
netflix you want to buy it on blu-ray or
download it it just wasn't worth seeing
the best part of the movie we saw it
with Dolby Atmos the sound was
incredible but that was kind of the bed
just of it the pre was also in 3d in the
3d I felt added absolutely nothing to it
if you are going to see in theaters
lacey has a couple of bucks and don't
bother sing it in 3d Arnold was awesome
so if you're an Arnold fan you wanted to
see and make jokes and give awkward
smiles go see the movie if you're
debating whether or not to go do
something else or tomato Genesis I pass
on it they do explain why it's called
Genesis and why it's weirdly has a lie
in it and not spelled the way you'd
expect so if you're worried about that
like I was they explain it but it still
doesn't make
much sense at all the movie for me gets
a big like see ya its passing it as an
action movie but it's not passing is
anything that really want to spend my
money on and I recommend you don't and
if you guys would rather see these movie
reviews with spoilers let me know I
could do that too it'd probably be way
easier than keeping everything spoiler
free but I love the movie reviews we're
not going to do them all the time I know
you guys subscribe for tech stuff we've
liked the movie reviews pvp video a
thumbs up always appreciate it I've sort
of my love's in life aside for my family
