at a prototype of the new vaio x which
let me tell you is unbelievably small
it's running a new 2 gigahertz I believe
dual core atom let me look at this thing
thing weighs absolutely nothing it's
incredibly thin really light we've got
your SD card slot right on the front you
can see ports on the side not really
many you've got monitor out and then
this little door I'll show you flaps
down for your Gigabit Ethernet on the
other side you've got two USB and your
audio in and out and then nothing on the
back but this thing is ridiculously thin
and it weighs nothing it feels like a
pad of paper almost I mean even opening
it up it's tiny it's got a really nice
sized keyboard keys are a little bit
small little undersized trackpad and two
buttons this is going to run sony hasn't
officially released pricing on it but
they're saying 1400 or 1200 depending on
the hard drive size which i believe is
going to be 128 gigahertz but this is
running the new Intel Atom processor
which is clocked at two gigahertz so it
should be relatively fast and powerful
when we move over to one where the
screen is on you can see this one is
running windows 7 you can see some of
the specs that it's gone on it's the
only got a 2.4 rating for windows 7
which is not very high but certainly is
enough to run it it just is a credibly
small unlike computer using the macbook
air you thought that thing was small in
light this completely dorks it in size
and weight the cool thing about this
estonia's claiming it's going to get up
to 12 hours of battery life which is an
unbelievable claimed although expected
to probably be around eight actual hours
the batteries actually already in there
it's sealed in its super small can't
even really even see it again just
overall very impressed with the sony
vaio x it'll be released sometime next
month
so if you're interested check out sony
style com for more information I'll see
you guys in the next video bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
