technobuffalo hearing barbers are lifted
we can finally talk about the samsung
galaxy s4 I've had it for the better
part of four and a half days not long
enough to put together a full review to
where I'm comfortable putting my name on
something but it is plenty of time to
share some first impressions show you
some cool stuff the galaxy s4 has show
you some new things that TouchWiz can do
and not do and hopefully help you decide
whether or not you want a pre-order or
order the galaxy s4 let's go and get
started alright so here is our galaxy s4
we've got it for sprint although oddly
we don't have any carrier branding on
our phone perhaps by the time these
devices get to you though there'll be
some sort of carrier notifications on
here so I go ahead and run through the
specs remind you what the galaxy s4 has
you decide if it's the right phone free
then I'll talk a little bit more about
what's in it and all about cents and all
kinds of other galaxy s4 goodness so it
is going to ship with Android 4.2 which
I give him credit for their able to get
that on by the time these devices hit
consumers hands for dimension standpoint
it's five point three eight inches x
2.75 inches by a pretty thin point 31
inches while looking at the side here i
will say the galaxy s4 now is sort of
metal esque accents now there's still
plastic but it makes the phone feel more
significant in the hands implies a
little bit better build quality at to me
and device is definitely thinner than
the outgoing galaxy s3 and it weighs a
pretty lightweight 4.5 nine ounces so
one of the big additions to the galaxy
s4 is that gorgeous 5-inch 1080p display
at super amoled plus here we keep track
with what the technology is and that
gives it a pretty substantial 441 PPI on
the screen here does look gorgeous will
cover all this a lot more in the review
and I feel like I've used the device
well enough but when I'm just online
reading websites and browsing around the
screen is absolutely gorgeous video text
playing games ever might be the screen
here really nice samsung as always nails
their screens are going back to really
the original Galaxy S and on so hats off
the samsung for improving and already
awesome technology 2600 milliamp hour
battery aven't used this long enough to
give my full impressions on the battery
we've had it for about four and a half
days now but I
say though in my regular usage I am able
to get through a full day with them bow
and thirty to forty percent laughs but I
want to put it through a little more
stringent testing before I declare how
good or bad at the battery life is so
you can get this in two different
versions the US version is going to come
with a quad-core processor the
international version you can get with
an octa-core processor but no support
for LTE that is in 1.9 gigahertz qua
qualcomm snapdragon ship so it's pretty
fast i mean quad-core octa-core nothing
here is really optimized yet for you
know for quad core or even octa-core so
i want to get to cut up on the number of
course your performance that was awesome
and of course when do a full ready feel
gaily tell you what all the quadrant
scores aren't all that kind of stuff but
this thing's blazing fast as you would
expect an augmented with two gigs of ram
you're never gonna have to worry about
any sort of android lag or memory loss
so we're not downloading some crazy bad
apps so internal storage 16 or 32 but
you've got a micro SD card slot that
lives underneath the battery door here
which is removable ah which is quite
nice speaking of removable battery door
and go ahead and do that same plastic
that we've seen on other samsung devices
it's no better no worse a little bit of
what looks like a textured pattern on it
but there isn't one sim cards gonna live
right there and there is a micro SD card
slot again we've got the sprint variety
which supports their new LTE network and
that's where that micro sim card is
going to live you can also see the
antenna and connection points for NFC
which is also built into this guy snaps
on just like the rest of Samsung devices
do a few little clips and you are good
to go cameras definitely improved here
as well we've got a 13 megapixel sensor
which takes full 1080p video and does a
very good job at it and a 2 megapixel
sensor on the front we're going to talk
a lot more about camera in two separate
camera videos up there's some cool stuff
that goes on here inside of the camera
like if you guys a bit of a sneak
preview as it gets that full coverage so
uh looks pretty familiar to what we seen
on other samsung devices if you want to
take videos go ahead and hit video hit
that mode button though there's a lot of
cool things that go on here so auto
pretty obvious nothing really exciting
their beauty face and hands facial
features best photo I'll take a series
of photos it's different than what
blackberry has won they'll just sort of
swap the head this one take
a whole bunch of photos you can pick the
best one actually recommend one with the
thumbs up best face for a similar thing
sound shot you can rinse pictures by
adding background sounds for a few
seconds kind of cool drama is sort of me
you can see what's going on here if you
take a picture of somebody running or
walking across screen you can sort of
see what that looks like animated photo
and I'll walk you guys through all this
in a separate video eraser erase when
walking through the background panorama
pretty obvious sports night on a few
other settings but does a really nice
job but one of the coolest things for me
in camera I'll go and open up back up
that you can use the front and rear
camera at the same time so let me go
ahead and show you i'll hit that middle
button right there and you'll sort of
see me there we go you can sort of see
my face in a little heart as I'm filming
you can see Ralph doing the phone will
focus on him it's probably a little bit
easier get that little arrow button you
can choose all kinds of different little
sizes and get out lines for what you
want it to look like so if you want just
an oval blur and you want to chat with
somebody recorded video you can do it
like that as you move it around just you
get those four little box on the side
which if you use Android for a while you
know that'll let you resize it however
big or how small you want so I'll drop
that down select that you can make it
bigger or smaller you can remove it
obviously entirely if you want to but
certainly a kind of a really nice
addition that Samsung has done so we'll
go ahead and close that a lot more talk
about on camera but consider that a
sneak preview an aperitif to the rest of
the goodness of the camera can do here
it can be coming to all major carriers
in the US so t-mobile AT&amp;amp;T Sprint and
Verizon one the few devices that comes
everywhere so you're going to want to
check what day is going to come to your
carrier because it's different for all
four but it will be coming so yay for
that so it's got bluetooth and NFC the
rest of the stuff you'd expect something
walk you around the device snap that
back all the way in here so it looks
pretty on the left hand side volume
rocker up and downs we've seen that from
design standpoint something two
different versus the s3 the save for a
little bit of better screen on the right
hand side you've got the power and lock
button in the spot where Samsung legs to
put it on the right if we continue the
tour on the back there is at 13
megapixel camera LED flash presumably
they'll be some sort of carrier branding
on here galaxy s4 and speaker grill up
top you've got a lot of port after
you've got a 3.5 millimeter heads
Jack it does have an IR blaster which
looks right barely you think that might
be a microphone but it's not the
microphone is actually right there on
the bottom that's where you are syncing
and charging ports going to be and there
is a noise cancelling mic as well and
rounding out some of the cutting-edge
features here of the galaxy s4 this has
either 211 NAC which I can't even test
for weeks I don't have anything that
supports AC but certainly over the next
two years your contract a lot of stuff
might so there's that option as well as
some new things here with sense you can
see how folders are organized or kind of
neat you get some nice animations in the
pulldown instead of just seeing that row
of 5 you hit that me upper right hand
corner you can see a ton of stuff
there's some cool things here to like
air view which will let you sort of
simulate we can do with an S Pen the
best example I can show you if i unlock
it and I lock the phone you can see in
that little light sort of follows my
finger I'm not touching the screen we
can see it sort of follows where my
finger goes and you can do that to get
sneak previews of emails if you want to
view text on a website or open a
calendar item sort of a neat feature you
can also do some motion stuff as well so
let's say I want to move a widget let's
say I want to move this google search
bar so obviously i can just drag it and
move it around if i want that any
problem i go from screen to screen but
you can also if you hold it down and it
doesn't always work if you wave your
hand across there from the side it'll
move doesn't always like to work there
you go you can see now it's screen to
screen as I wave my hand across it so
some kind of cool implementations for
technology I don't know practically all
are but there's super I on the cool
front and it does work not a hundred
percent as you saw but it's relatively
accurate so there's a lot of things to
like here in the galaxy s4 again I need
a few more days till I feel comfortable
putting my name on a full review but
overall the experience has been very
positive nothing giant difference from
the galaxy s2 really the big difference
is you're going to see here are in the
camera and some of that camera stuff
might actually still be coming to the
galaxy s3 now while on paper it's a much
faster phone the Galaxy s3 was certainly
no slow phone so all things to open a
little bit faster in quadrant scores are
a little bit higher performance on this
is pretty close to what it was on the s3
and every day you
naturally they complement to the s3 and
how good it was this is definitely an
incremental upgrade but it's a nice
upgrade and brings a lot of nice
features really the big one for me is
that gorgeous 1080p screen so stay tuned
for our full review as I'll walk you
through everything that this phone can
do and not do I'll give you the full
technobuffalo score any question things
you guys want to see leave your comments
down below I am jon rettinger from
TechnoBuffalo give this video a thumbs
up we must definitely appreciate it and
I'll see you in the next video
