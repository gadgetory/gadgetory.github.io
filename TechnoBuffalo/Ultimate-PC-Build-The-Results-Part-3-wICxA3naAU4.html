week at CES and we're back in the office
and we're here for the final installment
of our pc build video the last time you
saw us we showed you how it was actually
building it and now I want to talk to
you guys a little bit about what
performance has been like and what we've
been doing on the software side so we're
running Windows 10 and got a number of
things going on here obviously we've got
a few proprietary things for some of the
stuff that we've got plugged in we ran
through all of what's inside the PC
already so if you guys want to see
what's inside the PC you can head over
there running from mere of course that's
what I switch to premier fairly recently
and I've been quite enjoying it and what
we decided to do was just do a quick few
rough tests not comprehensive not super
scientific but just wanted to give you
guys an idea of what this is doing for
us in terms of our workflow so we tested
on a few computers just on the computers
basically that we wind up using the most
here in the office for actual exports my
iMac which is running an nvidia card and
has cuda cores installed takes about 7
minutes 51 seconds to export this very
same razor video from CES oh you can
click up here and actually watch this
video it's a good video and ron's imac
takes about six minutes 25 seconds this
computer the rig we've just been calling
it the rig takes same same video same
clip it's about a two minute long video
takes four minutes 2 seconds on this rig
now if you turn on previews which means
essentially rendering out the video is
going to actually make a difference if
you turn on previews it'll generate the
previews and then you go to export
obviously those are two separate things
and if that's going to take time in and
of itself as well because when you get
an export it's going to generate the
previews but if you do do the previous
verse that gets the export time down to
two minutes five seconds so if you're in
the habit of doing a full render to do a
watch through before you export that
you're going to be pretty happy with
this because it's essentially exporting
it one to one that's exactly what we
wanted out of this machine we haven't
done any testing in terms of gaming just
yet so seeing what we can run in terms
of frames per second but
this thing has just been screaming I
realize also that's not that big of a
differential between this machine and
the other machines but the other thing
that is really worth noting is that
playback on this has always since they
won been crazy crazy smooth it has no
problem just crunching through 4k video
and the rest of the computers in the
office just cannot handle that and it
becomes enormously frustrating to to
have to work with a computer in that
can't even show you what you're working
on all right as you guys may or may not
be aware I'm not crazy about benchmarks
but I did run a couple here for you so
you guys can take a look and see for
yourself the performance that we're
getting from each of these components
the overall score is pretty low because
it did also test you know some of the
other stuff an older hard drive that we
have for storage and our card reader
stuff like that but you can see each of
the components individually did test
quite favorably except for our ram the
ram i think needs to be upgraded sooner
rather than later then we also did go
ahead and run a cinebench test as well
so you can see performance on opengl and
the cpu performance all very good
exactly what we expected out of the box
i'm very very happy with that the only
thing that we're behind is on is the cpu
on this one and there's just two or
three better cpus on the market so i'm
very happy with the performance overall
alright let's check out those sweet
razor for referrals this right here is
the razer diamondback mouse this thing
is super cool it's really lightweight
but this thing is ambidextrous that
super nice we have a few people in the
office who have hands more than one hand
so that way you can use it to handedly
I'm just kidding that's not what that
means underneath that Mouse is the razor
Firefly and this is a hard mouse pad and
it's connected to USB why you ask well
it lights up along the bottom I realize
that seems a little superfluous but I
think it's super dope right now I have
it set to reactive so when you click it
lights up pretty darn cool last but
certainly not least is the Black Widow
chroma and that is the keyboard that
razor sent us it's incredibly
comfortable it's a mechanical keyboard
if you've never used a mechanical
keyboard before try it out it might be
for you might not it's not for everyone
but it's a very very comfortable way to
type especially when you're typing along
articles or typing scripts or whatever
on
also excellent for gaming purposes they
have the razor has their own switch
mechanism the fees and all their
keyboards guaranteed for like a really
high high life span this is not
sponsored by razor they were just kind
enough to send us some stuff to use for
the rig obviously origin as well big
thanks to origin thank you guys so much
for sending us this case i love this
case every day if you guys want to see a
little bit more about the pc if you guys
have questions please do let me know i'd
be happy to answer them for you and on
that note i just want to take a second
really quick to answer some of the
questions that you guys have had on some
of the comments pertaining to these
videos i can't believe you haven't got a
fan on the radiator make sure you check
that your temps aren't too high like we
mentioned in the last video we were
actually missing a few screws because
origin doesn't make these cases for sale
so they had to just send us some
components so we didn't have the screw
that we needed to mount the fan to the
radiator and then to mount that set up
to the actual case so the radiator as it
says right now is still up here we still
just need to give another Fanta haven't
gotten around to emailing origin maybe
you guys see this video maybe you guys
could just send us the screws please
dude you don't need that fan on the RAM
unless you have a crack in it I know we
don't need the fan on the RAM it just
looks cool that okay with you guys
Thanks yeah serious video producers
choose a video Bertha doesn't even have
10 bit color that doesn't really matter
for us we don't shoot intended color so
as nice as it would be to have it
definitely seems like overkill for us we
shoot in 4k so that we can crop in I
know that I get that question a lot so I
feel like it's worth answering often and
yeah we know that most most graphics
cards have fans on them we're just
trying to be funny and entertaining for
you guys so take a breather anyway thank
you guys so much for watching it has
been a blast building this thing
together with you guys and saying what
you guys think and and what what your
feedback has been positive or negative
is there something else that you'd like
to see us build another another thing
another like kind of a nerd rite of
passage that we've yet to attempt that
we could do for you on camera let us
know in the comments I would be only too
happy to do that for you and with you
guys so thank you guys so much for
watching be kind of one another and i'll
catch you in the next video
