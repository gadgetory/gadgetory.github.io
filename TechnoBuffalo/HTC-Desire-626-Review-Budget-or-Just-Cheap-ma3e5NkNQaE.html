OMS have a brand new affordable category
to consider and corner with HTC's future
on the line let's see how its latest
entry fairs with strong value driven
offerings on the rise I'm our first IRA
TechnoBuffalo and this is the HTC Desire
6 to 6 just as a quick disclaimer I
reviewed the device for five days the
HTC Desire 66 is a budget device through
and through everything from the build
quality to the screen to the internals
they all just scream budget so let's
start with that body
the 66 has an entirely plastic exterior
it's got this kind of soft smooth finish
feels kind of nice in the hand to hold
it's got kind of like nice soft round
corners the form factors really really
slim but it does actually feel sturdy
there's like not even a little bit of
flex there's even this kind of like
somewhat pearlescent finish on the white
areas on the outside obviously not all
that all the devices are white but this
one does have it and I hesitate to say
that it makes it look a little more
premium but it definitely does give the
impression that the device is a little
bit better than it actually is on the
left side here you're going to find a
flap to get at that SIM slot and the
micro SD card which is capable of cards
up to 200 gigs in size and on the right
you're going to find that kind of gushy
power key that you're never quite sure
if you've actually pressed Andy of
course the way too high for my thumb
volume rocker up here on the top
underneath the hood we'll talk about
some specs really quick this is running
the snapdragon 210 it's a quad core
processor clocked at one point one
gigahertz and Qualcomm says that that
this is the like 4G processor for
everyone so any device that needs forth
to 4G connectivity it's like they're
modern low-end processor it's got 16
gigs of on-board storage a gig of ram
and a 2,000 milliamp hour battery and it
is going to be available for $200 off
contract the camera on the back is an 8
megapixel shooter and the Front's got a
5 megapixel camera they're both about as
good as you can really expect them to be
the HTC camera app is easy enough to use
it's quicker than I really expected it
to be but the results are pretty
predictably rough
we forgot really noisy kind of washed
out photos and low-light photos that are
just about grainy enough to sand that
table you've been meaning to refinish
this isn't going to replace your DSLR or
even your pocket point-and-shoot if you
for some reason still have one of those
but it is perfectly serviceable for all
the snapchats that kids are doing these
days I did have a really positive
experience with the battery on this
thing it's a 2000 milliamp hour battery
and it's going to keep you cranking for
quite a few days with just a little bit
of light usage overnight in standby it
only dropped by about 5% and it's been
making it full days with me with about
40% left in the tank and that's just
with normal moderate day-to-day usage
between the stock GPU it's got a really
low resolution display and the low-power
Snapdragon 210 it's really not terribly
surprising how long the 66 can stretch
2000 milliamp hours plus like I said
that 210 even supports fast charging so
it is definitely the modern low-end
processor so even if you do run out of
juice you've got fast charging on this
thing to charger right back up the
screen though is really what betrays the
626 as a hundred percent budget device
this is a 5-inch display running a 720
resolution and it's an LCD that only
gives it a PPI of 293 and believe you me
it shows in just about every pixel I
haven't been this immediately put off by
display in quite some time the colors
are really really washed out the
resolution is incredibly low and the
text is rendered in honestly it's
borderline offensive in in most areas
the text looks like it's had like a grey
stroke applied to the outside of it it's
actually kind of confusing honestly
because it doesn't even seem to happen
everywhere but when it happens text is
really really difficult to look at
almost as if it's in the uncanny valley
of fonts it feels like someone just took
the screen and turned sharpening up all
the way to 11 and for me it's easily the
worst aspect of the entire device but
let's talk about the software really
quick the 66 is sporting Sense 7.0 which
is the latest and least egregious HTC
spin on Android and while it's certainly
more toned down than older offerings it
not quite as far backed off as I would
like from Android as even for example
TouchWiz has backed off from Android or
even better motorola has backed off from
Android it's definitely an HTC device
and everything from the app drawer to
blinkfeed to the incessant notifications
asking for your usage info for blinkfeed
and things like that they're gonna make
sure that you don't forget it it does
run smoothly enough though and despite
unholy amounts of 80 bloatware it never
really harshed my experience so badly
that it couldn't be mostly alleviated by
an icon pack and nova launcher
despite its less than ideal screen the
66 is ultimately a totally serviceable
device for the price this is exactly the
kind of device I could totally see
buying a teenager it's kind of crazy in
fact how far we've come and how
inexpensive smartphones can be these
days you know this thing is just 200
bucks and this would have been a
flagship a few years ago if I had a 16
year old who were getting his or her
first smartphone this is exactly the
kind of device that I would be looking
for it's nothing special but it's a
starter device you know and it is
inexpensive enough that if it were to
get lost or destroyed or stolen that it
wouldn't really break the bank to have
it replaced
unless you're shopping for your kids or
looking for a cheap burner device I
really can't think of a reason to
seriously consider or recommend the 6 to
6 especially as strong contenders like
the oneplus 2 and zenfone 2 start
creeping dangerously close to the budget
range of prices if you really need to
save somewhere in the vicinity of 150
bucks I'm not sure you're not better off
picking up like a flagship from last
year or even a Moto G which is actually
the same price as the 66 off-contract
what do you guys think I still don't
know that a budget device really ought
to be making this many compromises like
I said the Moto G is a very good device
for the price and as I mentioned the
zenfone 2 and the oneplus 2 are both
getting dangerously close to those
budget territories so let me know what
you think is this budget category just
getting smaller and smaller and smaller
until eventually we're just using
devices that are all about the value let
me know in the comments and of course
you can tweet me at mark B and if you
