all doing okay I wanted to share her
story with you I don't know if you guys
know or some of you may know i was in
new york city this past week and a half
on business and I brought my girlfriend
with me as a little vacation anyway we
had a great a great time in New York and
we were catching a cab to laguardia
airport at 5am in the morning and our
taxi was in a horrible accident going 45
miles an hour around a blind turn off
the Queensboro Bridge we slammed
headfirst into another car we were
driving straight the car was coming we
slammed headfirst into that did he the
other car fortunately everybody walked
away I had I still have a pretty severe
concussion and some scratches you guys
can still see my girlfriend didn't do as
well she has a big laceration over her
right eye and required ten stitches
bruised knee sore neck and back and a
concussion as well and both drivers the
cars were were okay really just feel
fortunate to you live and feel fortunate
that she and I are okay and really puts
things into perspective something that
serious you know we spent 12 hours in
the emergency room there and this is on
Friday and then our flight was canceled
on Saturday trying to get home and we
finally got home today sunday has been a
really rough rough couple days for me
but then I just wanted to kind of share
with you guys and if anybody's ever in a
taxi don't get in they don't have
seatbelts just don't want to put your
life in somebody else's somebody else's
hands which is a real scary scary
experience you know it's not fun to have
to pull the love your life up with a
blood all over her face and watch you
get carried into an ambulance on a flat
board with a brace around your neck
not something I wish on wish on anyone
but again you know thank God that we
were okay who think that we had you know
something or whatever watching over us
I'm not the most religious guy religious
guy in the world but I really do feel
blessed to be alive the car was
completely wrecked and you know with no
seat belts were fortunate we shouldn't
have gotten in the cab didn't that
didn't have seatbelts I always wear
seatbelts in California but you know
just one of those things at five in the
morning which is didn't weren't thinking
straight so anyway I hope you guys are
doing well I hope you had a better week
denied it i am home and once i feel like
my head is better i'll be making some
more videos again I got some new stuff
coming up but right now I just feel a
little woozy and having a little memory
issues from the head wound but I wanted
to share with you guys know I've let you
get into my life a little bit this was a
big life incident so anyway I hope you
guys are doing well and i'll talk to you
soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
