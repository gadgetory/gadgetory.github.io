technobuffalo and I thought we'd do
something a little bit a little more
casual I have a phone here that I want
to talk with you guys about but it is
not a phone that is available in the US
and I'm not able to get a sim card
working in it but I still wanted to
share with you so I thought we would do
a quick little video this way less
scripting less couch and kind of take a
quick look at the Lenovo Zuk z1 this
thing is a really interesting device
it's available overseas and I believe in
China the device is really interesting
let me give you guys a closer look here
you might recognize a few of the kind of
bits and pieces of the device itself
looks a little familiar you might say it
looks a little I phony but on the actual
display you're seeing android of course
but when you open up that drawer that
looks a little weird doesn't it that is
trebuchet that's because this thing runs
cyanogenmod so if you guys are familiar
with roms cyanogen is probably one of
the most popular ones and it brings with
it a ton of really cool customizations
the device itself in terms of hardware
isn't really terribly cool beyond a
handful of things number one thing it's
a 40 100 million power battery and since
the display is only a 1080p display we
don't have to worry about to too much in
terms of usage so this 404 40 100
million power battery should
hypothetically last a really good long
time and in my experience it really does
obviously like I mentioned I can't quite
get it working with us Sims but the
device itself feels strong in the hand
the battery life is fantastic the screen
is great the fingerprint sensor down
here on the bottom is one of the most
accurate fingerprint sensors I've used
on an Android device believe it or not
so I've had a fantastic time using this
thing the buttons are clicky it's not
too big i can almost touch my finger
from around the side i can swipe type
one handed it's just a fun fantastic
little device that happens to run
basically the best third party custom
rom that you can get
we're looking at uh internal storage of
64 gigs of course that is not expandable
via microsd because this is all unibody
but what you do see on the side here is
that SIM tray this is a dual SIM slot
and it also happens to have 3 gigabytes
of RAM that's right three gigs of
gigabytes of RAM and since it's cyanogen
you can do it but you're the cool things
like customizing these bottom buttons
here you can switch those right now the
right button uh is the back button and
though the left button here is the
multitasking you can switch that around
if you want to all the cool stuff that
you can do with cyanogen you can see
right here themes buttons let's pop into
buttons real quick so you can see you
can switch to an on-screen enabled nav
bar if you want to you can turn that off
you can have the backlight on and off on
these buttons down here you have a bunch
of other options for your nav bar if you
turn that on and again this is stuff
that you can only really get on cyanogen
Google doesn't let you mess around with
this kind of stuff you can have settings
for your home but your power button it's
a really cool device unfortunately like
I said pricing doesn't really make all
that big of a difference because it's
not going to be available here in the US
but I did want to share with you my only
major quip with it is quam quip quarrel
I don't know is that the camera is okay
it's pretty fast and run sign engines
camera software but the HDR mode is way
too aggressive it's really uncomfortably
aggressive it makes out like cheeks all
look really pink and colors look all
really poppy and saturated and I don't
get that issue when HDR is turned off
but the camera software is just
delightful to use if you guys have ever
used cyanogen scammer software you'll
notice it's it's just easy to use and
it's just a fantastic phone so all those
cool cyanogen features like trebuchet
and the cool camera app and the ability
to customize so much stuff on the device
that is going to run you about 320 bucks
USD you can like I said get it in the US
but it is not going to work on LTE bands
in the u.s. you can get it to work on
hspa+ so if that's ok for you then by
all means pick one up but if you live
internationally this is a great great
device to pick up at three hundred
twenty dollars all-day battery decent
camera strong screen good color
fingerprints
sir cyanogenmod what more can you really
ask for so that's my quick look at the
Zuk z1 thank you guys so much for
watching if you enjoyed the video
there's a like button right down there
below it there's also a bunch of
comments where everybody's having some
calm civil discussions about phones and
on the way down there you can hit that
subscribe button if you would like to
get these videos as soon as they come
out directly to your little notification
drawer thank you guys again so much for
watching be kind to one another and I'll
catch in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
