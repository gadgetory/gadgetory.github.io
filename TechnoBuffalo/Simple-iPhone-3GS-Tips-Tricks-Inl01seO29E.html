from TechnoBuffalo comm here and I want
to show you some tips and tricks that
are found on the iPhone I'm going to
demonstrate this on a iPhone 3GS some of
them are exclusive to the 3GS but some
of them you can find on the 3G and the
first gen phone so let's go ahead and
get started
to unlock the device so the first one I
want to show you is actually one that I
made a video on a while back in case you
missed it this one is just 3GS exclusive
but it shows how to get the battery in
the upper right hand corner actually the
numerical value of the battery you have
left so it's quite easy just go to
settings go down to general hit usage
and you can flip that battery present
toggle on or off now while we're here
let me show you some things that maybe
you may not have known here it shows
your total usage time since your last
full charge so I've used my phone for 38
minutes standby time it's been three
hours and 19 minutes all the call
information the cell your cellular
network data that's been sent and
received you can go ahead and reset this
if you'd like it's nice way to monitor
what your usage of the phonons so let's
go back and most of these settings I'm
going to show you are all found in the
settings it's obviously the settings is
that big icon that says seventh so the
next thing let's go to settings and
we'll hit general and we're going to
scroll down to accessibility this is not
a menu that I go to very often but I
happen to see what was there just by
accident there's a ton of really
interesting things here the first one is
this white on black toggle check this
out it actually reverses the color on
the iPhones now everything has a sort of
cool looking effect to it and this is
not a hack that's not a jailbroken
iPhone this is just standard on the 3GS
kind of neat it's one of those things
that you can use for a good day and then
you get really sick of but if you do
want some sort of variety this is a very
nice option so we'll go back to settings
I'll hit general go back to
accessibility
when I turn that off and let me show you
what else is here there's something
called voiceover it's the first option
essentially when voiceover does it
speaks items that are on the screen so
I'll turn it on and I'll show you what
it does it's a voice and you can hear
that weird sort of ominous robotic
woman's voice read this important
message here I'm going to hit cancel and
it just go ahead and turn voiceover off
so essentially what it'll do is it'll
just read aloud what you have on the
screen this is great for the hearing
impaired or those that just don't like
to read I guess but this is something
neat that is found in the operating
system so we'll go back to accessibility
and now there's something called zoom so
zoom magnifies the entire screen and
actually takes advantage of the
multi-touch but not just two fingers
this one actually takes three I don't
know I put three fingers on there I'm
sure you can count but let me show you
what it looks like so we'll turn this on
so DoubleTap with three fingers to zoom
and this will work really any to where
you are in the application radio there's
one more time there we go
and if you want to pan around you
actually have to use your three fingers
again and you can pan around the entire
screen it's kind of a that zooms in on
anything totally something to keep in
mind if you're perhaps vision impaired
again or you just want to zoom in on
something take a screen capture picture
this is a really kind of cool way to do
it so we'll turn that off and you can
also hear just the mono audio you can
turn that on or off and you can turn on
the speak auto text I'll show you what
that is essentially what that do does is
well it speaks auto text and you can go
ahead and turn that on or off nothing
terribly fun or exciting right there so
let's go ahead and keep exploring let's
go to home screen here and here's where
you can control what double clicking
this home button does so for me to right
now takes me to my phone favorites we
can set it to go to home search camera
iPod and
can choose whether or not you want your
iPod controls on or off a lot of these
things may be very obvious to you but I
didn't know where all of they were all
been worth first I thought maybe some of
you might not be familiar with these
settings as well so we'll go back let's
go to keyboard next and here's where you
can control some of the keyboard
shortcuts if the autocorrection annoys
you and some people aren't a big fan of
the autocorrection
you can turn it right off here Auto
capitalization you can turn on or off
you can able caps locks or when that
little icon means is double tapping the
spacebar putting in a period so you can
turn that on or off and here you've got
some international keyboards that you
can scroll through and turn them on if
you have friends in a different language
you speak a different language then
where your phone is primarily located so
go ahead and turn that off I actually
recommend that you guys go through these
settings in the iPhone almost menu by
menu because there's a lot of stuff
there that you may not have known about
so just lets it give you some real quick
tips and tricks for the iPhone
particularly the iPhone 3GS hope you
