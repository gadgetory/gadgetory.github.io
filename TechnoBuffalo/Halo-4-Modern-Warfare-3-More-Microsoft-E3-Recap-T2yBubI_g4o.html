e3 updates it is definitely one of my
favorite times of year when we get to
see all the latest and greatest video
games from the biggest manufacturers
Microsoft kicked off III week with their
keynote and they announced the done of
goodness that's my hand signal for a
bunch of goodness let me go ahead and
recap what we can expect and what
Microsoft announced today because they
announced quite a bit all right so let's
go ahead and get kicked off with modern
warfare 3 and I'm reading all this from
our TechnoBuffalo recap on the microsoft
event link down below you know the deal
probably one of the most anticipated
games of the year no one's even sure
this was happening until video leaked
the other day I won't be an exclusive to
Xbox but it was a pretty good way to
kick off the show so modern warfare 3
awesome next up we saw a trailer for the
new tomb raider game it's a complete
reboot we didn't see you Lauren the
short shorts that we've generally seen
her in but it takes you back to the very
first adventure when she was 21 years
old uh kind of neat EA Sports took the
stage and they showed fifa 12 men 12 all
the stuff he knew was coming that sort
of comes with yearly updates Forza
Motorsport 4 they talked about mass
effect 3 getting kinect controller
integration so now your kids or nephews
or little brother and sister won't for
the onion only ones run around the house
when you do you now YouTube can run
around your house doing that so that
will be coming new Ghost Recon game
future soldier is also getting kinect
integration the Xbox Live got a ton of
stuff too it's going to be eating up
much more of your time and your
bandwidth as it brings live TV Bing
search and YouTube to the mixed it also
looks like Microsoft really wants to
take control of your living room so
don't tell your cable box at next they
showed rise which will be using your
connect
you play around ancient Rome the only
showed Carol our bath oh but kind of
neat so you can run around Rome you have
to wear a toga then they showed fable
the journey also getting kinect support
and then they showed probably one of my
most favoritest things for connected i'm
super excited about and that is kinect
Star Wars when you can use your virtual
lightsaber and look like you're making
super dirty motions if people can see
you're playing games they also announced
that minecraft is coming to the Xbox
exclusively so that's super neat if
you're my crotch Fanny be able to get
that on your xbox not sure how that's
gonna work on a console but I'm sure
that they figured out a way and the big
news the biggest ball news is the halo
world we are getting a redone re graphic
up remake ish of the original halo
combat evolved that'll be coming xbox
live so awesome there and then the
largest news is a new halo trilogy
probably a surprise 20 people
considering how popular halo has been
but they showed a trailer for halo 4
trailer for halo 4 awesome coming in
time for the holidays be sure to check
out all of our e3 courage because we got
a ton of business coming up if you go to
any of our e3 articles or see this
widget thing at the bottom you can click
the articles kind of awesome I am most
excited and obviously i'm a huge nerd
for the kinect Star Wars trilogy I met
to pull my blinds Oh snow one season you
play it when it comes out because people
are gonna think that I have more mental
issues than I have and I have probably a
few so pretty exciting which ones are
you most looking forward to that's what
I'm looking most forward to halo 4
obviously pretty awesome the rest of the
games madden i probably pick up a madden
game every other year so i picked up one
you two years ago so i'll pick up 2012
the kind of fun anyway something there's
a season can be mad in 2012 of the
lockout ok probably not funny for
football fans anyway I am rambling jon
