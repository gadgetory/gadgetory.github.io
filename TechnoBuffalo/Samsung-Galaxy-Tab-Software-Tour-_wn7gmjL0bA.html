TechnoBuffalo here and I want to give
you a software tour of what's powering
the samsung galaxy tab in a lot of ways
it's very stuck Android 2.2 but in a lot
of other ways there are some very unique
Samsung tweaks that have gone in to make
this very tablet friendly so as you
consider which tablet might be right for
you this holiday season let's go ahead
and get started all right so let me
preface this by saying this is the
unlocked European version when this is
released in the US under all four major
carriers there will be some tweaks that
are going to be made so all these
features that you see today may not
actually make it to the carrier versions
just want to give you a full disclaimer
all right let's go ahead and unlock this
you'll see a pretty similar familiar
Android lock treat and this is running
Android 2.2 so go ahead and unlock it
and I do have the SIM card in here this
is the European unlocked version and I
want to sort of show you what
functionalities you're going to get when
you have a network connectivity so here
of course connected to AT&amp;amp;T however this
is just running on a Tinky's edge
network as the 3g bands in the u.s. are
not supported so I have not that any
on-screen customization here these are
what the icons are gonna look like when
you first turn on your Galaxy Tab
cenotes across the top we've got one two
three four five home screens gonna be
populated by a typical Google search
we've got a plug in here to show your
active applications you can sort of
control them typical task manager type
stuff I've got your phone video Maps
YouTube market and sort of your launcher
buttons across the bottom and currently
enough with this tablet when you're
going into phone you actually do get a
full phone functionality here cuz I do
have an AT&amp;amp;T SIM card let me show you
that it does work so let's go ahead and
jump back to the logs here and here is
that AT&amp;amp;T customer support all going in
column and show you that it works and it
will default into speaker and you can go
ahead and actually talk using the
built-in mic there on the right so you
hear that doesn't work you can put this
up to your head I mean it's just a big
phone probably more realistic is that
you
uses a Skype of like dagger didn't try
and kiss your pocket use it as a phone
you do have the option instead of now
that we're into the phone area take a
look at the customization that's been
done here so there is the dialer given
sort of default one for video call which
is going to launch a sort of a video
call client and if the person you're
calling is compatible it'll launch the
front-facing 1.39 Facebook camera
go ahead and view your log can see who
you just caught up at a picture they'll
show up right there you can email them
directly go ahead and view all your
contacts right here I don't have any
stored in here if you have your contacts
breaking up by groups and your favorites
you can tell this is european by the way
favorites is bailed so i'll go ahead and
jump back home
so that's or what the phone pumpkin is
gonna look like it's going to jump into
application take a look at some of the
other tweaks so this is gonna look very
familiar if you have a galaxy s device
this is sort of the TouchWiz way
different capsule a the icons instead of
sort of the wheel scrolling you got an
android 2.2
everything is encapsulated you scroll
horizontally so let's look at some of
the tweaks we have here let's go ahead
and jump right into and look at memos
looks a little bit different same
functionality just a little bit
customized here for the galaxy tab this
is a great time to actually show you
what the keyboard is gonna look like on
the galaxy tab so let's go ahead and
type memos here i'll go ahead and start
a new one a keyboard looks very similar
to what we see on an iphone just larger
a pretty responsive when you are gonna
get sort of your same great and growing
out of correct features if you decide
turned on that you get on any android
device
i'll hold it with two hands it's pretty
easy to type and i have it set for
haptic feedback and it works relatively
well of course when you rotate it you
are going to get a landscape keyboard
which is a bit hard to stretch your
thumbs out but certainly usable if you
want to sort of type on it like this i
like you can't learn iPad for example
gonna have a bit of difficulty
especially you have larger hands
seeing the keys so go ahead and jump
back out of this
let's go continue with some of the other
software tweaks and that we have so
we'll sort of continue this application
tour and you can see sort of what's
gonna be on here by default let's go
ahead look at calendar this is sort of
one of the things
thanks I'm heavily customised off or
tablet use so you've gone through your
month view I was gonna come up by
default you can't customize what shows
up and all your events would show up
down below you can view which month you
want to jump to right down at the very
bottom in front of you all of your tasks
for the day you can jump on over to
today I don't have any something's gonna
show up
you can choose a view by day week month
like we just saw list view don't have
any or today since I don't have anything
in there nice customization job that
Samsung's done it looks to be very
intuitive and user friendly
I use calendar functionality all the
time if you want to use it as a business
advice calendar function area is going
to be very important it'll close out of
this and jump back in and continue to
look we've got a music hub we'll go
ahead and accept that says clear so this
is really only going to work in Europe
unfortunately but it is a way for you to
straight download music the carrier's in
Samsung have said this will not be
present when it does launch in the US so
go ahead and sort of continue this tour
and look at what other tweaks we have
here as well so navigation you do have
Google Maps Navigation here of course
I've got some Samsung Apps and we're not
sure where that all these are going to
make it into the US version of the
majority of them we assume well click
uplink speed and TV application or
hottest QWERTY remote control let's go
ahead and take a look at one of these
here you can see what it is it's a free
video app that delivers an endless
riveting playlist of the most popular
video certain interests of time I won't
go and show you each one these are you
have to go ahead and install them
they're just down the links so we'll go
ahead and go back here news and weather
sort of a custom Samsung job I'll sort
of acquire your location and pull in
your most recent news
sort of a larger version of the news
widget that you can get on the home
screen and jump back home if they don't
let me a reader's hub this is where you
would download e-books and it looks sort
of familiar to what you'd see say on the
iPad or through an any nice graphical
interface bookstores who books news or
magazine
powered by Kobo here if you want to buy
books go ahead and agree to that very
quickly and I'll show you what the books
application looks like as well
so you can sort of that figure out if it
books of what you'd like it looks really
nice it's very sort of intuitive I can
go ahead and do new releases and pick
them up generally books range and you
are from two dollars all way up to sort
of 14 for new releases go back home here
and check out the rest of the
applications here actually speaking of a
book something jump back in and sort of
show you what the book store looks like
here so here's you book actually what
the your catalog of books is gonna look
like you've got a shelf interface here
so in the default book that comes with
this is the marvelous Land of Oz now
this does have a higher sort of pixel
density than the iPhone so you'd expect
or than the iPad rather so the exact
text to really pop I despite its smaller
screen and I will say that it's a very
readable text it looks very good not
necessarily as good to say eat inkwell
but this is definitely more readable
then something like the iPad is also
less the layer in direct sunlight as you
go ahead and go from page to page
so we get a very familiar animation look
even get a little bit of a noise as you
go through it's not as fast as I would
like but you can certainly couldn't go
through and read a book with relative
ease and some nice size to go ahead and
continue reading you can go ahead and
tap the side if you want to go back or
forward a page so I'll go ahead and go
back home and take a look at some of the
other applications that we're going to
get safe cuts are an OpenOffice
application let's go ahead and jump into
YouTube it's gonna look very familiar
typical YouTube player but let's see
what a youtube video looks like on the
screen aside so I'll do a quick search
for my channel which is John for Lakers
so John for Lakers it came up there and
we'll just play whatever the first one
comes up here motorola droid unboxing go
and see what that looks like it's a
pretty nice video experience whether
you're watching HD video when should can
certainly handle whether you're watching
even Flash content on the web a Democrat
in previous videos things just to work
well speakers are quite loud
as well which you're located right on
the bottom there so there's sort of me
talking in stereo go ahead and close out
of this from a browser standpoint things
do look a little bit different than
browsers between from sort of a standard
Android browser I'll show you that very
quickly I demonstrated flash in a
previous video so I'm not gonna recap
that all this does support flash 10.1
and slice to say things do work very
well you've got a few new icons up here
one looks like a phone's gonna jump into
the phone application not surprisingly
the other one is gonna open up your tab
and so you can sort of view your tab
browser tab open applications your tab
the windows here and you can go ahead
and select your stars to sort of
favorite your windows if you like
browsing is very smooth pinch-to-zoom
worked very well and overall things
don't work as you expect let's take a
look at some of the Samsung custom
widgets that come on here so we'll go
ahead and jump into widgets and you can
take a look at sort of all the choices
you're going to get with your Galaxy S
device so a key weather and a lot clock
calendar calendar clock daily briefing
beads an update Google search home
screen tips latitude market news and
weather picture frame power control
program monitor we got who financed
clock and YouTube some of those are
Samsung custom and some of them are
stock Android 2.2 and of course you are
also going to have sort of that same
wallpaper that you had before including
live wallpaper so you can sort of pick
what's here they really aren't anything
custom but the live wallpapers are a
deep present so guys this is sort of a
overview of the software of the samsung
galaxy tab gonna be a lot of competition
in the tablet market in coming months
and the Galaxy Tab was really aiming to
take a civic and peace of that market
