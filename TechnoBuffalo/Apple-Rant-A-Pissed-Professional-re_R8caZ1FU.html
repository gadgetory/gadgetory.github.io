TechnoBuffalo and as some of you may or
may not know I create shoot edit a lot
of the content you guys see on the
TechnoBuffalo youtube channel I also
have been a commercial director over the
last couple of years doing automotive
commercial work and I also create a
short documentary series called the
happiness stories reason I'm saying this
is that I wake up every morning and I
look at Adobe Premiere or any editing
software and I pretty much go to sleep
looking at that same editing software
it's a little bit annoying honestly
different story for another day so I
would consider myself a industry
professional or a pro user I rely on
these tools hardware and software to
make a living and pretty much since the
beginning of my career I've used Apple
hardware and software mainly because of
Final Cut Pro over the last probably
five to ten years
Apple has really begun to drop the ball
when it comes to their Pro users and
their needs if you guys remember a time
when Apple wasn't the biggest company in
the world and didn't make the iPhone
their core user base was really graphic
designers and photographers and
filmmakers and animators and all of the
above
however as they've begun to grow in the
consumer space they've really grown to
neglect that core user base and that's
what I'm going to be a little bit maybe
a lot angry about today so let's go
ahead and get started now the first sign
we saw a couple years ago was when Apple
neglected to update the Mac Pro now it
happened it just took forever we were
stuck with a really old design really
old processor and yes it was modular but
it just showed a lack of effort from
apples and now this sort of has
transitioned into the lack of a cinema
display today so when Apple did announce
their Mac Pro they were really proud of
the fact of how many 4k displays it
could output too but Apple doesn't make
a 4k display now sure you can get third
parties but the fact that they haven't
even bothered to update their cinema
display which is now like this fat and
it's fatter than the iMac which makes no
sense as a different sort of a different
conversation it's just a sign as to the
fact that they're not trying to really
cater to their pro users another example
is when Apple dropped their 17-inch
MacBook Pro and I guess this wasn't the
most portable machine but it was a great
desktop replacement for a lot of
photographers a lot of graphic designer
a lot of video editors the large display
made it yet a little bit difficult to
carry around but it made it worth and
easier when you were editing and
creating photos and just doing your
thing this also blends into what they do
with displays which was going from matte
to glossy now in the middle there they
did have the option to pick during
checkout but now you can't even get a
matte display for those of you don't
know the reason you want a matte display
if you're a video editor or photographer
or something the glossy displays
actually distort what your color space
really is it makes images more saturated
than they actually are it brings blacks
much deeper than they actually are so it
doesn't give you an accurate depiction
of what your color grading or what your
editing which is incredibly annoying and
that brings me on to one of the huge
this was probably the most public
dropping with a ball Apple hat in terms
of their Pro product Final Cut Pro X or
10 or whatever you want to call it or as
I call it iMovie on steroids when this
was first released we saw just a massive
drop-off of features this was when I
immediately switch from Final Cut Pro 7
to Adobe Premiere there's very little
flexibility within the software and
that's probably the best way I can
explain it a professional piece of
software works for you so at the office
we have myself we have Andrew we have
Mark we're all working on editing and we
all work in different ways but we can
customize Adobe Premiere to work for us
Final Cut Pro X forces you to work in
the way that Apple thinks you should be
working which is a very sort of hobbyist
way of approaching editing and it really
makes everyone's life much more
difficult when you rely on their
software to make a living and this
really bothered me because if you go on
Apple's website like today they're still
advertising themselves as if they're for
like artists on their homepage it says
look at what artists have made with all
these Apple products and sure their
regular consumers and I'm not saying
regular consumers can't make art I'm
just saying there's a big difference for
professionals who relied day in and day
out for something to work and work
efficiently for them to be able to pay
the rent and make a living and pay their
bills and there's difference between
someone who is a hobbyist and who
doesn't have deadlines to hit who
doesn't have clients and huge budgets
waiting for them to deliver a product
and I'm going to keep going you have the
iPad pro this is just an abomination in
my opinion not the product itself but
the fact that it's called an iPad
rrrow what is pro about it you could
take a great device or not a great
device preying on who you are and that's
a different conversation but the truth
is is that on iOS there's no way you're
making that a pro device no professional
graphic designer is walking to work with
just an iPad pro saying this is all I
use it may be something to use in
conjunction but to pitch is a pro
product when it's running iOS really is
just false marketing in my opinion I
don't know if Apple is trying to make
the regular consumers feel more
professional than they are or if they've
just not cared to fix their pro line or
rename or rebrand and finally the
whopper the last one I mean honestly I
could keep going on and on on you have
aperture which they dropped in the
dropped opportu didn't replace with
anything Ralph at our offices to switch
to Lightroom just another example but
the Whopper to me is that the 13-inch
MacBook Pro that you buy today comes in
with a 5400 rpm drive it's 2016 please
tell me what industry professional can
use a 5400 rpm drive and get much done
7200 would be one conversation but to be
honest if it's a pro device it should
have an SSD not necessarily PCIe but SSD
at least so that's it for this video
guys thank you so much for watching
thank you for listening to me yell and
complain for what felt like an hour I'm
actually going to a smile now leave us a
comment blow with your thoughts and
really curious as to what you guys think
if I'm the only one who's this angry
leave us a thumbs up if you're happy and
you like this video hit subscribe and I
will see you guys in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
