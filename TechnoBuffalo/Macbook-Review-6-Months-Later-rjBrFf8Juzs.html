about six months since i've had my
macbook unibody aluminum model i wanted
to give you an updated review so it's
been just about six months since i've
had the unibody macbook it's 2.4
gigahertz configuration and overall i've
been very very very happy with it my
enthusiasm hasn't waived since i first
bought it but things aren't as rosy as
they were on day one so let me fill you
in first off to my boot up time has
slowed drastically i went from the maybe
10 to 15 that I had when I first got it
now it takes it good probably 45 seconds
almost a minute to fully boot up and be
ready to use it's not that big a deal
but is something that's very noticeable
and I think it's probably a fault with
OS 10 leopard and it's file management
system then it is the computer itself
don't like something to keep in mind
hopefully they upgrade to snow leopard
and in the next few months we'll fix
those issues when it boots up at this
day on the blue screen for quite a while
so the new things that came out with the
unibody macbook the keyboard and
trackpad the backlit keyboard I thought
that I was going to use a lot knows the
reason that I got the 2.4 gigahertz but
as it turns out i'm really not using the
back like that much i'm taking notes in
class but you know usually it's it's
light enough and i'm not even utilized
the back way back most the time I turned
off to save battery so the new trackpad
I was really excited about the new
trackpad I thought there was a lot of
room I was really looking forward to
using the gestures as it turns out most
of the time now I use an external mouse
I found the clicking on the trackpad
about the button to be a little bit
cumbersome and not necessarily zakir as
i would have liked if you don't click
towards the bottom it doesn't work
sometimes cooking with two fingers
doesn't always respond properly so using
external mouse has really been my
solution that being said i love the
gestures on the trackpad i use a four
fingers for expose and show desktop all
the time I think those are absolutely
fantastic I look forward to more
utilization of the trackpad multi
capabilities kind of as we progress
another thing I still love about the
computer is i love the weight and i love
the size i'm able to throw into my
backpack and really not worried about
being weighed down or having sideways
shoulder from all the weight from it it
really is very very nice and very light
easy I've carried it everywhere for two
quarters of school now two chords your
graduate school and I haven't had you
know any issues with dings or scratches
it has been very very very durable I
could keep it in a neoprene case but it
looks just as good as it did on day one
also the glossy screen I've actually
been enjoying I've always been a fan of
glossy screen so that wasn't surprising
but glare firstly overhead glittering an
elector behind you shooting drop around
the computer it's not been as bad as
those people have said it actually found
it to be extremely usable so if the
glossy versus non glossy screen is the
issue for you hopefully this will help
offset some of your concerns the
computer is still as fast as it was my
first god as far as processing and
multitasking really is a very quick
machine and OS 10 really makes use of
the tube gigs built-in ddr3 RAM very
nicely it's really quite enough also I
dual-boot using bootcamp with windows
vista for some school related programs
and this day as i showed my benchmark
actually runs very smoothly and really
quickly actually runs much faster than
some of my classmates fully loaded
Dell's that's with 4 gigabytes of ram
and even some with solid state drives
it's really gotta give credit to Apple
for building a great machine for OS 10 I
also a great machine for running Windows
if that's what you needed to do so I'm
again I've been really happy with its
performance overall I couldn't have
asked for more but I need my windows I
have it when I need my Mac cookies most
of the time I have that too I have not
installed parallels or vmware fusion on
it or any other virtualization software
so i can't speak for the speed of
virtualization on the machine but having
only two gigabytes of ram i assume that
the will be as fast as native booting
and probably have a little bit of slow
down due to ram
kishan's something to keep in mind do I
regret my purchase absolutely not I'm
thrilled that I got it I probably would
have just bought the slower version said
ago after the 2.4 but live and learn I
don't think that point to difference is
really that big a deal and the backlit
keyboard what I thought I needed turns
out I didn't need it that badly so I'm
going to keep in mind if you're looking
to buy a new macbook alright guys so I
don't give me real quick overview I love
the computer i'm thrilled with it i
think if you make the decision to go for
the macbook you'll be happy to the last
point that i want to talk about real
quickly is graphics and HD and 3d
graphics with the new nvidia integrated
chipset that's actually far exceeded my
expectations as far as integrated
graphics card goes I think it's
absolutely fantastic i can watch HD
video without hiccup or slow down which
is really nice and they've been done
some 3d rendering just some tests on it
and actually has been very impressive
computer doesn't get that hot as well as
i mentioned in the review just really
nice just in the upper left hand corner
on the bottom of the processor it is
rather than you can keep it on your lap
and not worry about frying off your
business so and you guys just a real
quick update hope you enjoyed you leave
