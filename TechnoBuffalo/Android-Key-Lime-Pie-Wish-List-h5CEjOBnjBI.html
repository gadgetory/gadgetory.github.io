technobuffalo here google i/o is coming
up very quickly next month I thought
this would be a fun time to put together
my wishlist for the next generation
android operating system android 5.0 key
lime pie let's go ahead take a bite
let's go ahead and start with the first
one and these are no particular order
first complete android back up so i know
there's some things you can do if you
root and they're a third party that i'll
do some backups but i want is what iOS
has a full backup that it can restore on
any Android device my home screen will
be the way it was my apps will be the
way they weren't if there's something
that was unique to that particular
platform that manufacturer then maybe
that wouldn't show up but everything
else would be exactly the same including
SMS MMS contacts that is what I'm hoping
for so fingers crossed taking up SMS the
next feature i would love key lime pie
to have is SMS integration across
multiple devices including tablets and
that's a rumored future that actually
we're hearing key lime pie might
actually have so if you use a nexus 7 or
nexus 10 all your texts and stuff will
show up right there as well the next one
visual voicemail there are a ton of
third-party visual voicemail apps for
android i use youmail some carriers will
put visual voicemail bundled in but I
want it got completely included and
working seamlessly with the native
dialer in android i would love to be
able to see that in their next skirling
notification sounds I'm like kind of a
weird one I know but imagine the news
feet in the drop dead notification bar
or a stock ticker like iOS we could see
more information from an email besides
just a few lines or text from a social
network notification they can be kind of
cool to improve notification tray
hopefully Google's gonna be something
like that next is a rumor we've been
hearing quite a bit and if I was to
guess on any of these that would come
true this would be the one battle I
would like more than just google talk
and Google Hangouts think we need to see
is a unified chat platform that combines
clients across windows mac android iOS
etc that could be a huge win over I
message which doesn't really expand to
the PC unfortunately so if you can just
sit at a desk top where the mac or pc
and build a message and i know that
we've got
is a google chat does kind of that but I
would like a more seamless experience
and Google's got Babel ready to go so if
you'll be able to get a Babylon alright
so this is a big one for me I want pure
Android always as an option and I doubt
this is going to happen but I would love
for them to be a new set of API or new
regulations over it might be four key
lime pie the manufacture skins on top of
it data adhere to certain rules which
meant that it could be turned off if you
wanted to so imagine going up to pick a
brand new HTC One and you realize and
sense isn't for me flick it off suddenly
you are using native Android go get your
brand new s4 look and touch with no
thank you you get native Android
experience I would love for the skin to
be a user option and also that could
mean is that you could download other
skins imagine running sense on a samsung
device now I know this is probably never
gonna happen but I really really like to
be able to have the choice well then I
want to run skinned version of Android
or just a native unadulterated pure
Android love and we've kind of seen the
first step of these skins being able to
be turned off like on facebook home so
maybe there is some way to do that with
everything I'd be super happy next
actionable NFC NFC at least for me has
not been super usable so instead of
choosing a song or picture then choosing
to send it why can't we just tap NFC
enabled device together and then choose
what we want to send that seems much
more seamless so instead of slapping a
picture and then tapping it just tap the
phones select picture right on there you
can send anything that you want that
would work out well for me alright next
what's go to native multi-view support
so Samsung offers this on its handsets
but why not give it the native option to
run applications side-by-side or in
smaller windows or like pop out video
like on Samsung's devices processors are
beyond capable of handling this now then
could be really cool to see the great
way to sort of improved multitasking I
think you make thing you just look kind
of cooler so the obviously are a lot of
things underneath the hood I'd like to
see like to see project butter continue
to get more buttery as far as new
features these are the ones that I would
really like to see am I missing
something leave your comments down below
let me know what you want to see in key
lime pie love to hear your thoughts give
this video a big fatty thumbs up i'm jon
rettinger from technobuffalo i'll see
you guys in the next video
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
