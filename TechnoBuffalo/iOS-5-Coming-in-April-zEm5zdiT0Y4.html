technobuffalo here with the ipad 2
rumors put to rest and with some
concrete information seems like the
Apple rumor mill never stops turning
this time it is iOS 5 and mobile me if
you watched my iOS rant right before the
ipod to event there'll be a link down
below i lamented about iOS how I thought
that certainly needed innovated when the
launched in 2007 however it remained
very very scale and been passed by the
competition in a lot of ways most
notably with notifications and
lockscreen information I'm not going to
recap the whole breadth of that rants
the point being it needs a better system
and you shouldn't have to jailbreak to
get those options well it looks like
those concerns might finally be putting
to rest via macrumors.com the german
site and for you german readers out
there i'm sorry i've been a totally
massacred the presentation of this
though macker come da de is reporting
that Apple is gearing up for yet another
press event to take place in mid-april
either the 14th or the 15th which is a
thursday or friday to announce developer
preview of iOS 5.0 which is expected to
be a complete revamp of the iOS system I
certainly wouldn't expect anything huge
and drastic like widgets but I would
definitely expect new notifications and
multitasking to be one of the key things
that are brought up now multitasking ow
exists on iOS it's more of an app
switching system then true multitasking
I really think that we'll see something
along those lines if you go through your
guild breaking app stores whether you go
through cydia or one of the other
repositories you can see that there are
just a myriad of tweaks and potential
that iOS can do now it's not really far
from Apple to go through and look at
what's been done in the jailbreak
community and take influence from that
so if you have a jailbreak an iPhone
look at your phone see what features
you've implemented on there and think of
what you would want Apple to offer stock
out of the box people shouldn't have to
jailbreak to get some of these key
features being a point the last focus of
this alleged event on the 14th or 15th
it's all supposed to be a update to
mobileme going free and offering a
myriad of cloud services most notably
some sinking and iTunes we saw some
itunes playing ability come with iOS 4.3
is supposed to get full access to your
iTunes library and contents everything
I'll wirelessly done a little more
elegantly than what we have now thought
is we might actually get wireless
syncing as well so you have to plug your
phone or iPad it to get your sinking on
now this does line up with what we saw
with iOS four point oh last year which
is actually announced on april eight so
generally there's a year release cycle
so between april eighth of 2010 and
april 14th or 15th of 2011 obviously you
don't have to do math that's just about
a year so what do you guys want to see
in iOS 5 kind of curious sound off down
below if you want to sort of revamp and
we hear my thoughts on iOS four and what
Apple needs to do to regain their once
illustrious operating system links are
going to be down below John record your
technobuffalo see you next video bye bye
