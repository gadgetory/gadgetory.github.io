TechnoBuffalo and the pantech discovers
one of the few devices being announced
this time around at CES 2013 in Las
Vegas coming to AT&amp;amp;T I'm January 11 so
this friday for 4999 is packing some
killer specifications it was really are
announced rather this morning and packed
some awesome specs to boot it's got a
1.5 gigahertz dual-core Snapdragon s4
CPU it's got a gigabyte of rams this
thing is fast and really what pantex
looking at here this is appealing to a
bunch of different demographics whether
you're a first-time smartphone buyer
you're somebody that's looking for an
awesome device maybe you walk in dead
set on a 1 x plus or galaxy s3 but you
like you know what that's a little bit
too pricey this could be a perfect
device for you because build quality
wise it's right up there in the time
that I've had to play with it and it's
got some mate specs to boot like I said
1.5 gigahertz dual-core Snapdragon s4
CPU it's got one gigabyte of RAM it's
running Android core point with pantex
custom skin although pantech tells me it
will be updated to Android 4.1 at some
point in the future it's got a four
point eight inch 1280 x 720 p display so
HD display on this device and again
keeping in mind the 4999 price point you
really got a device here this packed to
the gills with specs where gets even
cooler the camera on the back is 12.6
megapixels with 1080p HD video recording
and you got a front-facing shooter as
well and a 2100 milliamp hour removable
battery design-wise got some stereo
speakers over here on the side as you
can see on both the writing on the left
with your volume rocker on the left side
your micro USB charging port at the
bottom your 3.5 millimeter headphone
jack and power button at the top and
then let's get into the meat here and
see what comes on the device it is one
device that comes with a tts drive mode
application let's go in here and take a
look at it really quickly there it is
drive mode and it's a cool application
that's kind of part of 18 TS it can wait
campaign where you can turn on drive
mode and you can utilize this to really
make your drive a little bit better in
the end the fact that you won't have to
worry about people texting you and doing
things like that while you're driving
it's a nice feature I'm a big fan as you
know of 18 tease it can wait campaign so
be sure to check it out at it can wait
dot org but it's nice that these devices
are coming preloaded with software just
like that so 16 gigabytes of internal
storage here you've got a microSD card
slot as well so expandable and again
like I said android 4.0
they do say it'll be updated at some
point in the future so don't let that
deter you too much if you're an Android
purist you like that latest and greatest
version of Android keep in mind it will
be updated very soon but really a nice
fan I suspect device keeping in mind
this is 50 bucks pantex marketing
campaign is going to be what are you
going to do with that extra hundred and
fifty bucks as you can see on the table
here I can't tell you to the movies
you're going to go take your significant
other to dinner i'll let you be the
judge there from CES 2013 I'm Aaron
