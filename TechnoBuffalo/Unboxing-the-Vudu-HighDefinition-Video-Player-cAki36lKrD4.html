lakers calm we're gonna try something a
little bit new here today my good friend
and colleague Brendan minmin who lives
on the east coast got some very cool
tech that I want to share with you guys
and since I don't have it no way for me
to show it to you so I asked him to make
a video and/or series of videos
detailing his experiences with it so I
hope you guys enjoy it's the first time
we've had anybody else other than me on
the channel just a little experiment
we're trying so I hope you guys enjoy
and i'll see you in the next video hey
everyone spread a minimun here guest
editor for John for lakers calm and
today we're unboxing something really
interesting especially for the movie
buffs it's called the Voodoo player and
the Voodoo player is a streaming set-top
box so you plug in your internet
connection and you suddenly have access
to ten eleven twelve thousand movies
right on your TV now of course there are
a lot of other set-top boxes out there
right so we have apple TV we have xbox
360 which will now do streaming netflix
we have the roku player which does
streaming netflix we have ps3 we have
some blu-ray players that can stream
movies and of course you have the
regular old set-top box that you get
from the cable company be on demand
movies that aren't the greatest of
quality and that's one of the wet the
places that the Voodoo player really
excels so the Voodoo player is one of
the very few set-top boxes that can
support 1080p content and for those of
you that don't know 1080p is the top of
the top in terms of resolution for for a
high-definition feet blu-ray players can
do 1080p and they're pretty much the
only medium right now that you can get
1080p content on so I'm really
interested to see how good this quality
is and also the Voodoo player has a 250
gigabyte hard drive on board so you can
store movies if you decide to buy them
they have plans where you can buy a
movie for twenty bucks or if you want to
rent one kind of like you do with you
know the xbox 360 or your cable company
it's between a dollar and four dollars
for a 24 hour period so we're going to
get into the unboxing right now and I'll
see you in a sec all right so let's get
to the unboxing and while I'm doing this
I'm going to note something about price
the voodoo player has been changing a
lot in price so
just a few months ago they announced
that they would be selling it for 299 at
bestbuy com but they would give you two
hundred dollars in movie credits which
is actually a really good deal kind of
bringing the price of the player down to
ninety-nine dollars now as of as of
recently in December they've reduced the
price of the box to ninety-nine dollars
so now my guess is they're going to keep
it low because they really want people
to buy the device and hopefully they
bring it down even further all right
here we go let's see what we have here
it says it's a big box Wow let me add
take away the brown box here all right
it says the right movie right now so
this guy has outputs for HDMI for for
optical audio for digital coax pretty
much everything you need for your home
theater system if you have one or if you
just have a standard TV it will work
with that too alright so let's open this
up it says are you ready to voodoo
alright we've got a quick start guide
here that shows you how to put the
batteries inside the remote how to
connect it to your TV and everything
like that we've got the power connector
standard stuff here is the very very
interesting remote for the Voodoo player
there's nothing out there that's really
like this remote it's very interesting
it has a scroll wheel a small amount of
buttons really and here it looks like we
have all the cabling that we need so in
hdmi cable we have some composed
composite and component cables we've got
ethernet cable good and it looks like
over here well i'm not terribly sure
what this looks like an antenna have to
take a look at that later all right
alright and here is the actual player
itself it's a little heavier than I
actually thought it would be and I'm
going to take off this protective
plastic so we kind of get an idea of how
shiny it is well very shiny very nice
look to it very sleek okay now we've got
all the plastic off let's take a look
around the device to see what we have
here so nothing on this side except for
a USB port I wonder what that's used for
okay so here we are on the back and
let's take a look at all of the inputs
that we have and I'm going to go through
setting this up in the next video so we
have a remote antenna for the little
thing that we saw earlier this allows
the remote signal to come through then
we have component video and audio
s-video we have digital coax and optical
for audio which is really great get that
really high quality sound through
optical or digital coax HDMI for 1080p
streaming to a flat panel Ethernet to
connect to the internet another USB port
which is kind of interesting looks like
we have some sort of switch here for
analog video out for ati or 480p and a
power connector so that's pretty much it
for the unboxing for the Voodoo player
coming up in the next video we're going
to set it up and talk about the
experience with using it we're going to
go through the whole menu system had
activated and all that sort of thing so
you can determine if this would be a
good investment for your home theater or
for your television so that's it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
