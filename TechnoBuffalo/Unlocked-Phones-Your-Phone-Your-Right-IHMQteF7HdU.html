to you by lynda.com what's up everyone
john r ng from TechnoBuffalo here
earlier in the week i filmed a video
giving my thoughts on the iPhone 6 plus
two months later in that video I talked
to that unlocked phones being able to be
used on t-mobile on ATT and Verizon and
the comments section I got a ton of
questions on that so I want to go
through and run through all of that tell
you what you can do or not do with your
locked and unlocked items so before I
jump into what the iPhones can do or not
do let me first say that if you're
looking to pick up a unlocked Nexus 6
device the same thing is going to be
true with that device with the iPhones
that's also going to apply so if you
wanted to get an iPhone 6 or 6 plus for
this sort of sake of argument I'm just
going to say iPhone 6 instead of
reiterating both and you go to a carrier
store you go to your Verizon store you
go to your t-mobile store your ATT store
and you pick up a device on either
two-year contract on their next edge or
jump plan your device is going to be
locked and what a lock device means
that's only gonna be able to work on
that carrier you can't put another
company SIM card and have it be able to
work so that's sort of a very important
thing to note know oftentimes if you buy
a phone locked and you've gotten good
standing with your carrier after 46 80
days different carriers different
policies they will unlock your device
and what unlocked essentially means that
you can use it two different carriers
the idea is that if you're traveling
abroad you can pop in a different
country SIM card and be good to go so
here's where things get kind of
interesting Apple sells two different
versions of each phones the iPhone 6
plus
they sell versions the a-15 2 to look at
the back your phone you can see it there
and that is the same phone you are going
to get if you buy it from Verizon you
buy it from t-mobile and you buy from
ett sprint has a different phone that
fortunately it's not going to work for
I'm going to talk about for the iPhone 6
its model number a 1 5 for 9 you'll get
from all three of those carriers now if
you go to an Apple store and you buy the
device and again you do it on a contract
to the carrier device it's going to be
locked if you opt to pay full price from
an Apple store only your device will be
unlocked well
decide to pay full price for a Verizon
t-mobile
or AT&amp;amp;T you're going to get exactly the
same phone it's going to be either model
a one five two two for the iPhone six
plus or a one five four nine for the
iPhone 6 and when you do that that's
where things get really really
interesting again exactly the same phone
which means if you want to pick up a
Verizon iPhone 6 or 6 plus and the Apple
store only has 18 t models we're going
to pay full price you could pop in a
Verizon sip card and that phone will be
fully functional including all the CDMA
radios all the bands there are different
band supports for each phone except for
the Sprint version you're getting
support for every band on each with
those two models so you sort of explain
that a little bit more simply if you pay
full price for your phone at an Apple
Store your device will be unlocked
you're going to get exactly the same
phone you get if you buy from AT&amp;amp;T
exactly same phone you get if you bought
it for t-mobile and exactly the same
thing you get if you bought it from
Verizon now it's been sort of the same
for a while you can use a similar phones
on AT&amp;amp;T or t-mobile Verizon that was
kind of new the CDMA radios exist in
these devices and that's what Verizon
uses for the 3G and sort of other legacy
networks and those are all active here
you get a Verizon SIM card pop it in
everything's going to work and that
includes voice over LTE that codes
visual voicemail and everything else no
need to configure different pan settings
Apple will do all of that for you

that's it nothing else you have to do on
your end to get your phone to work you
go out to an HDD store and just request
a SIM card for an iPhone they'll give
you one same thing with t-mobile if you
want to set up a new account with
variety it's a bit tricky there systems
are a little bit squirrely essentially
you have to ask someone in the store to
activate a new plan on another iPhone
that they have because it's not going to
show up in their system as a Verizon
iPhone because they didn't sell it to
you but rest assured it is exactly the
same phone so you can ask them to
activate it on the store iPhone they've
got they've got an iPhone in their
pocket that will work to your SIM card
you pop it in and you are
hundred-percent on your way and a lot of
confusion about that if you pay full
price for device from a carrier so you
pay full price from t-mobile AT&amp;amp;T or
Verizon store your phone will not be
unlocked you can request it to be
unlocked but it will not come unlock so
that's the differentiating factor there
if you buy it full price from Apple
store you're good full price free
carrier store not going to work for you
so if you're waiting online try and get
your new phones trying it your Verizon
phone your t-mobile phone or you're 18 t
phone maybe you just pick up an unlock
device and be good to go I've tested it
on all three carriers voice over LTE
visual voicemail everything will work
just as if you bought it directly from
that store so bear that in mind and if
you don't trust me you want to try it
for yourself
walk into an 18 T store look at the back
of their phones they've got for their
iPhone models see what the model number
is either a one five two two or a one
five four nine up at 6 or 6 plus walk
through t-mobile store like the back of
their phones
welcome to Verizon sir look the back to
their phones you'll see it exactly the
same number app wasn't publicized this
you can view the information on their
website they don't really make it very
well-known but it's a nice way to sort
of take one phone anywhere you want to
go to all three major carrier Sprint's
networks a bit difference unfortunately
that's not going to work but any of
those three you will be good to go 100%
also want travel internationally of
course that will work as well again this
is also the same thing that's true with
the Nexus 6 and a ton of other devices
so if you want to get along device pop
in your SIM card and you are good to go
and I say that quite a lot but you are
you're just set and ready to rock which
is nice to be able to try any carrier
you want and I you've got that freedom
so one caveat that I do want to mention
you might throw a bit of a wrench in
this is most Verizon phones are indeed
sold GSM unlock so if you pick up a
Verizon phone that maybe you got on
contract or you bought from someone had
it on contract you should still be able
to take that phone over to t-mobile or
ATT but I definitely recommend popping
in one of the carrier SIM cards first to
make sure that's going to work for you
