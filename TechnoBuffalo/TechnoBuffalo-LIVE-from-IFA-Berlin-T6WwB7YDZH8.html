but what's going on everyone we are live
from IFA Aoife however you want to
pronounce of 2011 Cavaliers from GT vs
mark watson soldierknowsbest he must let
the soldiers best we are doing the trial
on of YouTube live on the TechnoBuffalo
channel we have a ton of awesome stuff
and talk about we're hoping at some
point for gonna be able to take some
questions I'm very animated as you can
tell I think you can do better we might
be taking questions from this computer I
know before beer this is a live stream
in a few hours afterwards it's a
different story ball together so go get
some questions as well we got a ton of
awesome tech right in front of us
already come out for my opinion show
hasn't even started yet so i'll move
this down here the big Easter resistance
I think mark yes this is awesome so this
is the new samsung note i just got a
announced today and so the first thing
you probably notice is the big screen
this is what five inches 5.1 yeah it's a
5.3 owari inch screen with a 720p
display it's a beautiful display it
looks fantastic it looks very sharp
what's all this stuff is still pretty
thin so this is a song it's a tablet and
it's
nope at all in one it's also Callie's
dream device I think it might be so
here's the deal i have an iphone
currently my iphone contract is coming
up in about a week and i keep debating
what i want i want definitely an android
phone for sure and the thing is is I
want the 7-inch tab I love the galaxy
tab right but I keep then I saw this and
I'm like oh but then I can have all in
one the phone and the tablet and that
might be my dream device I I'm playing
with it we're all loving it there's a
lot to love you look at it font the
resolution of 1280 x 800 you expect the
screen to be beautiful and then you see
it in person yeah and it I mean you're
you're shocked at how awesome it is now
the big question is does it fit in your
pocket now think John Barban demonstrate
their run the test we will can certainly
move out of our cameras pulled out his
black bear you know the blackberry 9900
we're gonna try the pants test we do
what everybody wants to know when I saw
that is like it's great and I fit in my
pants now i cant i can see the joke oh
she said yeah if I could hear right so
let's try it no no I'm gonna and I'm not
wearing tight skinny you know emo jeans
here normal go down that path I am
normal dude Jews on alright so without
fall out over here live on camera
hopefully we're on here obviously I can
fit this in my pocket ah I take it the
room just figured out that much and you
know what I can sit down with it it's
not uncomfortable not that I'm you know
it's there it definitely makes a big
rectangle your pants so you
being at all right you can definitely
definitely use it here's the thing it's
definitely not gonna fit in a girl's
pockets by far I mean even my iphone
sticks out you know and that's a small
device but I I am a tall girl by far
enlarged and I do not like to carry
purses I'm thinking I might be willing
to carry a purse for this thing so this
won't actually come with accessories
evidently you need a purse right of
course just but it's big enough for them
so this also has another really cool
thing about it we didn't talk about and
it lives on the bottom here it is check
it out want to give us a demonstration
sure so this is the notepad part of the
the notes and you just go into oops i
just went into the planner when you want
you go into the memo actually here we go
there we go so the samsung galaxy note
and you can scribble around you can make
your notes your to-do list so what do
you guys like to write on your notes on
your notepads so jealous yeah it is yeah
and but then there's also a little
button here on the stylus and if you
hold it down and then click they'll take
a screenshot and you get the vibration
with it so you know it's worked and then
you can say that you can cancel it you
can email it you can looks like you
might even be able to share via Facebook
so is it strange to get excited about a
stylist again I mean don't you remember
the old you know your palm days and
windows mobile 6 and 5 no likes to say
HTC Flyer also has a stylish but I
wasn't excited but it sucks yeah but
this one is done right and it's done
because there's a magnetic all right
yeah it's different and they do it right
so it you can be able to not gonna
accidentally write on it with your
finger anything like that but the style
is very very responsive or so but it is
it just shows how big things coming yeah
like you're so excited now for a stylus
which Apple tried to kill with the
capacitive touchscreen now we're
so excited to come back to it window
bells on my mac ya tomorrow oh good and
we actually have some sort of new retro
tech we change is an awesome
unintentional segue that was actually
fantastic some of the stuff that we
could you free show check in keep
bouncing in this is from TDK of all
people the people who made because that
shape right one of this big he's got you
have marked in the beatbox I always make
some right again it's just gonna block
you okay the TDK it's the three speaker
boombox and they put a lot of work into
it I mean the thing I've noticed first
is help fantastically beautiful it is
that we've got the cover on this front
speaker with the betweeners on the ends
rubberized oh it's rather very nice sure
bill bottom right how heavy is it
probably what everybody's wondering haha
oops the second stuff we have some
strong shoulders to uh I also made it so
that it will mount on a tripod oh really
really that's realizing so also shown in
the top the where it's rubberized the
indention like that's for an ipod or an
iphone you can plug it in via USB but
they didn't create the dock on it
because they didn't want that look
journal of a doc fun look at the battery
cover it takes it takes what 12 12 12 DS
just like the old days what sort of
ports is it up on it and one of the with
the audio options Oh on the other side
USB for
during plug an iPod to USB yeah and also
aligning our salute guideline in an
instrument in and you can mix them so
you can i play yeah you can't wait
something on my chest yeah you can play
something by a being on your iPod then
you can plug your guitar into the
instrument input and you can mix the two
it's a beautiful looking piece artner
it's just retro but modern at the same
time yeah I think it's cool and that's I
think it's 449 499 and available win now
it's available now the conversion is in
the best part oh that's right the two
speaker version is actually invest by
right now in the US and that's all I
ever done and the TDK phones also got a
very cool this is a press kit it's
actually in a taste which is a which is
very cool it's kind of fun to see the
creative exact rate of muskets yeah so
that's not the only fun stuff we have
we've got a ton of other awesome stuff
rocking in front of us mark has right in
front of him one of the new Samsung
cameras now the cool thing about this
camera is that you know a lot of times
you're trying to take a picture of
yourself you have no friends nobody
around you cut along yeah you try to
point it this way you don't know whether
you're in frame or not the facebook
picture yeah yeah somebody call that the
myspace picture I guess I balls through
the generations oh yeah well they fix
that problem with this display that
actually flips all the way up and we
turn it on pops out now you can see
yourself I thought I had to worry about
missing yourself in the picture and also
they put a shutter button on the back of
it right here to be a little bit more
convenient for you so now you can just
take it snap it he just you're gonna
show them that's a horrible digital can
you take a new facebook facebook picture
take a new profile i should all take one
LOL again
all right I thought I don't think that's
actually gonna go on my profile I just
ugly depth at picture no I I did enough
of that myself but that's called the MV
800 and the MV stands for multi view for
the two different views and that's 16
megapixels yeah and yeah there's also a
few other interesting things about this
camera first it has a capacitive
touchscreen yes which is kind of new for
a camera who's maybe I'll flip it back
around I get that picture off of it it
says 3 inch capacitive screen on it i
believe yes Lisa yeah so a 3 inch
capacitive screen you actually scroll
through and just like at the smartphone
and it's got smart frames and magic
mirrors now i think it's called magic
frame in it in that race Vegas man it's
magic frame cracked yes and magic ring
too oh man just equal so this the Magic
frame actually allows you to combine two
pictures so if you have one picture
maybe there's a picture frame or a
tablet and showing in it you can then
put a second picture inside that picture
frame which is very cool so take a
picture to your kids you can put them on
the cover of Time magazine yeah type
thing he also has live panorama so you
can sort of do that sweep panorama thing
that we see in sort of made popular and
Zoomer and prosumer cameras how does it
say 3d pictures as well I should does
have a three-way I think it's this one
as a 3d mode it's got it says too many
photos okay well so we were playing with
the earlier and I think it was on this
camera specifically though that we were
playing with it and I'm not we haven't
quite figured out the 3d because it
doesn't look exactly 3d but there's a
file when you import it on the computer
there's a file that maybe you just need
a 3d like read or essentially to so we
have the samsung we do guys we can even
we can ask you know maybe in a minute
and here we can find out so we've got a
lot of other great stuff on here in
front of us so this is the nx200 I've
been playing with both of these for like
two days two days and I really like that
when I think that's an awesome point and
shoot but this has me kind of drooling
it takes awesome photos we've taken some
pretty amazing ones with it you know
given the size and given the price point
and as interchangeable lenses so if you
actually this is all so let's change
this out this is the 16 millimeter lens
hold that way bring in the big guy this
is the baby 85 millimeter 1.2 1.4 f-15
yeah as a cover of course and it's huge
what is that a pretty little body with
this bitch Carolyn is all of your weight
wise to hold with the limbs obviously
the lens is what's going to pull the
weight in but the lot of body itself is
light enough that you just want to you
know throw it in your purse or pocket or
whatever but obviously the way it is is
a little heavy nothing near you know a
DSLR like a canon 5d
anything like that you were shooting
video with this do right yeah yeah the
video is pretty good as well this is
what what did we say that on megapixels
this was that is 20 21 23 8 I didn't
have any complaints about the video and
the pictures were pretty fantastic Oh
expert yeah you stupid from Samsung
nothin Ethan yes come on in hey we were
just explaining the nx200 and the MV 800
yes and my favorite campus of all time
so we had a question about the 3d button
on here yeah sure well I have a question
about that book but go ahead is it
shooting is it shooting in 3d yeah so
what we're doing is basically than if
the camera can tell how far far away
those are okay the same way that it
focuses and sending out that game to
measure the distance it's using that V
to decide how far things away are and
then it can calculate the 3d image
editor go ahead any of you back the 3d
you plug it into your Samsung yeah oh
just uh just keep it keep it right on
gmail so you basically you simply plug
that in your samsung 3d television or
any 3d television and the images will
playback on your TV I don't do can you
do it the computer program there are
some AC pro yeah I just standard the
format that encodes the community images
are it's a standard format so what I
love is imagine you had a wedding or
something you take pictures at your
wedding 3d put them up
it's like people were there if you're
taking features of your own wedding
that's right I mean that's what I
wouldn't open you're not yeah my wife
when it killed me well you can always
take additional pictures in that as de
having a photographer for the honeymoon
absolutely and this guy has something
really cool the whole the whole line in
the in the lenses yeah what does that
technology calls the I function I
function yeah and walk us through maybe
with the i punctured us we can sort
maybe hold that all this if you want
okay i do need two hands for this okay
so if you have one of these sort of
cameras what you're going to need to do
is you're going to adjust your you're
going to need to adjust your uh shutter
speed your ISO all that sort of thing
and the way you normally you're going to
do it on a camera like this is you're
going to go into a menu so in this case
we have a menu that looks kind of like
this and then you sort of written have
to go through the screen and you know
select something and hit a button and
then move the dial a big hierarchy of
men use your ID Antonio so the poor the
whole point is we're saving you that
trouble you push the I function button
let me go in back into the shooting mode
so you can see how that works so if you
come becomes like a shortcut button
right on right on the lens right what it
does is you have this ring up here is
your focus ring so it's basically like a
shift key to the focus ring I just had
to go into manual mode because when
you're in auto mode you can change right
right so all you do is hit I function
right here
and you've got all the minute of options
you see now able to adjust the aperture
and right in from the ring the ring
becomes that the selector right and you
just hit it again and you can adjust the
shutter speed right from the ring
alright so you don't have to mess with
the menus it's all right we're hand all
right and I think it bodes well for you
know pro photographers if they want
something when they don't want to carry
around there there big camera equipment
I think they'll kind of like that that
view that's right that's right and of
course I we have think about 10
different lenses you can snap onto here
and we have some quite a bit smaller
than that that's what I love about the
nx200 is it it's um let me show you
something mark on one second understood
show them what it looks like without the
lens because you can't see how small the
camera is that giant yeah we have 60 I
didn't see it oh yeah you did okay so
yeah you can see how tiny mini cameras
this guy also has a hot shoe yeah that's
right with ya not it's a powered hot
shoe so what that means is we give you a
lens in the box and you can actually
plug the lens right in there that's the
OG Calgary million meters I'm sorry Thea
the flash yeah the the hot shoe you plug
the flashing to be hoppin any little
work from powered from the BI camera you
don't need batteries so you can have a
tiny little flash and that's in the box
that's and so you haven't actually
officially announced the lenses we
enough some of them but we're sort of
gradually announcing more and more
lenses and so we're gonna have a whole
image collection Eliza's will you do
price points yet one half price point
soon we haven't finalized all the price
points yeah some thank you guys I have
that I keep at you have lenses let's
just say we have you have multiple
choices multiple options we have lenses
for every possible application there you
go thank you so much thank you very much
thank you push it out take that with you
Cheers haha that was even he's awesome
it has been our friend for the past few
days um so if that wasn't enough and the
show has even started yet we saw waiting
for leaving this for a little while and
we still have more stuff we do so we've
got to you you guys worry about anybody
talking about next me yeah um so this
the viewsonic that is the viewpad 7x yes
and it's a tablet it's actually the
world's first or the first tablet that's
going to come to market on 7-inch with
3.2 Android so it's got a skin I'm
trying to find the power button hold on
a minute they're different everywhere it
has a nice skin obviously the Android
you're going to be familiar with we hit
this little button at the bottom and
this scant the skin is called view view
scene and win so I'm going to have John
here show you guys you it's like a
carousel yeah you throw it around and
you can put all your weather and your
maps and your traffic and all that but
then if you leave it for a little while
it actually acts as a screensaver so
it'll start popping up relevant
information in that module so if it's
traffic it'll start popping up maybe
pictures of traffic or I haven't really
looked at all ended exactly what it's
showing but I'm waiting so i can get
flying toasters there you go that would
be on it and i believe that's the
world's first three point two 7-inch
exactly from tablet exactly she kind of
course it's doing all kinds of neat
stuff and it's a Tegra 2 in here and
you're going to get some not very fun oh
yeah that you would expect it someone
all kinds of neat stuff you're on it
type of course exhibit is like a SD card
slaughtering think you're gassy I think
it has mike
hdmi done yeah he does have a yeah hdmi
out the point of writing 3000 sonic
monitor oh and the camera is 5
megapixels on back and two in front so
it should take very clear phone yes I
like it it's a little thicker than you
know like the tab if you will but I'm
gonna have to but I want to hang up for
weeding feels good yes so I like that
one oh my gang go ahead we get that the
only viewsonic you want to talk about
this one yeah okay so this is the
viewsonic i guess you guys didn't stop
by their booth um the it's just a phone
it's but it is dual dual SIM card so you
can actually I'm gonna have you show the
dual SIM cards there so you you can have
two running at the same time you can
have voice on one network you can have
data on another network and use them
both at the same time if you want to
separate your personal life and your
business life you can do it that way if
you travel a lot you can have one going
all the time for unlimited I mean there
are a lot of different uses for it and
it's super light feel that I mean it's
not the lightest one I've ever felt but
I but it was really light and it feels
good it looks good and what else that
that one is in Europe it's going to be 2
50 euros available in like two weeks yep
and
they're expecting it to come to the US
but we don't know what form that's going
to take yet in terms of you know
contracts or networks that kind of thing
yep there's a lot of kind of cool uses
to that dual sim thing I didn't know of
another phone that is no I don't
evidently the dual sim technologies
built right into Android it's just not
activated in most homes because they
don't have two SIM card Yeah right
taking advantage of it and it's built
and faked right into settings so when
you want to make a phone call you can
actually pick which sim you want to call
from or app calls come in on so we're
traveling right here if you've got your
AT&amp;amp;T sim card in one and you want to buy
one of those all-you-can-eat data
sometimes you pop it in and you're good
to go yeah it is more lit up it's got
nice it is running froyo though and so
we're no no gingerbread action alright
so here's the thing i actually like for
a better really yeah it's cold and
delicious but from the android
standpoint you take 40 you over
gingerbread yeah what I just it's more
solid maybe yeah it's been a been around
a little bit longer so maybe I'm just
setting my old habits I don't know but I
just like it better at honeycomb
especially drives me nuts a little I
don't think it's as intuitive that I
agree with ya if you let someone try and
figure out honeycomb on their own it's
not going to happen unless they're a
geek geek you know like a hardcore game
but regular people can you imagine the
comments right now as we're saying
something bad about Android you can we
get almost just imagine them going
straight guys also to where we're not
all right I love Android I just a honey
kong I can't wait till ice cream
sandwich yes and might I say they always
every time we see the freaking logo i
want on ice cream and you get the cold
and deliciousness of froyo you know
rolling right in there yeah so you know
everybody wins supposedly coming October
ish yeah
ya think so you know around that in the
Nexus crime is sort of a name we keep
hearing throat yes didn't wait to see
that Prime allegedly built by by Samsung
we also that wasn't the only stuff that
we had we don't have in front of us we
also had a ton of cool stuff come out
from Sony that had their keynote
yesterday yeah so I'm Sony yesterday had
their press conference and it showed off
the s1 s2 tablets which are now called
the tablet pee in a tablet s and so you
know the the main tablet has the 9.7
inch screen looks more like a
traditional tablet but also that came
out with the smaller one which is a
clamshell type of format and so it may
basically looks like this piece of paper
demonstration but that has a lot of good
uses they're probably good for reading
books or yeah or something like that and
also is small as well so if you folded
up you'll be able to fit in your pocket
so thick from the pictures and I didn't
get to go to that press conference I
think it get a chance to get my hands on
it but we'll see you tomorrow so if you
were going to pick up one of them which
I want you get which sony tablet is Mark
Watson gonna walk into this sony style
storm by i like the idea of the smaller
clamshell type of form factor i can see
a good amount of uses for it but i'll
probably have to wait and see do i get
my hands on it but did you guys get a
chance to play at the kyocera echo that
sort of had that dual know how you do
that wasn't CES though right I think I
plate yeah so do you think it's going to
be weird having that sort of gap in the
middle of the two screens it will be it
will be but may get used to it you have
to get used to it but it's also that way
on the 3ds no that's true too I envisage
separate screens I suppose we're trying
to make it 2-1 victory for browsing of
the web page or something or is it the
operating system one on each what I
think most importantly the applications
will probably take advantage of it so
you may be playing a game and then on
the bottom they have the map of the game
at top you actually plan it so we'll see
what the developers do with it so Sony
gains the tablet games kind of kind of
interesting to see
definitely and also the oh yeah the 3d
visor which i'ma know how you're gonna
wear that on in public they came up with
a of awesome ya know oh man Oh basically
it's a visor you put in your head and it
creates it make you feel like you're
watching a 750 inch screen like a nice
sunny all right I mean looking out of a
movie but wait what how it does it feel
different oh that was the one in from
CES okay okay so i have seen that one
right so it is it is 3d and you attach a
ride in your head I think it does have
headphones inside of it to come down my
ears yeah they do yeah that's that's
going to be 5.1 surround sound so still
sounds pretty nice and you can plug your
ps3 right in yeah and get your game on
I'm gonna sound super nerdy but from
Star Trek data you know they have those
glasses it looks like a bigger version
of noe do we really think that we're
gonna be wearing these things I can't
imagine a world where we actually use
these it's gonna be for those geeks in
the gamers I think they'll probably
either the best one to get it and then I
think it costs like seven hundred eighty
dollars yeah so that's gonna definitely
thinking sunday afternoon when I want to
watch football and my wife doesn't want
to watch football you know it could pop
that thing on you got a movie screen you
know right in front you can that's shame
it's in 3d but I'm such a klutz that all
I'll be so immersed in the experience
that I think I can get up and go get
spot or whatever and bam ok bound to
happen so I don't know what do you guys
think of that I a nice update that you
had buyers are more of just like cool
tech because they can do it all right
yeah Tony's mother's company that sort
of push the envelope to see if they
could shame you know just like them
bringing a Walkman back that's gonna
yeah I don't know about that but yeah so
yeah so anything no no I mean they bring
it back I think they're trying to go at
the ipod touch a little bit right try
yeah
garden no they just announced it be
announced a new yahoo a new lineup of
them yesterday and they announced a
multi-touch you think reader to my can
remember class trying to enjoy too yeah
that's gonna crazy multi I mean it's
eating it's not a LCD display correct
interesting it's gonna be weird
somebody's doing a little bit of
everything now so we'll see what they do
with it so my random story my
grandfather just started using a kindle
and I gave him an hour kindle class and
now he's downloading books like crazy
it's easy for him to you do you think
people that maybe aren't so techy can
use that one yeah I think that's a good
alternative to I mean I think a lot of
people first thing ipad but I think if
you're just going to be doing a lot of
reading books or magazines or whatever I
think the kindle or this new sony
ereader would be perfect for so the
great in sunlight so can't really beat
them and yeah as always techs are aimed
at the nerdy you know the nerdy crowd or
is it because I mean for our parents and
grandparents as well that sort of are
looking at all the stuffs and that looks
neat yeah that's the one challenge to
think Sony is going to have its
marketing it so people can understand
that it's not going to be just for the
techies yeah and I think that's a good
thing that Apple does it you know
commercials kind of bring you in make
you feel anybody can use it so it's not
just the commercials though I mean the
marketing is as it has that aspect but
you know I mean in terms of watching a
grandmother or grandfather play with the
ipad it's incredible I mean I feel like
part of my job is absolutely play with
the devices but also to observe other
people playing with it and so that's
what I spend a lot of time doing and to
