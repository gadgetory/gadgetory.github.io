Sangin from TechnoBuffalo and Apple
music is officially live it launched
with iOS 8.4 today and with it is
Apple's new 24/7 beats 1 radio station
we've been using Apple music since this
morning and here's a quick overview of
Apple's new music streaming service
Apple music so once you've installed iOS
8.4 the first thing you should notice is
the new Apple music icon setting up
Apple music is fairly simple and quick
first you'll be able to select whether
or not you want a free three-month trial
which we're assuming you do then you'll
be able to choose either a single plan
for $9.99 a month or a family plan which
offers support for up to six people for
just $14.99 which i think is a steal so
I opted in for that one next you'll
select the drawn resume usek that you
like followed by artists within those
genres that you also like it's a way for
Apple music to cater music to your
tastes after that you'll fill in some
brief account details like your username
that's used for commenting on the
connect section for Apple music then
you'll dive right into the application
now if here subscribe to iTunes Match
your music from your old music
application will be automatically added
on to your current library to give users
a seamless experience now if you guys
don't have iTunes Match you'll be able
to sync your music via iCloud music
library which essentially uses your
iCloud accounts to sync all of your
music across all of your devices so
let's go ahead and explore how Apple
music works and looks so in terms of the
user interface it's broken into five
main tabs for you new radio connect and
my music the first tab are all the
recommendations that Apple thinks you'll
like and arcader based on the genres and
artists you choose during the setup this
should change this Apple music starts to
learn your listening habits and the new
tab shows the latest album releases hot
tracks top songs and the like it's
pretty standard the radio tab provides
access to beats 1 radio as well as other
radio stations for recently played music
and variety of feature stations like
pure pop sound system that makes tape
and more the connect tab is Apple musics
attempt at social media allowing you to
view content such as pictures songs
music videos and other multimedia from
artists that you follow finally the my
music tab provides access to all of the
songs already on your phone songs you
match with iTunes Match and any music
you've added through Apple music Apple
music also includes exclusives like
Taylor Swift's album 1989 which I'm not
ashamed to admit I already purchased
later
though Apple music will become home to
other exclusives at least that's what
the company's promising other than the
hundreds of thousands of music included
in Apple music there's also music videos
inside Apple music now I do wish however
there was a dedicated section for videos
instead of a small area existing inside
the new tab overall I think most folks
are gonna find what they're looking for
in Apple music so long as they're
willing to take that time to look so
moving on to beats one beats 1 radio is
a subsection of the radio tab which
itself is a subsection of Apple music
it's Apple's 24/7 live streaming music
station that features live DJ's live
music interviews and more it's also free
in doesn't required the $9.99 or $14.99
monthly plans to access it's a really
fun spin on radio and feels like a bit
like what you'd expect from satellite
radio the with just a single station as
songs play you can choose to favorite
them or add them to your library
allowing you to store them for offline
playback at a later time if they're
available within beats one music you'll
see a live schedule of the DJs and
interviews coming up each day so you can
always check back later on if you don't
like a particular DJ or interview now
when it comes to sharing this is one
aspect of Apple music that so far I can
tell needs improvement you can't share
to other Apple music listeners instead
you're limited to sharing to iMessages
email or third party apps so what are
our final thoughts of Apple music well
we've been only using Apple music for a
couple of hours and we plan to continue
using it for the next few weeks and
months at least in tandem with Spotify
until my free trial ends I'm looking
forward to discovering new music and
finding out if Apple music spluttered
new tab is actually a great place to
find new artists songs videos and more
or if over time it remains just as
confusing and intimidating as it looks
right now anyways this is just a quick
overview of Apple music on iOS the
Android app should be coming this fall
and iTunes out for Mac and PC are
rolling out now before we end this video
I wanted to let you guys know that we
are selling a limited edition
TechnoBuffalo shirt for 10 more days
it's got the awesome beat logo and the
TechnoBuffalo logo in the back so it's
super awesome you guys could rock a
Buffalo shirt and wrap TechnoBuffalo
