the official car of CES what's up
everyone john renter from TechnoBuffalo
here live from the show for at CES 2013
we are at the LG booth taking a look at
their 21 by 9 ultrawide monitor 16 by 9
is evidently so 2012 it's going take a
first look at this guy so here is the 21
by 9 ultrawide monitor by LG the extra
technical model number is the EB 93 no
word on pricing on this guy 21.9 ultra
wide display with an HD resolution 1080p
of 20 56 by 1080 to 29 inch diagonal IPS
cinema display ultra wide color
expression srgb 200% it's got a 4 screen
splits essentially they're saying you
can show almost 4 total screens right
there on it it's got to high quality
stereo speakers at 7 watts it's kind of
interesting to see I could definitely
see the utility you almost get a foot to
supper monitor so you guys that are
running dual monitor setups essentially
their whole idea here is that you could
use one and have both set up here also
gaming potentially it could be pretty
awesome on this I'm thinking driving
games really cool I can almost see the
whole road some of the flight simulator
games could be really cool what we don't
have on here though is a touchscreen or
any sort of release date information on
this but if you're in the market for a
giant widescreen monitor so presumably
be coming sometime in q1 of this year it
does look very interesting picked up a
lot of desk space there are two
different bezel designs that they're
showing I'm not sure which one's
actually going to make the shipping
model it's got sort of a chunkier one up
there and a sort of a thinner looking
model up at the top but it does look
very cool I'm John Ranger TechnoBuffalo
I'll see you next video thank you again
to Ford
you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
