to you by go daddy what's going on guys
the m√§rklin segment from TechnoBuffalo
and today we're going to sharing with
you guys our top 5 lockscreen tweaks for
Android two weeks ago we shared with you
guys our top 5 launchers for Android and
I know how much you guys love that video
so let's not waste any more of your time
and jump into the video the first one on
the list would have to be my all-time
favorite AC display I actually show this
lockscreen to you guys on my what's on
my phone video a few weeks back and a
lot of you guys seem to like it a lot
this has probably hands-down the best
looking lockscreen you can get right now
it's very simplistic and modern the
animations are very cool and fluid and
the way it displays your notification is
pretty unique just like Motorola's
active display if you tap and hold on a
certain notification like this it'll
display a lot of the content on your
screen already and if you want to
dismiss that notification just simply
swipe down and it's gone if you want to
jump straight to the app just swipe up
on a notification and it'll unlock your
phone right away unfortunately you can
enable a password so it's not the most
secure tweak out there if having a
passcode on your lockscreen is important
then this might not be the right one for
you the second one is cover the best
thing about the stock screen is that it
learns which apps you use more
frequently and puts them right on your
lock screen for easy access you have the
option to hide certain apps and it also
show you different apps depending on
your location too if for example you're
at home then the apps that you use most
when you're at home will be displayed
first at work the productivity apps like
email calendar phone will be shown first
there are other cool features as well
like the ability to peek into apps right
from the lockscreen and quickly jump
from app to app by just swiping down on
the hot corner just like AC display you
won't be able to set a passcode so just
be aware of that and the third one is go
locker I know that John used this on his
Nexus 5 and he was telling me how much
he enjoyed it if you're familiar with
iOS devices then this shouldn't feel all
that different nor look all that
different either basically go locker is
a lock screen developed by the same
company to develop all the go apps on a
Google Play Store go Locker has a really
clean look that simplifies your
lockscreen it'll show your notification
on this page you'll see some of your
most used apps various settings and
controls you even have the option to
switch themes so you can really think
with this lockscreen as much as you want
make it unique and make it your own
every theme is different and the way
they perform are different too so you'll
have tons of options if you use go
locker so let's take a quick break from
this video and thank our friends over at

the fourth one I wanted to share with
you guys is echo echo is more of a
productivity or notification friendly
lockscreen it's not as customizable as
other lock screens that I mentioned but
the way it handles notifications is
definitely unique from the get-go it
looks simplistic and modern just like AC
display but where the two differ is how
echo handles its notifications
notifications like missed calls text and
email are under priority Facebook
Twitter Instagram and other social media
apps go into social and so on with echo
you have the ability to create reminders
and bounce back to notifications at a
later time or place which is pretty
useful in some cases if you're one to
forget to reply back to someone or just
want to be reminded at a later time
the other cool thing about this lock
screen is that it only wakes your screen
when you receive a priority notification
echo also allows you to set up a
security pattern for your phone so you
don't have to worry about people getting
into your phone without your knowledge
last but not least is start start is a
great lockscreen app that's just the
right mixture of functionality and look
with the start lock screen you probably
won't need to access your homescreen all
that often anymore since all your apps
and all your content is right on your
lock screen you can make calls and
emails send messages all without even
having to unlock your device you can
even check out your Facebook and Twitter
timeline with just a single swipe if you
want now the lockscreen app gives you
access to any app either via a ring menu
to unlock or the small tab spread out on
the left side of the screen there are
tons of options and tweaks you can mess
with and there are also hundreds of free
themes to choose from it's not as crazy
as the other lock screens I mentioned
here but the right amount of
customization to where you know you'll
be satisfied all five of these lock
screens are available via the Google
Play Store for free it's just a matter
of finding which one works best for you
anyways the suit for this video guys if
you guys have any suggestions on which
lock screens we should try out next just
leave them in the comment section down
below and as always a Marklin segment
