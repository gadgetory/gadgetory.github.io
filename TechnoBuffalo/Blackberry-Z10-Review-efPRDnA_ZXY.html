TechnoBuffalo here at the full review
for you of the BlackBerry z10 is this
guy the Savior that BlackBerry's hoping
abusing the device for the better part
of two weeks really get to know a new
operating system I didn't feel it just a
few days is gonna give it a fair shot
give me a chance get to know all the
nuances and turn the little quirks of
using a brand new platform so let's go
ahead put it through its paces see if
this should be the phone that you keep
for the next two years alright so here
is the BlackBerry z10 I'm gonna break
this review into a few parts I'm gonna
talk about the pros I'm talking about
the cons and I'm gonna give it a final
score so let's go ahead and start with
the specs to remind you what this guy
packs because it's an all-new phone from
an all-new company I can play a game at
home and count the amount of times I say
rim instead of blackberry so the screen
here is a pretty nice 4.2 inch screen
the resolution of 1280 by 768 which
gives it a 355 PPI being powered by a
1.5 gigahertz TI OMAP 44 70 that's a
Snapdragon chip it's got 2 gigs of RAM
16 gigs of internal storage expandable
with microSD 8 megapixel shooter living
right there on the back and a 2
megapixel one living on the opposite
side on the front Wi-Fi a total Evan BG
and then bluetooth 4.0 NFC battery is a
very oddly shaped 1800 milliamp hour
it's got all the usual sensors you'd
expect accelerometer gyroscope Magna
meter and proximity alright so first
let's start with call quality and I
should say this is an unlocked unit not
released by a carrier on use with AT&amp;amp;T
LTE network Kokoro is actually very good
about on par with any other iOS or
Android phone I've tested signal
strength is actually very good as well
especially impressive considering it's
an unlocked phone that has not been
tuned for the carrier's Network alright
so let's talk about the pros of
blackberry 10 this is a review that I
think you get only from using a phone
for two weeks not sort of rushing to get
something up after a few days alright so
let's talk about build quality build
clutter is actually really impressive
here on the z10
despite its plastic bag Ashley it's one
of the best are removable back
phone that I've seen really don't feel
sort of any sort of flimsy plastic like
you do on some other phones and I'd say
that the build quality actually rivals
HTC H I think as some of the best in the
industry you almost don't even realize
it this is a removable back so hats off
to blackberry for that there's a lot to
really like about this operating system
the first is the home swipe I will say
this took a lot of getting used to so
whenever you're in an application or
doing something and you want to get home
instead of having a physical home button
you actually just swipe on up that one
took probably about six days actually
become second nature I found myself
looking for home but looking for home
but you almost have to relearn
everything you thought about with phones
but I really do like it
blackberry peak is really cool too
essentially you can do is you can swipe
up you can see failure notifications
right there on the left you can peek on
in to see what you've got in your
mailbox it's a pretty neat little trick
and while I'm here blackberry hub is a
unifying inbox for all BlackBerry
devices and it works really well emails
come in just extremely fast the
operating system is very very fluid as
well I found with previous BlackBerry OS
it sounds to be a little bit laggy not
so at all to dual-core processor 2 gigs
ram this thing absolutely flies not sure
is really doing anything whether you're
opening applications or playing games
it's extremely fast a blackberry spent a
lot of time attention to detail here and
you see it on a lot of little things for
example when you're unlocking the phone
swiping up you almost get sort of a cool
shadow effect just little things that I
really appreciated here as well I also
like the core applications blackberry
world for example looks really nice
looks like a modern apps are both
something that was sort of tacked on to
an outdated operating system the other
applications that you use probably most
often Twitter Foursquare Facebook and
LinkedIn
I'll look almost identical to their iOS
and Android counterparts and behave just
the same to refresh you just pull on
down so very simple there one of the
features that I really liked as well and
I talked about this in a separate video
is in the camera so the camera button
you can open up either via a shortcut on
the home screen or is a dedicated sort
of soft hard button
daniyar channels
and oxymoron but they're always down
there and on the home screen is the time
shift feature it's really cool and
despite being in an Android phone it's
really awesome and kind of neat party
trick people ask what I think about the
z10 it's often the first thing that I
show them so one of things BlackBerry is
really touting here is a super-awesome
is their new keyboard so let me go and
show you what that looks like
so first the location of the frets and
those are those gray lines actually
really well placed on the keyboard
learns very quickly what's not being
talked about surprising with the z10
it's actually underneath the screen
there's a heat sensor so it can learn
where your fingers hit so if you always
kind of hit the opie and they may take
the P key it'll learn that and I'll sort
of move that contact point over a little
bit and it works very well and it learns
very quickly what you're typing I wasn't
overly a creative first but the more I
use the phone the better it got so again
if you just type this corrects it for
you is a I notice that words start
appearing down here and some of the cool
things you can do is you can swipe that
right up and you can see that there's
tends to start to be completed so it's
actually very little typing it's not
like a swipe keyboard we can sort of
drag your finger all around I actually
to see the words and swipe it up to the
screen speaking of swiping BlackBerry's
not using a gorilla glass screen here
and I'm not sure what the screen is made
of but oftentimes if your fingers are a
little bit dry for example I don't swipe
on the screen as often other phone just
a little bit of an odd quirk overall
this is probably the best keyboard that
I've ever used on an all touchscreen
phone I've used a lot of keyboards on
all touchscreen phones and if you want
to hide the keyboard in any application
should go ahead and hold down the space
button and it will go ahead and get rid
of it and to go back to home as I
mentioned you just go ahead and swipe up
the next thing that BlackBerry does
right not surprising is email they do
this right they've always done this
right and it's no surprise here that it
works absolutely awesome on the z10
emails come in quicker on my phone than
they do on my desktop it is absolutely
incredibly fast if you aren't using a
blackberry Exchange server no special
BlackBerry data plan is needed here
anymore there's been some conflicting
reports but I'm using the same data plan
I use an iOS or Android without any
problems I've got the little blackberry
notification up there to let me know
that things are working the browser
we've got a modern browser here finally
and
so it brings a bit of a surprise flash
is enabled on the device you can go
ahead and turn it on or turn it off
depending on websites you are using and
it works just like flash used to on
Android phones
the other cool thing we've got here is
multitasking you can see that's sort of
in these panes and it shows you what's
open so I'm sort of just being a
shrunken down version the app actually
shows you useful information so for
example here on phone calls I can see
what my recent calls are and it shows
you sort of important information as you
go through so you can see it here with
blackberry world and the application has
something important to show you it'll
show it right there it's kind of neat I
do miss though on old qnx devices and
I'm looking at you playbook to close
application you could swipe them off the
screen you got to hit a little X down
there I have to be a little bit on the
annoying side multitasking it works very
well
I thought it'd be annoyed that I could
see only four panels here actually
became pretty second danger just to
scroll down and hop on over to next one
there's been some reports about battery
life being absolutely awful it's making
hundred million power battery and it's
not all that big but it has worked very
well I'm a pretty hard user on my phone
with a few hours phone calls
lots of browsing facebooking Twitter
picture uploads and stuff I'm very
easily able to get through a full day
and that's with two emails coming in and
everything so I wouldn't worry all that
much about battery life despite being a
very small 1800 milliamp hour battery
other things I like I love the visual
voicemail is built-in
some of the applications that I use a
lot are missing like whatsapp and google
max firm apps for example but you can
actually side load Android app so I can
get into too big a detailed how to do
that there'll be a link down below and
from watching this video on
TechnoBuffalo it'll be embedded I had a
side load certain Android apps on the
screen other niceties here are with bbm
video chat works very well on par with
anything I've seen on Android or iOS and
screen sharing works as advertised it's
really novel feature I haven't found
many uses for but it does work in
pictures and video you can show pretty
much everything it's very neat
blackberry really has grown on me
actually I used to be a dedicated
blackberry user before 2007 when the
iPhone hit and I switch back and forth
between Android and Windows Phone
there's a lot to like here with the
BlackBerry z10 and BlackBerry 10
you can tell they spent a lot of time
holding this because they had to but all
is not perfect let me go and talk about
some of the cons so I started this video
by talking about the build quality I'm
gonna go back to the build here the
chins sort of what I've affectionately
called them on the top and bottom of the
phone are much larger than you see on
any other phones I'm sure it's where the
antennas are located but almost feels
like I've got a big plasticy case on the
phone I would have loved to see those
smaller you've got plenty of bezel here
where the BlackBerry logo is to sort of
start your swipe up or your swipe down
motions on the top so I'm not sure why
that chin is there I would have liked to
see even a little bit thicker I'd have
that chin removed there are a lot of OS
quirks here as well as it expect from a
brand new operating system for example
for the first week I used the phone I
couldn't add a new calendar event it
would constantly crash I mean then just
suddenly fixed itself something to sort
of keep in mind the camera while the
time shift feature is kind of neat took
really uninspiring unimpressive figures
I would have expected more from the
sensor the app selection here I talked
about blackberry app world looking great
the app selection here is not so good
now they promised the ton of them are
going to be coming but for right now
they're not here that's a big question
mark our developers going to not only
port their apps are they going to
support the applications in the future
so certainly that is yet to be seen at
the app selection they're definitely
something to consider if looking to pick
up the phone because right now they are
not there perhaps by time these phones
at US carriers next month or later the
application support will be a little bit
better something else the BlackBerry is
added here is voice controls you can
access it by either hitting the voice
control button or the middle button
right there on the right and sort of a
Syrian Google search s functionality and
it is not overly good it does some stuff
and I'll show you here what it does so
you can send a text email BB a message
call a contact search internet or
schedule an appointment or take notes so
I'll go ahead and do a quick search here
show me reviews of the BlackBerry z10
searching the internet for show me
reviews of the BlackBerry intent
so you can see it's not the most elegant
of voices not the most elegant of
searching it is functional and it will
send text and such but when you compare
it to what you get with Siri and Google
search it just doesn't compare one of
the other odd quirks I found is when you
make a phone call like that to the
Bluetooth so if you are in your car and
your phone is locked and sitting next to
you and you make a call the screen is
going to light up and unlock when you
end a call it is going to stay lit up
and not go back to a lock say every
other phone I've pretty much ever tested
has locked and turned off the screen so
if you're not aware of it the phones in
your pocket
you're going to burn out your battery
very quickly the screen is going to stay
on until your timeout limit is sets
there we've got that set for it's sort
of a very audit quirk with the OS and
certainly something I'd expect to be
fixed very very soon
another thing that's quite disappointing
here is Maps it is awful the points of
interest don't work very well and the
whole Maps itself is just not overly
elegant so bear that in mind if you're
looking to pick up a z10 turn-by-turn
those actually very good so sort of very
similar what we saw with Apple maps the
good news though if you follow some easy
steps you can definitely get Google Maps
up on your phone everything that comes
with Google Maps which should make your
life a little bit easier I'm speaking of
applications I miss Instagram I use it
quite a bit on any other device
Instagram is not here and BlackBerry has
not really said when it's going to be
coming or even if it's going to be
coming so there are a lot of pros and a
lot of cons on with the BlackBerry z10
there is much more that I could have
talked about I wanted to give you guys
sort of the highlights of each so what's
the final score of the BlackBerry z10 it
gets a very solid eight it's a well
built of life the really elegant
operating system the big question here
though is is it better than anything
else that's out there when you're trying
to catch the competition you can't just
run as fast as them you got to run
faster to make sure you can eventually
catch up and I'm not sure the BlackBerry
is running fast or are they running at
the same pace as iOS and Android that's
debatable but I would say they probably
are but to catch up in that huge market
sure they've lost over the years I'm
just not sure the BlackBerry 10 is there
yet perhaps we get some more choices
when the q10 is out on other screen
sizes are released they may have that
value ad but those you that use a lot of
applications you want to play a lot of
games it's going to be tough to
recommend it to q10 if email is your
thing and you want a great keyboard this
has always been BlackBerry's bread and
butter this is going to be a great phone
to pick up it doesn't do anything poorly
by any stretch the imagination I'm just
not sure it does anything better than
the competition so take that advice for
what you will but it is a very solid
phone I'm going to continue this my
daily driver for another few weeks I'd
love to hear what you guys think of the
BlackBerry z10 you get to pick it up
when it comes to your carrier are you
excited not excited do you think that
BlackBerry is going to have a future I
