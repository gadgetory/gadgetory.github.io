review for you of the blackberry curve
8900 for AT&amp;amp;T the blackberry curve was
kind of gone under the radar really kind
of got lost in the iphone 3gs
announcement in the pre-announcement
this came out just a few weeks before
and really not many people took notice
opens it's quite unfortunate actually so
this phone will run you 149 on a
two-year contract minus a 100-dollar
rebate this is what you'd expect from a
blackberry curve the previous generation
blackberry curve I believe actually
became the number one selling smartphone
of all time because it's released on
just multiple carriers every carrier
almost worldwide had a blackberry curve
and this is just a popular successor if
you liked the previous generation curve
meaning you like the blackberry
operating system you're okay with not
having 3g you like the chiclet style
keyboard as opposed to the one layout of
the bold where the keys aren't really
separated at my monster face in there
you know the curve is going to be free
really doesn't make many compromises
with the one exception of 3g but not
having 3g one thing i will say about
this device it took a long long long
time to get the battery to run down
using my test it took five and a half
days to get the battery to run down
really thanks to realize the drain that
3g actually is so if you're not into 3g
but you want a 3.2 megapixel camera with
video you want probably one of the best
email clients out there you want a
really sharp screen and this does have
the same screen resolution as the bowls
which is absolutely fantastic you want a
very usable keyboard you want a passable
HTML browser and you want some tactile
feedback and have an actual you know
substantial feeling phone the curve 8900
is a really good way to go it does not
reinvent the blackberry wheel by any
stretch of the imagination there's
nothing new a revolutionary for
blackberries in this device but what it
does do is what blackberry does well
emails email on this stick is fantastic
you're going to get probably
unparalleled access to black Ray's email
client so that's what you're into and
you can sacrifice a web browser you can
sacrifice having 3g this really is a
fantastic option so this is a phone and
it's got to make phone calls I was like
to kind of make that a nice segue into
the review and i will say that phone
quality on this was okay it was not as
good as say the bold radio that may be
due to the lack of 3g i don't think the
call quality was even as good as the
t-mobile variants of the 8900 so I'm not
too sure that's a reflection on 18t the
phone itself i tested using other phones
and the call quality was fine so it may
again just the this device I'll late
EMTs edge network sort of not being
phased out but a lot of the towers are
being transitioned for 3g towers so if
you are relying heavily on edge you're
looking to get the same reception but
there won't be the same number of towers
that are covering your area so it may be
a reason you want to look to upgrading
to a 3g capable phone whenever you
aren't able on my end it sounded okay a
little bit tinny on the other ends
people could hear me fine they didn't
know very clear that i was on a cell
phone something to keep in mind using my
few hours of testing i did have a few
drop calls nothing really had any
ordinary it's not a bad phone my new
tricks the imagination but it's not the
best phone that you can get but if
you're looking for a combination for
planner and email this really is not a
bad option this phone does a lot of
things well one thing this phone is not
is fun and this day and age really hard
to look at a smartphone and not least
naturally prepared in your head to the
iphone 3g the 3gs even the palm pre it's
really difficult to these has a tech
reviewer to not hold the new phones
coming out to what i consider to be the
height of the industry and that's really
in my mind the iphone and dupree this is
not a fun phone you're not going to get
touchscreen you're not going to get
pinch-to-zoom you're not can get any
multi-touch you know really what you're
getting with this the reason people
flock to blackberry is just for email so
email is important to you can sacrifice
the rest this is a really again
good option up said that a few times but
if you're looking for a package that
maybe has a little bit of everything a
jack-of-all-trades maybe a master of
none if you will if you want you know a
really unparalleled web browser it's
looking for a better picture of viewing
the iphone 3gs is a good way to go if
you're on AT&amp;amp;T if you're on another
carrier you've got the pre you've got
the g1 upcoming mytouch on t-mobile
there are a lot of options for every
carriers cachet of phones so it really
is hard to look at this phone while it's
very capable and say I'm impressed with
it or wow look what a great job rim
which is research in motion and makes
the blackberry did so again it's not a
bad phone it's just not an impressive
phone so how about that although at 149
you are getting decent value for your
money a phone that will last you two
years pretty strong build quality so if
I have to break this phone on a scale of
1 to 5 i'm going to give this all of
three for what this phone does it does
very well doesn't pretend to do anything
more than be a blackberry it's not a
storm with a really improved web browser
and touch screen it's not even a bold
with a little larger screen and perhaps
corian some more usable keyboard the
blackberry curve when you get a
blackberry curve you know what you're
getting and if you want one odds are
this review is it going to convince you
one way or another it's pretty
straightforward these in my opinion
anyway so on a one-to-five scale solid
three hope you guys enjoyed for
