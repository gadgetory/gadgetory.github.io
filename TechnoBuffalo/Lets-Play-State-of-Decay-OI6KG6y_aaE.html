we play I'm joy Davidson here with a
look at state of decay for the Xbox 360
alright so state of decay is kind of a
strange game this title is being
developed or I guess it's out now even
though I'm talking about being developed
it was developed by undead labs and
published by Microsoft Studios it is
currently an xbox live arcade exclusive
however it will be hitting the PC
platform by way of the steam marketplace
at a to be announced date the the dev
team hasn't really said when they're
gonna be doing that they've just have
said that they are doing it this is a
really interesting title it it basically
just earned the dubious claim of being
the fastest selling Xbox Live Arcade
original game ever it's been out since
June 5th and on the day of recording I
believe it's the 18th I don't know yes
maybe unless my watch is wrong it's the
18th it has sold over 550,000 copies for
an Xbox Live Arcade original game that's
huge and and I mean if you're looking at
it and I don't mean to slam the
developers right away but it's kind of
an ugly game right like this isn't
exactly a gorgeous very beautiful game
it's it's it's really a downloadable
title it was only 1,600 points 20 bucks
its open-world a lot of people have kind
of been comparing it to maybe like a GTA
Dead Island kind of a mashup what's
really interesting about this game and
you won't see me do it but there's a
whole lot of melee killing right there
you switch between characters so this is
one of the characters that you first
start out with there's permanent death
in this game and if this guy were to die
a new character would take his place and
I think up to where I am I'm very early
on and I'm gonna explain exactly what
I'm doing here in just a second but I
think up to where I am I only have two
characters found I've maybe played it
for like an hour and 15 minutes or so
and and I've spent that time kind of
exploring but essentially what I'm doing
right now one of my buddies is sick
at a safe spot which which you saw me
leaving at the onset of this clip and I
am making my way somewhere to find
medicine I don't get to all that in this
10-minute span as I'm running from this
zombie but what you will see me do right
now is climb in this tower for a good
cool hop climb this tower for a good
vantage point scout out the area and and
I'll see I'll earn like a sidequest in
the process and I'm actually going to go
help some survivors what you'll also see
in this and this little clip is my first
time firing a gun in this game so far so
good it's definitely a little bit rough
not everything about state of decay
works very well it certainly doesn't
stand up next to other more polished
triple-a there's air quotes around
triple-a experiences on the Xbox Live
Arcade but what I'm seeing of it so far
is a very wide varied and and and fun
package so watch patrol around the
environment for just a second you'll see
all the things that I'm scouting out and
then after I hop down the ladder I'll be
back to talk more
gotcha
there we go hey what's that looks like a
vet's office or something oh yeah dr.
gallery's playing what about it well
antibiotics for dogs aren't any
different than antibiotics for people
and it looks like no one's broken in
sounds like it's worth checking out hang
on I got a transmission coming in I
think we've had enough of being on our
own we'd love to join you if you'll have
us you might want to go check it out yes
I will go check it out so instead of
going to get those medicine supplies
medical supplies whatever words spelling
I'm actually going to try and track down
these survivors so here you'll see me
make my way over to that house where
they're hiding out and talk them into
joining me which this is probably one of
the rougher elements of this game
talking someone into joining you is
literally just pressing a button and
inside a proud there's no there's no
convincing element there's no you
arguing for their trust as you would
maybe in a game like Walking Dead for
instance or you know don't expect
intense dialogue options is basically
driving that here as I kill another
zombie one thing that I do get from this
game right away is that battling hordes
of zombies on your own not such a good
idea
if there are one or two of them around
you maybe even three you'll be okay
there's a little bit of a dodging
mechanic and the melee itself is fast
enough where as long as you have plenty
of stamina which that's that blue bar on
the left the red bar on the right of my
mini-map is health if you have enough
stamina you're okay if you don't have
enough stamina and if you've been out
for a while if you find a group of
zombies I mean even like two of them
problematic time to run away there is a
sneaking element in this game which you
won't really see me get into here but
for the most part it's better to avoid
fighting zombies does damage to your
equipment so here you're seeing me talk
to these survivors and I mean I'm just
kinda standing here like wondering what
to do all you do is walk up
press Y and then there's a you should
join us option and there with me that's
it I was a little bit surprised by this
I mean I'm used to kind of thinking that
nice game survivors would need
convincing right I mean if let's all
pretend that it's the real zombie
apocalypse right if some guy walks into
your house after hearing a radio
transmission you say we have supplies
we're tired of being on our own he
storms right in armed and he says you
should join me so that's a really weird
moment but you are gonna start to see
from here on out some much more involves
on be combat which actually will give
you a better taste of what to expect
what I don't do in this general and what
I think is more core element to the
experience of state of decay is
fortification and scouting for supplies
the weapons that I have on me are the
result of hunting around a camp ground
water doctor this is a city that I'm in
getting these weapons is essential
you're gonna see this weapon that I have
now break here a little bit which they
aim terribly so it's not as if having a
gun is going to win the game for you you
have very few bullets and since
ammunition is scarce kind of wonder why
in a way weaponry but mainly weapons
breaks you only have a certain number of
inventory slots to work with so that's
where the survival horror element of
this game comes into play I can't speak
to the later half of the experience as
maybe it's not too hard to survive you
know maybe you'll get overpowered
weapons that kind of make things a lot
easier but for the here and now fighting
zombies with what's on me
it's a little bit difficult so just
watch me whip out my gun here in just a
second and you'll see me take on a
smallish zombie horde and then I will be
back
and that's it as I beat that last group
of zombies and you got to see my
terrible shooting abilities this has
been state of decay it's available for
the Xbox 360 over Xbox Live Arcade
stuned to hit the PC 20 bucks maybe
that's a little steep maybe not if the
package is as good as it seems it should
be well worth your time and money
I'm Joey Davidson from TechnoBuffalo
