theory do for you of the Lenovo s10
netbook this will run you 349 to 399
from lenovo's website I'll put a link in
the sidebar
and that about $50 price difference is
really only a three to six cell battery
there's the only customization options
that you have so this thing will be
running Windows XP with one gig of ram
using Intel's Atom processor which
clocks in at one point six figures and
other than that it's pretty standard
netbook fare so let me talk a little bit
about netbooks in general then I'm get
into the review of the device in my mind
the netbooks really served to bridge the
gap between smartphone like an iPhone
Blackberry Windows Mobile whatever you
have and if full-featured the laptops
often you want the ability to type out
emails or type out texts they have a
hard time doing on a smart phone with
either a small keyboard or a
non-existing virtual keyboard then you
have a hard time doing that on a smaller
device but you don't want to lug around
your big laptop maybe it's too expensive
and even wonder what's breaking it all
the time maybe it's too heavy or it's
too big whatever it is you want the
ability to have a keyboard have a little
bit larger screen than you would on your
smart phone but you don't want to carry
your full laptop and that's really I
think the sweet spot that netbooks here
are trying to Hey so some of the things
that I do like about this is a
particular in the Lenovo is I do like
the Finch I think it looks very
professional with the glossy red
although it is a fingerprint and dust
magnet I do like that it's got a VGA out
so you can hook it up to another monitor
this is just have a 10.2 inch screen
which certainly can be a little bit on
the small side I like that it's got a
micro iris using a standard SD card slot
for expandable storage is quite nice and
I also like that it's got an expansion
port on the side although this does not
use a solid-state drive so it does have
a hundred and Zekey gigabyte spinning
platters so there's
plenty of room for story that's not
really gonna be an issue for you so some
of the things that I do like about the
device I do like the portability I can
throw this in my bag and not really feel
the weight that I would if I was
carrying my standard laptop it's nice to
be able to type out a quick email or
write a document or some people's cases
if you want update a resume whatever
you're doing it's nice to have a
keyboard in front of you no matter what
you say about smartphones the keyboards
are always cramped and it's never the
best way to write a full document or
edit the full document it's really just
a quick solution and the netbook really
takes out a step further and I really
did enjoy using it and playing with it
the internet browsing experience is
really the same as you'd expect on
really most other laptops or desktops so
the smooth was crisp no problem although
one issue of contention of lock wrapped
us a little bit later is screen
resolution with of these netbooks it was
great to be able to edit documents on
the go I was going to a coffee shop I
can't just throw this with me not after
worried about really breaking anything
if I carry my macbook with me I'm always
a little bit extra careful with this
it's a little more rugged and I'm you
know what not that make an investment
you're just not that concerned well
certainly you want to protect it battery
life with the six AA batteries you'll
see as this a little bit of heft was
absolutely stellar with the brightness
turned down even Wireless off I was able
to get six to almost seven hours of
battery life
however with brightness up and wireless
on try to most of the time you guys will
have you won't get somewhere between the
three to four and a half hour range it's
actually pretty nice for a small
low-power laptop so some of the things
that I don't like about this some of the
things are pretty big netbook gripes in
general the keyboard is cramped it is a
tiny tiny tiny keyboard as you guys been
saved to my fingers by comparison
there's no getting used to them no
matter how much you type or how much you
do you're never gonna get used to typing
on that small a keyboard you can make do
and you can make it work but you're
going to have
tons of errors and it is going to get a
little bit on the annoying side and your
fingers make crab if you're typing a
little bit something to keep in mind I
would not recommend writing 40 page
paper report on a netbook not gonna cut
it
screen size this is one of the things
that really you sacrifice with getting a
small package 10.2 inch screen there is
not that much real estate there is a lot
of scrolling going on since you can't
really show that much right there
and speaking of scrolling also take a
look at that tiny tract pattern it's
also very hard to navigate so if you do
want to do any sort of serious work an
external mouse and keyboard really are a
must take advantage of the wanted USB
ports there for a wireless dongle really
is in my mind a requirement resolution
on this guy is not very good as well so
you're not getting the most use of your
real estate unfortunately now one thing
that I was very disappointed with with
the lenovo and i think it's gonna be the
case of all netbooks running the 1.62
her Atom processor do not even for a
second think you can watch any sort of
video don't think about watching YouTube
videos Hulu any of that not going to
work even over a very fast connection
YouTube video struggled they lacked the
audio was good with the video was 10 15
seconds behind if it even played on
YouTube and Hulu it was just completely
unwatchable
I think that's more a symptom of the
low-power processor and where the
computer it's so certainly one gig
around its plenty in XP can obviously
run all those things fine simply
something to keep in mind if you think
you're gonna get one of these to go
watch your YouTube videos or Hulu or
streaming content on the go
thank you Ken you may want to spend a
couple of extra hundred bucks to get a
laptop that can do that for you I also
wish there were more configuration
options on lenovo site really the only
thing you can do is pick a color not
that much you get pink white black or
blue and that's really about it 3 or 6
cell battery and those are your options
there's no other configuration choices
nice to maybe have the option of great
two gigs of RAM or it's not to the
picking of bubu to or Linux pays off
brake systems run on this it would have
been nice but novo does not offer that
currently right now I also really like
if I demonstrated in a previous video
there instant-on operating system they
have here I actually found it to be very
robust and really very capable as far as
browsing and Skype and unit instant
messaging so if you guys are looking for
an instant-on operating system I think
what Lenovo offers is probably one of
the best so overall on a one to five
scale factor rate this just on a netbook
scale it certainly it's not fair to
compare it with other laptops I give it
a very solid three-and-a-half and truly
it's missing that one and a half extra
stars just based on keyboard real estate
Mouse real estate and the lack of
customization and choices with it I
really would have liked that
but for 349 at 399 it is a nice deal and
there are some coupon codes floating
around so it dropped that price down
even a little bit further it is a very
nice option it's lightweight feels
durable quality of build is nice and I
can't recommend it certainly so guys
this is just my first foray netbooks and
it certainly was an exciting one
wouldn't even think about netbooks in
the lenovo in general do you have one do
you want to get one are you looking at
netbooks or no interest you know what
