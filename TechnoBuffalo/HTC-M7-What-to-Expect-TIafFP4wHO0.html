TechnoBuffalo here earlier today HTC
sent out a press event for an
unannounced phone or product line coming
soon I think it's the brand new HTC m7
let me tell you what you can expect when
it gets unveiled on February 19th it's
concerning the HTC m7 is allegedly HTC's
next flagship device in two specs hold
true it looks to be really really
impressive HTC has had a history of
putting out pretty solid devices I'm
looking at you droid DNA HTC One x+ this
is again uh usher in a brand new era for
HTC was sent about to talk about in just
a moment so again this is all rumors but
they seem to be pretty substantiative
we've seen back panels of the phone
already show up so it needs to be a
pretty much foregone conclusion HTC is
going to announce so let me run down
what you can expect with the HTC m7
first a 1080p 4.7 inch screen giving a
ppi a 468 if you keeping track at home
the iPhone 5 is a PPI of 326 so about
140 ish more so really impressive pixels
per inch on that gonna be powered by a
1.7 gigahertz quad-core processor 2 gigs
of ram in there so it should have plenty
of power and plenty of memory to run any
serve apps you want 13 megapixel camera
on the back no word what's gonna have on
the front from the leaks we've seen it's
gonna have a dedicated camera but which
I'm in hugely in favor of I love just
hitting a button on the side instead of
doing the software buttons but that's
just maybe still the option to use a
dedicated button or not use dedicated
button and if you want to get into the
routing side of things I'm sure you can
reprogram that but to do a ton of other
stuff
battery to keep this monster power it's
gonna be a 2,300 milliamp hour fare of
being an HTC flagship phone it's going
to be endowed with Beats Audio it's
going to have Sense 5 which we've seen
screenshots of it looks to be way less
heavy and more streamlined than previous
versions looks to be more in the
background and less in your face and
what sense has been in the passage I'm
hugely in favor of I like the way sense
works but it's been a huge resource hog
awesome hopeful sense 5 will take less
resources be able to use that quad-core
processor 2 gigs of ram and that
gorgeous screen to its fullest capacity
no word yet on carrier but from the
looks of the phone at least in the leaks
what you see it looks to be very verizon
ask but no carry was announced yet or no
carriers really expected to be announced
until the event but rumors have it that
there's gonna be an 18 t version the
spread version and a Verizon version so
it looks like t-mobile it's gonna be
left out of the party yet again let C be
a really incredible phone it's got a
great screen size beautiful 1080p screen
I've ever seen the Droid DNA the screen
almost doesn't look a real looks almost
like there's a sticker on top of it so I
expect that same just gorgeous display
on the m7 and hopefully I'll get a
chance to get you guys some hands on the
19th of course we will be there at the
event covering it for you live any
questions and things you want to know
about the m7 or Europeans on it leave
your down below and stay tuned in
TechnoBuffalo obviously for the latest
and greatest news on the m7 another
flagship Android iOS Windows Phone and
Blackberry devices coming at you I'm
John Rhett enger' I'll see you guys next
