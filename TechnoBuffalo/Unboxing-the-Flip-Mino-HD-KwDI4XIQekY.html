for lakers calm here with a very cool
unboxing extra hand motions for emphasis
the good folks at flip video we're kind
enough to send over a flip mino HD for
me to review and check out really
excited to see the camera you guys know
I have a flip minnow and I love it so
hoping the HD is going to be even better
and they let me coordinate d so let's
get the unboxing it's not any more of me
talking so I really want to see if this
thing looks like let's move this down
sent from cafepress go ahead and open
this bad boy up just tape stab myself as
I'm doing it and while I'm doing this
i'll put a link up to flip video in the
description bar so you guys can check
them out in case you're interested in a
flip minnow or flipping to yourself
takes out packing flip video some little
bit of PR information nothing terribly
exciting there let's get to the good
stuff so flip video I think this is the
record 60 minutes yep flip minohd HD
it's only way you know it's the HD got a
picture of it on the front looks just
like the old flip minohd there's on the
side the back it's got shoot and share
in HD go white one nothing else there
nothing else there so I'm going to open
this bad boy up right so it's sealed
right up here designed by you it says
you can actually customize the design of
your flip HD which is pretty cool upload
videos direct to YouTube AOL video and
the rest of that let's open this thing
up ok forget the scissors all right open
it up on top really nice almost like a
leatherette feeling feeling box this is
flip mino HD right on the front
opens up top look at that John for
lakers branded pretty cool here Armand
actually was kind of do design on this
for me so go ahead and move the camera
up here and show you guys it's really
cool got the john for lakers logo with a
kind of neon cityscape right there on
the front says flip HD with the same
screen and the patented flip USB
connector which I love so let me do a
real quick size comparison for you
compared to the flip minohd pull its
back down here so here's a new HD here's
the minnow and they look to be exactly
the same size exactly the same
dimensions everything everything is the
same except this one's got a TV out on
it actually this one has a TV out on the
to something difference is that this
shoots in HD and let me shoot some video
and sixteen by nine so i can get rid of
this box it's on the outside of me here
so let's see what else came in the box
what's up link it's back down what's up
flip mino quick start guide very cool
actually operating this couldn't be any
easier really just hit record and you're
pretty much good to go wrist strap a
little carrying case and cloth
underneath there okay they included some
TV cables very nice that looks like some
simple a positive cable step back
