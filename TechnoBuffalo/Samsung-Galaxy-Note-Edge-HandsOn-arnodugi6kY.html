I'm TechnoBuffalo we just had a mad rush
here so pardon the noise but this is the
Galaxy Note edge just announced by
Samsung here you can see it's got that
unique it's a 5.6 inch display with that
unique 160 a wide pixel ticker right
there and looks like it's showing some
twitter otherwise you're looking at a
quad HD display and a lot of the note 4
features so that includes the S Pen
which is floating around over here which
has a lot of new options also the new 16
megapixel camera on the back got a nice
premium metal border running down the
sides of the volume keys there 3.5
millimeter headphone jack and the power
button up top nothing on there right
because you have the the new display
there sorry for the autofocus changes
and then under the hood obviously a
quad-core processor Snapdragon 805
coffee 2.7 gigahertz you're running
android 4.4 here that's kit kat three
gigs of ram 32 gigs of storage on this
model that's expandable if you take off
the back cover here obviously we can't
do that up front you're looking at a 3.7
megapixel camera with a wide-angle lens
that samsung says will be great for
selfies also you've got the fingerprint
reader here other centers include a UV
sensor a heart rate monitor all kinds of
stuff like that you can see that they've
added some changes to touch with there's
a note widget therefore quickly
launching into note
you see most of TouchWiz and try to get
over here well the same look that we saw
first interviews on the galaxy s5 but
what's really cool is that sidebar there
where you can quickly launch different
widgets so I just went into messaging
we're going to get into the camera or
anything else like that so it's actually
really neat in Samsung's opening it up
for developers so lots of people can use
it any case that's a quick look here at
the Galaxy Note edge is todd Hazleton
