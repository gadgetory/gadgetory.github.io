every few months it's great for us to
get a play with new toys but sometimes a
bummer for you buy a new phone within
like a week later it seems like you got
an upgrade
well HTC is back with their latest phone
this is the bolt and it's exclusive to
sprint and it's kind of a follow-up to
their flagship HTC 10 with some
questionable choices made but also some
nice features that you might want that
the 10 is lacking so let's go ahead and
take a look at the phone let me know
what you guys think before I jump into
specs let's talk about design first its
iconic HTC not just because it's got the
HTC logo we can look at this phone and
they've cover that out Vic is clearly
HTC it's got that industrial look and
industrial feel to it and the build
quality looks to be really awesome they
did some different things with the
design here there's a lot more angles
than we've had on previous devices even
around the corners it's a series of
different angles that sort of make it go
all the way around where companies are
going to prefer that more smooth look
like we saw with Samsung HTC is going a
different direction I think it works
here as well this is a nice looking
phone it's a nice feeling phone as well
we've got it here in the black color but
there's a glacier silver available as
well in case that's your fancy all of
this nice looking phone is not going to
come cheap to set you back 25 bucks per
month for two years for a whopping out
of the door total of almost $600 what if
you're doing your math at home you might
know the HTC 10 is on sale for five
hundred and forty nine dollars so $50
more you figure you get $50 more in the
spec Department and if that $50 more in
the spec Department means you want some
sort of water resistance this is
probably a good phone for you to pick up
because it is rocking ip57 whereas HTC
10 doesn't have have anything but if you
care more about Ross specs than you are
going to disappoint it especially for
your extra $50 on the screen you're
looking at a qHD screens 5.5 inches
initial impressions here it looks to be
on par with other q HD screens not going
to stand out from the pack as one of the
best screens outside but if you want the
extra resolution especially for things
like a virtual reality you're going to
have that here with the HTC bolt so
here's where things get a bit
questionable for me it's rocking a
Snapdragon 810 now it's a new modified
version the a-10 but it's still the a-10
you gave 10 that's been in phones for a
little over 12 months now memory serves
me properly so it's
a bit tough to justify and that
Snapdragon 810 is paired with three gigs
of RAM which is a bit under what we're
seeing now flagship phones have and we
compare this to flagship phone because
they're charging flagship prices for
that's sort of my metric for what I
consider relieve anything $550 and
higher I consider a flagship and this
one again pushing $600 32 gigs of
storage are on board you have an
expandable storage slot for microSD
cards where HTC might have been to
Fishtown the processor side they really
tried to push things forward on the
software side this is shipping out of
the box with Android 7.0 nougat with
HTC's own skin sitting on top and I love
it states you see your sprint thing but
there's a lot of bloatware on this phone
it extends all the way to the wallpaper
it's shipping with there's there's a lot
of apt I didn't want to put in a folder
HTC has been stepping up their camera
game especially you starting with HTC 10
and that continues here with the bolt
have a 16 megapixel sensor on the back
with f 2.0 aperture paired with eight
megapixel selfie camera on the front
rather than other things we like to see
boom sound so the best speaker is going
and USB type-c for charging and syncing
on the bottom so it appears to be a
mixed bag for the bolt I love to design
things like the power and lock button
have a nice texture to it the
fingerprint reader seems to work really
well the industrial feels seems solid
but questionably outdated specs so kind
of hard to look past and I get it's not
always about the processor and that is
certainly very true now androids really
been streamlined the past few years
especially with 7.0 or it becomes less
dependent on having raw power and a ton
of RAM to run smoothly but you're
charging 600 bucks as a consumer you
kind of want to feel like you're getting
$600 worth of phone and I'm not sure
that you're getting that here with the
HTC bolt there's a lot of options for
that same price point from Android and
of course from Apple as well so whether
or not you want the bolts you're gonna
come down to design water resistance and
carrier your sprint you like HTC you
want waterproofing then get the bolt
you're gonna love it if your wish sprint
maybe want the best phone for your
dollar look at the whole portfolio and
decide for yourself</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
