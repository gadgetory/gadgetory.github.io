video for you this time i'm going to
list my must-have free mac programs
these are some programs that i use all
the time and can't live without and some
of them you may know about some of them
you might not they fit helpful to me
hopefully they'll be helped fer to you
you can find the name these programs and
a link of where to download them up
there in the notes section so the first
program that you've got to have with a
mac these are things you should download
you know right after you open your
computer is a program called flip4mac
and what that does is it lets you play
WMV files which are a window give me a
windows media based file on your mac and
it works just in your quicktime so opens
up no problem just to get another video
file it is an absolute must have a lot
of files out there are in WMV a lot of
the streaming video to that you see on
CNN com also need this player to to work
just to get would on any windows so flip
form flip4mac must have another cool
program is a program called app delete
and in one of the nice things about Max
through the delete a program you just
drag the icon to the trash but
unfortunately that can leave some
remnants of the program in the registry
and what app delete does it opens up an
icon and essentially just drag the
program to that icon and it deletes
everything associated with that program
really quick really easy and it's a
piece of cake so app delete so when you
guys got to have another one that I'm
sure you guys are all familiar with and
mostly you are probably using is Firefox
Firefox is a mozilla based browser based
on their gecko engine i believe i use
firefox have a firefox think it's a
great browser doesn't crash not a
knockout safari i never really even use
safari I was used to firefox from from
windows so that's what I use highly
recommended if you're looking for
another browser
the next program excuse me for those you
guys that use gmail like I do is a
program called google notifier and what
it does it puts a little envelope up on
your the top bar of your computer and
you get new emails at glutino and lets
you know how many new emails you have
it's really handy especially for me I
get a lot of emails from you guys you
know new comments and questions and
stuff so it's nice to know when they're
there so i can try and i'll try it to
get back to you guys as soon as I can so
that's a Google notifier another cool
program when I don't necessarily use all
the time but I do you sometimes and I
know one that you guys like is something
called I alert you and it's actually
what that is is a an alarm for your mac
it takes advantage of some of the motion
sensors in a macbook macbook pros i blew
their new macbooks have them as well so
what does is you set this i alert
program it sounds like you're setting a
car alarm beeps at you and if somebody
moves your laptop or opens your laptop a
car alarm actually goes off and you can
set out to take a picture with your
built-in isight camera so you can see
who's taking your computer and it will
automatically email to you it's pretty
cool program so just an alarm and again
guys all the names and all the links
down these programs are going to be
right up there another program that
you've got to have if you have an ipod
and iphone or Apple TV or anything like
that is a program called I squint like I
and quit um like you're trying to see
and with that does that converts a
really a cornucopia of video files to be
played on the
products and it's very very easy to drag
it in you click whether you want to play
on an Apple TV or an ipod and how great
you want equality to be it also
determines the size and get start and
that's it it's really really really a
piece of cake on the next program that
you gotta have is a program called
handbrake like handbrake on a car and
what that does is it lets you rip dvd's
so it'll pull off the video off a DVD so
you can watch it on your iPod or iPhone
Apple TV or your computer must have next
program that you got to have one that I
use all the time is neooffice and I've
talked about neooffice before in my
macbook pro review so check that out for
some videos and it's a full office for
you like Microsoft's like Microsoft
Office it's got a spreadsheet of a word
processing program a presentation
program and it lets you open up word
excel powerpoint documents you can save
them in Word PowerPoint Excel documents
and really save them in any format you
want it's really helpful and the last
program that I use all the time on my
mac is skype i'm sure let you guys use
skype too i use it for video
conferencing it's free video
conferencing for people that
unfortunately don't have max so if you
know someone that has a PC and you want
a video conference with them just have
them download skype and hook up their
webcam and you guys are set escape is
also great for colouring computer to
computer you can also use it to call
internationally and call regular phone
lines but that part you have to pay for
but the computer to computer calling and
video conferencing is totally free so
skype another must-have program my guys
I'm sure there are ton more programs
that you guys use and you think other
people might want so post a video
response to this or post a comment on
this video let people know what it is
not just the name of the program but
more specifically what it does and where
they can get it from so hopefully we can
all get something new or cool I'm
looking forward to seeing what you guys
have
so again the links for these are up
there hope you guys enjoyed watching
have a nice day or afternoon wherever
you are talk to you guys soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
