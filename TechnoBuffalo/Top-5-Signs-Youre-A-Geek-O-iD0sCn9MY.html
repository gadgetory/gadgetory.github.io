TechnoBuffalo here it is the holidays
here in the United States we're
celebrating Thanksgiving I thought it'd
be fun to kind of reflect on my life and
give you guys a top-five list you know
you're a geek if you watch these videos
chances are you've got a passing love of
Technology and inner geek hidden
somewhere in there or maybe you just let
your geek flag fly obviously there were
a ton of things we could have covered in
this I could have made this probably a
top 60 list I tried to pick the top 5
you think of one that maybe you've got
even a comments down below on another
way that you think you might be a geek
it's gonna get started number five you
see a phone being used in a TV show or
movie you can immediately tell the
edited in a fake operating system this
one kills me I'm watching a movie you
can see somebody's clearly using an
Android phone they turn on their phone
to type a message or answer phone call
and it's like some weird OS that just
has like a big end and a big green send
button on it and that's it you know
that's not what it looks like or you
know they're using an iPhone the OS is
just something super weird that's not I
Oh s that one happens to me all the time
any TV show or movie I watch Tracy that
I was according my wife I'm like that's
not really she talked to me like this
coming in at number four you look at
minimum required specs for modern PC
games and chuckle to yourself
hahaha self and say those specs were so
three years ago I'm getting into
building computers get into playing some
PC game they look at these required
specs I'm like come on it's really those
are the minimum specs I had those back
in 2010 command number three this is a
good one if you're traveling sitting at
airport got a long layover you can name
the phone anyone is using when you're
out in the bout so take a look at it see
if someone's using a phone and guess
what phone that is like oh i phone six
Oh droid turbo
oh that's the HTC One m8 you think
you're even better than that see if you
can guess the carrier based on some of
the color offerings that are not done
this is a game that I play probably way
more often than I should
number two you quietly judge people
based on their phone selection I
emphasize quietly I'm not talking about
the folks that like to just get crazy in
YouTube comments but let's say your
brother cuz some of the new phone it's
an eye
phone your Android lover he might be
like shake my head dude shake my head we
all do it
hopefully you're respectful about it and
I'm guessing that if you do do it you're
probably a geek too and number one since
it is Thanksgiving this one happens to
me all the time you are everyone's IT
help lying I'll tell you a funny story
so my mom called me last week saying she
couldn't access her email you probably
think she's probably use a gmail or
outlook or sort of one of the common
email applications out there you would
be wrong she uses AOL and not anything
like AOL com
the web portal check her email she uses
the AOL app with the app that used to
send on CD and disk drive years ago I've
tried to set up a million gmail accounts
for and she refuses to do it she tried
to get into the application she couldn't
see her emails from like a couple of
weeks ago and I said mom I can't help
you over the phone I don't I don't know
how to use that app I haven't used that
since like 1993 and she and very serious
I said over the phone but this is your
job which also said my mother has no
idea what I do for a living but chances
are you are the IT support for everyone
in your family eat the hell you help
them set up their phones you help them
set up email on it you help them set up
a Wi-Fi network
anything else has to do with internet
technology they assume that's just what
you do and you know everything about it
that one is a big-time number one so did
I miss any what are your signs that you
know you're a geek what do you do that
and breaks your geek them even the
