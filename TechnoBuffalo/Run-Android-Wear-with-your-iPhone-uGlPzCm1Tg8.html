Sangin from TechnoBuffalo and in today's
video we'll be showing you how you can
use your iOS device with Android wear
sort of just as a little disclaimer
before we get started this isn't a fully
functioning version of Android wear for
iOS Google hasn't officially opened up
support though it could happen as soon
as Google i/o you'll only be able to
receive notifications and nothing more
you won't be able to reply to messages
use Google now independently or really
get the most out of what Android wear
has to offer it's mainly for feeding you
notifications telling you what time it
is and showing you the battery life of
your iOS device there were a couple of
essentials we needed in order to get
this to work an Android device and
Android wear SmartWatch and iOS device
and two apps where connect for iOS from
the Google Play Store and ble utility
from Apple's App Store now even though
you need an Android device to set up
your Android wear for iOS you don't
actually need to be around the Android
device to receive iOS notifications you
can simply just leave it at home and be
on your way setting it up will take
about 10 to 15 minutes it took us a few
tries until we were able to sync our iOS
device to an LG watch urbane but after
that it should be all set first thing
you want to do is download where connect
for iOS from the Google Play Store
once it's done installing open it up on
your Android wear device and you should
get a notification card to toggle the
app on and off enable iOS connection and
swipe the cards to the right to dismiss
it after the card is dismissed you'll
see a new car that pops up that says
disconnected
next up download ble utility from the
Apple App Store and once the app is
installed launch it and choose a
peripherals at the bottom tap the
disconnect the notification on your
Android wear device and it should prompt
you to enter a pin on your iPhone enter
the pin found on your Android wear
device to your iOS device and once
that's done you should be offset after
it's all set up your iOS notifications
will start to show up on your Android
wear device there isn't an official list
of apps that will push iOS notifications
to your Android wear device but
everything I've used from snapchats UI
message works perfectly do keep in mind
that this isn't an official release from
Google so not everything will work 100%
Google's i/o conference is just right
around the corner and there's been a lot
of talk about Android wear playing
nicely with iOS so hopefully we'll see
that very soon if you guys have any
questions or need help with a particular
step just leave them
the section down below and we'll try our
best to answer your questions if you
guys enjoy this video make sure to give
it a thumbs up and we will see you guys
in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
