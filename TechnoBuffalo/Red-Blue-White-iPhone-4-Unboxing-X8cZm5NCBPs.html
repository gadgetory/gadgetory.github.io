membership today what's up everyone
John Rhett enger' from TechnoBuffalo
here with an unboxing is something I
don't think you've seen before so
whether he's on my channel or other
people's channel chances are you've seen
one of these before
a black iPhone and if you watch my
videos you may have seen my white iPhone
make a cameo but what's inside of this
box I don't think you've seen you can
probably tell from the title I've got a
red iPhone unboxing a blue iPhone
unboxing and even another white one
should be living inside of here so
without further ado let's go ahead and
dig in so I am super excited to dig into
this box the folks from I fix direct did
these conversions they will convert your
phones to white red or blue the
conversion is going to run you just
about two hundred and seventy-five
dollars I should preface this by saying
these are not Apple official parts this
is an aftermarket conversion and it will
void your warranty if you want to check
out the I fix direct folks the link will
be down below they also fix broken
iPhones if you need and they say they're
gonna have a clear conversion coming to
where you can make your phone look
totally clear super neat so if you got
an old 3GS or a four that broke link for
them is going to be down below alright
so here is the box that it came in I
don't know if yours would come in this
or not go ahead and slide this open and
we'll do sort of a slow striptease of
phones we've got white one living right
there we've got looks like one of them's
turned on we've got a blue phone looks
sort of reflective kind of neat and
lastly we've got fire engine red kinda
neat all right it's let's see what the
folks at I fixed direct did looks like I
turned on the white one let's take a
look at the white one first I'll do just
sort of a quick overview and show what
they look like I'll do more videos going
in depth of the color and going over
performance and seeing if the color
conversion effects performance I want to
get a chance to use them to actually see
if there's anything
notable here but let's go ahead and see
what they look like just from an
aesthetic standpoint so here is the
white one looks like it's definitely
turned on I can compare it to my white
one that you might have seen they look
pretty close to identical no SIM card
installed there looks like the battery
is getting quite ready to keel over on
some locket see if it works
screen appears to work so that's a good
time I will take a look to it the camera
functionality now there's been a lot of
talk about the white iPhones having
issues with the camera we'll run through
everything build quality it looks to be
pretty good feels solid but again we'll
hold off judgment until I get a chance
to really inspect it further so there is
white you've probably seen that before
not overly exciting um but the white is
not released yet so kind of neat uh
jumping around here here is blue and
this is one of the colors I was really
looking forward to seeing it's very
reflective you can see me if I can wave
at you in there there you go in the
reflection um the home button is a
little bit of a darker color blue so you
sort of two colors standing out this is
more shiny and this is a little bit more
matte the back looks great as well I
think this one was accidentally turned
on also so it's like this one is also
has a dying battery let's go ahead and
power it off peers to be pierced you're
working but again we'll go into a bit
more detail looks really nice there's a
screen protector on the back and see
what the blue and the white one look
like you get the shiny of the blue and
the matte of the white kind of neat so
let's go ahead and jump on over to the
fire engine red which is sort of
continuing our American flag of iPhone
colors here is the red this one looks
like it is powered off just like it's
blue friend the red and the home button
is a little bit darker I kind of like it
the screen and the color around it isn't
as reflective ods the blue it's a bit
more matte similar to what we see here
on the white the back and the screen
protector on there looks to be pretty
solid if you look around here build
quality and again I'll do sort of a full
overview looks pretty solid things
aren't moving around but I definitely
want to give it some time to you
everything and make sure that things
work so I wish that I had some like gold
stars here I could go ahead and put them
on here we can make a i phone american
flag we'll bring in a black one here too
for comparison so i know what the next
question you guys are going to say
because i know my audience what are you
gonna do with all these phones you've
got too many phones you keep them all
the short answer is all these phones
aren't all mine unfortunately but you
know that i wouldn't tease anything like
this and tease anything what I think is
this cool without doing some sort of
giveaway so stay tuned for a giveaway
I'll give more details coming very soon
where you can win an iPhone color of
your choice unlocked so anywhere in the
world that gets GSM service stay tuned
for that coming very very soon of course
I want to be able to share some of the
fun of seeing all of these colors here
which is really what's really strange
I've got used to seeing an iPhone in
white but it's bizarre to see it in blue
or red these are not paint jobs these
are actually color conversion so these
plates were all replaced so are these
something you would use do you wish
Apple would release it really kind of
curious to what you guys have to say if
it was on Verizon or AT&amp;amp;T or another
carrier is this something that you would
want I want to thank our friends and
