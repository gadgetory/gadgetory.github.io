from TechnoBuffalo here with an unboxing
of the newest Android 3.0 tablet on the
block this is the Asus Eee Pad
Transformer let's go ahead dig in and
see if there's more than meets the eye
I'm sure I'm the only one that's ever
made that joke alright so this is a demo
unit sent by the folks at Asus not sure
how your packaging is going to come but
if you order it presumably it'll look
very similar if you are looking to pick
one up for yourself you this will be
available at retail on the 26th of April
pricing is going to be 399 for the 16
gig $4.99 for the 32 gig and 149 for the
docking station I'll show you what that
is in just a minute to see epad
Transformer bring some pretty cool
things here to the tablet world so go
ahead and use the obligatory
unnecessarily large knife I'll make some
also obligatory jokes about not cutting
off my finger go ahead and rip on the
tape
let's see what we have inside so here is
the retail packaging of the Asus Eee Pad
Transformer rented the specs in just a
moment push that off to the side here is
one of the coolest things actually about
the e Pad Transformer this is a keyboard
dock and looking forward to showing you
this as well so push to the box off to
the side go ahead and take a look at the
transformer itself so here it is bring
the camera in just a bit a Pad
Transformer it's got a picture of the
device on the front it's got that
typical tablet form factor the slate
look let's go I've got an iPad
transformer some more images as you pet
transformer some more and we got some
legal business on the back but that's
not what everyone wants to see that's on
what I want to see this is the first
time I've actually had a hands-on with
one of these guys so I am looking
forward to it looks like the tape has
been
opened and here is the Asus Eee Pad
Transformer let's go ahead and open it
up it feels very light in the hands
actually I'll push it off the side for
just one moment see what else you're
gonna get in the box of your android 3.0
tablet I'm gonna get the required stuff
we got a little bit of reading getting
started guide tips for using your iPad
got a adapter for the wall charger and a
proprietary connection cable to USB
alright enough of that let's go ahead
and look at the transformer itself and
because I can hear you all screaming in
the comments I'm going to remove the
plastic before I start talking about the
device so you taught me a little bit
about its IPS screen and all kinds of
other goodness but I will talk to you
about that we don't need any stickers
tell us go ahead and take it out of the
plastic here is the iPad transformer
thing is very very light alright so I'm
gonna go ahead and try and boot it up
and while it's booting up I will run
through the specs power button looks to
be on the left-hand side
not sure if it's got any sort of charge
in it hopefully it's got something
alright so the e Pad Transformer there's
a lot to like about this guy starting
with its 10.1 inch IPS display with the
resolution of 1280 by 800 IPS is going
to give you a little bit darker blacks
and brighter colors and it's going to
give you a better visibility in direct
sunlight as well as a better viewing
angle so you're looking at it from an
angle wherever you might be stopped on
the screen should look pretty good it is
being powered by nvidia tegra 2 so that
is a dual-core processor with one
gigahertz on each core it's also got a
gig of ram that is not a typo or a
mistake this has one gig of ram in here
storage is either going to be 16 or 32
as I mentioned again price points are
going to be 399 and 4 that's 16 or $4.99
for D 32 802 11 B G and n what you
sex on the fronts there is a 1.2
megapixel camera and see that sucker
right there and if we show its butt
we will see a 5 megapixel camera I can
tell you I do right up the bat like the
camera placement something's gonna be
difficult to put your fingers right
there and cover it
no on the iPad for example I always have
my fingers cover at the camera can get
quite annoying you've got a micro SD
card reader audio I've got the G sensor
light sensor gyroscopic a compass GPS
flash support multitasking of course
you've got some custom issues business
going on here you're gonna get about
nine point five hours of battery life or
16 hours with the dock the dock had its
own battery life in it alright so let's
take a look at the device I'll do a
hands-on sort a tour of the Android
operating system I've done that in the
past so this one has some nice additions
to it so you've got a volume rocker on
the left and right side physical power
button that lives there on the left
nothing on top on the right hand side
got HDMI out there's your charging
connector 3.5 millimeter headset jack I
also have a microphone on the bottom so
if we've got the dock connector as well
as some speakers go ahead and kick the
screen on one more time there we go well
unlock it we should get that nice
honeycomb look to it alright so now that
we take a look at the tablet let's take
a look at why this is actually called
the transformer and look at the dock for
it which we will unbox push the tablet
off to the side if you're interested in
picking up the dock here which does have
an extra battery it's gonna set you back
149 dollars
so go ahead and see if there's a tape to
cut here I think there is nope this one
does have tape so we'll go ahead and
slice through that there we go
and from what I've seen what I've read
this dock connector is what separates
the e pad from the rest of the majority
of 3.0 tablets that are on the market or
coming out on the market so here it is
it is a keyboard at that same look and
feel to it a little bit on the heavy
side perhaps that's because it's got an
extra battery in it some documentation
and looks like that's about it'll charge
the same way as a tablet so I'll push
this off to the side now let's take a
look at said duck go ahead rip it out of
its plastic
I would ggressive Lee regretted laughing
and it does tilt them take a look at
this you've got a full keyboard almost
what you'd see on an Asus netbook or any
other kind of netbook pretty decently
spaced keys it's not giant Lee full size
but you could definitely type something
on here you do have a trackpad you've
got one physical button actually sir is
the left and right click now on the
other side of it we've got the looks
like there's the charging port and on
the other side living under here should
be a USB port which is really kind of
cool for for storage there's a custom
issue software built on here that'll let
you drag and drop file and access files
right from USB we also have a full SD
card slot living right there that you
pull that out and show you see push in
there we go
SD card there's something comical in
just a dummy but there is a card in
there alright go ahead and dock the
tablet and see what this looks like
I'll pull back the camera a little bit
so this is looking to really bridge that
gap between I want to carry a tablet
because it's nice and light and I want
to do my browsing but I also might have
to actually do some productivity that
it's habit just isn't going to provide
tablets are great for media consumption
that's daily media creation looks like
this is aiming to fix that so clicking
on the dock connectors and everything
right there let's go ahead and drop it
in and see if we can find where
snicks or at least attempt to see where
that connects so goes right in there you
can see go ahead and drop it in which it
was pretty easy and then when you go
ahead and close it
I should I leave it open so it lets you
know that it is connected now when you
close it actually have almost a laptop
doesn't weigh very much it's got a
pretty nice feel to it it's not the same
look on the front and back is also going
to charge it once plugged in assuming
the keyboard has a charge should come
close to doubling the battery life go
ahead and open it up and there's some
productivity suites in here that let you
know that you can use a keyboard for
typing when you go ahead and pull a
tablet out and run a real quick size
four pairs before you with some other
tablets that we've got going on I'll go
ahead and pull it out of the dump it is
relatively easy to do push the dock off
to the side and if you're looking to get
a tablet I chances are you might be
cross shopping so if you are indeed
crush of it you might be looking a
device like the Motorola Xoom you can
see these two right next to each other
the zoom feels much heavier the e Pad
Transformer is a little bit longer you
can see right there a little bit thinner
as well and then the zoom you may also
be looking at an iPad 2 so here is an
iPad 2 for comparison purposes 10.1 inch
screens the iPad is a decent amount
thinner also feels a little bit lighter
and perhaps you are looking at an iPad
one even so here is the iPad one for
comparison purposes you can see what
those look like there so this was a
first unboxing and very quick hands-on
of the new iPad transformer and the dock
number looking forward to getting some
hands-on time with this and spending
some more loving tablet II greasy
fingers with this IPS screen and see how
the e Pad Transformer responds hey guys
