technobuffalo here at the 4 review for
you of the samsung galaxy s2 for AT&amp;amp;T
let's go ahead and dig in and see if
this really is the king of the
smartphone world so very few phones come
with as much hype as a galaxy s2 is our
European brethren have had this phone
for a few months before it finally hit
us shores and here it is I'll dressed up
in AT&amp;amp;T clothing so let me run through
the specs of this super phone very
quickly this is arguably one of the best
spect phones on the market so we are
looking at a 4.3 inch super amoled plus
display with a resolution of 480 x 800
Scott Gorilla Glass on there so you can
bang it around your pocket put some keys
in there hopefully not scratch it does
not mean it's scratch proof though so
don't get upset and yell at me when your
beautiful new phones got a gash across
it it's not to protect it much and drops
either so keep that in mind so it's got
TouchWiz 40 with Android Gingerbread
sitting on top of it being powered by a
dual-core 1.2 bigger chip and this thing
is a screamer I will talk about that a
bit more it's augmented with one gig of
ram and that's my big word for this
review 16 gigs of storage 8 megapixel
camera on the back with a pretty awesome
autofocus sensor that can also shoot
1080p at 30 frames per second and it
weighs 116 grams alright so let's go
ahead and talk about call quality first
the phone doesn't matter how many giga
hertz our cores it has if it sucks
making call it's not going to be much
used to you this phone runs on AT&amp;amp;T
hspa+ network so they are billing it as
a 4G network called quota is actually
very good I experienced only one drop
call in my 20 call test speaker phone
was exceptionally loud what is
surprising for a device this thin but
the speakers on here are not bad I did
have a tad bit of popping noise though
on my ends on about seven of the calls
that I made it wasn't necessarily that
noticeable
but I did hear it and I did have some
issues connecting with a few Bluetooth
accessories those made by job or a
particular I do that some difficulty
with that might have been just this
device but if java is what you use for
your bluetooth you might want to try
this out first in the store if possible
so call quality was decent not
tremendous it's good enough so you don't
have to worry if you want to get this
it's going to be fine in the call
quality department but let's talk about
what everybody wants to know about the
galaxy s2 and that's the raw speed of
the phone so for me where I know to
speed the most and where the power comes
most to me and maybe I'm alone on this
is web browsing I hate seeing that
checkerboard patterns I'm scrolling
through a website and I don't see it
here at all this phone is incredibly
fast pinch-to-zoom with flash on
although no flash concepts being shown
here is really quick the browser is
outstanding it is probably one of the
best browsing experiences on a mobile
device if you saw my review on the droid
bionic I praised it for its extremely
fast really almost eloquence buttery
smooth browsing this one is just as good
just really samsung did an incredible
job taking advantage of the native
browser here you can see the physics
engine at work in androids put together
just an amazing browsing experience so
if browsing is going to be important to
you the speed here is pretty pretty
outstanding see a speed of loading a web
page here it's ever been loaded before
I'm not connected to Wi-Fi just the
hspa+ network talk about that in just a
minute could see how things work it is
just lightning fast all right so there's
browsing for you even on sites that are
heavy on flash wasn't a problem here at
all all right so let's talk about speed
of applications with one gig of ram I
never once had to go into a task manager
and readjust application to close things
it was never even issue something that I
was very conscious of let's say the last
generation android devices on this
generation has a gig or more never been
an issue at all opening applications
lightning fast just pleasure to use so
whether or not you are a multitasking
demon you're not going to have to worry
everything here just opens up and works
very quickly and they're not going to
have to close applications
for those of you that want to know what
the raw speed numbers were I did run a
quadrant test and I use this test on all
of my smart phones that I test leads on
the Android smartphones it might not be
the most accurate but it is what I've
tested on every single android phone for
the past almost year so it does make for
a pretty even test and I did get a
square of 2881 and this is what they
stock rom you can see it sort of how far
ahead that is here so from a spec
standpoint even with the stock rom it is
outstanding if I want to get in there
and tinker with the roms you can even
get that square up higher point being if
speeds what you're worried about you are
not going to have to concern yourself
with it on the galaxy s2 this thing is
just absolutely incredibly fast from a
speed standpoint let's talk about
network it is a 4g device after all
right so I am hspa+ I'm in Southern
California which is blanketed hspa+ and
I've got almost full bars of service
let's go and run a speed test for fun so
here is the speedtest.net app finding
closest server to be able to find the LA
server if not i'll set it to it no Wi-Fi
connected here at all let's begin test
let's see what we get just for fun so
connect it to the LOS angeles-based
server and we are right now at point
almost at 11.2 so we're getting there
alright 1.43 was what we got it's
actually the fastest test that ipad
ground hspa+ network in just about
points five ish on the upload and we are
done alright so just for laughs let's
bring in an iphone here using the non
hspa+ network and let's run a speedtest
Wi-Fi has been turned off just as 3g
with about three bars so we'll go ahead
and run a similar test and this is
obviously just a test at 18 TS network
there's nothing really to do with the
galaxy s2 itself just something that I
found very interesting let's see if I
can duplicate the results here
so the ping was just about the same i
phone is just about one petering back
down a little bit point 51 on there
download let's go ahead and check the
upload here and I I speak test
everywhere I go I don't know it's a
maybe too obsessive compulsive Singh
compulsive thing or the inner geek and
me I just can't stop testing so I even
got faster speeds on the upload and
about a third slower on the downs I got
a hard time classifying this as 4G now
certainly your speeds are going to vary
depending on where you are this is just
a test of a nice but instant in Southern
California in fact that other tests I've
ran this is actually come out much
faster than this guy so can use that
term 4G and take it with a bit of a
grain of salt at least until we see LTE
start coming out on mobile devices so
i'll push this guy off to the side and
we'll continue our test let's talk about
this screen now it is super amoled plus
and it's super amoled awesome text here
looks really really crisp so let's go
ahead go into some articles there we go
well zoom in text here absolutely pops
you're not going to have any sort of
pixilation sometimes on older screens
and you zoomed in you could see
pixilation on these modern screens that
you very rarely see it the screen here
dosto is absolutely beautiful so let me
show you some images here let's go ahead
and we'll hit home and go ahead and jump
into gallery so may I can find gallery
owners have a hard time finding that
let's see if I can spray Bobby see
probably imagine you guys screaming at
it in the comments there it is there it
is there's gallery but I will find it on
my own right so there it is gallery
let's go ahead and show you some images
that we've got here so I took some
photos of water bottles something cool
i'm going to show you guys in just a
minute we'll go and hit done so there's
a water bottle go ahead and turn it like
this it looks really nice the autofocus
here works extremely well and i'll show
you guys an example of that but there's
something else kind of need here so if
you want to zoom in on web pages or
images you can pinch to zoom like normal
networks just about as well as you
expect so very well
but Samsung get something else doing
here QB put two fingers on the screen
you tilt in or out you can actually
control the zoom which is kind of
gimmicky but the more I use it more I
found myself finally getting valuable
actually started doing zooming like this
it's pretty handy it's also pretty
precise alright so let me go ahead and
show you what this camera looks like
we'll go ahead the camera button is not
a hard button for camera it's all soft
buttons here so there's that same water
bottle used for a last subject go ahead
and hit the shot and you can see it auto
focus and takes a picture it's pretty
fast stepping a picture to a video
attest shooting 1080p looks average for
a cell phone it's not outstanding but
it's better than a lot of cell phone
esque images I couldn't take this video
and i can upload it to youtube but
you're going to see a degradation in
quality from thats take my word for it
it looks decent if you're out shooting
your friends or want to shoot pictures
your dog this is going to work certainly
it's not going to replace a handycam but
it's going to you know do a decent job
all right so let's talk a bit more about
the screen then go ahead and jump back a
web page and go back to the main
technobuffalo com site so ever since
samsung released the first AMOLED than
super amoled amoled plus displays
they've been plagued by a little bit of
a bluish hue in it so if I go ahead and
pull out here's the iphone by comparison
the same page you can see that that
bluish hue is still here on the samsung
galaxy s2 it's not something that really
impedes the use of the device something
that I'm definitely cognizant of if
you've ever gone to best buy walmart
wherever you go to look at tvs for
example and you see a really expensive
TV next to a less expensive TV yo the
difference of the screens when the next
to each other however once one of them
is gone and you get it home put on your
wallet it looks great on the screen here
is no exception I've spoken to a few
people actually prefer this blue hue
they find to be a bit more natural for
me it's not my preferred sort of color
drain but the screen is gorgeous and
that's really hard to deny that this is
probably one of the best screens on a
mobile device right now but keep that in
mind if you're one of the few people out
that blue hue is going to bother you try
it out in the store after using it for a
couple of days I hardly even noticed it
anymore at all all right so now let's
talk a bit about the design I mentioned
at the beginning that our European
friends had the galaxy s2 for a little
while and indeed they did but when it
came to us shores here in ATT clothing
AT&amp;amp;T hugged up a supermodel looking
phone on the european version you had
just three buttons you had a big home
button here and then two buttons
flanking it now we've got those forts or
a typical capacitive android buttons and
it's a great it is not a good-looking
phone which is unfortunate because it's
really pretty inside the specs here are
incredible it's like putting Groucho
Marx glasses on a supermodel it's just
not the prettiest phone to look at it
looks like every other end right phone
out there which is unfortunate because
it's much better than pretty much every
other Android phone out there I liked
that big home button that Samsung had on
the air kuna version I wanted to unlock
the device I could just tap that as
opposed to having to hit the button here
on the side which admittedly is not a
big deal but I was kind of cognizant of
it as I was using the phone so a
personal preference I think it's not the
best looking phone on the market but
it's definitely one of the best android
phones on the market and certainly the
best android phone in 18 tease lineup on
the back samsung this whole back part
here is plastic and it's kind of flimsy
plastic if you take it off go ahead and
show you see it's very very thin however
once it's on its it so flush over that
battery they don't even notice how thin
it is so the built quality does feel
pretty solid you know that it's a bit of
a plasticky feel to it but it's not bad
I would have liked to be some sort of
metal actions that would have made it be
a bit heavier but you know I might be a
personal preference thing here on the
offerings at them side so you do have
TouchWiz you can see all the TouchWiz II
goodness that Samsung's got here
TouchWiz has gotten a lot more out of
your way than in previous versions we've
seen so it's now in its fourth iteration
let me show you some of the widget
action here so you hold that down now
you've got immediately a new way to
select what you want see it right here
we'll go ahead and jump into widgets and
now they all show up serve as a nice
list you can see what they are is sort
of crunch in and crunch out on there's a
lot of nice additions here featured apps
latitude power savings
voice stuff and all the goodness they'd
expect from Android including a really
awesome free turn-by-turn navigation if
you're on this bench with what operating
system to get and you're not in love
with Apple forever reason you don't have
to have windows phone 7 the free
turn-by-turn navigation really is a
killer feature that people have
forgotten about you don't have to pay
for TeleNav or any sort of additional
add-on it's free you can deal with the
robotic voice it works really really
really well as well as any other
navigation system that I've used on a
mobile device so keep that in mind as
you guys can decide what phone is right
for you so a bit of an ugly design aside
this is definitely the best android
experience i have used if it had true 4g
speeds i can say that this phone is the
best phone bed reviewed but those dismal
one point eight ish 1.5 speeds which is
actually the fastest that i've seen on
my test here make it hard to give this
guy a perfect five out of five now if
you're in an area where that speeds not
going to be a problem you're always
connected to Wi-Fi or hspa+ is faster by
you then five out of five no brainer
hands down for the galaxy s2 however if
you're like me in an area where hspa+
might as well be edge speeds it's tough
to give it five stars so give it a solid
four and a half with that half to make
up for the speed difference my battery
standpoint I was easily able to get to a
full day with the screen set to auto
brightness and with email accounts
pulling down all the time about two
hours of phone calls and a ridiculous
amount of browsing more than I want to
admit on video it is a great phone and
when I can wholeheartedly recommend to
those on AT&amp;amp;T looking to pick up the
best smartphone on the planet and one of
the questions that I get is should I get
the galaxy s2 I hear quad-core might be
coming this is an awesome phone it's a
well SPECT phone it's going to be a fast
phone for the next two years so it might
not be the fastest phone on the market a
year from now but it's always gonna be
able to keep up with what's coming and
with processor like this can be able to
get the most recent updates of Android
assuming samsung releases them you know
ice cream sandwich or whatever comes
next after that so don't worry pick up
the phone if you want some Android
action i'm jon rettinger from
technobuffalo Android action that sounds
that sounds really bad i'm jon rettinger

will see you in the next video bye bye
