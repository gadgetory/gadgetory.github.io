how i like to make them too so what
we've got is Microsoft Office 2008 for

with Microsoft Word Excel PowerPoint
entourage and messenger for Mac it comes
with the open XML file format and it's
universal for Intel and powerpc-based
macs what this doesn't have that the
more expensive versions have is
Microsoft Exchange Server support
animator actions for workflows in
Microsoft Office and Microsoft
expressions media but for just Word
PowerPoint Excel and entourage which is
max version of that look this is all
you're gonna need so what do you say we
open open it up guys I gotta apologize I
just actually did a full unboxing of
this but my camera can capture it so I'm
gonna re unbox it for you but all you'll
see is I didn't take off the plastic but
I just did so anyway here's the box

it's got three serial numbers because
you can sell this on three separate
computers I'm not gonna show you guys
