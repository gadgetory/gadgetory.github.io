to you by Toyota what's up everyone jon
rettinger from technobuffalo here taking
a first look at the Xperia z1 compact
from Sony CES president let's take a
first look so the z1 compact continues
the trend that we've seen recently of
smaller versions of flagship devices but
those are usually diminished and somehow
have lower specs not really so here at
all I looking at top-tier specs
highlighted by a 4.3 inch full HD screen
it's got what they're saying is one of
the best cameras going to and think it's
by looking at it but that is a 20.7
megapixel sensor they're saying is
awesome in the low light and bright
light powering it is a beastly
Snapdragon 800 clock at 2.2 gigahertz
with two gigs of ram onboard trillion no
compromise device it's a smaller form
factor if you don't want you know the
larger five inches sighs I get a 4.3 and
show on say a quick tour it looks very
familiar so there's the dock and
charging connector that we see right
there though accessories will be coming
for that we've got expandable storage
living under there and of course you got
your sort of one large power button
right in the middle and lock a volume up
and down and then a physical camera
button I really like to see I've got
Sony's skin on here in all of its glory
to love it or hate it it is here for the
screen looks absolutely gorgeous or the
exact take a look at this see how the
camera performance put it through its
paces see how it performs but if you
want a smaller phone even used to having
to sacrifice performance respects
brutally Sonia said no more I looks to
be a really nice entry to the smartphone
world please check us out on all our CES
coverage we got a ton and stuff coming
up to the rest of the week I'm John
renter from technobuffalo and I will see
you in the next video thanks again to
Toyota for sponsoring our CES coverage</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
