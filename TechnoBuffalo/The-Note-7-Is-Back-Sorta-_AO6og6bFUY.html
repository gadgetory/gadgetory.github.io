office for saying I've got good news and
bad news for you so feel free to have at
it and at me in the comments but I've
got good news and bad news for you if
you like me are still sad that the
Galaxy Note 7 was just pulled out of
your Android loving hands I've got good
news and I got bad news for you
according to the Korean economic daily
via our friends at Android Authority the
note 7 kind of coming back but only in
emerging markets they mentioned
specifically Vietnam and India so the
story goes they'll be refurbishing stock
to start making brand new note sevens
but they've got a ton of notes evans
laying around with a smaller battery
down from the 3500 that originally
shipped with that had all those damn
issues that you guys know about
supposedly it'll be down to about three
thousand and thirty two hundred the
phone should also be a little bit hard
to find there Clemmy are going to be
doing kind of a limited run so a bit of
a sad mark there but if you live in one
of those countries you're traveling for
those markets it should be available
sometime in June I still missed a note
seven
I love the note seven I love Samsung pay
on and I love the screen I love the
s-pen I love the ip68 of the way my
glacier blue looked I love the camera
the retina scanning I loved everything
about the damn phone except for the fact
that it's smoked sometimes and
occasionally caught on fire but in all
fairness almost also in kind of
potential to do that
the note 7 was evidently just a little
more prone than Samsung other government
agencies were comfortable with so it
looks like smaller battery less less
problems so kind of brought to the
question if Samsung did this on a
mass-market in the US or where you live
would you buy a refurb note 7 I'm pretty
sure I would but this close to the
galaxy Si and the SI plus orders had to
call a larger version I don't know maybe
I'd probably just wait just looked in at
7 long you'll remember our good times
when you see like an ex-girlfriends post
Facebook updates and just like hi I
remember remember that time that was fun
week good times and then you wish them
well the rest of their life and and the
new husband and kids that's two of like
a like too much like that exact story
for you so note 7 may be coming back
won't do real quick TV news to share
that story with you and mostly ask like
would you buy one I think I would
specially came at the right price gonna
be 250 or 300 bucks
good absolute steal for the Galaxy Note
seven so our comment of the day comes
from our last video will the s8 beat the
iPhone 8 come from Brando who is a
Twitter handle Brandon Russell works
right there but maybe this is different

for that so comments the day when that
got slapped I don't know if that means
slap your own neck but Ralph did it so
