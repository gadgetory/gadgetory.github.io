technobuffalo here I have so many tech
distraction in my life chances are you
might as well so what do you do to get
rid of all that distractions and focus
on what's important to you well let me
show you what I did maybe it'll help you
as well
for the past four odd years that I've
been on YouTube I've had an amazing
chance to get hands-on with all kinds of
electronics that I never even dreamed of
and I've shared my life with you guys
over the past four years so what you
might know is that I work from home what
you see around me right here this is my
office and outside of this room is the
rest of my house right over there is
where I sleep and right downstairs where
I watched my TV and working from home
I've had a really hard time separating
where work ends and we're home life
begins you know eight nine ten eleven
o'clock at night sitting downstairs
watching TV and I'm on my phone checking
websites i'm replying to comments
sending out twitter updates and all that
sort of smart phone ish things that you
do from your iphone or blackberry device
your windows phone 7 whatever it is that
you're using when i'm out to dinner with
my wife i'm on my smartphone now the
easy thing and something probably most
people would do be just say put the
phone away put it in your pocket don't
use it and I know that makes sense I
just have to had a killer killer time
doing that you know I can't keep the
phone in my pocket I always want to
check and I want to see what's going on
I want to respond to comments I want to
know what you guys are up to and it's
gotten sort of difficult to manage a
personal life while having this I guess
it's a tech addiction so here's what i
am doing about it i am using this guy as
my new smartphone of choice it is a
blackberry bold 9780 it's unlocked no
carrier branding on it I'm using it on
AT&amp;amp;T 3g network so why did i switch to a
blackberry well i need email i got to
always have email coming in to something
they got to reply to sometimes their
advertisers or site issues or writer
stuff i have to deal with so i can't
take the email out of my life but what I
loved about blackberry and this is going
to sound a little weird is the
limitations the brows are sucked so I
can't spend much time browsing the web
on this guy sorry you know the Twitter
application is average i can send out a
few tweets but i can't do that much from
it I can't reply to comments again
because the browser is not so good app
supports not overly outstanding so I'm
not wasting my
I'm playing apps this is everything that
I need and nothing that I don't it is
taking the distractions Toby out of my
life I'm sure this isn't the
advertisement that rim is looking for
he's using a blackberry because of its
limitations but at least for the past
few weeks I found it to be extremely
cathartic I don't know how long this is
going to last insured only a matter of
time before i hop back to using you know
an android phone or an iphone for
whatever iphone 4s or five whenever it
comes out but least for right now it has
been so awesome and so liberating I feel
like I've lifted weights right off my
shoulders so when I'm sitting in my
office I am an all work mode and when
I'm outside my office I don't have my
computer in front of me there's not much
I can do rather than email i can send a
text message and i can be on google talk
that's about it and it's been so
wonderfully fantastic i was getting
really close to even just busting out
this guy the original was at the v3 i
think the original RAZR the back is all
broken and all that kind of stuff but it
makes phone calls I was so close to
going to this fight any an email I
probably would have so am I alone on
this am I super weird for wanting to
simplify things I sort of comes in waves
but be something new out in a week or so
that I'm going to want to try and I'll
forget my blackberry phase and I'll
probably come back to it you know in six
months or a year but you guys share this
you ever find yourself like just
completely plugged in to plugged in that
you can't plug yourself out I send out
all of my own Twitter updates I don't
have anyone that does it for me it's all
me all the comments are all me and all
that kind of stuff I am always in front
of a computer and always want to
interact and I thought that this might
be an interesting wait at least is a
trial to see if I could separate those
two parts of my life something I just
wanted to share with you guys so a bit
of a rambling video just we talk to the
camera but you know I wanted to share it
and maybe I'm alone maybe I'm not but
I'm really curious to hear your thoughts
on it anyway I am jon rettinger from
technobuffalo i'll see you guys next
video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
