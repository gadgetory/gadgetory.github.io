cuts could be looming at struggling
social network myspace there are reports
that the news court own site may have to
lay off more than 1,000 employees in the
United States and overseas that's about
fifty percent of its workforce nearly
the entire staff is off this week in
order to save the business money
facebook me while dealing another blow
to internet Titan Google according to
internet tracker Experian Facebook's
surpassed Google to be the most visited
website for most of 2010 what does that
mean for google what does it mean for
facebook joining us more for a rematch
is jon rettinger director in chief of
technobuffalo and andrew sea turtle
who's director of ecosystem calm welcome
to you both gentlemen John how serious
is this if there are now more people
more Americans logging on to Facebook
than Google oh this is tremendously
serious this is the first time in about
six year history of Facebook that
Facebook has surpassed Google a mounting
for mounting to eight point nine percent
of all US traffic there's no doubt these
two companies are clearly headed for a
collision course Facebook controls the
social media arm of the web and Google
controls the rest Google serve dabbled
in the social media realm in the past
and failed miserably referencing
something like Google Wave which was
dubbed by Google as email to point oh
and to quote them a radically different
step in communication they've also
failed with a product called Google Buzz
which is still in existence right now
what was plagued with privacy issues
from the start it's really failed to see
any sort of massive adoption facebook on
the other hand as really putting a solid
push into the search engines really
bread and butter with Facebook questions
which was launched in beta and earlier
July I'm drew do you agree look internet
businesses are an area where quality of
traffic is much more important than
quantity it's true that facebook is now
more popular in terms of the number of
people visiting it then Google is but if
someone spends an hour on google
searching for new dishwasher that's very
very valuable to Google if someone
spends an hour on Facebook looking at
pictures of their friends vacations that
is not very valuable to Facebook mmm the
thing is Andrew the perception may well
be that the rest of the industry is
innovating i'm thinking of groupon in
particularly in terms of solid sales on
the streets you know doing local deals
done indeed Facebook with the way that
it is now being able to leverage that
vast audience that it has around the
world let us not forget the perception
is that the others are renovating faster
than google would you accept that I
think that's a very strong misperception
I think that Google has shown that it's
definitely able to buy up companies like
YouTube and rightly and turn them into
products like Google video and Google
Docs things that drive traffic and
things that could become core revenue
generators in the future in contrast yes
Facebook has launched Facebook questions
yes it's launched a new messaging
service but when it buys companies likes
a hot potato or drop yo their hood
ornaments they don't add to Facebook's
core business of advertising driven
revenue shoulder by stone woods
absolutely now if I can interject when
as Andrews referencing people looking at
the friends pictures on Facebook's are
also looking at vas advertising that's
populating the site so I think that's a
vast because in this conception a
misrepresentation to say that traffic
doesn't matter that traffic is the bread
and butter of company like Facebook and
if you look at for every successful
Google innovation there's an equally
unsuccessful innovation you only get a
certain amount of popular goodwill
Google's forays into social media such
as google wave and google buzz have been
met with great resistance from the
population and facebook still has a
trump card left to play should it need
to they acquired 18 patents from
friendster earlier in the year for about
40 million dollars which covers really a
broad breadth of social media anything
from making connections on on social
media sites to using a branch to make
connections with other friends and they
really do have that trump card to play
when it comes to patents should that be
necessary mmm we have to leave that
gentleman we're out of time but it's a
fascinating discussion in an industry
that just gets more and more interesting
and intricate each year thank you very
much all the best for 2011 John there
and under thank you thanks Evan</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
