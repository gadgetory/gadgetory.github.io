to you by Toyota hey guys actually
technobuffalo here with tricia from
SourceFed nerd hi guys we are hanging
out at CES really it's a long show
especially repressed yeah it's been
crazy and we've been doing days and
start at show floor open and don't end
show floor clothes we go to some night
press event and keep on truckin yeah
just keep going until you pass out and
it's been how many days now and I can
say I maybe have seen about forty
percent of what's here if that like nerd
disney world where you are never going
to see it in one week like you don't
have to be a two week vacation so Lucy
you got to just pick and choose what you
can see so yeah you have not seen in
fact one hundred percent of the show
because that is actually statistically
impossible in what have you seen that
you really really loved um okay so I had
a lot of fun over in the tech zone area
of the South Hall this year um hanging
out in robotics and 3d printing
specifically there's a wide enough did
you get over to robotics at all I saw
some robots a couple nights ago at
showstopper yeah they're closed little
um it's either MIT for MIP robots a
little party robot yeah yeah yeah the
little dancers I need an entire
civilization of those in my house like
just moving around they're very cute but
I feel like I would have a lot of
nightmares like I feel like I would open
my eyes and it would be like right there
with its led eyes in my face and I
freaking
I want to be really excited about
robotics but then I also have that
incessant irrational fear of sentient AI
hail then rise up and kill us and it's
probably from the matrix well I've got
good news for you the AI is not that
great yet not yet no yeah it's bad news
for me though because i was super
psyched to come here and be like yes the
AI is gonna be real it's gonna be just
like in her we're all gonna start dating
our os's soon and like I'm ready for it
although I'm definitely afraid of I'm
ready for a committed relationship with
an operating I am I totally am I'm very
excited we're very involved here yes
there was a robot I don't know if you
got a chance to see rapido I feel like I
did see this okay little guy they
actually 3d printed the mold that
they're using right now they go two
types camera sensor runs off raspberry
pi like it's meant to be used with
raspberry pi awesome I'm absolutely aah
sighs for a $25 processor right exactly
super cheap it was funny going out to
the booth because a lot of people are
standing there going well what does it
do and the guy who created it who
English is not his first language is
like whatever you want and they're like
don't know what does it do and he's like
whatever you make it do and they're just
going back and forever and so I picked
up their pamphlet and read it and I was
like oh ok I'll explain it come over
here come over here I love that you're
gonna start giving booth tours now she's
available for hire at any nitrous offer
you left you'll see no I actually am I
used to do the good bad thing really
yeah I totally did I'm because you get
paid more when you can describe the
product accurately I find as really good
gigs when you know what you're talking
about that actually sounds like a pretty
good racket and because CES is industry
only it was a great way to get in before
I was involved in the industry that is
also very true I am very very true I I
kind of did that yeah it's a sweet way
to get in so it it hurts me in the heart
space a little bit when people like to
make fun of the booth babe
cuz I'm like hey some of those girls
really know their stuff don't discount
them because they're ladies they're
trying to get into the industry anyway
thank you maybe they are really into
technology I'm gonna keep that in mind
yeah 730 definitely aren't some of them
are just here to get a paycheck but some
really are and but yeah you know what
some of them just need to put themselves
through med school right we can't have
him on a pole no that's going to be CES
next year in like the middle of center
central hall there's just gonna be a big
goal which company would do that I'm
trying to jam vania's the one you have
let's go ahead mr. Fuji mr. Fuji cyber
body slimmer is the name of the device
apparently he may also yes apparently
can also make cyber relax chairs or
something like that which are vibrating
massage chairs cyber body slimmer looks
it looks like a Segway but the bottom
where your feet go just jiggles back and
forth and you can set the speed so just
be sure whole to go I'm
horrified by muscle readies girls is
like really tight clothes just dancing I
the pictures on it is all these
different high knees Oh pics i know why
but the thin but the bubble butt um and
so of course the first thing i did was
hop right up on that one tonight I was
like man I can't work now they should
just call it big machine the beauty she
can't work just jump right on this oh it
was amazing do you think in like 50
years that's gonna be the machine that
they show I'm like clip sort of like
that old machine that used to rub you
like yeah be like a little it that's
what people were saying it feels similar
to that it just shakes you in 50 years
that's gonna be the thing everyone makes
fun a big of God key please oh there
that's our quack medical device I just
love 2014 I just love that their
marketing was a picture of a bunch of
different butts and girls shaking it in
tight clothes we got a frankan you gotta
bring in the you got to bring in the
attendees man
yeah like you said she's five percent of
the show and you know what she stopped
at but the booty shaker yeah the booty
shaker that's what drives around wren's
I'm a damn women very resented mr. Fuji
was also very charismatic I know he
probably wasn't mr. Fuji but the
gentleman that was there it was selling
the product sherry heroin addict he was
very good but then we finally got
through robotics and 3d printing was
awesome to see the chef jet 3d prints
food I did not see that awesome but I
did here is this the machine made of
bacon that Prince bacon there was no I
feel like we need to have like separate
little like like each day should be
dedicated to a certain type of
technology so like game ones wearables
then everybody leaves and then day two
is 3d printing and then we can all go
eat 3d printed bacon and do it together
it'd be so fun the big team about next
year in our discovery digital networks
booth we have a bacon printer I think
that sounds like the best idea I've ever
heard yeah there's a lot of good ideas
out on the show floor this year I'm not
one number one so speaking of number
ones absolute favorite thing that you've
seen um favorite thing that I've seen I
actually just saw today besides besides
the cyber body slimmer isn't this the
highlight of the show copy of something
that I saw today that really stood out
to me just because I wasn't expecting it
like you expect the big TVs you expect
the driverless cars that kind of stuff I
was in Eureka park which is the startup
section of CES were you sometimes you
see some of the most unique stuff and
yeah the virtuix Omni it's called and
they used it paired with oculus rift and
it looks like it's full body full
immersion virtual reality so it kind of
looks like this
stand-up thing it's a little bit it
circulates a little bit bigger than this
table but it can pass capacitive touch
on the bottom so you wear your sneakers
and you run on it in a harness that
holds you still and so you're just
slightly your shoes are sliding on it
but it can be used with any pc game
right now which game would you play they
had a demo with half-life I'm very good
but yeah with anything so like this
guy's got a gun and he's literally
running and shooting and running in and
going to the side and backing up and you
know it's like people say oh well if you
want to exercise while you're gaming get
though we but this is something that
like legitimately like I get scared when
I get scared I run and I hate working
out but like that would be a way to get
me to be active I like for sure well put
you in there and we'll turn on dhoom3
yeah like screw these fitness bands
that's not it you stick me in dhoom 3
put me in a tube with doom 3 on yeah and
I and they're also saying the other
thing that was really cool about is they
were saying it was gonna retail for
right around four hundred and fifty
dollars creates Kickstarter right now
but that's like legitimately something
you could get in your home yeah like
it's not so it's not like hired in 10
inch curved OLED television well you're
gonna get that in your home anyway but
I've saw so many kidneys for that we've
been on such a tight schedule I'm
looking forward to tomorrow Friday of
the show is usually the days tough day
well it's a see stuff day and it's the
day that they kind of opened it up to
the public so we're to the wise if
you're in the Vegas Aaron you want to
check it out that's the day to do so
it's really busy so tartar to see stuff
in that respect but as far as if you are
here for work then a lot of the times
you've gotten your work out of the way
and it's time to play fun it's fun see
things day which I like so aren't you
