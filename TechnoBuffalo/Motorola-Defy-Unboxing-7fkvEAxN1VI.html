TechnoBuffalo here at that unboxing of
the motorola defy this is an unlocked
version of the device that's available
currently in the US on t-mobile the
folks at clove coat UK hooked me up with
an unlock device and if you hear water
in the background nobody's in toilet
it's just because it's raining let's go
ahead and take it to the unboxing so the
Motorola Defy is a 3.7 inch android 2.1
sportin slate device take a look at the
box you have a picture of it on the
front looks like a pretty standard
android slight device picture of it on
the side and you've got some text on the
back which looks almost next to
impossible to read in direct sunlight
but fortunately I had the specs written
down off to the side let's go ahead and
unbox this guy or at least attempt to
he's embarking a bit more difficult
thing to expect alright so slide it off
I've got sort of a neat motorola
unlocked pensets red box there it is
push that off the side for just a minute
it's actually really thin quite
surprising let's see what else we're
going to get in the box we are going to
get a pair of stereo headphones with
microphone attachment so that's nice
third of your usual accoutrement of
stuff micro USB to USB charging port
your battery which is of size 1540 which
is actually a pretty nice DP battery few
motorola fanatics out there it's the
beat f 5x got a a european charger this
is a european unlock device and we've
got the back of the phone alright so
let's take a look at the phone pick off
all the accessories to the side and see
what we have here so let me run through
the specs very quickly on this phone so
as i mentioned it's got a 3.7 inch
diagonal screen the issue you guys ever
heared the screen size that is measured
diagonal sometimes you figure that might
be measured length wise but it is not
with the resolution of 480 x 854 as i
mentioned it's got a 1540 milliamp hour
battery which is supposedly going to
give you about 6.6 hours
of talk time actually the specs a 6.66
which is three sixes in a row so let's
eat this phone really is a beast it's
got android 2.1 on it augmented with
motoblur well not i think that's an
augmentation or not it's probably a
matter of personal preference I've said
in the past I'm not the biggest fan of
motoblur this is the version motoblur
with the colors on it oh you can see you
right there which is sort of obtrusive
it kind of pulls in all of your social
networking things until one supposedly
unified platform it's powered by a TI
OMAP 800 megahertz processor and this is
a processor receipt in the past which is
actually surprisingly fast I despite the
clock speed it really is a nice a power
sucking processor or not power cycle
processor rather that really delivers
decent amount of power on the back side
back side it's got a 5 megapixel camera
with autofocus and flash I'll go ahead
and pop the battery in and put the back
on one of things I don't like about
motoblur is in order to set it up
especially as a reviewer have to log
into a motoblur accounts and that's a
pulling all your kind of information you
can't just jump right to the phone which
I find very annoying uh so let's sort of
continue the tour here you've got your
motoblur array of buttons got your menu
button home button back button and
search on the left-hand side there is
where your micro USB charging port is
going to live underneath a little bit of
a door I've got some visible screws
they're sort of an interesting design
key we actually just follow the picture
on here to see what else we got 3.5
millimeter headset jack which has a
little bit of a cover on it this guy
supposedly is a little bit of a
water-resistant phone I would
necessarily take this out in the rain or
drop it in some pools of water despite
what people have done on tests that's
sort of why we see all these little
parts covered and why the screws are all
visible you're supposed to get a decent
amount of water resistance with this but
I've phones and technology don't surly
mix with water clean always mix with
magnets generally keep them away from
that and on the right-hand side you've
got your volume rocker and also we've
got the power and lock button on top
cameras going of course live on the back
it's a very actually thin phone I'm
surprised at how thin it actually is
let's go ahead and pop in the bat
and see what this guy looks like
alright so battery is going in there's a
micro SD expansion card slot let's go
ahead and push that down up a den here
is the back of the phone which does have
a bit of a soft touch rubber feel
instead of keeping with that water
resistance type thing there's a bit of a
door right here which is going to help
make a seal and see a little bit of a
lover right there now certainly testing
this phone I'm not going to throw
anything of water to see if it works I'm
just going to go and take Motorola's
word for it that indeed this does work a
lot of time with these reviewing phones
we have to send them back after we use
them and this would be probably qualify
under a you break it you buy it kind of
thing I don't really have an necessarily
desire to purchase a waterlogged and
Motorola Defy is I'm going to fiddle
with the back here and figure out how to
get this thing on something with this
little lever seems off I'll come right
so the back is on here it's a little bit
more difficult than a typical phone
because that's sort of seal that makes
but filled with enough and eventually
you would get it to work let's go ahead
and power this sucker on I think we're
just going to get to a motoblur splash
screen that's far as well go and I'll
walk through everything and sort of give
it all total summation when I do the
review and I peel this off because I
know you guys hate to see these things
on the screen so it is off I do read the
comments and I listen well these
tribalism can't make everyone happy all
the time alright so we've got your
motorola logo that we've all seen to
love or loathe depending which camper
and there's a motoblur splash screen
motoblur splash screen again flashing
again flashing again flashing yet again
one more time yet another time hopefully
we're going to boot up there we go Alex
can ask you for a motoblur login and
password or it's going to do the splash
free one more time I wants to make sure
we know that it is indeed running
motoblur and if you're interested in
picking one of these phones up there's a
link down below to the folks at cloak
coat UK and perhaps it's not going to
make me do the motoblur logon which is
super nice let's say if we're so lucky
know there's a motoblur loggin alright
guys so I will walk you through the
phone
and how motoblur to see in the past a
works on this particular set of hardware
i'm jon rettinger from technobuffalo and
I would see you in the next video bye
bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
