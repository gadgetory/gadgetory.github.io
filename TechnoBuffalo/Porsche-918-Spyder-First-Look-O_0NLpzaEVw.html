from TechnoBuffalo here we've got the
privilege of being one of the first to
take a hands-on look at the brand-new
Porsche 918 Spyder this is a spiritual
successor to the gran Carrera when you
think of hybrids you might think of the
Prius the Honda Insight you might not
think of its Porsche this guy it's just
that for taking that hybrid concept to
an entirely new level it's got a 4.6
liter v8 coupled with a 6.8 kilowatt
hour battery pack driving this beast is
a 7-speed PDK dual-clutch it's really
cool to get a chance actually see the
918 a person especially in Geneva

debuted here powertrain on this guy you
know it's gonna be fast that 4.6 liter

two electric motors putting out another
279 horsepower good for 887 horsepower
total as a car of this exclusivity you'd
expect it to be built in minimal
capacity only 918 of these are ever
going to be built for interested in

powertrain that gorgeous looks are some
