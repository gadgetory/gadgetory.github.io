technobuffalo here taking a look at what
i think a lot of you 3d fans have been
waiting for non glasses 3d we are at the
LG booth right here looking at a 3d
tellers obviously you guys can't see the
3d when I get transported through
YouTube but I will say it does look
really good the technology here is very
similar to what we saw on old school
baseball cards would actually take a
card you move it a little bit you see
the image move this is actually very
similar effect as you move around the
television you may be able to see the
picture change a little bit won't look
3d but it definitely changes as you walk
around this is probably the future of 3d
TV it's not doesn't involve any sort of
active glasses then even sort of charge
or even passive glasses like you get at
a 3d movie theater right now this is
completely glasses free technology we
take a look right here they're telling
you now that it is comfortable multiple
viewers can enjoy 3d television you
definitely have to be surf sitting in a
right spot if you're sitting in a wrong
angle it looks a little bit on the
blurry side but this will work for
multiple people
with a ton of other technology there's
going to be 3d applications and you've
come into play here but it does look
very good it's really the first lie of
nice-looking demonstration I've seen of
glasses three technology those you that
afraid of whooping silly where they wear
prescription glasses you want to put
something over I'm more than just a
comparable definitely look for non
glasses 3d TV coming soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
