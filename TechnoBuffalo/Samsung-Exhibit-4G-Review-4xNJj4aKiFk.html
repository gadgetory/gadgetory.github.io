this number again thank you my crewmen
here for a TechnoBuffalo today I'm
reviewing the Samsung exhibit 4G
t-mobile's cheapest 4G phone it's 80
bucks
after a $50 mail-in rebate with the
two-year t-mobile contract voice and
data join me the exhibitionist that I am
on my exhibit of the Samsung exhibit 4G
ladies and gentlemen step right up this
is the Samsung exhibit 4G at close range
I sniped it out of the wild let me give
you some specs here this runs on
t-mobile's 4G HSPA+ network it runs
Android 2.3 Gingerbread so that it's the
latest version of Android available on a
smart phone we have swipe for messaging
swipe and we also have flash support
full flash support in the browser and
that is a wonderful thing let's open
right up to TechnoBuffalo here and you
see our quick this phone is that's a 1
gigahertz hummingbird processor they
stuffed into this bad boy let's go ahead
and open up let me see if we can find a
post with a look it's too it's so quick
that I made a mistake and it just threw
me right over to it ok here is a
stop-motion tutorial cool and obviously
there we go
come on give it to me that funky stuff
give me that stuff that funky stuff
there we go
playing right away cool okay
so now that we've had our fun little
dance capade let's talk about this
screen this is a very nice screen for
phone of this size in this price range
it is a three point seven inch TFT Amal
LEDs touchscreen
it's a 480 by 800 resolution screen it's
actually very nice surprisingly for a
phone of this size of this price range I
was very impressed with it it's nice and
bright
just like Samsung screens tend to be
colors were a little bit on the blueish
side but definitely bright it was great
for reading text especially John ours
tweet posts here which I read every day
and they're just so magical they make my
day scrumdiddlyumptious okay so let's
also talk about memory this phone has an
8 gigabyte microSD card and I really
like the port layout on this phone you
really don't have to snap the back hatch
off to get to any of the you know to get
to the memory card it's right here for
you we get an 8 gigabyte card out of the
box they gave me a 4 gigabyte card I
don't know why because they hate me and
but it'll come with an 8 gigabyte card
and 1 gigabyte of internal storage
onboard storage so it will have 9
gigabytes of storage right out of the
box we also get an enclosure here for
the micro SD p-- micro USB port here and
there's a 3.5 millimeter audio jack
based on that's the size of this phone
it's very similar to an iPhone the only
thing is the exhibit 4G is a half inch
thick so let me show you something
this action here it's a little bit
thicker with the the the rest of the
architecture is very similar in
dimensions to the iPhone 4 and I really
like the design of this phone as well I
love this tapered bottom here I like
this
Darth Vader mask type grille here and I
like this sloped bottom bottom patch
here
it's just aesthetically it's a unique
phone it's unconventional and I like
that in a sea of monotonous and bland
Android phones actually I like to call
them bland droid phones you'll notice
that this screen keeps timing out that's
part of the power save feature here but
this battery it's a 1500 milliamp hour
battery this battery was a great
performer and samsung claims talktime of
nine hours and a standby time of I think
it's over a week something like that
it's a long-ass time for standby but
this did it stood by a very long time I
did not even have to charge this phone
at all calling and spending a day taking
pictures and playing around with it it
still had half a battery life left so
that's one thing that you're not going
to have a problem with this on this
phone is battery life let's see what
else we have in store here let me just
give you a few other specs before I jump
into some of the fun features on this
phone it has Wi-Fi 802 a leaven B G and
n a GPS it has an accelerometer so it's
awesome for 3d games and we have a light
sensor Bluetooth 2.1 with EDR stereo and
that should do it for the core specs one
more thing a front-facing VGA camera
here and that's for video chat and
something that if you are into your
applications and games this phone comes
with bejeweled to Scrabble and doodle
jump so
if you are a wordsmith or you love jewel
puzzles or if you like a little creature
with a funnel snout jumping to oblivion
can you by the way is there an end to
doodle jump it just seems like he goes
forever and nothing ever happens until
you die it seems like the only way to
beat the game is to just die when you
get to a crucial point high in the air
when you think you're almost going to
beat it and then you just um you just
fall off one of the platform's you just
get shot out of the sky by one of the
doodle monsters but I digress
so let's uh let's take a look at Android
3.1
I mean I'm insane Wow
Android 2.3 Android 2.3 here's our
drop-down menu okay so it's nice we have
our little power center here and let's
go check out oh we're getting a phone
call here no thanks and we're gonna
scroll over we have seven home screens
maximum here and we also have a leap
type HTC leap type thing here but is
Samsung and it's Samsung side scrolling
application menu here and you could do a
lot of things on this phone that you can
do with the higher end phones Maps work
beautifully show you maps here
okay let's apparently turn on Wi-Fi okay
Maps as I was saying there we go and you
see we don't have that we don't have the
rotational option we can only zoom in
and out that's okay and that's an
example of you know one of the things
that this phone is missing when you
compare it to one of the 4G giants out
there on the market but overall quick
little phone it's not like a dual-core
quick but it is fast it gets the job
done for 80 bucks I really don't know
how you can complain with this phone
it's solid it's portable it's quick it's
capable Android 2.3 it's got swipe so I
pretty much covered the bases here but
I'm going to go out in the woods and act
like a strange person and give you my
conclusion with the Samsung exhibit 4G
for t-mobile yeah Noah and the next step
is a restraining order so yeah put that
in your pipe and give it a puff
so my final conclusion with the Samsung
exhibit 4G for t-mobile is it's it's
actually a pretty good one the diagnosis
is good I think the future of
smartphones the 4G smartphones are going
to get cheaper obviously naturally and
this is the first example of that
the exhibit 4G exhibited a very decent
all-around performance and had a great
battery life it made calls fine and it
basically did a lot of the things that
the super 4G phones were capable of
doing but it was just smaller and it was
more iPhone like so it is definitely a
sign that the times are changing
if you live in a 4G area and if you're
on a budget then the the t-mobile
exhibit 4G made by Samsung is one of the
best options out there for you I
recommend checking it out until next
time this has been the Samsung exhibit
4G review for TechnoBuffalo I am Mike
Pearlman and I'm going to see you guys
later
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
