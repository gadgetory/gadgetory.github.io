TechnoBuffalo with my review of the
Pelican ProGear u 100 elite laptop
backpack which is pretty much the Chuck
Norris of backpacks first and foremost
it features a built in watertight crush
proof case designed for 15-inch laptops
but will fit up to a 17 inch macbook pro
for those who still own one this thing
is vacuum lock resistant and also gasket
filled so does water tight up to three
point three feet for up to thirty
minutes which is awesome just in case a
freak accident happened in addition to
its fish-like superpowers that is also
TSA ready with quick access so you can
easily pull this out if you're on an
airplane and most importantly it is
crush proof so if you knock it over or
drop it kick it over it is gonna resist
all that impact beyond that it's got a
nice solid rubber handle on the top just
in case you want to carry it as opposed
to using it as a backpack now right
there on the front that is actually an
impact protected ipad pocket so it's
gonna work with the ipad i've tested it
out works no problem nexus tends a
little bit tight won't actually fit
there comfortably but things like the
iPad Mini or obviously the Nexus 7 will
also fit in there and be protected no
problem
there's tons of pockets and options to
load up your external hard drives your
external batteries and that is not even
the main storage section so in addition
to that as well as the actual laptop
spot there is a 16 litre main volume
storage to load whatever your backpack
loading heart desires if you get thirsty
no worries BAM there is a concealed
water bottle pocket as you guys can
check out right there and one of the
things I'm most appreciated was actually
the S curve on the back you kind of
really don't think about this but most
backpacks aren't actually contoured to
your backs design your back is not
straight it kind of curves a little bit
so this is gonna be helpful if you're
taking this on the go or wearing it for
extended periods of time because it is
not gonna break you back now this guy is
gonna retail for just under 300 bucks
but thanks to the interwebs I've seen it
sub $200 we'll have the best pricing and
availability linked down below aside
from that if you are looking for the
utmost protection for a laptop and a
backpack I can definitely recommend
checking out the pelican u-100 aside
from that thank you guys for watching
this video
this is Jonathan aka John for Bull's
signing out see you guys later
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
