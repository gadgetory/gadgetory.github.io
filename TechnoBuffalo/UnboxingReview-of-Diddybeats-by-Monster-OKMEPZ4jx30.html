from TechnoBuffalo here with an unboxing
and full review for you of the Diddy
beats by monster under there by dr. Dre
brand so that further ado let's go ahead
and get started
alright so here we've got the box of the
diddy beats they are of course in ear
headphones which feature what monsters
calling control talk that essentially
has a built-in microphone to let you
control your iPhone and iPod and worked
with blackberry and the Android device
as well right from the headphones so you
get a picture of them on the front they
come in two different colors I think
white pink and black looks like we've
got the white version here on the left
hand side you're going to get some specs
and some high-end design information
from monster and the color is indeed
white here's a little bit about it since
they are Diddy branded there is a
picture of the man himself I talking
about the sound of life high performance
sound management these do feature what
supposedly is an anti tango cable but we
put that to the test and see if they are
indeed and detangle and on the right
hand side you get a little bit by
dragging them talking about control talk
Universal which has been capable mic for
hands-free calling answer phone calls
and that is it so let's go ahead and dig
into the box and we don't have the big
ol knife we do have the nail clippers of
doom which we'll use to go ahead and dig
into this these are going to run you 179
dollars from the monster website go
ahead and do a google search I'll put a
link down below though
to the monster website keys you're
interested and these this are a review
unit that was sent by monster go ahead
and cut these this is less effective the
big ol knife may have to bring that back
there we go we'll go ahead and dig in
babies wrapped in plastic all right
let's go ahead and open these up it
looks like it slides up there we go
all the boxes I open you figure out B
better figure out how to get them open
all right so you've got some black
packaging and a beets go ahead and pull
this up and we presented with the
headphones in a sweet velvety feeling
carry case we want to take this on the
airplane or something and here are the
headphones go ahead and pull this out
see what stereo inside there the
headphones themselves push those through
for just a minute let's see what else
we're going to get in the box
so of course you're going to have the
headphones it's alright elegantly
wrapped push those off the side for just
a moment you have a ton of ear tip
options for all you big or small or
medium sized near people I also can get
a few more your tips as well let's like
get some black ones as well and clip
keeps you want to clip it some paperwork
by monster last train trip to Paris
looks like it's some registration
information and some manual and warranty
so I'm gonna go ahead and use these
headsets for just about a week and I
will see how they look and feel and for
me it's gonna be week but for you it's
gonna seem like just seconds alright so
I've been using these headphones for
about a week and I'm ready to give a
full review on them but before I do I
want to draw your attention to some of
the build things that these headphones
have that I didn't notice when I do the
first unboxing first it's a very premium
feel to them the whole top part here's
actually lined with leather so that
white part is actually a very nice
high-quality leather on the back here
you've got the DD beets and actually
this is a branding that people feel very
strongly about while wearing these in
the gym actually had two different
people on separate occasions asked me
how I liked them people are very
familiar with that DB you know the beats
by dre it's did he beat sort of logo I
definitely a lot of questions about how
the headphones perform which we will
talk about the next kind of interesting
thing about it use this anti tangle
cable which is flat it almost looks like
a phone cord it's very thin and very
durable I'd supposed to not tangle let's
go ahead and put that to the test and I
certainly use these most lose at the gym
they got thrown in gym bags where things
are prone to tangle I serve just wrap
these up
as much as I can in my hand mix it
around a little bit and notice that it
comes out completely untangled so that
does work as advertised and a really
nice feature nice to have to untangle my
headphones all the time when I was using
prior and probably what a lot of you
guys have are the Apple in ear
headphones you looked at sort of build
quality these are sort of thrown into
the iPhone box or iPod box there
definitely is not much our comparison as
far as build quality goes these names
tangle they don't sound all that good
the 3.5 milimeter headset jack i was a
90-degree angle which is actually quite
nice good fit fit in if it's on top or
on the side I think that was good matter
to me or make any issue whatsoever but
it was nice as far as holding my iPhone
when I was running out and have
something bigs from jetting out that
could hit me in the pocket while I was
while it was running
for instance on the in-ear headphones it
stitch straight out so you have them
plugged into the iPhone for example I'll
do that right here this part can
actually hit you with the 90 degree
angle on the beats by dre it's much less
of a problem to sort of something small
that I didn't notice as I went through
and used the headphones alright so let's
talk about the good and the bad because
the beats sorry the the divi beats
rather not the beats by dre the diddy
beats are a bit of a mixed bag sound
quality is fantastic sound quality was
very good i heard really a nice rich
sound the bass was really high quality
when i had it turned out or turned down
really just sounded good on by no means
an audiophile but i can't judge what
sounds good and what sounds bad and
comparing these to the in-ear headphones
that come with the Apple products it was
no comparison Lightning day now that
being said I had a hard time actually
using these headphones and let me tell
you why these little ear cups right here
are very very very narrow and I'll go
ahead and pull this off there's not that
much room right there so you can put
these in your ears it's going to be a
bit hard to try and get them to stay in
what did you get them to stay and you
can't really move your head so if you're
running on a treadmill and elliptical at
running outside it involves a lot of
head movement you're gonna have to leave
have to be constantly putting the
headphones back into your ears
and how they do come with a ton of sort
of different shape adapters and I tried
some of the larger ones but still it
didn't help all that much of these ones
sort of the tiered ones I found to be
the best and stay inter the strongest
but on the most part on an average run
I'd have to put the headphones back in
probably three or four times it did get
to be a bit annoying
now one other sort of strange design
flaw is this metal part right here at
the bottom of the headset it serves no
sort of function other than sort of spot
to pull the wires through but it is very
heavy I mean you have headphones that
don't stay in a year all that well
something that's weighing them down is
not gonna be the most helpful
so as you're running and this part is
swinging for example that bones are
gonna come swinging right out of your
ear so this is another reason I've had a
bit of a hard time with the diddy beef
they do come with a clip you can sort of
clip it onto your shirt which I did
actually have to use a little I wasn't
the biggest fan of it however if you are
going to be outside doing a lot of
movement you're going to have some
problems now using this as a headphone
for a phone working really well the sort
of inbound microphone is very clear I
could mute songs I can mute the audio
from the phone call I can meet songs I
can go to the next song I just worked
very well however due to the hard time
in the ear and when I have using my
headset I would move my mouth sometimes
that jaw movement will actually knock
these things right out but if they
recommend trying them first
perhaps I have big ears and it won't be
the case with everybody but it certainly
was for me
look you're considering the day beats go
and try them if you had the opportunity
to make sure they stay in your ear and
if they do stay in you're going to get a
fantastic pair of headphones the idea of
quality is absolutely stupendous
ten twenty thirty times better than what
I've used in the past as far as in-ear
goes however the annoyance of having
them constantly falling out of my head
is gonna make these very hard to
recommend it to everybody something to
keep in mind and 479 bucks I feel like
something like this should definitely
stay in a little bit better but that may
just be my ears but I wanted to honestly
share my experiences with you so any
guys hope you enjoyed I am John Rhett
enger' from TechnoBuffalo and I'll hear
ya
in the next video bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
