technobuffalo here with an unboxing a
full review for you of the diddy beats
by monster under there by dr. dre brand
so that further ado let's go ahead and
get started alright so here we've got
the box of the diddy beats they are of
course in ear headphones which feature
what monsters calling control talk
essentially has a built-in microphone
let you control your iphone and ipod and
worked with blackberry and android
device as well right from the headphones
so you get a picture of them on the
front they come in different colors i
think one pink and black looks like
we've got the white version here on the
left-hand side you're going to get some
specs and some high-end design
information from monster and the color
is indeed white here's a little bit
about it since they are diddy branded
there is a picture of the man himself I
talking about the sound of life
high-performance sound management these
do feature what supposedly is an anti
tangle cable will you put that to the
test and see if they are indeed and
detangle and on the right hand side you
get a little bit by dragging them
talking about controltalk Universal
which has been capable mic for
hands-free calling answer phone calls
and that is it so let's go ahead and dig
into the box and we don't have the big
ol knife we do have the nail clippers of
doom which will use to go ahead and dig
into this these are going to run you 179
dollars from the monster website go
ahead and do a google search i'll put a
link down below though to the monster
website case you're interested and these
this are a review unit that was sent by
monster go ahead and cut these this is
less effective the big ol knife may have
to bring that back there we go go ahead
and dig in
Jamie's wrapped in plastic all right so
let's go ahead and open these up looks
like slides up there we go all the boxes
I open you figure out be better figure
out how to get them open all right so
you got some black packaging and a beats
go ahead and pull this up and we
presented with the headphones in a sort
of suede velvety feeling carrying case
we want to take it on the airplane or
something and here are the headphones go
and pull this out see us we go inside
there the headphones themselves let me
push those through for just a minute
let's see what else we're going to get
in the box so of course you're going to
have the headphones which are elegantly
wrapped push those off the side for just
a moment you have a ton of ear tip
options for all you big or small or
medium-sized your people I also get to
get a few more your tips as well let's
like get some black wood as well and
clip case you want to clip it some
paperwork by monster last train trip to
Paris looks like it's some registration
information and some manual and warranty
so I'm going to go ahead and use these
headsets for just about a week and I
will see how they look and feel and for
me it's going to be weak but for you
it's going to seem like just seconds
alright so I've been using these
headphones for about a week and I'm
ready to give a full review on him but
before I do I want to draw your
attention to some of the build things
that these headphones have that I didn't
notice when I do the first unboxing
first is a very premium feel to him the
whole top partiers actually lined with
leather so that white part is actually a
very nice high quality leather on the
back here you've got the diddy beats and
actually this is a branding that people
feel very strongly about while we're
knees in the gym actually had two
different people in separate occasion to
ask me how I liked them people are very
familiar with that DB you know the beats
by dre diddy beats sort of logo I
definitely a lot of questions about how
the headphones perform which we will
talk about the next kind of interesting
thing about it use this anti tangle
cable which is flat it almost looks like
a phone cord it's very thin and very
durable at supposed to not tangle let's
go ahead and put that to the test and I
certainly use these mostly at the gym
they got thrown in gym bags where things
are prone to tangle my serve just wrap
these up
as much as I can in my hand for mix it
around a little bit you'll notice that
it comes out completely untangled so
that does work as advertised and a
really nice feature a staff to untangle
my headphones all the time when I was
using prior it probably what a lot of
you guys have are the Apple in-ear
headphones you looked at sort of build
quality these are sort of thrown into
the iphone box or ipod box there
definitely is not much a comparison as
far as build quality goes these things
tangle they don't sound all that good
the 3.5 millimeter headset jack I was a
90-degree angle which is actually quite
nice good fit fit in if it's on top or
on the side I didn't think that was
gonna matter to me or make any issue up
so ever but it was nice as far as
holding my iphone when I was running out
and have something bigs for jetting out
that could hit me in the pocket while I
was well it was running for instance on
the in-ear headphones it stitched
straight out so you have them plugged
into the iphone for example do that
right here this part can actually hit
you with the 90 degree angle on the
beats by dre it's much less of a problem
just sort of something small that I
didn't notice as I went through and used
the headphones all right so let's talk
about the good and the bad because the
beats sorry the diddy beats rather not
the beats by dre the day d beats are a
bit of a mixed bag sound quality is
fantastic sound quality was very good i
heard really a nice rich sound the base
was really high quality when I hadn't
turned up or turn down really just
sounded good on by no means audio file
but I can't judge what sounds good in
what sounds bad and comparing these two
the in-ear headphones that come with the
Apple products it was no comparison a
lightning day now that being said I had
a hard time actually using these
headphones and let me tell you why these
little ear cups right here are very very
very narrow and I'll go ahead and pull
this off there's not that much room
right there so you try to put these in
your ears it's going to be a bit hard to
try and get them to stay in what did you
get them to stay and you can't really
move your head so if you're running on a
treadmill and elliptical or running
outside it involves a lot of head
movement you're going to have to leave
have to be constantly putting the
headphones back into your ears
now they do come with a ton of sort of
different shape adapters and I tried
some of the larger ones but still it
didn't help all that much of these ones
sort of the tiered ones I found to be
the best and stay enter the strongest
but on the most part on an average run
I'd have to put the headphones back in
probably three or four kind of did get
to be a bit annoying now one other sort
of strange design flaw is this metal
part right here at the bottom of the
headset it serves no sort of function
other than sort of spot to pull the
wires through but it is very heavy I
mean you have headphones that don't stay
in a year all that well something's
weighing them down is not going to be
the most helpful so as you're running
and this part is swinging for example
that bones are going to come swing and
right out of your ear so this is another
reason they had a bit of a hard time
with the DB beat they do come with a
clip you can sort of clip it onto your
shirt which I did actually have to use a
little wasn't the biggest fan of it
however if you are going to be outside
doing a lot of movement you're going to
have some problems now using this as
eight a headphone for phone work really
well the sort of inbound microphone is
very clear I could mute songs I can mute
the audio from the phone call I can meet
songs that go the next song I just
worked very well however due to the hard
time in the ear you want to have using
my head said I would move my mouth
sometimes that job movement actually
knock these things right out but if they
recommend trying them first perhaps I
have big ears and it won't be the case
with everybody but it certainly was for
me look you're considering the day beats
go and try them if you had the
opportunity to make sure they stay in
your ear and if they do stay in you're
going to get a fantastic pair of
headphones the idea of quality is
absolutely stupendous a 10 20 30 times
better than what I've used in the past
as far as inear goes however the
annoyance having them constantly falling
out of my head is going to make these
very hard to recommend it to everybody
something to keep in mind and 479 bucks
i feel like something like this should
definitely stay in a little bit better
but that may just be my ears but i
wanted honestly share my experiences
with you so any guys hope you enjoyed i
am jon rettinger from TechnoBuffalo and
I don't hear ya ll stupid in the next
video bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
