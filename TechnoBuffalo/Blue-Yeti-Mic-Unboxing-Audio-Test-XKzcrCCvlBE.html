from techno but flew here was an
unboxing of the Yeti by blue this is a
professional microphone with a USB input
admittedly my audio has not been the
best in past I haven't been up to the
standards that I would have liked I'm
hopeful that this Yeti is going to take
care of it for me let's go ahead and dig
in so I read a ton of reviews on USB
input microphones and the Yeti really
shy to the top by the same company that
makes the snowball you might have seen
it a lot of professional tech reviewers
use it sort of a roundish microphone
this is a step up from that you got a
picture of the Yeti right here ultimate
USB microphone for professional
recording we've got four settings
infinite possibilities is hopefully
going to improve the audios lets you
know you can just stereo mono all kinds
of other stuff here are some features of
said Yeti you've got a meet button we'll
go through all that stuff rather when I
open it up probably a bit better that
way it's gonna set you back about 149
dollars and there's a picture of yetis
on the back the Yeti is not the mythical
creature that evidently likes to play
the guitar go to work study singing
opera listen to music and just be pissed
off this is of course the microphone
alright so let's go ahead and dig into
this guy and of course I'll do audio
test sort of before and after and see
how it works I'm hoping that I can hook
this guy up with my camera that I use
and also when I do screencast this
should improve the audio quality
tremendously as well as when I do live
broadcast so we'll go ahead and take the
Yeti out of the box
hopefully not throw it on the floor
alright so there's another box inside of
a box and there is plastic hereit's go
ahead and bust out the big ol knife and
a cut set of plastic all right there's a
lot of plastic here it's or tape
whatever it is go ahead and cut that
probably shouldn't cut towards me let
that be advice to everybody out there
I didn't even break the there we go
alright so now we've got this open we've
got a USB input which looks like it is
mini USB not micro if you'd be saying a
lot of here is a book on the Yeti
ultimate USB microphone for professional
recording features we'll look at that
later
some styrofoam not good for the
environment good for audio though and
like I need some drumroll music it's a
lot of packaging here for a microphone
here we have the yeti pull off the
silica stuff and it looks like it goes
like this and you can see all the jokes
already going on here alright so he dug
through all that packaging let's take a
look at the Yeti itself we've got of
course a mute button and you've got your
volume button if we go ahead and take a
look at the butt of this guy and turn it
around this is where a lot of the action
happens you've got your mic gain control
right here and you've got your four
polar patterns which are going to be
stereo Omni bi-directional and cardioid
I'll learn sort of more about what those
things do but hopefully the end result
will be much better sounding audio of
course I'm going to play with this you
see how it works and sort of tweak
different settings so be patient with me
as I learn some audio tweaking hey guys
I'm John Brennan TechnoBuffalo and I've
seen the next video by
this is an audio test of the Yeti and
just sitting relatively near the
microphone talking chat see what you're
up to
how are you how you feeling need help on
an emotional level this is just a test
of the regular microphone that's built
into the iMac from sitting at the same
just in chatting talking how are you
good glad to hear</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
