technobuffalo here this is a video
that's been about three to four years in
the making when I've been thinking about
for many many years but in all candor
I've been too afraid to do this isn't a
video for folks that want to see things
be unboxed or see phones and tablets be
reviewed this is a video for folks been
watching us for years new fans or
anybody's thinking about starting a
business and wants to know what it takes
give a very candid look at the company
as a whole I'm going to share traffic
stats actual numbers and as far as I
know no other side has ever done that
and walk you through what we've done
right and certainly what we've done
wrong as well I took a nice
introspective look at where we've gone
and where I want us to go shows you that
are interested and want to know what
TechnoBuffalo is all about sticker so
this video I'm going to try and pull
back the veil and there's always a veil
between audience and business or between
business and customer this is always the
way things have gone I'm going to take
all that away i'm going to show you
actual traffic numbers i'm going to show
you stats and i'm gonna share you know
where we succeeded in where we failed
suppose you'd like begin the
TechnoBuffalo here's a really quick
condensed brief history I have always
loved technology i suspend my days just
walking around best buy when I was
stressed to try and relax and just play
with two tech that was there start
making YouTube videos just as a hobby
back in around 2007-2008 when YouTube
was just getting started and sort of by
virtue of YouTube just getting started
there were that many people doing tech
videos my video started to get a lot of
attention not because I was better than
your bills out there because it really
wasn't many people really weren't many
other people out there and it grew and a
grew very quickly much like you i used
to read all the text that's out there i
emailed and gadget i emailed gizmodo i
emailed cnet saying hey I think videos
could have a big role in sites in the
future no one's embracing it let me be
your guy and nobody got back to me so I
figured I would try and start it myself
I went to business pitches I tried to
pitch for investment money I got laughed
at I ended up going back to business
school at night to get my MBA
from years of california-irvine to learn
how to run a business that's sort of the
real quick condensed version of how
TechnoBuffalo got started one of the big
questions I get all the time and people
don't mean it to be offensive but
oftentimes they come across that way
let's how those technobuffalo make money
when I stop looking at as an offensive
question looked at it as a question that
people are generally curious about folks
it might want to start their own
business in the future I thought it was
sort of fair to answer that and entering
use for the very first time before to
answer that though let me tell you how
TechnoBuffalo is different from other
YouTube channels that you might see out
there so we make our money in two
separate ways so we've got the youtube
channel and we've got the TechnoBuffalo
com website the reasons we've had quick
growth which I'll talk to you about
YouTube is still a second largest search
engine in the world people are searching
for videos on YouTube naturally we'll
sort of come to TechnoBuffalo from there
so we've got two separate avenues of how
the company is going to make money so on
the website side which I'm going to talk
a lot about this we have an ad network
that ad network serves ads that you see
on the sidebar on the mobile side
whether it's your tablet or phone
oftentimes both sponsors will do some
sort of sponsored tweets and stuff on
social media side primarily it's
advertising based on the tech side on
the video side also advertising but a
whole different organization that does
that the videos that you see that sales
video is brought to you by are primarily
that revenue comes and certainly we
share in the google adsense revenue from
the videos as well typically those CPMs
tend to be in the two to three dollar
range oh that's really fluctuates as the
years tend to go so since we launched in
2009 we have had absolutely incredible
growth just for perspective our very
first month in existence September 2009
we did just under forty two thousand
page views and 6587 uniques and what a
unique first page view means that unique
is an actual person the pages how many
pages were viewed so one person can
obviously view many pages and every year
since we've had over 150 percent growth
every single year and as the side grows
gain that percentage up over 100 gets
harder and harder this past October we
set a record for traffic with just over
twelve point eight
page views and the following month in
November we set another record with over
3.1 million uniques and we're settling
in around an average of around 10 to 11
million pageviews and about 2.8 to 3
million uniques but don't take my word
for it you can see our growth chart you
can see our actual numbers i'm going to
show you what the numbers are actually
from google annex themselves so you know
that nothing is being fudged the trust
but verify kind of school so how have we
done this how has the growth served come
that big so first we brought on really
great people now one of the things I'm
most proud of with the company is the
people that we have here I know teacher
once told me always hire people that can
replace you and I've sort of lived by
that mantra we've got an incredibly
talented group of people I'm succeeded
because of them and a lot of times in
spite of me we formed a logic
partnerships and a lot of syndication
deals have been really helpful to help
get new eyes to the site we started in
2009 we've got a very large market share
now but the mind share something you've
always been trying to grow don't always
hear of TechnoBuffalo so we're really
working hard to change that the few
other stats from january 2014 until
right now is being filmed on 11th of
december 2014 we've done it 110 million
pageviews compare that to just shy of 75
million page views from last year 12.6
million uniques last year compared to 20
point six million this year we've had a
206 percent increase on organic search
two hundred ninety percent increase in
social traffic all of this when you
combine text and video makes us one of
the largest independent consumer
electronic portals in the world which is
incredible we're competing against sites
that have huge budgets that are owned by
huge media companies that are owned by
CBS owned by AOL on x box and we're just
us trying to swim oftentimes swim
upstream on the video side we're gaining
about 500 subscribers per day we now
have over eight hundred and seventy
thousand as well as over a quarter of a
billion video views with around 306
million our social network influence
continues to grow on Facebook's become a
huge traffic driver for us aside from
traffic growth
and growth on the video side us has been
a really important year protecting
Buffalo the company we were finally able
to increased responsibilities and roles
allowed us to bring the majority of our
staff on full-time something that I've
been really presently I've been working
towards for the better part of two years
move them to New office built the studio
I had some nerf wars and just try to
have fun while we're here but not
everything we did was right we made some
mistakes and we're really trying to
learn from them and I know that our ads
particularly on the mobile site have
gotten ridiculously out of hand it's a
personal embarrassment to me and what
I'm really trying to rectify as quickly
as possible as some perspective our
current contract with what was a new ad
network last year expires December 31st
come January first we're moving back to
new provider that we used in the past
and I've insisted on complete control
over what units are going to show I know
advertising is integral part in keeping
our lights on but I also know that I've
let our readers down on that front our
mobile site has become virtually
unusable ads pop up articles don't
scroll and it's an embarrassment to me
that's when I am aware of and when I
promising you I'm going to fix I
appreciate everybody is reached out to
me whether it's been on Twitter or email
to let me know and of those are coming
from a place with just wanting us to be
better and that's a huge area where we
need to improve some days we publish 40
or more articles a day we have a really
strict protocol for how articles go up
including a stringent reviewing process
sometimes though mistakes happen words
getting this used spectrum correct or
the grammars a little bit off all I can
tell you we always strive to be for
perfect we aren't always and we're
working really hard to eliminate these
so every article you see embodies the
vision technobuffalo vision is very
simple to provide our readers with the
best consumer electronics news that's
out there we're updating our handbook or
getting our protocols to make sure that
every article that gets up has been seen
through several sets of eyes to help
bring you the most up-to-date and
accurate information that we can I also
know that many of our videos have ads in
them usually four per week these a lot
of like ads on the site are necessary
part to our revenue ideally I like to
create way more video content so the
ones that ads are the exception and not
the rule but this is kind of another
side effect of why tech
but feels different we're a business and
we're business that I run we brought
market on to help create more video
content as we move to next year we look
to bring on more but for me if you do
content I produce becomes were difficult
when I'm negotiating contracts when I'm
trying to take care of taxes I'm kinda
run payroll and such things that you
know normal business owners have to do I
love being in front of the camera I love
talking about consumer electronics I'm
talking about tech news I've been making
sure of an effort the past few years my
technobuffalo less about me how people
think of technobuffalo they don't think
of me they think of company think of
article they read maybe a video from a
bevy of hosts that's been difficult it's
been hard for me to sort of pull back a
little bit I want to do more video I'm
hopeful that i may be able to do that
and in the coming years i sort of give
and responsibilities to others on the
staff and I'm hoping that you can sort
of get my face out there more but also
other people who deserve a chance to be
on camera deserve to have an audience
that they can speak to give them that
opportunity so I know a lot of people
are going to ask why we're doing this
why share traffic stats why give you
actual information why break down where
revenue comes from and the such and why
admit were made mistakes and the honest
answer is if you're still watching this
video I feel like you all deserve to
know this you put food on my table you
put food on everybody's table behind me
everybody that's not behind me you know
every way I can think of you our clients
and if we're not serving you the best
and we're not doing our job you know I'm
sure there's a ton of things I'm leaving
out I've gone too much more detail the
advertising side on something you guys
want to know I will go into more detail
about that I will pull back every veil i
can give you guys a full picture of how
things work but i wanted to sort of
condense everything give you guys an
overall sense of how talking about flow
works where we've succeeded we've had a
lot of successes but also where we
failed i think taking a look at yourself
and your business whatever you might be
doing and sort of seeing where you're at
and evaluating where you've made
mistakes as important as we move to 2015
we look to make resolutions aren't just
personal which also for the business so
it's everybody who's watching now who's
been watching for years everybody behind
me everybody works on technobuffalo
thank you
thank you for your support thank you for
helping us get better I know we are far
from perfect but I give you my work we
are working to get there and every year
I will make a state of the site
video-sharing where we succeeded and
where we failed and again I think you
guys want to see me go to more detail
about it would be my pleasure and honor
to do that thank you guys for watching I
hope you enjoyed i'm jon rettinger from
