Hazleton from TechnoBuffalo we're
checking out the G watch our and it
looks as awesome as it did in the press
photos we saw when it was first
announced just going over it real quick
you can see it's got that metal rim and
look looks like a classic timepiece as
opposed to a SmartWatch I think and it's
got obviously the rounded display and
that's a POF so it's plastic OLED which
is supposed to be great for viewing
angles and it looks like it's good here
and then also under direct sunlight on
the back here you've got the heart rate
monitor and then a button on the side
presumably for executing tasks and stuff
like that we only have a few minutes
with this so I can't do too much but you
can see right here it's pulled down the
notification shade which so it's
obviously the same software that we've
already seen on Android wear from other
makers so there we go bringing up ok
Google wow that's really right it's hard
to even show with the camera it's just
connected from a smartphone so I can't
do much with it but quick look here at
the LG G watch our this is Todd Hazleton
