to you by AMD what's up everyone welcome
back to the episode of rumor roundup we
are they familiar backdrop this the show
where we take all the rumors from the
week we smash them back Shimon condense
them into one rumor show for you see
didn't have to read all the sites in the
world it's the only thing you you got a
watch to know what you missed up this
week we're gonna talk about Apple and
Samsung being the very best frenemies in
the world some Galaxy Note 3 shenanigans
are going on Verizon folks might finally
be getting the HTC One of their dreams
and an iPhone 5s we might know a little
bit more about what its going to have
this is rumor roundup
I'm Rios John Rhett injure let's go and
get started alright so let's start with
the Apple and Samsung news these two
love to hate each other evidently Apple
is switching back to Samsung for LCD
screens lawsuits clearly won't stop a
poll from partnering with Samsung which
means it may cut orders from other
partners such as sharp and LG sucks to
be them the reason behind the move is
likely a nod to the South Korean
companies ability to produce touch
screens using thin glass in super large
quantities very fast the glass is used
in everything from the iPhone and the
iPad MacBook Samsung is also one of
Apple's largest suppliers of processors
and memory partly though kind of misses
the old Steve Jobs way of doing things
we had a similar situation back when the
iPhone first came out and they were
trying to get all the flash storage out
there essentially Apple went salih
supply chains that sold flash stores to
listen give it all to us for the next
five years will overpay for it
essentially that created a shortage for
every other company I'm kind of
surprised Apple is not gonna go in and
snap up a supply chain that creates
displays and buy all the raw materials
and create a bottleneck for everybody
else
makes for fun story Galaxy Note 3
supposedly it's going to pack a
Snapdragon chip processor a more
powerful chip in the Snapdragon 600 in
the Galaxy s4 as well as a pretty
similar 13 megapixel shooter the news
was first reported by ZDNet Asia which
said that Sony's next Xperia smartphone
is also gonna offer a Snapdragon 800
processor so the quad-core chip will
launch with speeds up to 2.3 gigahertz
although it's totally unclear Samsung's
use that clock speed that's just crazy
speed but Samsung does love to win at
least on spec so should be interesting
it also supports LTE and Kat for LTE
Advanced in addition to 802 11 AC Wi-Fi
support and for Mackie resolutions of
2560 by 2048 pixels damn making a
mistake though just because Qualcomm's
new mobile CPU supports technology
doesn't mean Samsung's really gonna add
that Hardware the next generation note
the Galaxy Note family has last
refreshed during IFA 2012 in September
of last year we think that's when the
Note 3 is gonna make its debut alright
so if you're on Verizon and you've been
looking longingly at your friends the
HTC One your prayers might be answered
SlashGear recently obtained delete
images from evey leaks shows a verizon
product with the one branding we're not
too surprised though to see Verizon
jumping on board although it does seem a
bit odd Korea wouldn't just offer phones
sooner rather than later
IEC one those reportedly set to launch
on Verizon early summer which means we
might see it pop up really any week now
another phone dubbed the t6 could launch
in the fall true place enjoy DNA
entirely so we largely believe the
iPhone 5s can look the same as the
iPhone 5 that follows Apple's historical
release pattern and it's probably rather
expensive to totally retool machines to
create a new brand industrial design
every stinking year solo a new rumor
Adam kind of suggested Apple will
decrease the bezel around the screen so
that it fits closer to the sides of the
iPhone some of what you see on the iPad
Mini which he is awesome the story first
popped up from weifeng Network which
also said that Apple plants increased
number of pixels in the screen from
seven hundred and thirty thousand on the
retina display to 1.5 million pixels
we're getting all this information for
you soon apple's WWDC kicks off in june
and we expect to hear much more about
iOS 7 software it's gonna power the next
iPhone although we believe the device
won't launch though until early fall but
whatever they announce we will be there
live to show you everything that's
coming so of course stay tuned to
TechnoBuffalo we take a minute to thank
our friends and sponsors ant
what's up everyone Jon render from
TechnoBuffalo here in our last video we
had some fun with this AMD Tomas chip
but now it's time to get down to
business it's not a spy tool it's the
AMD a6 APU it's actually I think you're
gonna want to use to do games onto your
computing on and do everything you do on
a computer so what I do most on a
computer is I want to play some games so
I installed the game that we play the
most here Tecna buffalo office we
actually have pretty heated left4dead
battle so we installed steam on the sky
put left 4 dead 2 on I want to see how
it performed it's kind of crazy you see
something that looks like this
eventually gonna be in a package that
looks like this this is gonna be the new
a series chip it's gonna power pretty
awesome-looking devices but really want
to see that awesome look to just skin
deep or could actually play some games
let's go ahead take a look
I knew we could handle everything on the
lower setting so we thought it'd be more
interesting and a better test of the
machines capabilities to bump it up so
we kicked it up to 1080p we kept the
film grain at about 30% affect detail we
went to hide the model texture detail
also got kicked up to high I wanted to
see how it performed if you had any
framerate dropping with the boot time
was if the fans kicked on like crazy and
just how overall gameplay was put it up
pretty quick about as quick as it does
on the i3 rigs that we usually play on
here at the office didn't really see any
framerate dropping at all it was a very
pleasant experience in fact after a few
minutes I forgot that this monitor was
plugged into a computer that looked like
a spy equipment
I just worked really well we didn't have
any sort of loss the gameplay was smooth
the fans barely kicked on the whole
experience was eerily quiet we came away
really impressed with the performance
especially for something that's still in
pre-production form and if it could
handle 1080p game it can obviously
handle the rest of stuff you're gonna
throw at it it could handle your
Photoshop your Microsoft Office your
email video watching but ever else you
want to do it'll rock it so what's the
final verdict here if you're looking for
a new computer and if you're shopping
when you are fortunate enough to have
the a series on the market you're gonna
owe it to yourself to take a look
represents a really great low energy
consumption really portable option
it doesn't sacrifice any power that you
get with other mobile processors so keep
a close look out for these systems that
are just starting to come to market step
aside from the rumors for a minute to
remind you about another show we got
going on on another youtube channel
called the tech feed why is the show
called TechnoBuffalo driven
cover all the news in the world of cars
this week we got a ton of awesome stuff
to talk about including the power of the
Corvette c7 and other awesome tech news
and I want to share with you you should
check it out thank you guys for watching
the episode of room roundup hope you
enjoyed please give the video a thumbs
up we most definitely appreciate it I'm
John Rhett injure not see you next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
