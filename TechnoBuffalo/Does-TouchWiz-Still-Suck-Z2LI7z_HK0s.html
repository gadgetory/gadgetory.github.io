popular phones on the planet long being
applauded for killer hardware and
beautiful screens but would not have
been met with equal enthusiasm has been
the UI formerly called TouchWiz I know
I've been especially hard on it for few
generations it's great modern but still
it's got TouchWiz on it which just isn't
TouchWiz gets in its own way and then
you said but on the s7 the s7 edge
actually gotten pretty useful and really
good I'm John Rangers from TechnoBuffalo
and these are the top 5 things to
actually like about TouchWiz before I
jump into the top five if you caveat I
know a lot of these features are
available on third-party launchers and
I'm not going to talk about things that
are apps like Samsung pair things you
can't really see like Knox just what you
can see in touch with your finger and
also some of these features are not just
available on the s7 or s7 edge they're
also available on older Samsung devices
coming at number five split screen
multitasking looking eerily similar to a
Google just released with the first
Android and preview smokey tats and
window drag the application up
I got pitching down below and you've got
to running on top of each other nice and
easy works as advertised coming at
number four a simple long press on the
screen will give you access to changing
your grid size which is very welcome
with my favorite features of other
third-party launchers you can pick four
by four four by five or five by five to
make it look as custom as you would like
coming at number three the always-on
display now I don't like you can't show
through our notifications but I do like
that it's there you can see things like
your missed calls for example you can
change even the background image from a
few stock when the Samsung offers but
for me just laced obviously the time
come in at number two a really simple
elegant touch ability to move multiple
apps from screen to screen really easily
just pick an app drag it up to the bar
at the top throw up two or three or four
go to screen you want and just drag them
right down it's really elegant and
really easy before I get to number one
thing that I like about TouchWiz how
about a few that I don't like what about
the app drawer on the bottom right side
why can't I move that to the middle
where I want it and where it should be
and also the icon still look too bright
and cartoony but fortunately there's
number one on my list and that is themes
you can pick a theme that's gonna make
the device look how you want my favorite
though is one that makes it look like
stock Android save for that app drawer
on the right please only move that
Samsung so you guys willing to give
TouchWiz another shot another
chance are you going to let it suffer
for the sins of the previous fathers I
want to hear your thoughts on it it's
something that you want to pick up at
the galaxy s7 you excited about the
devices are you just waiting for the
next iPhone waiting for the next Nexus
and if you are tell me why give video a
thumbs up but certainly appreciate it
just give it a mash until next time I'm
Jenna in Jacmel buffalo talk to the next
one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
