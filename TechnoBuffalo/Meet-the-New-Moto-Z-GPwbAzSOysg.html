but say a big fat hello to the Moto Z
and it's a beefy brother and the Moto Z
force let's start with the Moto Z is an
absolutely gorgeous incredibly thin
device that motorola claims is the
thinnest smartphone on the planet it
also has plenty of hardware to back up
those good looks but I 600 million power
battery which is incredible for device
this thin 5.5 inch quad HD display
that's really bright and colorful too if
you want to play movies or anything on
it be able to do that because it has
expandable storage now you get 32 gigs
though built-in if you're saying to
yourself self that's what looks awesome
I can't wait to plug in my wired
headphones you are gonna be very
disappointed they beat Apple to the
punch and there is not a single
headphone jack to be found but you will
find in its place is USB see so time to
get a new pair of bluetooth headphones
or a new pair of USB C headphones a
phone in this thinning light is very
strange to pick up it almost feels
hollow but it's not to say it doesn't
feel premium the metal build feels
really solid yet hollow so you got a
pick up in your hands and really
experience it for yourself for phone
this light to pack a cutting edge camera
there's probably gonna be a little bit
of a hump and have a humps it does is a
13 megapixel shooter paired with an 8
megapixel shooter on the front despite
being so thin and so rockin a twenty six
hundred million power battery you can
get eight hours of battery life in just
15 minutes which is pretty incredible if
you like your phone's a little beefier a
little more resistant than Motorola's
got the moto Z force for you it's pretty
similar but it's got a shatter shield
screen to be more durable against drops
and a larger batteries gonna give you up
to 48 hours of battery life which is
pretty awesome but even more awesome 15
hours of battery life in 15 minutes
that's an hour a minute by my math going
through its thirty five hundred million
power battery you also get a little
better camera at 21 megapixels and if
that's all not enough for you how about
modularity Motorola announced moto mods
add some functionality to the phone if
you want to know more about said moto
mod we have a video for you that'll
explain it all so you guys think about
the Moto Z and the z4 so you excited
about it I'm time I say the z4 s I keep
thinking about the flash the thugs both
look and feel awesome
letting your thoughts I don't leave the
comments down below the next time I'm
John render from TechnoBuffalo talk to
guys the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
