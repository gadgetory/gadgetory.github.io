4G LTE device which at this point does
not have a device name we are here with
Verizon Wireless is gonna give us a bit
of a tour of it and talk about specs so
right here you've got this is the Skype
capable phone so here's a demonstration
of the Skype capabilities of this device
on the phone and this happened the last
time so let's say this is running the
new Super AMOLED plus Super AMOLED plus
which means it has 50% more sub pixels
okay so it will be the first one of its
kind for Verizon Wireless that will be
launching you talked a bit about the
resolution screen you know the
resolution I'd have to get back to you
on that one okay but this is what this
guide looks like physical buttons or
physical buttons okay
this one is for a search this one is to
go back this one is home and this one is
to go into the menu and this this is
running Android 2.2 2.2 Froyo will be
upgradeable when you look at one of the
cool things I do like to show is on the
camera here you have an 8 megapixel
camera in the back in the front you have
a 1.3 this right here is the capability
for it to show you so you are now on
camera and then you go to the back and
there you are back viewing what we have
in back of us which is the large screens
so it's very easy to go back and forth
between the front and back camera to
allow you to go in
one of the key things that does show off
the screen itself is the fact that the
let's call so when you're looking at the
actual game the Super AMOLED screens are
gorgeous he always had a bit of a sort
of grayish I'm here understand as that
Ben Sampson has a dress that it is their
actual screen so it has been addressed
with that and as you can see it does not
have any kind of green or blueish gray
dress that so with you know we do it as
a partnership it's all together so but
it does come across I've seen it in the
Sun and it's very do you walk us through
the device itself besides in the bag and
talk about the camera so when you look
at this device so you've got the long
device it is a far device so and it's
all touch so there is no keypad you're
looking at it it does have seven home
screens so you have the options of seven
it is it is running it's two version of
TouchWiz that we've seen the bastard is
a new version of TouchWiz this is the
same version as far as I am I'm in
journalism so when you're looking at the
settings this is the way you can easily
set as a home page and set anything you
want so it's a nice little trick button
there when you're looking at it from the
sides here it's a nice thin side device
you've got the power button you've got
your HDMI output okay from across the
top you do have the ability to put in
your headsets if you do not want to do
your Bluetooth you have got your USB
mini micro charger your volume up and
down when you look at the fact that it's
the bottom was to see how thin and nice
clearness this is the back of the device
where you have the 8 megapixel camera
with speakers down here and LED flash
yes it does an LED flash back the
saiping to the profile inside let's go
take out a bit of a yes it does and now
this actually put in for the speakers so
it has the back speakers and this is an
expandable memory yes it does them what
sort of internal memory does it have but
is it cannibal yes it is is there any
way we could see the battery that's in
there as far as the LTE network a lot of
concerned about battery drain believe me
I know
and is this mobile hotspot people with
it is up to eight update which is new
with our forty minutes if a lot of
journalists would be thrilled to have
that at the show exactly that what is
the million dollar
I think it is 1,500 500 million yep
there's the Verizon's in poverty still a
bit drying the safe it is isn't it and
then here is the expandable memory so
we'll just pull that out so we can give
you up the extendable memory and it has
8 gigabytes in there but that does not
mean what it will launch it sure will be
expandable up to 32 iso but I figure the
cards will permit yep as of right now
plasticky shiny back to it
excellent the back has a little bit of a
detail on it and it does have auto focus
which is a nice anything else you'd like
the audience to know about the unnamed
seem the unnamed Samsung no that is
about it but if you'd like more details
on it and a more in-depth interview we
do have a card for you thank you and any
other to do a launch information you
guys are right now it is mid gear so as
with all our devices by mid-year you'll
be seeing smart phones we have to ask we
didn't have to ask for any carrier
freighter exactly if it dries somewhere
else thank you so much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
