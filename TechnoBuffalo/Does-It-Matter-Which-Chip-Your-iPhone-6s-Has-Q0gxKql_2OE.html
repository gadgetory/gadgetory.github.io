to you dear friends by domain what's up
everyone welcome back to episode of
renter's rifts there's a lot of stuff
from tech world to talk about but I've
been getting a ton of tweets and
questions about chip gate the concern
over different manufacturers making
apples a nine chip talked about it real
briefly in this week's ask the Buffalo
but I thought I'd go into more detail
about what it is and why you should or
shouldn't be concerned
I want to thank Mac rumors and Ars
Technica I did a ton of research to try
and explain what's going on in less a
synched way that I could submit of
overview Apple hired two different
companies to make the a9 chips tsmc and
Samsung and you're probably saying to
yourself Sam sorry I thought they hated
each other they do Samsung and Apple
also knew each other the chips at tsmc
makes are a little bit bigger and
supposedly giving better performance and
value life versus the chips Samsung
makes that's a story people have been
going a little crazy over it trying to
download apps and go to website to see
which processor they have in their
phones and I'm gonna say mostly just
success but assuming talking about 6s
and 6s plus the world the chips inside
are the same all right we got that other
way all right so last week depending on
when you watch this videos early October
let's just say Apple address concerns or
bad luck discrepancies between the tsmc
and Samsung a nine chips using iPhone 6s
and 6s plus suggesting that a real-world
vial of difference was maybe just like
two to three percent between a chip
despite what we're going around the
internet about Geekbench battery tests
that have pointed towards a way bigger
gap not talk about Geekbench in a minute
so the folks Ars Technica did an awesome
job they conducted a controlled battery
life tests in to iPhone 6s models one
the tsmc chip and one of the Samsung
shipments findings line up with what
Apple said in their statement they used
to AT&amp;amp;T models both with SIM cards
removed and screen brightness set at the
exact same level and all apps closed
alright so what about geeks benched as I
mentioned earlier is Apple just making
stuff up so in Wi-Fi browsing WebGL and
GFX bench tests there were performance
differences mostly in favor of the tsmc
phone but the variation between the two
phones was kind of slight there's also a
more
and performance difference on the
Geekbench three tests that test is not
reflective of real-world usage so
despite what you read about Geekbench
not reflective of real-world usage so
aside from the Geekbench test which saw
a battery life difference of
twenty-eight percent between the two
devices the tsmc phone and the samsung
phone scored up in two to three percent
of each other in our technical test in
arthas opinion I call them ours because
we're on a first-name basis the real
world is going to be little different
between the Samsung phone and a tsmc
phone by throwing I mean the chip inside
in fact here's a quote from our site
akka air quotes begin so there are
definitely circumstances under which a
tsmc phone will last longer than the
Samsung phone but it's not a gamer
--sold problem assange some chip that's
mostly idling or even one under modest
CPU usage or GPU load those going to
behave in just about the same way as a
TSMC chip and the kinds of CPU intensive
work the Samsung chip seems to struggle
with just aren't that common on
smartphones most of the time iPhone 6s
battery life should be similar no matter
what chip your phone is using and
air-quote everybody wants to start a
website my grandmother has two of her
own and trying to figure out where you
go to start the website can be tough
domain.com is a place to go in that next
just brilliant idea just lightning bolts
into your head it's one-stop shopping
for everything you need for your domain
from web hosting and email and
everything in between also there are the
200 plus domain name extensions that are
happening now like dot ninja
for example dot NYC dot website and all
kinds of other stuff so if you had the
idea for the next crazy like dot ninja
website go check out the main comm and
save 20% on domain names and web hosting
we just use the coupon code
TechnoBuffalo
all one word at domain.com check out
when you think domain names think
domain.com it's in the name according to
Apple again of course Apple made the
phones they want things to seem good but
according to those folks a comparison of
just two devices is way too small of a
sample size to make any sort of
meaningful predictions about the
performance between iPhones with the
Samsung processor and the ones with the
tsmc
as ours points out no one but apples
resources to collect enough data from
enough devices to get accurate picture
performance so our Senecas findings do
line up though with what Apple says it
has has seen in both labs testing and
data gathered from hundreds of thousands
of customers Apple has also said the
variation between the TSM Siegen saying
some chips that observed as well within
manufacturing tolerances that was a
quote from Apple and as a level of
variation that can be seeking devices
that have the exact same chip the exact
same manufacturer so here's your schools
of thought you go with what our set to
co-founded what Apple found that really
no difference at all or do you say geek
bench geek bench
geek bench I saw the difference there's
a big difference 28% I don't want a
phone that's has a Samsung chip in it
you can pick which side of the fence
you're on if it was me and I want the
deny phone I just go store and buy one
not really care what chips inning you're
not gonna miss that big a difference at
least presumably that's a big difference
well Geekbench tests again are not
representative of real-world usage of a
phone so what use your phone for is
Geekbench tests then yeah it's can make
a difference if you use your phone for
is no more like phone stuff and probably
just exhale a little bit and don't worry
I know I got a little technical I talked
probably pretty fast there's a lot of
stuff to go over but the moral take
anywhere from this video is really just
don't worry it's a phone enjoy it
your better life is gonna be fine I know
what do you guys think about this chip
gate issue up to hear your thoughts on
it leaving the comments down down in
this area until next time I'm John rende
your TechnoBuffalo and I'll talk to you
friends in the next video
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
