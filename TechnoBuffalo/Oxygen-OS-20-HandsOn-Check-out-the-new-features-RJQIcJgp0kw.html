sang it from TechnoBuffalo and this is
oxygen OS 2 which is based off of
android 5.1.1 well oneplus is new and
updated OS may look a lot like stock
Android there are some neat differences
that make the company's ROM a great
alternative now if you were saddened by
the breakup with cyanogen don't be
it looks like oxygen OS is more than a
worthy replacement right off the bat
were greeted with an almost complete
stock Android experience from the on
screen buttons to the animations and the
notification tray it looks identical to
stock Android but dig around and there's
some noticeable differences one of the
newest features in oxygen OS 2 is shelf
but you can access by swiping to the
left from your main home screen shelf is
essentially a screen would quick access
import information such as frequently
used apps contacts and other widgets
it's not quite like Google now but it's
a great place to quickly access your
apps and contacts and it also allows you
to keep your homescreen free of clutter
the other new addition to oxygen OS 2 is
dark mode which is a feature we saw in
an early developer release of Android M
the main purpose of dark mode is to
essentially take all of the white
elements inside the software and make
them dark this will make using your
phone easier to view at night when your
lights are off aside from the really
awesome dark mode feature you'll also be
able to change the accent color from
green to blue to orange to red you can
pick from 8 different color accents to
express your personal style oxygen OS
who also supports custom icon packs in
almost any format without you having to
switch to a third-party launcher you'll
be able to choose icon packs inside to
launch your settings making
customization super easy you can also
change the app drawer as grid size from
a standard 4 by 4 grid to a smaller 4 by
3 or to a larger 6 by 5 grid you can
also rearrange the tiles in the quick
settings pane by tapping on the square
button and also hide certain toggles to
give your settings pane a more
minimalistic look something very cool
that we absolutely loved in a 1+1 was
the ability to switch between the
on-screen buttons and hardware buttons
that very same feature is still here and
I'm glad oneplus left it for one plus
two users gestures on a oneplus 2 are
still present in oxygen OS 2 as well if
your phone is locked for example you can
simply draw a V to enable torch while
drawing an oval launch the camera
double tapping the screen will turn on a
display and swiping down on the screen
with two fingers will play and pause
your music
the
tammer UI in oxygen OS who looks
completely different - and it's sort of
like a mixture between stock Android and
iOS the icons and overlays are very
reminiscent of Apple's camera UI while
the animations and features are very
much like Google's overall it's
simplistic and modern and very easy to
use oneplus also added app permissions
in oxygen OS - which will allow you to
take full control of what apps can
access your camera location contacts and
more this is very similar to what Google
has planned for Android M in terms of
security if a certain app is sending you
way too many notifications or you don't
want Instagram to use your location
you'll be able to turn them off oxygen
OS - on to oneplus 2 has been a blast so
far it's buttery smooth and we think the
new features such as dark mode and shelf
are great addition to an already great
OS oxygen OS - is very simplistic and
modern with no bloatware which is great
it also feels very light and snappy -
we're still working on our oneplus 2
review at the moment but if you want to
see more one plus new coverage like this
you can check out some of the other
videos we've done over here anyways
thank you guys so much for watching and
if you guys enjoy this video make sure
to give it a thumbs up and we will see
you guys in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
