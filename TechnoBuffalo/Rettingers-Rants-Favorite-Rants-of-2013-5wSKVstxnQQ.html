to you by netflix what's up everyone
welcome back there pisode of renter's
rents the show where I rant and rave on
something that's pissing me off no other
technology looking back on the year
there's been a lot that has pissed me
off some I was right about so I was a
little oversensitive I can admit but in
this kind of year-end episode I want to
wrap up my top five favorite rants at
least top five that meant something to
me and there's stories behind each one
of them going it started coming in at
number five from februari 27th I got
ripped apart for this video and probably
rightfully so it was a balance of the
ps4 right during the ps4 announcement
right when Sony sir first unveiled the
console that really unveil much else in
the way of details I was really really
tough on Sony and it seemed like they
were poised to be overtaken by Microsoft
before the xbox one was announced turns
out I was very very wrong and retrospect
probably deserves all the criticism that
I got some of the comments were little
in the personal side some of them were
pretty accurate turns out those things
would have it I really love my PS orange
probably one of my favorite consoles
ever that I've ever had I'm certainly
I'm using it pretty much every day not
just play games but I'm streaming
everything from it because my blu-ray
player I'm really just enjoying it
overall number four from sep tember 2012
I know it's technically not 2013 but I'm
counted I think it's still relevant
Samsung you have too many damn phones
and that is still true you have too many
phone samsung we don't need a mini
regular max I don't mean 19 versions of
your camera phones and 16 different
galaxy variants just maybe just make a
few yeah that might be simple I still
hold true with that one number three
this was probably one of my favorites at
least some of the most fun videos to
make of the year it was just you know
about sixish weeks ago from November
sixth where's John Q it was when John
came out to visit us here in California
I junkies probably with my favorite
people in the world he's probably one of
like the three greatest human beings
it it's nice to get a chance to see him
to hang out and just talk and also put
you guys see John on camera again I'm
hoping that we can convince John to go
back in front of the camera cuz you is
pretty awesome on it number two from
july twenty fourth technobuffalo updates
Ashley had just joined us and you guys
were all freaking out about somebody new
on the channel it was a time when I sat
down and I was like listen guys we're
growing in order to grow I were to run a
business I can't do every single video
and after that you guys really embraced
actually very quickly and oftentimes
embrace her inner much more than you
guys do me even so that video is sort of
personal to me it was something was
really cool to see the audience kind of
grow with TechnoBuffalo and then I
really appreciated that and my favorite
rants from last year coming at number
one was from august fourteenth tech
youtuber tips I'd love the chance to
share some the knowledge I've learned
over the years Tim that's right some of
its not but I always feel a duty to get
back to the tech community I think kind
of look at it like a fraternity you know
we serve have to help each other that's
the same analogy of you know all ships
rise when there's a high tide you know
whenever anybody industry does well it
just lends more credibility to what we
do as an industry so I sort of feel
obligated to try and help those after
that are just starting it's much harder
to start now gonna was back when I was
much more crowded so anyway that i can
try and give back I'll do that I know it
wasn't even a rants I came at number 10
just one of my favorite videos to make
and I'm looking forward to be able to
bribe me more tips and maybe help more
people get their start on YouTube been a
crazy year for rants I got really angry
about a lot of things and I was thankful
for a lot of things and some things I
was irrational about but that's the
point of a rants it's not always it
always makes sense and they weren't
always rants I supposed to just
something that was on my mind but rants
and rettinger do rhyme so that's where
the show name came from but thank you
