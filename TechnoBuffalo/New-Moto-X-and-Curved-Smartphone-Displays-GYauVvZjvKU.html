to you by teen mobile that makes sense
what's up everyone welcome back there
pisode of ask the buffalo this is the
question answer show we could ask me jon
rettinger whatever question is running
around in your mind you want to talk
about new cell phones new wearables new
tablets or you know why your girlfriend
stops talking to you this is the show
that you can ask up this week it's the
Moto X note for in galaxy edge some
gorgeous moto 360 talk and some curvy
screens is that's a buffalo let's start
asking the first question comes from
Billy st. John who asks at John for
lakers what do you think of the new Moto
X hashtag asked the Buffalo I loved the
original moto x and i am beyond excited
about the new one so first day up the
specs and up the screen it's now not a
low respect phone really it's got a 5.2
inch 1080p display it's got the
snapdragon 801 mike one of my favorite
things that was custom voice prompts so
instead of just saying you know ok
Google you can just be like sup bro how
many species of mountain goat are there
and you'll tell you or sup homeslice or
don't be iran whatever you want to say
and it'll you can just big it but i
think is really cool of course all the
moto maker options are there so you have
crazy customization stuff they've now
got aluminum band around it I could pick
even leathers if you want which sounds a
little weird to have a back on the phone
but listen if leathers your thing I'm
not I'm not here to judge you do what
you want as long as it's between a
consenting adult and a consenting phone
you can use leather it's fine with me
pricing went up a little bit though
which is not overly awesome but so did
spec so I guess it's kind of relative
it's about 500 bucks if you want to get
it unlocked or 99x want to get it to
your contract it looks like a really
really sweet phone they promised update
you're gonna be coming to it really
regularly it'll be ready for Android
else you get sort of the best google
experience plus the awesome moto edition
so it's kind of like a win-win next
question comes from at Cal abroad at
john for lakers is a note for note edge
worth upgrading to from the note 3 that
sir is the million-dollar question so
worth it is total
the relative my wife uses a note 3 and
she loves it I showed her videos on the
note 4 and the note edge and I was like
do you wanna upgrade and she wouldn me I
have no need she thought the note edge
seem kind of silly but if you use your
right handed where you're going to put
stuff and what if you dropping that's a
lot of concerns people have but for me
who likes technology the note edge seems
absolutely awesome i'm really excited
that samsung is trying something new
with you like it or don't like it that's
going to be up to you but they're trying
something different and i appreciate
that as far as upgrading the big thing
for me if you don't like the screen on
your note 3 then yes if we worth
upgrading you're getting sort of a qHD
2k screen on your phone regardless which
when you go for it either 5.7 or 5.6 on
a note for and a galaxy edge
respectively so beautiful screens big
sizes if you want to have the latest and
greatest and yet upgrade otherwise I
think the note 3 is going to be there
still really solid advice for another
year until the note 5 and edge to come
out we stopped the question for one sec
to thank the good peeps add ting you've
got money in your wallet you probably
want to keep it there with ting you
aren't forced to pick a plan based on
what you think you might use from data
minutes and text which means there's way
less waste if you just use less you
simply pay for the service you use leave
the service and ever you want with no
fees so that makes life much easier no
hidden admin fees no crazy sketchy weird
surcharges team bills are super simple
to understand and they only charge you
usage but six dollars per device plus
tax each month and that's it so you can
figure out exactly your mobile bill is
going to be you don't use much than
month you don't pay much for that month
the mobile phone experience in general
includes a lot of confusion and
powerlessness sis's and plans tend to be
littered with crazy hidden fees steep
penalties arbitrary rules unnecessary
premiums and phone companies tend to
kind of be unapproachable and flexible
for tried to call your carrier you know
exactly what I'm talking about bottom
lines though consumers are overpaying
and underserved if your phone carrier
was a restaurant you would never go back
there current customers with tang will
likely say huge decrease in your monthly
bill go check out the rates page at
technobuffalo tang com to see what your
new lower bill is going to be this
technobuffalo tinkham at TI ng
let's talk about some moto 360 at coach
C WCS at John fo Lakers do you think
sales will not be as good for Moto 360
since it only has a leather band instead
of metal until later in the year I don't
think that's gonna affect those sales at
all that watch is absolutely gorgeous
and it's $249 Scott removable bands tues
you can go buy a leather metal band
rather put it right on and be good to go
i don't think waiting for it is gonna
make much sense at all if it was like
350 bucks and yeah maybe make a
difference but 249 is really cheap it's
on par with the other Android wear
watches and sort of just beats the crap
out of them books apartment looks like
those other two just got beat with the
ugly watch dick next question comes from
Nick geeks who asked at John for lakers
what do you think of this new curved
screen trend you find them to be useful
you think they're kind of gimmicky yeah
that's a good question uh I mean they're
probably a little bit gimmicky but
they're also probably little bit useful
they are definitely still sort of in the
infancy of what they're going to be but
I'm again I really like what Samsung's
trying something new at some point with
every new serve paradigm shift in
technology there has to be served a
first device that tries it and sort of
puts it out first Mets may not be the
best implementation and it happens but
they always have to be someone that's
trying its get to serve the audience and
consumers use of something new and
that's what we're seeing here with the
galaxy edge has been stroker screens
before you know we've got things like
the g flex and the galaxy nexus had a
little bit of a curve to it but it's
something brand new as far as how you
use a device that's sort of a whole
separate screen on the side we'll see
how consumers gonna respond to it I
think one of things are gonna want to
see in person before you use it kind of
weird you can t have controls on the
side again what if you drop it I don't
land on the right-hand side a lot of
concerns there but i think it's the
future I think curved screens least
wraparound screens are really getting
something that's going to come very very
very fast I think we're going to see
serve wraparound screens for
advertisements on you know power poles
and such that's going to be happening
much sooner than we expect they're just
kind of getting people used to it as far
as the phone goes I'm excited to see it
though I just want to play with it and
what do you guys think are you excited
about crazy curvy screens I want to hear
your thoughts on it until next time I am
