about two months ish away from the next
iPhone iPhone 7 s iphone 8 whatever
Apple might decide to call these phones
so it's time to go to recap some the
latest rumors that have come out the
past few weeks you get a better picture
for the iPhone 8 is going to be and
before I tell you what I think it's
going to cost you might want to sit down
let you put your feet up because chances
are you're going to be a little bit
surprised according to John Gruber the
top-of-the-line iPhone 8 with Twitter 56
gigs of storage could come in at wait
for it $1400 just let that sink in for a
minute there's been always to talk about
an Apple tax the Apple charges more for
their products fourteen hundred bucks is
crazy and if that's too much money
there'll be a little lower cost one
about twelve hundred dollars can give
you 64 gigs of storage I am hoping that
that is just hearsay I don't care how
nice an OLED panel looks or how
edge-to-edge a phone looks going to be
damn hard pressed to pay 1,400 bucks for
any phone you can buy a used car for
that price maybe not like a
top-of-the-line car that is a ton of
money if you decide to spend all that
money for for an iPhone 8 inductive
charging wireless charging is going to
be part of the phone but much like
portrait mode with the iPhone 7 plus
it's not going to be ready by the time
the phone ships in supposedly late
September so for tender bucks it's
wireless charging but just can't
wireless charge it yet supposedly the
deductive charging pad will be also a
way for it don't separately but if
you're still with me and you're still
geared up for an iPhone 8 a friend bed
guess game is back with another rumor
saying about coming for colors one of
which will be a near finished option so
think of kind of like ipod touch style
back with the the mirror on the back
hidden safe the other 4 colors will be a
probably some combination of voice and
jet black product red whatever the
colors have had in the past rose gold
gold should be
in there so recapping our our iPhone 8
newest batch of rumors so it'll be some
sort of edge to edge boy I'm not gonna
call it infinity display because that
Samsung deal but should you have sir
that cutout at the top the screen kind
of wraps around and encapsulate so much
or how I feel about that fingerprint
sensor rumors for there have been all
over the board from going to be on the
back giving the Apple logo and looking
to the screens applicant digit up
together I need some sort of facial
recognition unlocking technology we
don't know much there as iPhone 8 we do
know it's gonna be expensive
certainly I'm hoping not 1400 bucks for
top of the line it's not gonna be cheap
about we're getting a better picture
that's not going to be the only phone
Apple's going to offer so be that 7 s +
7 X plus at the lower price point that
we're sort of come to expect and of
course you can do a carrier pricing plan
for all that your pay it off over a few
years so if i tempered your iphone 8
excitement have I got you frothing it's
a mouth like a rev dug for some iOS 11
action love to know what you guys you
guys think a lot of money leave in the
comments down below hope you guys
