the time with technobuffalo we're
checking out the LG g2 is just announced
today and it's going to land on AT&amp;amp;T
Verizon Sprint and t-mobile United
States although pricing wasn't announced
and we also don't have a release date
yet but let's check out the phone itself
move around there's no buttons on the
device except for the back so right
there you're just looking at the SIM
card tray I presume back there it's a 13
megapixel camera and you've got the
unique volume controls in the power
button in the middle seeking adjust
those or launch the camera even from the
back single LED flash on top you've got
the IR blaster nothing on the left or
the right generally four buttons where
you to see the volume control speakers
on the bottom with a 3.5 millimeter
headphone jack and here's the front
where you've got the 5.2 inch full 1080p
display and it's a HD it's a high PS
display as well 3000 milliamp hour
battery under the hood this is one of
the first phones to launch least in the
United States it will be with a
Snapdragon 800 processor that's a
quad-core chip let's take a quick look
at the software here it's running
Android 4.2 point2 jelly bean so not the
ladies remote or not the latest release
rather they've got quickly memo qslide
quick remote sound data all the controls
right here in the top miracast battery
saver should tons of controls right on
the top of the display there in the
notification menu
pull it up we're not going to see any
blow we're here and we don't have a sim
card in so it's a can't tell which carry
this looking forward just based on this
unit here
let's see if we can find some music
people are stay in the audience gets
little city pictures first
alright here's a sample video so you can
check out the full HD display
pretty neat so the 13 megapixel camera
with optical image stabilization so they
say that it should prevent blurring and
a lot of phones they're sampling us have
either for 8 megapixel cameras with
optical image stabilization rather see
we can check out some of the controls
here can change the shutter size of the
photo you're shooting it looks like it's
set right now just 10 megapixels so by
default you have to switch to 13
megapixels qja taggings off we've got
the capture key here that's one of the
options from the back so you can use the
camera to capture a picture or rather
the volume controls capture picture from
the camera
FM radio we just saw their
so here's the Vienna's boy the Vienna
Boys Choir rather we just heard them
perform now it's a little take taking a
little getting used to change the volume
from the fact that it's a loud room it's
kind of hard to hear those speakers
anywhere any case again this is coming
to AT&amp;amp;T t-mobile Sprint and Verizon
Wireless the United States in the coming
weeks this is Todd Hazleton with
