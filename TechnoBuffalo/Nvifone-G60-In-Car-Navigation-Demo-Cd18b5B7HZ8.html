gone in car to give you a demonstration
of the garmin nuvi phones g 60s core
feature the navigation system so I've
got the car mount here and you can also
make use of the mini USB port on the
back and plug it into your car listening
has a full charge so I'm not going to
use it got to make sure you set the
brightness to not time out as well so it
mounted just like you'd find any other
garmin gps and the operating system just
aligns itself when you turn it into
landscape so to start the gps you can do
it one of two ways you can either hit
search or view map if you hit Search
you're going to be brought into a very
familiar garmin looking interface any of
you that have a standalone garmin gps
unit one of the new v's you're going to
immediately recognize this it looked
just like it would on any other device
you can search by points of interest you
can set your home you've accessed
yellowpages address favorites recently
found upcoming events movie times gas
prices contacts if their addresses are
stored your coordinates or you can
browse maps so as i mentioned in my
previous descriptions of the g60 the dr
some premium features that are offered
with this when you buy the g60 and you
just buy the phone itself you have
access to the navigation functionality
no additional charge the maps are stored
locally on the device so you don't have
to worry about having a data connection
however things like gas prices and movie
times require a premium subscription to
AT&amp;amp;T which as of right now i believe is
about five dollars so to show you an
example if you hit movie times it's
going to check for that premium
subscription so just know that if you're
looking to get this and use it just as a
navigator you're not going to get some
of that premium functionality and that
includes live traffic updates right now
checking for premium subscription
service so it's not going to find it so
I'll just cancel out and go back so
let's go ahead and see what the
navigation looks like since we are
sitting here in a car I'm going to go
ahead and put it in a dress so we'll
search for how that we do points of
interest
yet fueled bank shopping food let's pick
some food we'll pick Asian food I do
love Chinese food so you can pick pick a
place you can either call it right from
here since obviously obviously a phone
view map or go we're just going to go
calculating the route
please drive to highlight it round and
this does have text to speech so it will
actually say the name of the street as
you're going so I'm going to put on my
seatbelt and i'm going to start driving
you can see what this looks like in a
real time and driving environment so
tell me to proceed to know crush street
so i'm going to proceed to know Chris
tree quite obviously and you can hear
what the navigation sounds like and what
it looks like and the game throws you
that have used the garment this is going
to be extremely familiar to you and
there you go and I'm just gonna keep
doing that until you get to where you
want to go there isn't an audio ding
that tells you when to turn you actually
have the option to set that if you like
I turned it off of like the lady to not
yell at me as much as possible miles so
you can see that the navigation system
just works as what any other standalone
navigation unit
okay so we just arrived at the location
and I want to show you some of the menu
options that change as using the GPS so
I hit the back button and we go back to
the home screen here notice I've got new
icons on the bottom I've got stopped and
detour so if you happen to back out of
your gps functionality you are actually
going to get access to some of that same
navigation functionality from the home
screen of the phone and certainly the
other menu options are still there as
well so this is your navigator and
obviously at your phone as well so does
it handle accepting calls when they're
coming through as you're doing your
navigation so I'm going to go ahead and
have somebody call me right now and
we'll see how this takes it
so it interrupts navigation go ahead and
hit answer a client we will answer the
call hello so as you can see we're
documenting our phone call and we got
the option to hang up or continue the
columns we like and goes right into
speaker and the navigation continues
while you're making your phone call so
you have the option of calling while you
are navigating all via hands-free if you
have a bluetooth headset connected it'll
be routed right to the bluetooth and
then the call will end when the call
ends so from a phone and a navigation
standpoint you're not going to get a
better standalone navigator than garmin
and that same philosophy follows through
to the phone or not going to get a
better phone navigator then you're going
to find with garmin all the other
functionality is the operating system
the OS the email the text messaging you
know that's another story and we'll
discuss that during the review but right
now I want you guys to see how this
handled phone calls now if you can also
go through and make phone calls while
you're in the navigator mode you can
just back out of navigation and go right
to your phone here and make phone calls
and then go back to navigation and it's
going to keep the speaker phone
functionality on for you if you have
Bluetooth connected again you can use
that as well anyway guys this is a jon
