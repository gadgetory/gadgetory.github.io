Sanger from TechnoBuffalo and in today's
video we're gonna be sharing with you
guys three Android launchers you should
check out we did a video a few months
back highlighting some other great
launchers so make sure to check out the
link down below now this list is in no
particular order whatsoever so let's get
started
starting off with number one which is
solo launcher now solo launcher is a
free launcher that's designed to change
the way you use your home screen not
only does it look super simplistic and
clean but it offers gesture controls to
launch apps and other actions now if for
example I use the gesture to zoom out
it'll launch the calculator app if I
pinch to zoom in it'll launch the camera
app there are nine total gestures that
you can set for individual apps to
launch giving users a lot of flexibility
since I'm using the Nexus 5 and it
doesn't offer DoubleTap to sleep I
installed a free plugin and now I can
double tap the screen to put its sleep I
can also change themes very easily no
need to go through menus if you have a
few icon packs already installed on your
device you shouldn't have any problems
other features included in the solo
launcher includes the ability to quickly
clear your systems trash files and free
up space and boost performance ok Google
works with this launcher too which is
great and that's about it
everything that solo launcher offer is
free plugins are free and extra apps
that work alongside the launchers are
free so make sure to go check those out
the second one on our list is femur
it's a launcher that specializes in
themes hence the name femur if you love
to customize your phone and want
something that'll definitely change how
your home screen looks femur is a great
option there are over 400 themes
available to download for free and most
themes are customizable or you can use
them as they are theme ur also supports
for third-party icons found in the
Google Play Store now this launcher
still uses a basic app drawer and widget
functionality but with the customization
you'll be able to do with this launcher
I don't think you'll ever want to use a
regular app drawer anymore
fever is free check it out from the
Google place the last one on our list is
the everything me launcher everything me
is a contextual launcher that delivers
what you need from your phone in just
one tap once you saw the launcher all of
your apps will be sorted into smart
folders you'll have one for social games
photography and it'll figure out on its
own whether that app is really for that
specific folder now one thing I found
pretty cool with this launcher was the
suggestions and features within the
folders it'll recommend an app for you
to download for that specific category
and for example I check out the around
me folder it'll show me my location and
if I swipe to the left it'll show me
nearby places I could go to which is
really cool I can navigate to that
specific place right away with a type of
button now another thing I noticed was
when I checked that the news folder it
also shows the information or headlines
from news outlets like The Washington
Post ABC News and NBC there's a search
bar at the top for you to easily search
contacts apps and more and it makes
searching stuff so much easier there's
also the prediction bar right above the
dock which shows you relevant apps for
you at that moment now for example if I
click on this calendar icon it'll show
me my upcoming events and I could create
a new event if I swipe to the left
I could also check out the news check
the weather see my frequent contacts and
relevant apps everything be is also free
from the Google Play Store give it a try
and let us know what you think anyways
