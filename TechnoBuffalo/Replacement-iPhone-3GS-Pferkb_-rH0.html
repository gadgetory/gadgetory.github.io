recording this with the camcorder on my
new 3GS Apple was nice enough to replace
it for me really no questions asked I
was still within my 30 days I expected
them to do so but it was nice to get
that quality of customer service and
they did it much faster than I
anticipated
without an appointment at the Genius Bar
so I don't know what happened to the
phone they really didn't know what
happened to it either the screen
wouldn't turn on it was really
unresponsive it wouldn't go into DFU
mode it wouldn't restore you know
obviously I tried holding the buttons
down doing all kinds of other things the
phone was just dead would not work I
think that it was just an isolated issue
and probably not a representative of the
quality of the 3GS a lot of friends
who've had them and haven't had a single
issue I think I just got a bum one out
of the batch it was nothing to do with
some of the overheating issues that
people are talking about as well you
know I have a white once people were
wondering if it was brown on the back
for anything I think it's being reported
out the discoloration issues were just a
result of some third party cases and
could be cleaned with just some cloth I
used the GPS on the 3GS non-stop for
good half hour 45 minutes I didn't get
any overheating issues long as you don't
leave your phone in the car for three
hours while you're gone you know you're
gonna be fine it's a battery in there
the battery is left in direct sunlight
for a long time it's gonna expand and
your phone's gonna have trouble that
wasn't what happened to mine I think
just one of those weird bump things but
Apple did give me a new white 16 gig so
if you guys are worried about getting a
white one because you think it might
turn brown don't sweat it
you are going to be fine so wants to
give you an update I'm actually adding a
couple movies right now while I am
filming this but I just wanted to say hi
and let you guys know what was going on
see you the next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
