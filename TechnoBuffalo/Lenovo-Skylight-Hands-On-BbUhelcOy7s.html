deceptively thin I mean it is really
tight running a custom build out of the
Linux that was designed by Qualcomm and
Lenovo it is just amazingly thin and
really tiny this thing is very very
light clearly has a sealed and battery
which tracks on it you don't really know
that much about the spectrum eyes on
what do you want to know hi today as far
as a hard drive space Ram quadratics
there's an eight gigabyte NAND flash
chip on the motherboard that for the OS
is hold long with some indexing of your
data applications there's actually a
absolutely
this is actually a 4 gigabyte USB key
you can actually get a larger ones we
sell larger one there's a microSD card
where the base is 8 gigabytes again
expandable Rapunzel 2 gigabytes in the
cloud again expandable and that's all
completely user-accessible that comes
right out so actually if you guys
you can see the light blinking here 720p
video is playing officer kick it over
there so is your sexy a staple of
playing whole very clear 720p playback
and that's from our custom video today
yesterday's recover here
there's a mini HDMI port on the sorrow
which might come to our television
notice capable of playing as a pretty
substantial video alice's what a 32 inch
strip so you can play this to a 32 inch
screen bring this over to a friend's
house and very clearly watch pleninger
up the video you can't tell if this is a
anemic processor or not ok 30 full
powers and really surprisingly capable
