TechnoBuffalo here there are a ton of
smart fans out there and the latest one
about the privilege to check out is by
adidas it is a fit smart band it looks
almost like a cuff but does a lot more
so I'm good and walk you guys through it
and what it does and see if it's worth
your smart band buying dollar so here is
the band itself looking more like a cuff
than a smart band before I put it on
I'll show you the back of it there's
where your magnetic charges are going to
live and it's going to plug very simply
into the included charger which will
just plug into a simple USB port
utilizes green LED tech in order to get
a lock on your heart rate adidas says
the battery's gonna last five days but
that includes a pretty stringent workout
each of every five days I'll be honest I
did not work out five days in a row and
I was easily able to get almost ten days
of battery life out of those guys if you
wanna use it as a watch you'll get
plenty of life at it and of course if
you want to use it for what it can
actually do you're gonna get well past
that five days so it comes in two sizes
small and large I don't know the largest
wrists in the world but they did send me
the large version which does fit so it
fits very similar like a watch you go
ahead and slide it through you find the
right latch for you and put it in
instead of having a standard loop it's
got a little bit of a hook you can go
ahead and push right through to give
kind of a more seamless look now it's
gonna be very important that you get
this relatively tight this does have
included heart rate sensor on it and I
found that a little bit looser it was a
few beats off but when it was nice and
tight I've got a pretty accurate reading
so the UI navigation is relatively
simple here you go one main button then
you're flanked on the right side by an
up or down button I go ahead and tap
that home button again you're gonna see
a battery indicator with LED lights on
the side this is one of my favorite
features obviously being able to see the
battery life is nice but as you're
working out these lights are going to
illuminate in different colors and you
can different things you should do in
your workout so if you're working too
hard for example and your heart rates
going crazy it'll go red if you need to
do a little bit more it'll go green so
you just want to glance at your watch
really quickly or you're smart better
there quickly it's a really nice added
feature as you go ahead and go through
it go ahead and push up so we're gonna
get access some of your stats where your
heart rates been
that kind of stuff go ahead and go back
here there's also an included smartphone
app which it's been really helpful be
able to customize what you see here I
will also track your history and give
you achievements so go ahead and go down
this is where the miCoach app is going
to live if you're gonna start one of the
predetermines miCoach workouts gives you
all that information right there if you
selected again I can see what your heart
rate is going to be it's relatively
quick to lock on to your heart rate
especially compared to other fitness
bands and as I mentioned you want to
make sure that it's really snug or it's
going to be off just a couple beats so
right now it thinks that I've just
started to workout so it's a workout
time in the percentage that I've
determined for how finished my workout
is if I want to end this go ahead and
long press home button you get two
options here you can either continue it
or stop it in a very familiar play or
stop so we'll go ahead and stop it and
I'll show you the rest of the features
that the band has go back home so stats
free which initially I thought just
meant I had to customize the space but
that means they just want to do a free
workout that's where that is going to
live select that and you get all kinds
of other stats again your heart rate and
other such things that you might want to
know including steps calories and the
rest of the standard features you'd
expect from a standard band my initial
thought here is that this was a little
bit on the wide side but as I use it for
day after day after day after day and
that battery didn't get depleted I
started to see the advantage of a band
this thick if you're in the market for a
band and you're willing to pay $150
price point you're gonna get a really
nice product here from adidas it works
well with the smartphone I can use it as
a watch and you get really a standard
smart band features now I would have
liked more smartphone integration
perhaps notifications for calls coming
in texts and such that you do not have
here but as a slowly fitness band and
also gonna tell you the time does a
really nice job and we guys thank you

what you think about the fit smartband
