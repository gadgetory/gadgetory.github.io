TechnoBuffalo here at a full review for
you of the Palm Pre Plus for Verizon
Wireless you see me put this guy
head-to-head with the iPhone with the
Nexus One now it's time to let it stand
on its own legs and go over sort of the
specs and the features and what I think
about the device as a whole so some of
the general specs I'm probably more
salient ones it's got a 3.1 inch
capacitive touchscreen with of course
multi-touch it's got a 3 megapixel
camera on the back with LED flash as of
right now it does not record video but
palm has said that update is coming soon
it's expected sometime the end of
February early March resolution on the
screen is 320 by 480 and the screen
really does pop it doesn't appear to be
washed out or or dim so the resolution
is actually quite nice so I always start
off my phone reviews with how does it
work as a phone no matter how many
features they can pack in or how fast a
processor how much RAM or hard drive
space if it sucks for making phone calls
it's not gonna be useful to you so this
is a Verizon device and Verizon's
network at least where I am in Southern
California is very strong call quote it
was fantastic on the Palm Pre plus I
heard no white noise or buzzing on my
end and people on the other end of the
phone reported the same they actually
had a hard time telling that I was even
on a cell phone so if you're looking to
get a Palm Pre Plus and quad it was a
concern of yours
you can push those aside it's going to
sound quite nice speaker volume was sort
of on the weak side not as strong as
other devices I've tested if you rely on
the built-in speakerphone for your car
or ever you might be there's a chance
you're gonna be a bit disappointed
something to keep in mind so any review
of the Palm Pre or really any modern
palm device isn't complete or wouldn't
be fair without a brief sort of overview
and synopsis of its operating system web
OS so the Palm Pre again is of course
running palms new operating system and
really started the the biggest
bread-and-butter of it and what
the best is multitasking and I've showed
this in many videos give you guys just a
quick demonstration as how it handles it
it uses things called a deck of card
interface it launches an application so
I got the web browser open right there I
can launch Twitter application and you
can keep you know upwards of 50
applications open I've seen videos
showing that it works and I've tested up
to 30 and the thing actually worked
quite well it's really of uh speed
degradation the painting applications
you have open but it's capable to keep
quite a bit so you can hit that you
gesture area right down below and you
can swipe through open up an application
and if you want to close it swipe it off
screen which I find can be extremely
satisfying a fun feature of web OS so
some of the differences with the Palm
Pre Plus that weren't on the initial pre
that were launched well over a year ago
at CES for Sprint's is the absence of
the home button down below that's been
replaced by a touch-sensitive LED should
see it light up when I swipe my finger
over it so now you just touch it and
that's would be the equivalent a the
home button and that'll launch your deck
of cards feature we sort of saw this
first with the palm pixi and that sort
of carried through to the pre plus you
also have double the RAM and double the
storage space now you've got 16 gigs of
in device storage although still absent
and a bit disappointingly is any sort of
expansion so micro SD or mini SD or any
sort of expansion is gone from the
device other than that it's pretty much
the same Palm Pre you either love or
hate sort of Verizon add-on that they
added it's the ability to have a mobile
hotspot essentially what that is it
treats this as a MiFi device and I've
did a video demonstrating this you can
see it right there mobile hotspot for
$40 a month it'll suck in Verizon is a
video network and kick out Wi-Fi that
you and four friends would connect to at
once
but turn this into a mobile router it
doesn't work pretty well the 40 bucks is
gonna buy you five gigs of up-and-down
data transfer so not bad go ahead and
close that something to to keep in mind
if you really fear a road warrior and
you carry a network card or some sort of
USB device you
actually use the Palm Pre Plus as
everything in certain data plans run you
close to 60 bucks this is going to see a
bit of money down the road if it's
something that you use pretty regularly
so I've been a big fan of webOS I really
liked it when I first saw the pre-launch
however a year later things haven't
changed much and the features that I
wished were gonna come really haven't
gone and absolutely completely is any
sort of autocorrect which is something
that I think the device really needs and
you look at its slide-out keyboard it's
a very small keyboard I've got pretty
decent size fingers and as I try and
type my fingers cover a lot of the
letters so oftentimes I got fat fingers
and I'll type the wrong letter have to
go back and delete it I wish there was
some sort of more robust auto correction
that would have definitely made the Palm
Pre Plus I think a more well-rounded
device the keyboard is a bit improved as
well over the initial pre also gone is
the sort of orange button that used to
be right there it's now open gray and
the keys have a bit more clicky feel to
them similar to what you find on the
palm pixi so while it's a better typing
experience certainly not the best one
that I've used if you're a big proponent
of physical QWERTY keyboards and that's
why you were drawn to the pre plus I
recommend going to try it in a verizon
store or a Sprint store when check out
the original pre keyboard can be a bit
difficult to use I actually prefer an
on-screen keyboard I found that in the
long run I'm a bit more accurate with it
and if my not is accurate
mostly physical are the the virtual
keyboards have Auto Corrections so the
iPhone or Android
so it'll sort of accommodate for the
miss types that you may make although
overall I've been very happy with the
device its multi-touch works extremely
well on the web browsers or pictures
it's got a built-in YouTube player
Facebook to plays video you can download
songs you can put songs on here it does
work very well there was a bit of a cat
and mouse game with palm and Apple and
it's perfectly sort of make this device
sync with iTunes Palmer put in the fix
and Apple will fix it again to prevent
it from happening and insert it would go
back and forth can't really do that
anymore it seems that palm is a band
that sort of cat-and-mouse game so this
won't sync with iTunes directly although
you do get drag-and-drop capability so
you plug it into your PC or Mac you just
drag files right to it it doesn't work
pretty well now one thing I wish the
device had was more applications in its
app catalog it's got a lot of potential
I think the device in the platform it
could handle 3d games
I can handle sort of your standard
applications but there aren't that many
in there which is a bit disappointing so
I'd like to see that improved either you
know via software updates or really just
by the developer attention now this is
released on two different carriers
Verizon and Sprint we're going to
probably get a bit more of a developer
interest in the platform if I have to
rank this on a one to five scale I give
it a very solid four and a quarter
missing out because lack of video
recording at least right now although
that it's coming and the lack of any
sort of auto correction on the keyboard
things I do like I do like the webOS as
a whole I really like the notification
system so you saw a little mailbox or a
little envelope pop right there
notice with the way it handles
notifications is really top-notch I can
tap that I can go right to my email I
take out a message from Brandon I can
either tap that and go right to it
or hit the Gmail lo going to write to my
gmail or I can just swipe them away
multitasking is probably the best
implementation that I've seen really
just works fantastically and is a very
well-rounded and pretty nimble device so
if you're looking for something on
Verizon that's full feature gives you
multi-touch has a QWERTY keyboard if
that's something that you really insist
on that's sort of very cool look you owe
it yourself to check out the pre plus
overall it's a very solid device an
early thin and nice form factor anyway
