was all about software OS 10 is now Mac
OS the new iteration is going to be
Ciera and of course it took the wraps
off watch OS 3.0 there's a ton of hidden
features in Sierra that Apple just
didn't talk about and a lot of new
things and watch oster it didn't have
time to touch on either so to you we've
got seven things and maybe you didn't
know about mac OS sierra and watch our
westering Apple announced serious coming
to mac OS but they didn't talk about was
everything is going to be able to do
Siri can control system settings like
screen brighton is toggling on or off
Wi-Fi adjust system volume and even put
your mac to sleep and also start the
screensaver so you also know some system
specs to like processor speed how much
memory your computer has a computer
serial number how much free space it can
be left on your hard drive all you gotta
do is ask Mac West sea air is going to
give Apple pay the ability to know if
you have your Apple watch or iPhone
nearby allow you to buy stuff from the
web right within safari Safari can be
destructive to show or hide Apple pay
buttons based on the proximity of an
Apple pay enable device to keep your
watch or phone on you but you probably
watch on you don't leave your phone
behind Mac OS Sierra is bringing picture
to picture to the Mac lineup which we
knew about well it might seem like you
can only drag the picture to one of four
corners on the screen actually holding
the control key allow you to drop the
picture anywhere you want after wdc
everyone knew that my message was going
to get tremendous updates all the Mac
may not be able to create many of those
special effects that we saw can view
most of them the most useful at least to
me is the rich URL previews essentially
what this means someone text you a link
I message is gonna pull up a mini
preview it with a site name and often a
picture in a preview box it's a way bed
in a thousand character text link and
also you know friend to send you
something that you don't want to look at
it work you know you do it and the last
hidden feature in mac OS Sierra Siri can
be mapped to a keystroke commands or
even disabled entirely if you don't want
her around and the preference panel of
Sierra users can disable Siri completely
change her voice even disable voice
feedback and figure which microphone to
use even set a custom keyboard shortcut
for activating her there's obviously way
more that goes into mac OS here and as
each beta comes out we'll update this
lesson seems anything new that we think
you guys should know about if you've
installed a beta let us know how your
experience is going and maybe you could
help sway people one way or another
watch OS 3s and dowling the Apple watch
with some really much needed features an
apple was pounding their chests about
these at WWDC but there's a lot more
that they didn't announce
here's some hidden features we found and
watch os3 Apple added a face gallery
option in the Apple watch app for iOS
makes it way easier to switch faces tell
different customization options or even
edit complications similar let's say to
what we see on the Android wear app on
Android and Apple finally enabled find
my iphone to locate a missing Apple
watch rather than accidentally taking
screenshots on the Apple watch daily you
can easily disable screenshots from the
iOS companion app which at least for me
is a big deal because my son's always
playing with my watch and I end up with
half my camera roll is just random
screenshots of watch faces apple also
add a new complications for the modular
watch face which is my personal favorite
as well as a new extra large watch face
when you leave the house that your
glasses on or you just want to get one
for your mom or dad so what you guys
think about mac OS here and watch our
West 3 have you installed it what's your
opinion been any other features that
Apple didn't announce be the comments
down below and let us know and maybe you
can help sway people want to way or
another to download these betas till

TechnoBuffalo so you guys the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
