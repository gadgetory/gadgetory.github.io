Lakers comm here and I want to give you
a review of the t-mobile Sidekick I've
had it for just about a week now and
want to share my thoughts and feelings
on it with you but before I do let me
show you a hardware overview of the
device all right guys before it gets to
review of device I want to give you a
tour the hardware since it does have
some very unique features about it so at
the front you've got a three line menu
button push that menu pops up you can
navigate with the scroll ball you've got
a speaker grill right here it's
surrounded by a four-way d-pad which is
another way for navigation which is very
nice and then you've got a jump menu
this is five or ten little circles right
there would take you back to the main
screen where we are right now anywhere
you are on the phone you've got a X
button which will close at our program
you're in and a back arrow which little
back you're right back up and you've got
a green send key and a red end key
surrounded by the very familiar
trackball which is found on BlackBerry's
and sidekicks for generations now going
back to the sidekick - on these top of
the device you've got two shoulder
buttons used for games and serving
various functions throughout the
different programs we've got a mini USB
port and a nice addition of a 3.5
millimeter headset jack take advantage
of the immediate two-player capabilities
of the phone on the bottom of the device
you've got a plus or minus for volume
and a power key and wouldn't be a
sidekick unless it had the cool swivel
so all you do is push down on the upper
right hand corner screen swivels right
out which is very nice it's gotta make
sure you pull your finger away my logic
sock and there it goes and opens up now
every sidekick has had to swivel device
but the one exception of Motorola
sidekick slide which was very
short-lived in t-mobile's lineup so if I
just want to give you a real quick
hardware or review and let's go talk
about the phone alright so now that
you've seen what the device looks like
let me go ahead and talk about it
first I had a sidekick - way back in the
day probably about five six years ago so
I was relatively from
with the sidekick line but I haven't had
one since really had a chance to play
with one since my initial impressions of
a sidekick we're always it's fun it's
great for Iams maybe a little bit too
kid-friendly for me but really have to
say after a week of using the device I
am incredibly impressed with it the OS
is a little cartoony and it is a little
kid ish I supposed but what the phone is
capable of far exceeds most smartphones
well it does max out at edge speeds the
browser is quick the browser renders
full HTML web pages email is very quick
and seamless and fast contact management
is nice and easy SMS is nice and easy
MMS is easy really everything on devices
right at your fingertips really is a
piece of cake I'm still increasingly
impressed with the DES phone the more I
used it the more I got to like it the
phone like I said before maxes out at
edge speeds
now obviously t-mobile coverage is gonna
vary upon your location but where I am I
a full t-mobile coverage and call
quality was fantastic users on the other
end reported a slight white noise in the
background but nothing that impeded them
from hearing me at all and I could hear
them no problem also the speakerphone on
the device is quite loud so if you use
speaker quite often will not have any
trouble at all with the phone I found
myself really enjoying that flip up
mechanism of the device like sitting
there playing with it while I was home
at work or playing with it really just
during the day and flipping it up and
playing with it and flipping it back
down really makes the device unique in
my opinion the full QWERTY keyboard on
is actually probably one of the best
QWERTY keyboards I've used and that's
Stan I've used the BlackBerry Bold I've
use the curved Samsung epics I got
kicking around here I've used a lot of
phones with full QWERTY keyboards and
the sidekick has its reputation for a
reason and the reputation is just
fantastic easy to type keyboard
they're made of raised plastic and since
the keyboard is in the landscape there's
much more room to space it apart and
it's a full 5 rows - with a separate row
for numbers so let's go ahead and move
on to navigation navigation is done with
this simple roll ball and it really
becomes a - it is very quick
you can push the ball in to select
there's a back button right below it you
really get a chance to you feel like
you've used the device actually for a
while I only using it for a few minutes
one thing that the younger crowd might
like are these customizable shells so
you can pop this right off put on
whatever color you'd like here they came
with a blue one to the SIM card on the
back this shoulder part pops off as well
on whatever color you want you can
actually order your own custom shells
from t-mobile dot-com and a few weeks
later they'll show up right in your
inbox so guys I really am still so
impressed with the phone you have the
ability to sync your contacts and your
calendar wirelessly with t-mobile's
online service the organizer is really
full feature you can set reminders set
dates and sync it wirelessly really a
lot of features that other phones don't
have if this thing had true push email
it may really be a competitor for some
of the big smartphones out there I think
the toughest thing that it has is its
reputation of being more a kid-friendly
messenger device and that's not really
so much of an issue I mean well it does
appeal to a younger audience really has
features that the business crowd might
like size-wise it's really nice and thin
fits very nice and easily into my pocket
then give you a real quick size
comparison of the device I'm gonna move
this down here so here is a mobile
sidekick we'll bring in the iPhone here
you can see it's a little bit longer but
definitely narrower down on top of each
other so other devices you might be
looking at talked about the BlackBerry
Bold little earlier get them bring that
in another it's bringing the sidekick
and compared with the BlackBerry Bold
notice it's much much much much thinner
much narrower and here is the
just-released blackberry storm it's
actually a little bit thicker than the
storm definitely narrower there's
another side view of it for you
camera back up here device is really
pocketable and you hardly ever even
noticed it speaker volume is loud the
vibration alert on is loud really
everything on the phone exceeded my
expectations increasingly impressed with
it like I said probably a million times
already
so guys t-mobile Sidekick out of my five
star reviews I really give it a solid
four and a half I don't give many phones
four or five but I'm very impressed with
it if you're in the market for a
full-featured QWERTY phone and you're on
t-mobile you owe it to yourself to go
check it out we're taking about
switching carriers for another phone
before you do go to t-mobile and
definitely check it out highly
recommended all right guys I'm John
