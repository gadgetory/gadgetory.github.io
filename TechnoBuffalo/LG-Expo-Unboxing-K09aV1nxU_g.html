here with an unboxing for you of the LG
expo for AT&amp;amp;T Wireless this phone is
making a lot of noise for two reasons
the first it's one of the few carrier
release smartphones to feature the
Snapdragon 1 gigahertz processor which
is crazy fast by comparison the iphone
3gs for example has a 600 gigahertz
processor so this is market ibly quicker
I'll see how that translates to actual
real-world speed improvements or
multitasking abilities the second is
that this is phone also supports a pico
projector which is a small projector
that catches to the back to lets you
well obviously project whatever you'd
like I don't have the projector with
this phone but we'll take a look about
how it handles with the processor it's
running Windows Phone or windows mobile
6.5 as you might know it and it's going
to run you won 99 99 after rebates and a
two-year contract so enough of me
talking let's go ahead and dig in we use
the obligatory little knife to this cut
into the FedEx box there's the phone
please i don't think the projectors in
here there is the phone itself this was
just released we've got some 18 to
information you got a picture of the
phone on the front and your typical AT&amp;amp;T
box letting you know that it's got Wi-Fi
is indeed a touch screen has gps which
is I believe assisted GPS so it will use
cell towers and its GPS chip and it has
a 5 megapixel camera and of course it's
the touch screen version of windows
mobile 6 405 previously known as
professional Wi-Fi touch screen all
stuff we just ran through take a look at
some of the rest of the specs here it's
of course a 3g phone talk time to 5.3
hours standby time 15 days the wifis B&amp;amp;G
bluetooth 2.1 it's a 480 x 800
resolution touch screen weighs five
point two ounces scott a micro SD card
goes up to 16 gigs and the rest of the
windows mobile sort of slew of things
looks like this box took some beating in
transit over the phone is still okay I
have not used a phone that's taking
advantage of the Snapdragon processor so
I'm really curious to how it works the
same chip that powers the hd2 and I
believe a Acer phone as well so go ahead
and take out the packaging some
information a quick start guide here is
the phone itself which is actually a lot
smaller and thinner than I expect it to
be push that off to the side let's check
out what else comes in the box your
standard slew of accessories got your
charging head or die soon connects to
some form of USB cable which is right
here and let's see what sort of standard
this is if it's a proprietary or if it's
appears to be micro USB we've got a pair
of stereo headphones with mic and looks
like a volume control on it that's quite
nice we've got a stylist so this does
not have a stylist embed in the device
you have to actually attach this little
thing to it the site most pops out super
annoying hopefully you're not going to
need to use a stylus all that much there
it is you know just pops back in its
retractable it's using a stylus because
this is a resistive screen it is not a
capacitive and your battery of size feel
big the matter is here I'll let you get
that man a 12-time it's probably at
least 1200 milliamp hours I would assume
let's take a look here if it tells us
fifteen hundred million power battery so
this is a quite a big battery it's
actually light as well let's take a
quick look at the phone here is the
touch screen looks like that's some sort
of optical go down to the camera focus
some sort of optical trackpad we've got
your end button or your call button your
end button and a back button I don't
know if there are some sort of virtual
buttons that'll show up there on the
left side advice you've got a volume
rocker up and down on the right let's
give got your camera button
you've got a probably a lock or a smart
key and your microSD which is nice to
have it right on the side so I mean it's
hot swappable you don't take off the
battery to access it 5 megapixel camera
with LED flash and the battery release
store does look to be a quite a nice
bottle running through the full paces
and see how it works and also it's a
little bit on the chubby side because
it's got a full evidently four row
qwerty keyboard when first blush does
look to be pretty nice keys it looks
similar to what we saw on the touch pro
2 they're rectangular keys the little
bit of raising mechanism there they do
feel very nice a little bit of a squishy
feel but not bad i think this is a
keyboard you could definitely get used
to and you've got your sort of weird
arrow navigation keys and some shortcut
keys embedded there for use with the
function button go ahead and slide that
back and if you had the projector the
battery actually comes off or the
battery door comes off projector sits
right on the back hope you'll get a
chance to show you what that looks like
at some point stay tuned to the channel
for a full review of how this handles
and how the Snapdragon processor
compared to other devices if you're
looking for a size comparison if you're
considering the LG expo I'll show you
how it compared to some of the more
popular phones out there today here is
the iphone 3gs here is the just-released
HP ipaq glisten also for AT&amp;amp;T it's a
touch screen windows mobile 6.5 phone as
well different form factor for the
qwerty board when you get a thick miss
comparison if you're interested in any
other of these phones here is the xperia
x1 by a sony ericsson which is
noticeably thicker and lastly here is
the original blackberry storm for size
comparison can sort of stack all these
up together that one right there is the
expo in case you're keeping track at
home sort to see how they all stack up
in a big cell phone sandwich there the
expo does look to be a pretty nice size
and can
stack up with the rest of them anyway
guys hope you enjoyed and I will see you
in the next video bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
