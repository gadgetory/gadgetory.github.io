don't know what IFA is think of it like
CES but for Europe usually where we see
big product announcements and we did see
some cool some crazy and some bizarre
products get announced this year let me
show you something to highlight some of
the coolest weirdest things that we saw
at IFA let's start with the abomination
that I want more than any tech product
right now just because this is the
gargantuan acer predator 21 x i think at
this point you can't call us sing a
laptop it's more of like a like a
desktop you can lug around with you so
first as a ridiculous 21-inch screen if
that's not ridiculous enough it's a
curved 21 inch green then how about you
throw in dual geforce gtx 1080 graphic
chips for for good measure and then
maybe just add in the toss of I cracking
technology which during a demo you
actually used to play games like move
your eyes and shoot the enemy 64 gigs of
ram in this thing and if that's not
insane enough they also have a
mechanical keyboard with cherry MX
switches into this thing it is the most
ridiculous thing I've ever seen and
again I don't know why but I I feel like
I need one but I don't know when I can
get one because release our pricing it
hasn't really been announced but damn
look at that thing it you're gonna need
to have like a workout regimen to carry
this thing around but imagine it looks
you're gonna get in starbucks when you
work on your screenplay what tradeshow
be complete without some phones and Sony
was there with a couple tiny computers
the phone looks really nice it's kind of
a dark navy blue huge phone and I like
the design language that Sony has but
maybe it's time to try some new nothing
from the spec department here is gonna
blow you away Snapdragon 820 and kind of
the rest of the stuff you'd expect from
a mid to high range phone but what is
awesome with Sony phones is that 20 30
pixel camera in megapixel it aside Sony
makes some of the best sensors going and
factor so good most manufacturers are
using their sensors anyway so if you
want a killer camera look for the X Z
but I doubt those here to come to us
anyway so looked about what unlocked if
you like your phone smaller with a
compact in their name then perhaps
xperia x compact might be for you we
used to love sony when they would
squeeze all these high inspect
smaller phones but that's not the case
here and say you're getting kind of
middle-of-the-road stamp dragon chip and
a bunch of the same specs the guard gate
at Austin 22 megapixel camera that we
just talked about in the xperia x z it
did feel nice to hold a bit like d
unapologetically plastic phones it may
have come from other companies i'm not
gonna mention any names but again a nice
mid-range phone the chances are we won't
see here in the US but what if you're in
the category like me or like your
phone's big and your tablet's small
perhaps the brand new hallway mediapad
m3 might be one to consider 8.4 inch all
metal design it's got hallways take on
android on it love it or hate it but
Google play's there so throw launcher on
other than that it's the tablet that
we've all seen before a few nice
additions though the home screen you can
serve swipe over and get access to
multitasking it's a nice little trick
that they've included if you're a fan of
good speakers on your tablet they
partner with harman kardon i'm here and
they sounded loud to us even in a
crowded conference hall butt off to get
him home in the lab test it out and see
how the sound the screen looks really
nice to the naked eye which is a weird
expression to say i'm gonna put a shirt
on my eyes no one no one's Dylan's got
to see that this Blake does look to be
pretty solid I did like how light felt
though it seems like it's perfect just
for watching a movie catch to the book
on a trainer plane ride plus starting on
a 3-2 50 euros that doesn't hurt either
how I didn't save will see in the US but
if we do i'll let you know maybe we'll
just come and visit maybe get a work
visa there were also some smart watches
that got announced you're probably
thinking i'm gonna mention huawei LG
samsung the usual players but no how
about weddings the folks that made that
regular watch that actually had some
SmartWatch functionality into it they
are back with the winning steal HR which
not surprisingly is made out of steel
and it's got a built-in heart rate
monitor as you'd expect again that HR
name and it looks like a classic watch a
lot of people are looking for they might
not want to screen on their wrist I've
been using some are watch for a while it
son felt a little bit small to me but it
felt really solid and well built and the
feature set is what you want so if you
need that heart rate monitor and you
want a classic watch look without a
giant screen it's pretty good option
there's obviously a ton more my FA we
cover it ton more for my affair but
these are some of the things that
thought when the most interesting
discussion pieces not all obviously
we're great not all knock things out of
the park but some were interesting so
what you guys think about IFA 2016
give us a like for gigantic curved
laptops I feel like they they deserve it
