chance to see my office a complete
disarray desk not constructed boxed all
over the place well have been cleaned up

percent done yet but I want to show you
guys what my new office looks like and
my new studio this is where I'm going to
be filming all of my videos from now on

getting in me when I'm filming is right
from here but I'll walk you guys around
just a minute we've got the 24-inch imac
with harman kardon soundsticks and there
is the main speaker down below all my
wires subwoofer rather there's the imac
the wireless keyboard Mighty Mouse
there's my phone very clean very simple
that's kind of why I liked it there are
some of the drawers on the desk as you
can see right there my nice chair that I
found to be very comfortable bookshelf
over here with my Wi-Fi printer and
digital picture frame some books that I
have some textbooks some files and
folders and that my macbook is there and
its sleeve right there and some other
books down below still have it unpacked
the PlayStation yet and kind of my some
other bags here still have a little bit
of a packing left to go and there's a
tripod storage closet but I just wanted
to give you guys just kind of a real
quick tour of what things look like
