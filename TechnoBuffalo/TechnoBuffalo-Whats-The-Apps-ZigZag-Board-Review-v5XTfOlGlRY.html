here from technobuffalo and welcome to
what's the apps the simple little app
review show here in TechnoBuffalo and
now rev 3 today we're going to be taking
a look at a productivity application
called zigzag boards since its release
and even today the ipad is considered to
be more of a for fun device versus a
no-nonsense business tool as far as
daming goes the ipad has somehow found
itself sandwiched between the pc flash
gaming experience with more traditional
portable gaming devices like the sony
PSP besides all the fantastic and
interactive gaming possibilities of the
ipad it's also a very capable and very
powerful personal productivity device
while browsing through the productivity
category in the App Store's library I
found a free whiteboard application that
caught my eye zigzag boards zigzag
boards or zigzag for short as I like to
say is a very simple and very handy
whiteboard application that transforms
your ideas and creations into versatile
vector points not to mention it takes
full advantage of the iPads magnificent
screen real estate and the superbly
smooth touch experience that the ipad
has to offer unlike more traditional
whiteboard applications or even drawing
applications you'll be able to select
specific strokes or even the graphics as
a whole and scale them as large or as
small as you want to without sacrificing
any quality just like what you can do on
more advanced computer graphic programs
like adobe flash or illustrator zig zag
boards has two main tools one to draw
and want to select that's it one tab
uses the tool and two finger taps
changes them up that's really all there
is to it the simplicity of it all means
that the user focuses less on fidgeting
around with menus tools options and
witches and whatnot and just you know
uses the main feature of zigzag of
course would be it's a live
collaborative feature it allows multiple
users on either iPads or computers to
collaborate edit and share ideas and
opinions this all happens wirelessly as
zigzag boards handles all of this
creative awesomeness over the internets
and if no one's available to collab with
you you can always just send off your
ideas via email with a couple simple
taps after using it for a while I
noticed that zigzag
words uncomplicated and simplistic
nature is sort of like a double-edged
sword the fact that it only uses two
tools makes it kind of limited you can't
paste or embed existing images or
screenshots like most drawing apps you
can't draw shapes and you can't add text
most of the missing functions I just
mentioned aren't absolutely necessary as
you can just draw them in yourself but
it would definitely help your
collaborative ideas look a little less
chicken scratchy even though zigzag
boards is missing some basic and
practical features like text input and
shape tools the ease of use and the
smoothness of it all more than makes up
for it which is why I personally give
zigzag board a 4 out of 5 and the fact
that is free makes it that much more
awesome well I hope you guys enjoyed my
review of zigzag boards for the iPad
this one John Q from TechnoBuffalo take
care and I'll see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
