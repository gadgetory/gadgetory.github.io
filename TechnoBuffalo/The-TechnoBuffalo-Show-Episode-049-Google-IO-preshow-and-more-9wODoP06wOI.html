TechnoBuffalo show I'm live your to host
for today Sean ani editor-in-chief of
the site i'm joined by deputy managing
editor Todd Hazelden hey everybody are
you doing today Todd I'm good I was just
realizing i haven't had any coffee yet
prodomme I I don't know how someone
would live through that yeah there you
go it's noon my time this is actually my
first cup of the day so yeah hey well on
podcast days I know I'm going to want
one during the show so I'm just like
I'll just just wait it yeah just wait
and get it when the show starts and
slowly become a human as the episode
progresses yeah but so last week you
were off driving cars and visiting the
irvine office how was your trip it was
awesome i was out in California test
driving the new xc90 from Volvo they
actually had two models for us to drive
we had the t a twin engine which is it
can also run in electric mode but it
only has about 17 miles range in that
mode and then the t6 which is gasoline
it was a lot of fun we drove a lot and
then I was down in irvine in the office
with all the guys and then I flew home
and got home late on Saturday so it was
a good time late on Friday late Friday
yeah yeah yep so welcome back Joey was
in your seat last week and we talked
about gaming and real quick i just i
want this wasn't on the headline and we
haven't discussed a pre-show but I sent
you that link i I've got to mention this
because this has been one of my biggest
complaints about virtual reality so
studies been done that yes virtual
reality can be very off-putting because
you don't understand where your spatial
relationships are somebody came up with
the unbelievably brilliant idea of
putting a virtual nose in front of your
eyes and I was like that's simple but
brilliant yeah and I think it would
solve a lot of my personal problems with
virtual reality yeah reduces simulator
sickness they say I'm interesting
I'm all for it let's let's go for it
folks let's let's give me a virtual
knows now it would be cool those if you
get to choose your virtual nodes as you
can see your nose job yes exactly so
maybe you can have a smaller nose yeah a
little bit more petite yeah well the big
topic of course is the big topic for
this week of course is we are now 23
hours away from or no I'm sorry 25 hours
away from time zones uh we're some time
away from google i/o tomorrow google i/o
that teaches me to try to be fancy so
yes Google i/o is tomorrow unlike Apple
events do you feel like we know nothing
of what's going to happen tomorrow yeah
it's kind of strange I mean there's been
rumors right like we not even rumors
they had Android M on the original
schedule that went out and they I guess
they removed it the Photos app
apparently is getting revamped which is
awesome so we have some things like that
you know we can probably expect Android
wear conversation especially around the
Apple watch we're ready for some new
devices but yeah it's it's almost like
these days when Apple takes the stage
you're like okay I mean thanks to a lot
of the reporting on 9to5 mac it seems to
reveal a lot of what Apple's going to do
you know it's like okay here's what
Apple is going to have in store for us
then we just sort of weight and maybe
there's a surprise here and there we're
like a surprise on how things work you
know like force touch on the Apple
watching like that but with google
tomorrow it's sort of like what the heck
is going to happen and it reminds me a
bit of Microsoft build you know just
what was that like two weeks ago or so I
don't know time's flying these days
where we were expecting sort of a lot of
stuff maybe even windows phone hardware
and then it was just sort of a lot but
but not consumer-focused very developer
focus which you know it's a developer
conference so that's fair yeah yeah no I
just it's interesting I mean I I'm going
into tomorrow you and I were discussing
this yesterday and I just I don't yeah
I'm sure we'll hear about Android M and
all that
but just in general it just feels like
we don't know whole I for once I feel
like we're going into an event that we
will legitimately be surprised by a lot
of what is discussed yeah which is
exciting and you know some Google i/o is
I think it was 2013 when or was it 2012
and the sky divers came in from the
ceiling here from above showing what
Google glass could do and then they
handed it off to like BMXers that would
have been 2012 was it yeah yeah so
Google i/o can be very exciting yeah no
I mean glasses the thing I always went
back to I mean nobody knew what was
coming exactly you know we had heard a
little bit of rumors and all that but
you know when they skydive did you were
like okay wow yeah that's guy too cool
and Matt glass is nowhere to be seen but
and I wonder if they're gonna mention it
tomorrow sort of maybe even in passing
if it's the way that we've seen hololens
from Microsoft for example so i dont
know ill omens hololens ipod apologies
to everyone i told everyone not to call
me during the show and apparently they
did not listen anyway I don't know
especially i agree with hololens now out
there it's a bit more does google go
back to class and try you know because
there's definitely competition on the
horizon now and collins to me feels very
much more refined it guys especially cuz
it's like powered by you know like a
full version of Windows 10 yeah whereas
glass is sort of like not yeah but I
mean look glass is now under Tony Fadell
from nest um father the ipod i I'm not
sure you know like if they're gonna just
show a little bit of it tomorrow or just
not go anywhere near because it needs
you know a couple more years work that's
what I don't know but I feel like under
him it should be something very cool I
don't know and speaking of nest we
should also hear possibly about the
version of Android for the
internet of things he's apparently
called brillo code name brillo yeah I
highly interesting that's there's no way
they can be the final name because never
smart yeah right although then you know
kit kat they had that Nestle partnership
happy Chad uh but you know that'll be
really cool because apparently it's a
version of Android that runs on either
32 or 64 megabytes of RAM not gigabytes
so obviously not gigabytes but very
little ram so you know things like maybe
a coffee maker and another gadgets that
you're gonna have talked to the house
now that there's an idea I could get
behind me ohh wake up in the morning hit
a button on my android phone and start
my coffee pot if we had a lot right like
Android wear ok Google started making
coffee I mean it seems totally plausible
and if it's Android than it you know
just communicate a lot better with all
the devices that already exist well we
have a question from such and be Hall
and this is a question we get a lot what
would we like to see an Android um I
really don't have any big I can't wait
for them to do that things that with it
at this point yeah I know right like I I
feel like the big thing for me was
design changes and that happened last
year with lollipop in material design so
i don't know what i want to see with
android am I mean maybe it's more of
like that sort of Microsoft continuum
and Apple what do they call it son
continuum but so hurt the continuity
where you know more of this computer /
phone handoff so for Apple lets you know
you pick up Safari on your computer or
things like that which is very simple
but also with Microsoft continuity on or
continuum rather in Windows 10 and
windows windows 10 mobile as they're
calling it now where you get a full
fledged version just by plug up this app
by plugging your phone into a monitor I
like to see cool stuff like that sort of
come but I don't know if we will it
hasn't been any real indication yeah I
think I mean at the base of Android you
know it's got everything you need ooh yo
so I'm not I think at this point there
getting more to just the tweaking stage
than adding big new features right and
like notifications are great which is
still like one of my huge complaints on
iOS so there's a lot of things i think
android does really well that doesn't
don't necessarily need polish i guess
isn't you know but maybe security
features i mean all that all these
things about you know reading your face
is smart unlock and stuff like that
which we've seen before from sam signed
it never really worked very well maybe
it's maybe we'll see that too I that's
one of those features I'm just like oh
great at something all use for two
minutes and never use again right
exactly oh but speaking of that I mean
also Google Wallet needs a revamp and
there's been talk that maybe that will
come through or in or it will have its
own payment based system besides google
all but like that I uses a fingerprint
for touch to like built into it instead
of having sort of like you know like
Samsung's touch ID or not touch ID
whatever they call their reader and
everybody else having different systems
all built into the same Android and you
know payments with Google Wallet could
work the same way I mean right now it's
Samsung with lupe that they bought by
for samsung pay so we'll see if there's
any sort of native android support a
funny answer to this question from such
and Bohol how often do you guys use
google now the other day I caught my
mother using google now what's she like
constantly uses it now that I've noticed
it I'm like who are you I rarely easy oh
she uses it all the time and I'm
wondering because like you I don't
hardly ever use it ooh so I'm wondering
if maybe this is an age thing yeah I'm
not going to give out my mother's age
she would shoot me you know up there and
but she now uses voice search for
everything who chooses google now
constantly and it's been really
intriguing to me to watch her as an
older person that you would think would
be afraid of things like that she loves
it yeah it's interesting she has all the
features you know built-in we're like
your email and gives you your flight
data and all that kind of stuff in there
yeah just like and I use it more when I
travel I should say that yeah same here
same here but like when I'm at home no I
just you know I type out searches or
whatever ooh and so it's intriguing to
me i'm wondering if maybe that truly is
the bridge for the older generations
that a lot of work is being taken out of
the process for them right sure so I
don't know interesting yeah but uh no
tomorrow's gonna be an interesting day
will John will be up at the event in
person the rest of us will be covering
it remotely so make sure you tune into
technobuffalo calm for all of your
google i/o coverage and we will be
covering every aspect of it and it will
make for a long day but always an
interesting one always such and she is
using it on the note 3 nice uh let's see
here to do a another interesting
question that kind of relates to the
Google another thing from such a ball
which you use more Android or iOS and
which android devices are you currently
using i would say i use iOS more simply
because i like I use my iPad a ton okay
and so I think that's a lot of is that I
you know I just the iPad as my go to the
device for so many things as for my
current personal Android devices the
nexus 9 and a 1 plus 1 i've been using
the gt4 just picked up our international
one from the office which is pretty nice
nice i like it you know i did our hands
on initially camera seems pretty good
and then i'm mainly using the iphone 6
plus and i'd say between the two I mean
I don't even know which one I use more I
use them both really frequently it's
sort of like which ones in my pocket
like which one which one is my phone or
my hand grab first for imessage I guess
you know I get a lot of my friends are
on that so I end up reaching to the
iphone but it's not because it does one
thing better than android it's just
because i'm getting do I message yeah
and then recently actually I gave my
wife we were both coming back from
California she's out there too I gave
her the ipad mini take home and I use
the nexus 9 and I really like that
because it's like a larger screen and
all that so sometimes we kind of go back
and forth she doesn't use she's an
Android user herself so she uses the
additional user on the Nexus 9 which is
always a nice feature but she ended up
with my ipad and i was using the nexus
so um an interesting question from null
gaming we do have a post coming up on
this and it it boggles my mind from know
gaming what do you think about the that
quote effective power unquote text that
reboots iPhones I've got a few but I use
a nexus 6 of course is who SAT around
and figured this out I know it's insane
you know somehow it's out and i feel
like we covered it in a post and i wrote
like you know it's probably a hilarious
prank like if you're in middle school or
high school or something like that to
your friends on I message but it could
be pretty dangerous for someone who
needs to use their phone and is in like
an emergency like say you send it to
your mom and you're like ah she's not
gonna have to figure it out until I
didn't show her out and then like her
car breaks down she can't text anybody I
don't know I mean of course you can
place a phone call but I don't know it
seems like a bug that needs to be fixed
sooner than later although it could be
kind of funny yeah bye dad I i 100%
agree with you you know I I hope that I
don't get one but you just you have to
wonder about the person say around went
ok so now if I do three of this symbol
yeah and then this oh oh wait no it
actually okay that didn't work alright
let's try for of this symbol hey I know
it's it's too stringent I don't know
yeah I'm sure there's something somebody
dug in the code or something and found
something I don't know but I it's just
like a video game sometimes when people
find things I'm like how how did you sit
around and think yeah but how long did
that take you and I guess just so we can
explain quickly to people who don our
there's a bug apparently an iMessage
where if you send a specific string to
somebody it crashes there I message or
their phone depending on like where you
are if it's in conversation view I guess
you can't open messages and if it's in
the message you can just sort of get out
of it but I guess it's a quick crash and
I will just simply tell you we're not
going to tell you the code so you can't
send it to people it's not for the fact
that I have no idea what half those
symbols are right it's Arabic in some
part of it I don't know if the whole
thing is i I don't I don't know man is
so get some of this is power that's
weird yeah so we won't be telling you
the code because we're scrupulous that
way it has nothing to do with the fact
that we don't understand it yeah but uh
yeah that's a very odd odd situation
that I don't fully grasp but ah yeah
moving on down here from such an Mahal
what is each of your favorite conference
trade show to attend or watch each year
and why I know yours is going to be now
what comic com yeah well it doesn't
really qualify treat you yep yeah kind
of yeah no I love going to comic-con I
was going to say I really only attend
one a year but yeah now at now attend
comic-con did you know for me I I don't
tend to go out to that many I mean Todd
you go to all of them well except well
I'm not do like Google i/o and WWDC I do
you like the yeah I do see yes Aoife
more Congress yeah yeah at least you get
to go to fun places even though you
don't get to see them yeah yeah although
we were able to work at this year that
you got to have a little time in spain
right well I was yeah I had the I had
the weekend that's right yeah which was
nice i was thrilled that's you know a
lot of people you oh you guys get to go
to all these exciting places we don't
ever see them yes
you know it's like especially in for
even Germany you're at the hotel taxi to
the conference center at the hotel to
actually come for Senator 50 yeah but
and at CES I mean yeah we we usually go
out as a team for one good meal but
otherwise it's like uh guess we'll go to
the buffet yeah exactly it looks like
food my favorite would have to be
probably Mobile World Congress so for
that reason Spain's beautiful i love
Berlin I'm not a fan of Las Vegas and
the food is amazing so I guess how can
you not be a fan of Las Vegas Todd just
not but don't worry neither am i but uh
Vegas is I I've never been to Vegas for
anything other than work and that's the
only way I can ever imagine myself going
to pickets yeah me too now I've had
friends say like oh we should go to
Vegas for this and that no like no I
didn't know eight times now now I I have
other places I mean I Love New York I
wouldn't mind you know just hanging out
in New York City but yeah vegas i can't
ever see myself yo just hanging out not
going to happen as for watching though I
mean say what you will and I'm sure
somebody will scream fanboy at me I love
watching Apple events mainly because
they're they're so well-planned and
there's also none of their yes there
there's the occasional superfluous you
know okay find this person's been up
there doing a demo long enough but
there's no none of this awkward scripted
conversations you know have a chorus
come upon yeah there's no singing
there's no dancing there's no awkward
scripted conversations you know I I'm
looking at you samsung I'm sorry I'm
just what I'm saying watching a samsung
presentations my own idea of a personal
hell you know you would think they would
go online after an event and go okay
what were the comments like wow people
really hate this we should
do this again yeah except let's do it
again and then three months later they
do again yeah yeah Oh with you though I
like apples and I like I like Google i/o
and I like some of Microsoft's thinking
what they're talking about like build I
thought was really well done it was just
you know life is like yeah exact and
long very long yeah but uh no Samsung
events are just painful to watch their
best oh good grief i would give anything
not to cover samsung events believe me
we still will this is just my personal
dream world yeah that's where Samsung no
longer holds those events but uh from
dis Langston I'm going to assume I know
what this question means Dennis have you
heard anything new about Google Fiber um
I think they're just contained to work
on the rollouts in the city's they'd
already announced yeah I think so too
unless we're talking about project Phi
in which which is the wireless service
that google is rolling out with its
using sprint t-mobile right now I think
he's talking about the the gigabit per
second chance or anything you either
just in it slowly roll no I think
they're just contained to work on now
I've heard a really interesting rumor
and this is what I'd always I wrote an
article on technobuffalo yun's ago about
this that google was not getting into
Google Fiber to become a gigantic is be
they were trying to light a fire under
the behinds of other companies yeah and
it's worked it is work I think extremely
well there is a significant rumor that I
might only cable company here I mean you
all know i live in kirksville so the
only cable company here is a company
called cable one which is a small
company mm-hmm there's rumors that
they're working on one gigabit per
second that's awesome and sure enough
out on the road I've seen a lot more
cable trucks than I normally see and
I've seen big spools of cable coming in
and the rumor is that 2016 they're going
to launch one gigabit per second and we
were one of the tent we fought really
really hard to be the
official google fiber town i mean i went
to town meetings and everything we were
really trying and you know with multiple
colleges here with a major hospital here
ain't you think real farming community
but we're actually fairly
technologically advanced here so I if
Google Fiber if this is a result of
Google Fiber going out and getting it
stuff done awesome this is what I always
thought would happen yeah I think it's a
good point that you know these companies
are like oh you know if we don't do
something we don't actually change then
Google just going to come in and do it
exactly stars kept these companies are
having to race ahead of Google now right
and deploy as many places as they can
because they never know when Google
won't go and go hey guess what we're
here here yeah so I think it's going to
be a this is what I always thought would
happen and I'm thrilled it's happening
from saha Raja do you think they will
show an update on project ara man I
don't know that is such an odd yeah who
really controls it so yeah love it if
they did I mean we're still sort of
waiting for that soft launch in Puerto
Rico right i don't i don't think that's
happened yet it's all happened you up
yeah so once that happens maybe we'll
learn more I don't know I'd love to hear
more on it just I mean we do have what
two and a half hours year marked on the
calendar so for this keynote it could go
anywhere you know up to that mark so
when you thought good grief uh-huh i I'd
forgot it was two and a half hours
tomorrow yeah lunch on the table here
exactly yeah I it real quick let's let's
let people in behind the scenes what do
what do you do to prepare for one of
these events when we're covering
remotely um for me I definitely I'll
have coffee tomorrow and like I did
today and probably a bottle or two of
water and some food we're all of just
eaten because it's tough I mean you
don't know really you don't know when
you're gonna be able to get up next yeah
we work as a team usually on skype and
we're saying you know okay you write
this news and all right this news and
you write this news and it goes very
quickly and thankfully most of the time
before you know it you know the two
hours is pretty much gone but it's it
can be tough and you got it up yeah I
mean I'm not saying we're like in the
trenches but no no but else no we're not
very wild you know it's a pretty crazy
two hours two and a half hours sometimes
but yeah so about a half hour before the
event starts we get on we start our
skype group chat and that way it's just
it's quicker for us to yell out you know
who's free who can take this okay I'm on
this you take that and what we do is
whoever is currently writing a post
mutes themselves because we don't want
to hear for keyboards going at any time
okay i was using a mechanical keyboard
forever now i'm on oh thank goodness see
you guys can all relax you enjoy
watching your dueling mechanical
keyboard yeah uh so yeah it's I'm the
same way I get a cup of coffee right
before the show starts I know that will
last me 45 minutes to an hour so then I
have a bottle of water ready to go as
well yeah I typically don't I I'm not
despite what you might think looking at
me I'm not that much of a snacker during
the day so I don't worry about food so I
am I I have breakfast white Guetta I
cannot believe I'm discussing this on
the show I had breakfast when I guess
and then I have like a snack in the
midday and that's pretty much it ah
things you never wanted to know about
the technicals down unless we expect
about food yeah at least deal with
riches but I had for breakfast today oh
that Becca actually that could be fun
during the holiday season when there's
nothing else to discuss from saw Raja do
you know mkbhd I don't Todd have you
ever met him no I be a secret Vince's in
my heaven minimum we see him around I
know John knows him you know they're
they're friends but uh honestly I sit in
a corner and just people come over and
say hi shot
so nice leave me alone in my corner I
work to know but um from such an Baja
and the i'll just say bright up front no
I don't uh do any of you guys use
periscope meerkat and well you guys use
them more since they both just came to
android the irvine office is using them
they love them that's a periscope
they're easy and probably more on
Android yeah yeah I don't see the
interest in this whatsoever yeah I'm not
big on sharing that kind of stuff I
don't know I that's why I don't use
snapchat much i use Instagram like I'll
send a picture of my dog or the beach
green uh something like that mmm that's
about the extent and even on Twitter I'm
really quiet I I talk more on Twitter
just gonna have it open all day and i
just i randomly comment on things as
they pass by but no I just I'm not I
haven't used either i don't feel a need
to use either it's just not yeah it
comes down to like I don't I don't maybe
like next time I'm at an event I would
do it but I don't do much i think that
like my audience would wanna see like
you know in the weekends where I'm like
gearing up my fishing pole like I don't
think my audience is following me to see
that I do I'm gonna get a mac letting
the bar corn yeah that's to hear or like
barbecuing I like I don't know I assume
like next time I think you know the LG
g5 event yeah that's a different
situation yeah in our everyday lives our
everyday lives folks are very boring I
we just a the this little air you see me
and this is where I am for 10 11 hours a
day I don't move from here Todd no Todd
everyone's well I know you get wild and
you get up you walk across the room I
know Brandon yesterday one of our
colleagues we've been competing deck and
four
earth on steps taken except for both
sadly going nowhere and at five o'clock
i'd gone twelve hundred steps and
doctors suggest you get 10,000 in a day
okay I actually I've been trying really
hard lately I I have a treadmill across
the room I've been trying really hard
lately at least once a day get up walk
over and walk out for just ten minutes
you know just to get some sort of
exercise right and I know I knew that
was nowhere near 10,000 steps I knew
that so I decided to finally look up and
everyone's like well yo steps vario
depending on your height and all that
yadda yadda right right it still works
out to somewhere around for miles well
that's not bad it's not horrible but I
mean when I jump on the treadmill for
that 10 minutes that's point five six
miles is how far I go in that 10 minutes
right so I'm not getting up and going
over eight times a day I'm sorry right
oh I see what you're saying the 10,000
oh yeah 10,000 steps equals 40 over four
miles huh yeah I hate men nah it's
always interesting when I come back for
my annual vacation to England i've lost
like 12 15 pounds of the week that's
because i do nothing but walk yeah
that's all I do when I'm in England is
walk constantly but uh may I don't even
know how we got on that and fitness
tracking we were talking about meerkat
and then we don't go get her oh yeah we
apart this is one of those episodes from
such a Mahal hey Sean have you got your
shipping location for your pebble time
since you were a super early backer and
got for 159 I i saw this question when
we first got here I went over to my
email check i have not gotten my
shipment notification today i know they
said you know the 27th was the day those
would go out but i have not seen a
shipment notification yet and this plays
into another question from such an ball
who out of the TechnoBuffalo step is
going to be reviewing the pebble time
and you guys should also make a video
directly comparing it to the apple watch
and and Android wear device videos they
probably will we're just waiting for the
one survived on door mine since they do
all the videos as for who's going to do
the written review I we really even
discussed that yet I honestly thought I
just kind of assumed it was might be me
since I did Apple watch and all that
brought the pebble time to yeah I knew
you'd bought a pebble time as well and
you got in on the early backing as well
on the second round of the early back so
uh I think it also depends on who gets
theirs first yes a lot of it I we've got
a bunch ordered from all the different
offices would uh what we'll just have to
wait and see who actually gets one early
hmm from cuoco Yuki thoughts on the
Susan phone to Todd you writing this up
this morning oh no no we were covering
the possible zenfone three oh I'm sorry
it was it but I don't think it is going
to be it was sort of this mid-range
zenfone pass through tiene oh the
zenfone 2 is the one that just was
announced yeah they just just came out
in the United States it looks like a
nice phone I honestly haven't spent much
time with it aside from briefly at CES I
believe but it's out in the office they
have it so I'm sure we'll have more
coverage on it but I like the price
seems like pre decent device for price
yeah I like a sous products yeah me too
and you know you have this range of like
you have the alcatel one touch idol 3
you have this to zenfone 2 you have one
plus one there's like there's nice range
of Android devices a low-cost good for
everybody what's that from such a ball
are you still setting up petrol meters
yep we're talking about this again yep
for those that may not know the joke a
long time ago mispronunciations made of
pedometers as pedo meters had led the
whole series of bad jokes anyway from
chase kelvin t'en does glass have a
feature is it
head will we see it I oh I don't know I
it was certainly dead like in its
current form we know that so much but i
think google uses a learning lesson
maybe inappropriately like probably
shouldn't have made a consumer product
if it wasn't really ready I think it has
a future in a different form um we know
like I said Tony Fadell is the guy who
co-founded nest and father of the ipod
is everybody says he's heading it up now
I have a lot of faith in that guy he
seems like he knows what he's doing so
we'll see what comes out of glass but i
don't i don't think we'll see it you
know the ugly thing again no I i think
the ugly virgin is gone yeah and i don't
have a problem with that yeah i think we
will see something similar to glass i
will it necessarily be called glass I
don't know honestly I think the name
glass has a bit of a stigma attached to
it now definitely you know so I could
see them calling it something else but
there will be people like tated me who
will be at our keyboards going it
doesn't matter what I call it's the
glass yeah still looks stupid so let's
go preds all privacy concerns yeah I
think it was a definite it was a
learning experience I think for the
entire technology world because they
didn't think about the ideas of okay
howre movie theater is going to react to
this how is wearing it into a biker bar
going to go over she knows everywhere
yeah there was a lot of things they
simply did not think about and I think
that's okay I mean I i I'm not saying
that they are a problem that they didn't
think of this you can't think of every
single possible variation but I don't
know it's it's going to be interesting
to see if this ever goes anywhere yeah
uh from know gaming do you think windows
10 xbox one streaming will be available
on Windows Phone or even hololens um it
should be I if I might be mistaken but I
thought it was going to be available for
Windows Phone in some fashion but I
could be mistaken at least two tablets
and stuff like that we already know and
hollow lens I think because I think it
should work because they've said you
know hololens is just like a full
version of Windows 10 so you can like
you know pop open a browser pop up in a
video presumably stream a game right but
I'm correct uh breaking news just in
from CNBC tech Apple response to reports
that sending a specific string of
characters to an iphone can shut down
the phone quote we are aware of an
iMessage issue caused by specific series
of unicode characters and we will make a
fix available in a software update
unquote all right there you go so they
had said earlier today I guess you know
via Twitter someone said that they have
been working on but good to know yeah
it's not a surprise you know it should
be a fairly simple fix I would imagine
but we'll have to see how long it takes
them to get that going from Sean the man
34 or what have you returned recently
Todd did I return anything well I didn't
return it but I replaced the neon green
and on my Apple watch with a black one
and here's the thing i have that i had
ordered one already but news hit last
week when i was in irvine that they were
out in the stores so i went bought one
and now my black one that i ordered
should be here soon all hatcheries
earned that so there you go i love the
fact this has become a segment yeah
that's this week's what have I returned
yeah sure man 34 you are officially art
now our asker of what is todd returned
I expect to see that question every
single week there you go uh from such a
baja have any of you guys seen pitch
perfect 2 yet I've seen it and it was
funny i am not had a chance I have not
seen I love to pitch perfect one
obviously so I'm looking forward to see
i'll probably wait till it's out here to
be honest though or rental and it won't
take long these days I mean what it's
like almost like two weeks later it's
available Google Play I know anymore I'm
just like it takes a lot to get me to
the theater and I'm probably gonna buy
that one too cuz i bought the first ones
sorry pre-ordered it on itunes perhaps
from chase gelding t'en aspire going to
be able to compete in the video world
what about podcasts will this rebrand
make them more successful ah I don't
know I don't know either but it can't
hurt I mean 499 animal I don't think of
changing the price right I'm just adding
stuff I mean it does make it sort of
more desirable and you're going out
there and picking you know a music
service whether it's Google play music
or Rdio or whatever so yeah I think it's
sort of like let's let's fill up our
stuff as much as we can before Apple
tries to enter the game with a lower
price that they can turn around say well
Apple might have it for 799 but for 999
you get movies and music videos podcasts
and I am so I think that's probably
smart move from shauna man 34 missed the
beginning of the stream so I may have
missed the discussion todd has the Apple
watch three weeks later um well I'm
still wearing it which was my answer
last week I like it software update that
hit last week I finally applied it seems
to be a little better i was joking last
week how every time I sat down it
reminded me to stand almost about it's
like I was just standing what are you
talking about Apple watch um and I'm
still yeah I'm still wearing it so that
I can get something I like you know I I
think that says a lot actually yeah so I
appreciate again I have it really
limited on notifications so I have you
know hangouts text messages and then
sports scores i think i think those are
like the main ones i get and it was nice
having my flight information they're
going
back and forth from California but I did
not use and we've talked about this
before it is my boarding pass I sort of
always rely on the paper just in case
well you know the thing is when you like
I always have a checked bag yes so when
you go up and you check your bag they're
gonna give you the paper tickets anyway
yeah so I'm just like fine I'll just
keep using paper Deggans I don't care
yeah I just don't want to be that guy
when you know everybody's just like I
just want to get on the plane and you
know you're like eat like it's not
registering and you're like standing
there and everybody's like who's this
jerk with the Apple watch like why don't
you get a paper ticket like the rest of
us so until everybody has them and
everybody's used to that I don't want to
be that guy yeah I i I'd uh I don't know
it's actually one of my the worst things
about it so far though it's like when I
don't want it to be a conversation piece
and it becomes one so for example on the
plane I was sitting there and the person
to seat Stan was like what do you think
of the Apple watch I was like I like it
and then when i was up at the bathroom
miss lady leans over and she's on the I
I mean she's on the window of that once
she's leaning over me well yeah what do
you think about the Apple watch and all
these people are so looking at me like I
think about the Apple watching and the
one question i'm getting is is it worth
it and I'm like well I don't yeah for me
it was worth it is it worth it for you I
have no idea you know I literally just
met you I don't know what your use cases
but I spensive now that is i I've come
to the point now on planes where I tried
to not reveal what I do yeah because
it's a topic that everybody has an
opinion on ya and you'll get asked about
you know what you think about this phone
oh so I have this phone what do you
think of it I'm creating my website how
do I do that yes I I on a plane this is
my one of my few times in my life I
consider watch a movie yep don't talk to
me yeah but so in that in that case I
wanted to like almost take it off just I
can see that I can see that yeah it's I
and I me
a short haul flight I'll talk to you all
day I don't care our flight whatever
whatever right yeah but if it's more
than 90 minutes which means i can get a
movie in we're not talking exactly angry
