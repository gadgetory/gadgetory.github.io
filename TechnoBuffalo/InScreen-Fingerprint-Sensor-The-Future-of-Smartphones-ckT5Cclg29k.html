sponsoring this video smartphone design
hasn't changed that much over the past
few years bezels have got a little bit
thinner display technologies gotten
better but we haven't seen that giant
leap forward that we've seen in previous
years that is until now and it's due to
the clear ID sensor from synaptics and
it might not mean much to you what the
technology does is something we've been
dreaming about for years and then
rumored about for even longer it puts a
fingerprint reader under your display
and I've got it here and I've got it
working so it's working on a vivo phone
some version of this is eventually going
to hit the market probably not in the US
but the technology here is absolutely
incredible alright so first just as
English as a geek it's incredible to
actually see this working in a prototype
that surprisingly let me set up and try
and it worked as advertised
so the unlock time is like 0.7 ish
seconds it's about 40% slower than what
you see with just normal fingerprint
readers but to the end-user I don't know
as much of a slowdown at all so anything
on this magic essentially works so the
sensor is sitting below this point if
you catch it in the right light you can
actually see it down towards the bottom
it's set at an angle that they told me
was for improved accuracy and speed it's
barely there but it's kind of cool to
see it and because it's under the screen
you can do a lot with design you'd have
to worry about taking up a chunk of
space with a fingerprint reader on the
front on the back of devices if you make
things look more elegant materials put
in bigger battery put a generally other
components cuz you don't have to worry
about trying to find a spot for that
sensor because there's an actual spot
for it software kind of comes into place
as the phone moves or you pick it up
it's a text you want to unlock it it's
gonna illuminate essentially where you
should put your finger put your finger
right there and it unlocks and the rest
of how it works
seems kind of pedestrian which i think
is the point it works the way all your
finger parameters working out set up was
very simple unlocking it is very simple
but it looks like magic when you turn
your phone off and the screen is blank
and you know as a fingerprint reader
actually under there so it's a simple
answer of how this works it's actually
going through the pixels
the OLED panel so it's optical it's
different to what we're gonna see from
Qualcomm later on in the year it's abuse
of ultrasonic technology to do similar
things but this is here and right now I
could get a lot more about the
technology but as a fan of smartphones
and what they represent this is a
gigantic leap forward this is the stuff
of science fiction a few years later in
the palm of my hand hopefully we'll see
this technology make it to a ton and
more smartphones in 2018 so this video
wouldn't be possible without nuclear and
we've actually been using this a ton at
CES it adds way more functionality to
new MacBook and MacBook Pros with USB C
so the big thing it adds seven ports
seven ports of things that you need USB
a and actually USB C port SD card
readers and more and most importantly I
think at least to us is you can use all
seven ports at once it's color match to
the MacBook it's a must-have accessory
if you've got one of these new computers
it's one dongle and one cable that just
adds way more functionality than you get
right from Apple so I don't learn more
link to it down below so do you guys
think reach excited as I am are you
pumped you prefer some sort of other
biometrics to unlock your phone this is
an incredibly elegant solution leave a
comment down below let me know of course
subscribe hit the little bell icon T
notify the more CES videos are coming
your way
till next time I'm John rende your exact
no Buffalo I'm holding the future
they're not gonna take it from me</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
