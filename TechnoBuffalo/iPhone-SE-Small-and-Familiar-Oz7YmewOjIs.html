just order them and they get delivered
which we have some on order but like a
lot of folks go to the store to pick
them up so I thought we'd share the
experience see how the launch line is
Apple stores open five minutes ago so
let's see if it's busy you're engaged
the reaction of a phone by what's
happening at the store so we're gonna go
check it out see if they have their pick
up an iPhone S II and a nine point seven
inch iPad pro and C v app another four
so we just got him didn't seem like
there was a lot of excitement about him
but maybe you forgot to get him home and
check it out we have a a gold SE and a a
gold 9.7 we have a few we ordered to do
we've got a got a Space Gray and the
silver iPhone coming in and I think
another silver iPad coming to the office
today but figure we have some colors to
show some variety I don't think I could
quite pull up rose gold I'm not that
confident myself quite yet someday
alright so we just got back from the
Apple Store with our gold S II and our
gold in 9.7 we are going to unbox the
iPhone se first it looks like every
other iPhone bought a little bit smaller
se branding on it
and that's really it Apple logos strewn
about Lucy wants to come in and say hi
go ahead and get her nice and cut the
plastic thrones do some specs here too
in case you guys need an update on what
you can expect from the iPhone se if you
decide to pick one up got a 4-inch
display living inside of the box and
leave that tiny tiny little guy there
it's 11:30 6x6 or do not many pixels
going on the way down that's a 326 about
PPI inside of the box very typical Apple
stuff we got a wall wart
lightning cable and Tamiya pods that's
about it and
inside here sim removal tool booklets
and two Apple stickers not that exciting
so for all the phone feels really nice
it's a familiar feel something I think a
lot of people are used to I don't know
how people were actually clamoring for a
smaller phone I think for me though and
my line of work I'm constantly carrying
a lot of devices like usually I'm
carrying an iOS and Android but at the
same time so I think a smaller phone in
my pocket is certainly nice I'm excited
to try it again especially having the
power of the current gen of the smaller
form factor of the previous gen copy
that Apple kept the same megapixel
camera on the back and the 6s ideally
like that camera man a 16 gig phone it's
a tough pill to swallow so up for the 64
I think that's watching we're going to
unbox the iPad pro necks hit the link up
above to go take a look at that also
link it down below you want to see
what's nine point seven inch iPad pro
looks like</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
