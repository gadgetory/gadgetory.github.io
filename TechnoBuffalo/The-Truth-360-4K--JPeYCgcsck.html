from technobuffalo here and we are back
with another state of the site we try
and do things differently TechnoBuffalo
we even the past sort of pulled the
letter back and shared all of our stats
all of our traffic history and we tried
to very candidly look about what we've
done right and what we've done wrong did
a lot of things differently these past
few months and I figured what better way
to talk about we've done differently
than by doing a different video I feel
so weird so we are in 360 which means if
you've got something like cardboard
laying around put your phone in and look
around at the room where we do a lot of
our filming in if you're watching on
YouTube you can move your phone around
actually look around the room and see
all of us sitting here so boobarella
we're talking look around take a look at
what's behind us and things that are
going on because they're shooting b-roll
right shooting b-roll as we speak i've
got i've got ron in front of me I've got
marked first Niner to my right so let's
go ahead and let's start with video
think we've done a lot of different
things as video yeah so I've been doing
YouTube videos since 2007 along a long
time doing videos I sort of got into a
rhythm of the way I was doing things and
in a lot of ways that it started to
stagnate a little bit I sort of took an
introspective look at what I've been
doing personally with videos I think
it's important to do on any job whether
youtube or anything and I started saying
that we need to change up the way that
we were sort of doing things are
approaching videos because the oldest
tree is has changed so we started doing
that of me early November I think yes
art is it about couple months outfits
about too much yeah you should be able
to see some of those changes so you saw
the regular shows like ask the Buffalo
and rumor roundup that initially go away
you're going on hiatus hyannis just
reevaluating yeah they're still there
still existing and when there's
something to talk about we're gonna do
those shows but linked to something
worthwhile talking we're not going to
shoehorn them in there for any
particular reason we want to mix up our
sets you know I make the video sort of
look a little bit different doing a lot
more voiceover centric videos and trying
new technologies just things that we've
always kind of wanted to try this year's
been an incredible year for us we pass
it over millions of drivers we passed
1.1 we're on our way to pretty close to
1.2 million yeah subscribe words been
great on the site technobuffalo calm
obviously god we've had hurtin what's up
you got a gold play button we Dave you
gotta go away yeah weird nabavi by that
growth has been release all this our
fifth year of consecutive growth on
TechnoBuffalo comrades site grows and
grows it's hard to sort of have that two
hundred percent growth you have the year
before finishing return yes so we had
about a forty percent growth this year
which is really solid we sort of settled
in to around thirteen and a half to 14
million page views a month and about
three million uniques per month on so
big big numbers obviously our goal for
next year as I want to have an average
of about 15 million page views and about
three and a half to four million a
single put us in a really nice position
we're also reevaluating kind of
everything that we've been doing it and
the ads are a big part of of how
re-evaluating the reality is I don't
like abs I don't think anybody here like
yeah add I feel like what what has kind
of come through in video is how we feel
about ads like I don't mind ads when
there's something entertaining and
that's what we've been going for is like
trying to do something fun too long I've
been trying to make her ads like their
own individual pieces of content I think
that is like they should be good enough
to stand on their own and be whether
they be a little skits or whatever we
have fun with them or whatever maybe
that's kind of been the thought so if
we're if we're doing ads we only want to
do them in a way that we'd actually
watched and let you guys know at least
you weren't just like hey you should
check out whatever razor or should we
try to make a fun entertaining we're
gonna continue to do that yeah we're
also going to work to put out more video
of higher quality so not every video you
see has ads we're have to do for videos
a week that have ads but we are sort of
working through negotiate how those ads
would work to make it a better
experience because we want it to be
better for you guys we want the whole
site to be better yeah and the videos to
to be better so heading into next year
you should see a lot of things that are
different I think you'll look to see
more frequent videos different styles of
videos we're independent so we can how
to do what we want we're gonna try sort
of new angles on on both posts and
videos you'll see Ron literally new
Anglesey way yeah you'll see Ron a bit
more on camera yeah you'll see in the
a little bit more on camera so if you
guys couldn't tell we try and do things
differently here and that's why we give
you all this information let you know
what's going on behind the scenes so
we're going to look heading into next
year to try and fight stagnation it
happens in any job and any career in
anything you do something long enough
but you get comfortable and sometimes
getting comfortable as the detriment of
the business and determine the videos
and it was from a tough relation for me
to sort of look inside and big maybe on
the thing that was holding us back maybe
the style that I got so accustomed to
lose what was holding us back so we all
sort of got a lot more collaborative we
all started talking more brainstorming
video ideas try and make videos better
yeah we've got almost 1.2 million
subscribers you know we want at least
twenty percent of our subscribers to
look at each video and that's our goal
that's pretty about average for for the
industry we want to forget that number
up higher so videos that averaged thirty
forty thousand views it should be
averaging 80 90 100 that's up to us to
put out better videos with new styles
love to hear what you guys think things
that you want to see maybe you want to
see more tutorials maybe you want to see
more camera gear here that Rhonda's
maybe you want to see more ways to root
your phone on it something that burst
can do we'd love to hear what you guys
want to see hope you guys enjoyed this
we'd love to just sort of pull pull back
to the veil yes and just show you our
stats no one else does this no other
site does it's kind of cool thing about
being independent we can show you
everything have a really kind of honest
discussion so and since and since we are
all here you know we can just have a
very frank discussion we're like you
know we're not you guys aren't just
numbers on a piece of paper and like you
said like not everybody gets the
opportunity to do this and talk about
what those numbers are and you guys are
who those numbers represent so when we
say like let us know your thoughts or
let us know what you think in the
comments like we're not a joke it's very
it's very genuine like we're we're super
serious like let us know what you think
in the comments because we are we're
reading them you know thank whoever
which one of you spoiled Star Wars for
me because I remember but events and we
do this I particularly do this because I
love it I could have sold this years ago
and otherwise what I mean I'm done
something different yeah I love
technology I love making videos i love
to be able to talk to you guys so I like
first said let's have discussion if you
see the comments on any of our video
we respond we respond all the time I
will always I'll respond from the china
buffalo one I signed it and being like
and I probably spawned two I mean almost
every comment no matter how horrible
some of them yeah some of them are
really some of them really horrible and
speaking of comments last thing that I
want to talk about is dealing with the
comments now for a long time it's easy
for me to say it gets easier to deal
with man those comments it really tough
sometimes we already get discouraged I
wasn't a little bit of a rut I think for
the past few weeks yeah I think I was
there with you for like a week or two
minutes it's really hard Internet is a
horrible place great and awful I mean
but at least great and awful yes yeah
but the same thing with comments like
four for one or two videos like really
discouraging yeah and I'm not so like I
pinus guy to be like he should all be
nice because I know they've got the
reality of the world yeah at least isn't
thinking about typing something don't
type something that you wouldn't say to
somebody's face right if I wouldn't say
to Ron I wouldn't say it to you I try it
yeah and you know what like even with
even when people are like pretty awful
about it I try and how would you like to
be responded to you know like if I had
said something awful and someone said
something to me like hey maybe think
about what you're saying first I think
oh thanks oh it's a very little way
level-headed way had to help her stop
being a jerk yeah it's it's tough to do
the comments and doing this for so long
I always think that I get better and
then I think that I finally like got
some armor on yeah then someone says I'm
just like rips it all right that'd be
nice I know that we're still human
beings we might be on YouTube but we're
yeah normal dudes like you guys are so
anyway thank you guys for watching you
guys want to say I don't think so I mean
mostly thank you like yeah we wouldn't
be able to do like the play button
videos that the state of the site videos
that's my number one thing is like I've
been a viewer for a very long time this
is my like kind of first foray into the
other end of the spectrum in this
particular medium so I think it's is
important for you guys to feel valuable
you know as if you were every single
time you click like it makes a
difference it does it makes a huge
difference in we're it not for you guys
we would not be able to have this
business operating as it does today so
and just just from my kind of like
alluding to what you said earlier which
was just to keep videos fresh I think
something we've done is really avoid
having going to the same place as
filming the same locations and so we've
really like really
made an effort to to pushed on will been
challenged ourselves yeah close to every
single day we come in you know we have
meetings in the mornings or like or
we're like what do we do today you know
we have like three view okay but we want
to do a great job in everything we don't
want to fund any of them in so yeah we
try really hard I know for me I and tell
a story like I know I try especially
lately I'm trying to approach each and
every video that we do is like an
opportunity to tell a story about a
device and I think as you know I think
that's something that you guys can
expect to see a little bit more of
mm-hmm agreed so thank you guys we love
doing 360 stuff we're going to try and
do more if you want more French on how
we get 360 and where we we did will put
links to yeah that's up down below so
YouTube you get zero 360 on anyway guys
until the next video John render I'm are
percenter I think I'm Ron berita and see
you guys soon oh this is weird signing
off altogether I liked it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
