technobuffalo here and I'm doing
something that I have never done before
I've got a movie review I had this
ridiculous honor of going to the world
premiere of Avengers age of Ultron
earlier in the month I couldn't talk
about it for a week it up and just
bubbling over with stuff to talk about
so I'm gonna try doing a movie review
for you I figure I saw the movie we
cover stuff on technobuffalo kombat
movie so i'm going to share my thoughts
on it gigantic caveat spoiler alert i'm
going to talk about what happens in the
movie i'm gonna give stuff away if you
do not want things to be spoiled then
you can mute me and you just look like
I'm going like this for a while you want
to know my thoughts on the movie things
you might not have expected like what's
the after credits scene if there is one
what's the cutscene does anybody die oh
it's kind of questions that you might
want to know before you go in and decide
if you want to see it stick around if
you want to review the movie without
spoilers here it is real quickly it is
awesome the special effects are
incredible I was really concerned at
what is going to be as good as the first
one it was as entertaining as the first
one as many plot twists as the first one
again the effect traps are ridiculous
the sound was awesome in it it is a
great movie if you love superhero movies
you love the Marvel movies you're
already going to see this one anyway so
there's your non-spoiler part let's get
into spoilers so I'm a big comic book
nerd I used to read them all the time as
a kid in fact I still collect them now
as an adult so I sort of know the
stories going in and I follow the news
I'm the kind of guy that before movie
hits I'm searching YouTube to find out
what the after credits scene is I've
sort of want to no spoilers don't bother
me so the first thing I want to jump
into there is not a scene after the
credits so don't bother sitting there
unless you want to see all their names
know who the best boy grip was there is
so ever seen about three minutes into
the credits and I'm going to jump right
in with that it's freaking Thanos Josh
Brolin doing the voice essentially he
picks up a Infinity Gauntlet like we got
back there minus the gems no gems in he
says I'm gonna have to do it myself they
notice isn't pulling the strings
throughout the entire involving marvel
universe trying to get the infinity gems
they talk a lot about in these movies so
bear mine that's what the cutscene is so
the movie jumps in pretty quick with a
lot of action you got the Avengers try
get back low key staff from Hydra the
coolest thing you see and they're
jumping all out of the car and they're
all doing like cool action scenes it's
actually right in the beginning of the
movie from the first scene DC on it
comes out pretty awesome they get the
staff back and everybody's all super
happy you jump to a scene of Tony Stark
and Bruce Banner talking about virtual
intelligence saying whether or not they
should do it Everett they shouldn't do
it turns out the Infinity stone that's
inside of low key staff it's actually a
computer conveniently enough for sort of
a type of computer artificial
intelligence built in and they're like
hey we should go ahead and particular
are bugged without any sort of sense and
what the Ultron product even was and
they jump right frickin in to all Tron
you see a big blue ball representing old
Tron the big yellow ball representing
the AI of Jarvis and you can see that
the AI of Ultron is much bigger and
they're like okay we're just going to
punch some keys on a keyboard ai ai ai
stuff they're like all right well which
probably get some pizza we got a party
tonight now they just like leave of
course you know that's not gonna go over
well then suddenly you start to see the
blue ball come alive and you hear the
voice of James Spader as Ultron who is
so awesome as all tratas voice is so
good if you guys watch the blacklist in
there who he is some of the older movies
he's done but nails the voice of Voltron
here start to fight with Jarvis a little
bit the jar back and forth and
supposedly kills Jarvis and they go to
the party that's sort of the scene but
you see in the trailer who I'll try and
pick up Thor's hammer and none was able
to do it captain america move it a
little bit and then suddenly hey there's
Ultron just turned rotten in with
strings on me uh and he says I'm gonna
kill the Avengers all the stuff you've
heard and the trailer little bagel
trumpets flat through and they fight
them and the Avengers can fight them off
and they kind of killed Ron at least the
body Voltron but thing about him he's
sentience and he's artificial and they
say they've lost him the internet which
like come on they lost he's in the
internet like users is in the internet
is what they said like he's just
floating at the internet to thing and
then he's in it we're okay a little
cheesy but I'll be clearly not grounded
in reality because you
have giant sentient robots telling James
Spader that want to kill you that's a
plot you've got Ultron Ultron feels the
only way to save humanity is to kill
humanity and start over from scratch
sort of him as these are template for
how the next generation of people should
be talked a lot about asteroids hitting
earth and killing the dinosaurs and how
it's the next phase for humans to be
extinct and I've got your bad guy yeah
and all the Avengers try and fight him
new to the fold you've got Scarlet Witch
and Quicksilver which fun fact and the
comic books their father is Magneto but
since Fox owns right to expedite magneto
they couldn't even say the word mutants
in it they call them enhanced they're
working with Ultron because one of Tony
Stark's missiles killed their families
so they're super mad at Tony Stark and I
work with Ultron Scarlet Witch has
mind-control powers and Quicksilver is
like a ghetto version of the flash you
can run super fast you saw him in the
last x-men movie did a different version
of him one fun story don't sir side note
Jeremy Renner who played Hawkeye was
super critical the first Marvel movies
because he didn't like kind of mind
control and thought his character kind
of sucked they make a very
tongue-in-cheek reference to it Scarlett
Witt tries to control his mind and
Easter hits her with an arrow in the
head and it's like my patrol tried that
wasn't a fan hot guys are some of the
best lines inc in the entire movie so
when you watch it take a look for some
things he has to say there's a lot of
certain cheek references to him being
pissed about the first movie so they
fight the Avengers with Ultron for a
while they realize hey wait a min
electrons super duper bad we're gonna
join The Avengers and now they join The
Avengers there in some random Eastern
European city where Ultron's hiding out
Ultron uses what they're calling
vibranium because they can't use
adamantium which is what Wolverines went
out of because also Fox on that they're
using vibranium which also fun fact they
say it comes from the planet of Wakanda
which you follow comic books also know
where Black Panther is from so the sort
of setting that up to the next movie
where Black Panther presumably will be
there and then his own Black Panther
movie so sort of bear that in mind so
anyways fast forward they use the
vibranium sort of lift up the entire
Eastern European city where electrons
holding out to treat it like
an asteroid and take it all the way up
drop it and it'll wipe out earth and
then yellow Tron can live and create new
serve humanity a lot of questions who
have been about the vision where he
comes from whether or not Tony Stark
creates and like it did in the comic
books Tony Stewart does not create the
vision in the movie in fact it is Ultron
who creates a vision they use somebody
out of man tiem and some crazy
technology they've got to create skin on
top of it what kind of a random doctor
just shows up to create the vision they
sort of put Jarvis's AI inside of him
they pop it in findi stone in his head
right right there and the vision is born
presumably he's the yin to all trans
yang and sort of equally powerful and
they've got him on their side now also
fighting Ultron and also he picks up
Thor's hammer and just uses it like like
it's nothing and that's sort of a fun
play between Thor and the vision they
fight they beat Ultron as you would
expect somebody does die I don't want to
tell you who let's all leave that part
open but there is a death in the movie
and the movie ends Captain America
leading sort of a new team of Avengers
sort of folks you already know guys like
Falcon guys like war machine and some of
the New Avengers that you meet in this
movie and teats ends with the same his
famous line supposed to be a vendor's
assemble cousins he says Avengers it
goes black and that's how the movie ends
but everything just looks awesome the
movie was incredible I really enjoyed it
you want early on if you like the first
Avengers you'll like this one if you
like the Marvel movies you'll love this
one's kind of cool to see them all
together interacting it's at the stage
for a lot of other Marvel movies sort of
also set the stage for us toward Marvel
calling phase 3 but I'm excited and you
can tell it i'm rambling because i love
these movies we're not going to do many
move reviews on TechnoBuffalo i just had
a chance to go to the premiere it was
