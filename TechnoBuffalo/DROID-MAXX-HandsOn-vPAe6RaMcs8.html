with technobuffalo we're checking out
the motorola droid maxx that was just
announced today their verizon event here
in New York City it's going to launch
August twentieth for to 9999 the ideal
part about this is that it actually has
a 48-hour usage time that's thanks to
the 3500 milliamp hour battery under the
hood O'Brien you've got the 5-inch 720p
display so not today any feet you got a
1.7 gigahertz dual-core processor though
Motorola's describing an X 8 annex a
process that actually they're saying
sort of mimics using an eight-core
processor depending on the task using
God ok Google now is a command you can
use it's actually programmed to use your
voice though it's not going to work for
me if I say it but basically it launches
Google now for you when you say ok
Google now got a 2-megapixel
front-facing camera there up top a 3.5
millimeter headphone jack the bad
lighting here nothing on the left micro
USB charging on the bottom let's try to
get that for you there you go on the
right you've got volume bugs anything
about that we try to get a better shot
that you can actually pop it out and
that's the SIM tray 2 and then the power
button right there on the top right ok
now we've got on the homescreen
something called command center you can
use what's called droids apps to send
files using just a quick gesture you can
lock things you share at a randomized
code just decide what shared you can
even share the app itself and then of
course you can change the weather or
wirelessly stream data to a display
using mirror casts simply go through the
phone for you again settings
neck actually and here you can see it's
running for point-to-point to jelly
beans we're not sure if it's going to be
updated to 4.3 we can see its skin here
so it might not be as quickly and I
don't need to go through verizon's
approval process well again the selling
points to large battery here 3,500
milliamp hour battery it's a 10
megapixel camera on the back by the way
