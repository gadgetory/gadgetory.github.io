technobuffalo and we're back again with
another video to help you guys out with
your video production in the last one I
covered very basic lighting techniques
if you missed that then I'll be sure to
include a link in the description box or
if not I'll a scourge on lakers to do
that he's cool like that for this video
I'm gonna cover basic sound for video
production something a lot of people
overlook especially people who are new
to amateur video production would be
sound now when I say sound i'm not
talking about sound effects or anything
wow wow those are my amateur sound
effects by the way when i mentioned
sound i'm talking about audio as a whole
like my voice for example for quality
video sound means everything is even
more important than the video itself
watch see even though there's nothing
there at this point the video still
rather watchable I can even start an
image slideshow if I wanted to as long
as I'm still talking this is a pic of
John Lakers all chubbed up from one of
his live streams isn't it epic so what
have we swap it around now there's no
audio only video
regardless of what's going on in the
video I'm sure it's a lot harder to
focus and pay attention to maybe not yet
but imagine this for like two or three
minutes then it get crazy now that we
all know the importance of sound let's
look at our options we have two main
options here one of course would be to
use an external microphone and two would
be to use the internal microphone on
your camera see I'm not very
enthusiastic about this one because the
internal microphone on the camera is
just it's just nasty I highly highly
recommend you choose the external
microphone option and if so try your
best to get the absolute best microphone
you can get all you gotta do is plug it
in and record with your favorite audio
recording program and you're good to go
from my videos i use a blue snowball
microphone which would retail for about
eighty or ninety dollars nowadays a huge
advantage of using an external
microphone would be that the quality
would be so so much better because you
can have the microphone closer to you
when you speak the closer the subject is
to the microphone the better the sound
that's why you see there are boom people
in film and TV on top of that it's a lot
easier to do voiceovers because you
don't need to turn on the camera in
order to record your vocals a minor
disadvantage would be that you'd have to
sync of your audio file with the cameras
audio file in your video editor which
isn't as hard as it sounds and honestly
it's not too bad another option
involving microphones would be to you
think sterno mic for your camera if your
camera supports it you can use an
external microphone such as the rode
videomic right here usually they're a
little bit more expensive compared to
something like the snowball mic right
here but you're playing for the
convenience there's no audio syncing
involved in regardless of where your
film you know that audio will be rather
decent and everything's just right there
ready to go a huge disadvantage would be
that if you're in an environment where
the room is echoey and there's a lot of
background noise and everything the mic
probably will pick it up for videos like
this one the audio would have no doubt
been compromised because look at how far
the camera is from me compared to this
USB mic right here if I were to use it
of course I actually bought the rode
videomic for my Canon TTYL but I ended
up returning it in about two days and
picked up all the echo here from this
room and even my cpu fan which is
offensively loud even though my canon
t2i supports an external microphone I
like the quality a lot better from the
snowball but that's just me personally
second option i mentioned earlier would
be to use the internal microphone from
your camera the sound quality isn't too
bad in the canon t2i internal microphone
which is what you're hearing right now
is definitely a lot better compared to
the internal microphone of this sony HD
camera right here I can't describe it
the one on the sony is just not as good
yeah the internal microphone from my
panasonic lumix camera is even worse it
sounds like i'm inside of a tin can or
something very unpretty sounding so for
amateur video making i highly recommend
you get a microphone of some kind it can
be for your camera or for your computer
but if it's for your computer try to
have the microphone as close to you as
possible if you can have the microphone
as close to you as possible without
being in the shot at the camera unless
of course you don't mind it being there
then in which case all the power Turia
if you're stuck using the cameras
internal microphone and try to be as
close to the camera as possible without
being too close for comfort this level
is acceptable this is a little bit
creepy but the audio will be a lot
better well that's it for my basic sound
guide in the next one I'm gonna go more
in depth and show you guys what you can
do in post production to sync up the
audio with your camera and make yourself
sound more epic and manly by doing audio
enhancements that doesn't sound very
manly manly I don't have a very manly
voice I really hope you guys found this
video helpful and I'll see you guys in
the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
