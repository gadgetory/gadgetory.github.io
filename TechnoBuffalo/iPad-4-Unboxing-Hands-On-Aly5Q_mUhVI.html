TechnoBuffalo here with an unboxing of
the latest generation iPad the fourth
it's either the new new iPad 4th
generation late 2012 whatever you want
to call it it is still brand new it
brings a lightning connector faster
graphics performance and a few other
goodies under it's exactly the same
looking as the new iPad shell let's go
ahead dig in see what's worth the
upgrade alright so here is the
fourth-generation iPad the new new iPad
we've got it all dolled up here in 16
gigabytes of configuration it's gonna
run through to 16 to 64 and Wi-Fi or 4G
flavors now Sprint's has joined in on
the party prices are gonna range from
$4.99 all the way up to a pretty beefy
830 bucks let's go ahead and open this
guy up we'll use our TechnoBuffalo knife
and maybe the big ol obligatory emboss a
knife I'm making a comeback pretty soon
I'll go ahead and cut all the plastic
here alright so the plastic is all cut
let's go ahead and take off the top Hey
alright so here is the fourth-generation
iPad looking and feeling exactly like
the third-generation iPad push it off
the side for just a moment what are we
gonna get inside of the box of goodies
designed by Apple in California there is
the lightning cable we've got some
getting started guide and a couple pairs
of Apple stickers or one pair of Apple
stickers and a new charging brick for
charging up your iPad muddy fast alright
so here is the new fourth-generation
iPad go ahead and peel this off now you
should get about weight you should get
about twice of performance graphics and
video is versus the last generation so
while most of the improvements are
internal you should see a lot of
improvement specially if you're a heavy
gamer on your iPad or if you do a lot of
video rendering or exporting using
iMovie or another video editing piece of
software alright so here we are running
of course iOS 6 let's talk about the
dimensions we are looking at 9.5 inches
by it 7.31 inches
by seven five point seven three inches
and it weighs one point four four pounds
the screen is now a very familiar nine
point seven inch screen that's an IPS
technology built in at the resolution of
2048 by 1536 it's gonna give you 264 PPI
powering this is a forty two point five
watt hour battery our Chapel says is
going to give you ten hours of use so
let's get to the new stuff it's got a
1.4 gigahertz dual core a 6 X chip with
quad core graphics so it should be a
screamer
a Giga RAM in here as well of course
we'll be playing games and benchmarking
it let you know how it fares in our full
review again internal storage is gonna
range from 16 32 or 64 it has two iSight
cameras first one who lives right there
it's a 5 megapixel camera your 1080p
video we've got a FaceTime HD camera
living it right up front
1.2 megapixels it can shoot 720p and
again if you want to get a LTE version
coming out in just a few weeks LTE will
be on AT&amp;amp;T Verizon or now Sprint got
Bluetooth and no NFC and available in
black or white
we've got a new lightning connector down
there on the bottom got a mono speaker
on the left-hand side we got nothing on
the right-hand side volume rocker up or
down and a profile switch if you do pick
up a 4G version it's gonna use a micro
SIM not a nano SIM like the iPad Mini or
the iPhone 5 is gonna be let's go ahead
power this guy on and take a first look
alright so we've got this guy all
powered up and ready to be used and the
big differences you're gonna notice so
when you play games or do any sort of
video exporting which we will absolutely
test before all for review but right now
things look blazing fast as really all
generation iPads have I really no not
noticed any iPad being slow but the same
thing here as well with the fork
generation very quick it's going to be
very familiar for you have used any sort
of Apple product so look for our full
review in the coming days to let you
know if this is a worthwhile upgrade
worthwhile purchase or whether not you
should skip it
or run to the Apple store to get it
let's do some quick comparisons here is
the left variant darisha iPad which was
called the new iPad but those guys
by side third generation versus forth
pretty similar there as well a few
differences now let's bring in the iPad
Mini just for a family portrait here you
see the difference in size quite a bit
and see the difference in thickness as
well alright so be sure to check us out
