camera just so you know what time of day
it is in Sun conditions it's about 11
o'clock in Southern California
I've got direct sunlight pretty much all
natural light so we're gonna go and do a
quick test here of the digital video
stabilization I'm gonna go ahead and
hold my phone up so you can see mark
actually jumping to see what it looks
like while he's doing this see what
digital image stabilization looks like
and whether or not it works or doesn't
work or distort the image can also get a
sense of the internal mic is gonna sound
like on the iPhone 6 so there's what the
jumpring will look like if you're on a
bike big deals been made about digital
versus optical image stabilization we're
gonna head and go on over here we can do
some tests of the focus to see how the
focus pixels are going to work on the
video side of course you'll have still
images that are gonna go up on the side
as well and we did the same video with
the iPhone 6 plus so check that out of
course a TechnoBuffalo comm so Mark's
gonna bring the phone down here I'm
gonna count the three he's gonna move it
and on three he's gonna tap two out of
focus one two three try that again one
two three one two three so you can see
what the auto focus is going to look
like on the device again of course we're
gonna have a ton of coverage on both of
the iPhone 6s the 6 and the 6 plus on
TechnoBuffalo comm check us out on this
footage I should say is going to go
straight to YouTube so I can go through
any editing or any compression all the
pressure that's gonna happen is what
YouTube is going to do directly but it's
not gonna go through premiere or final
cut or anything like that it's not gonna
get sent over Google Drive or you know
any sort of compression engine so you
can see exactly the phone footage from
the phone is going to look like hope you
guys enjoy it
John render its a next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
