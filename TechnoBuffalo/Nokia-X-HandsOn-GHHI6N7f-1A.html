Hazleton from technobuffalo we're here
checking out the nokia X one of the
company's first android phones it
actually announced the X the X plus any
XL and so the X here is similar the X
plus and that they look the same but so
much is the hardware's a little
different DX plus has a bit more storage
and an rim and here you're looking at
them about the gig of available space
there that on the phone itself another
gig so not much but in added a memory
card in any case the interface you're
probably interested and what Microsoft
are actually Stephen Elop with Nokia was
saying is that the goal here is to bring
Microsoft's apps to Android users you're
getting gear maps you can see there's a
lot of android games already installed
they're going to bring one drive with 10
gigs of storage one month of free skype
and then also you have access to this
you're probably not going to get to the
store but it has its own Nokia Store but
you can also sighs load android apps
most of them should work right away but
you're not going to get google play
services so no gmail right out of the
box or google play store anything like
that let's quickly go through some of
the software here there's the dialer
if you have a contact list
there's the keyboard not too bad
I feel it feels really basic I know it's
running Android it's going to come in an
entry-level price point but doesn't feel
very advanced at all i do love the color
the on the back is simple camera they
didn't reveal the megapixels on stage
and I don't have a spec sheet here but
we'll let you know more about that in a
sec 3.5 millimeter headphone jack up top
micro USB charging on the bottom volume
controls on the right in addition to
power and then of course Nokia's camera
application it's not a pure view cam you
can see it's in focus they're pretty
simple at a whole lot of controls but
you can get into iso and noise reduction
in face detection all kinds of stuff a
sort an entry-level price point not to
bad mix musics included here mixed radio
and FM radios on there let's check out
the calendar
pretty simple come in all off looks like
they've taught us on an opera browser
and then a universal search up top there
and if you notice those icons that's a
dual-sim option so in a lot of countries
where two people might share a phone or
using a phone for work in play that's a
good option also you have the Wi-Fi
Bluetooth quick settings here put it in
silent but otherwise pretty really
compelling device I really love the
color I think I'm more attractive cxl
right now just as got the larger 5-inch
screen 5 megapixel cameras left but
anyway this is the nokia X from anyway
this is the nokia X and this is Todd
