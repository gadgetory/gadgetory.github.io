to you by the all-new G flex 2 from LG
life's good what's up everyone john
renter from TechnoBuffalo here we're at
CES 2015 at the Panasonic booth and
what's behind me it's something that I
have not yet seen in person and
something I am ridiculously stupid
excited about this is the follow-up to
Tesla's crazy popular model s this is
the crossover SUV the Model X it's going
to take a look so the first question you
probably think of yourself and I know I
did is first of all I haven't seen a
Model X yet at all they're not yet
release it's a pre-production model but
why is it Panasonic it's at Panasonic
because they are partnering with Tesla
on their upcoming Giga Factory is gonna
make just a ridiculous kind of batteries
so this guy right here
futuristic thinks about it first
hundreds in pure electric of course like
the Model S but dem doors doe those are
what Tesla is calling Falcon wing doors
and they freaking open up they're not
like the lambo doors that you might have
seen or doors on older Mercedes like the
goal wing doors these doors Tesla claims
can open in any space anywhere you can
open a normal door these can open
they've got a really unique multiple
hinges on them so they actually go up
and then out to go over the car
so why you might you want that I got a
baby at home I'm trying to get that kid
in that of a car seat is an effort in
doing this and doing this while picking
up a 30 pound kid freakin hurt your back
this you can stand up and get access to
that second even third row without
having to have bend forward so it means
that I probably don't have to consider a
minivan after like kid number two which
would make me ridiculously excited
you've enough room in here to go I guess
kind of off-roading with six of your
friends this is a seven seater with a
full third row and they're actually
normal-sized seats for swimming or not
eight feet tall people in the back of
course this is electric so it's usually
pretty fast electric cars much like
electric grills when you sort of push
that trigger they've got the instant
torch they go full
need right away normal cars have a power
curve this just has a line it just kind
of goes up I'm sort of one rpm you're
getting maximum torque this guy will be
faster than a stock 911 when options up
it's coming with all-wheel-drive access
to Tesla supercharger which means you
can recharge this car up to 80% in 20
minutes for the grand total of zero
dollars you've got the same front in the
front it's a front trunk trunk that you
have in the Model S the underpinnings
here are all Model S but of course it's
been sort of lifted up and widened a
little bit I guess kind of like a good
bra to make this thing sort of look more
SUV ish so other highlights of the car
things Tesla are known for of course at
21 inch touch panel inside on Tesla
announced with their p85d when they
announced that car they also always
gonna be autonomous driving capable
you're calling it autopilot
this thing will have the ability and
cars already on the road have this
ability as soon as government sends off
they could turn it on to kind of drive
themselves if you're on the freeway you
can let it drive itself put on the turn
signal to change lanes for you it'll get
off the freeway for you they even make
turns for you which is both creepy and
often of course the X hits the road I
love those same features what you're
seeing right now might change a little
bit from what you see the production car
which is supposed to go into production
middle of 2015 but my guess does it look
pretty similar to this this is what
they're calling sort of their third beta
of the car we saw alphas we actually at
the announcement way announced this car
anyway just basking it it is absolutely
gorgeous to see I have not yet not yet
seen those doors in person and it is
really really cool
I don't know how they're gonna work in X
to close your car though of course like
I said that's what claims we'll be able
to get in and out line and the other
doors that seems hard to believe
especially if you're parked next to like
a giant lifted you know Escalade on dubs
but you know I trust tests left their
cars one crazy amount of awards they the
first unanimous Motor Trend Car of the
Year the Model S they're all five-star
crash rating they think that companies
there's a little bit of the benefit the
doubt and I'm going to give it to them
thing just looks absolutely
incredible all done up in white so what
do you guys think are you excited about
the Model X do not excite about the
Model X we don't know pricing yet Tesla
is taking reservations for it for the
first batch has already sold out of
Signature Series but it will start hit
the road in 2015 I won't hear your
thoughts on up we give the comments down
below
until next time I'm John rented from
TechnoBuffalo and I am definitely gonna
go geek out over this car behind me
