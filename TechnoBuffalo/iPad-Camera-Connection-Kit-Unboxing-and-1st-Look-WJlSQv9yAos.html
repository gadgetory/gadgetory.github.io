technobuffalo here with an unboxing of
the very hard to find iPad camera
connection kit so this little guy is
very very hard to find for whatever
reason f was retail store generating
listed is backordered for upwards of
three weeks I happened to be in a local
apple store and they had them in soft so
I grabbed one of those you that follow
me regularly you may know that I am
getting married and I wanted something
to take with me where I could upload
photos from my honeymoon and send them
to family and friends that having to
bring my whole laptop with me let's open
that something like this ipad connection
kit could be perfect so it's going to
set you back about 30 bucks let's go
ahead and dig in sort of very a regular
apple packaging same thing that dock
connectors come in and such go ahead and
peel off that classic i'm also going to
do a demonstration here to show you how
it works and also see if it works with
an iphone 4 i know there are many other
uses with this especially if you have a
jailbroken ipad mine is not jailbroken
this is actually harder to dig into than
I thought gotta really use your nail to
get in there there you go pull that back
there we go alright so now let's
probably dig into the package we've got
some documentation and then there is the
camera kick you could itself there
actually are two of them I want to take
a look at you can see how they work push
it off to the side go ahead and dig on
in and it is very simple dongles so are
the funny word one of them actually has
a USB port and supposedly this can
unlock many other uses as well but the
30 pin connection USB and the other
let's see what the other ones
looks like a way to put in a SD card
which is kind of handy as well depending
on what sort of camera you have let's go
ahead and do a demonstration see how
this works so I do have my iPad nice and
handy right here here is my camera it is
the sony nex-5 i'm going to go ahead and
try the USB first let's see how it works
the nex-5 actually does have an Etsy
card so if the USB doesn't work we can
go ahead and try the SD method as well
so go ahead and plug it in there we go
plug the other end into the camera
connection kit using the USB part of it
alright and I'm gonna plug it into the
iPad turn the camera on and let's see
what happens so it looks like you
probably have to go to the mode on your
camera where you look at to view
pictures so I'll go ahead and try that
there's no external power anything
needed here and let's see if this works
so far nothing appears to be happening
dressin see if anything happened here on
the screen right now oh there goes looks
like it's now going to start importing
the pictures i'm going to cover my hand
over this they got some personal
pictures on there i will move out of the
way but it is actually showing all the
pictures that we have here actually you
can see some of the test shots that i've
got here actually nothing really
personal there we've got pictures of my
niece and stuff like that you can select
what you want to import and it just
seems to work actually very well so i
can go ahead and see if i can select one
or two of them i'm going to select what
you want and just hit import and that is
it and it just works so let's go ahead
and see if this works on an iphone 4
i'll light out
will it seems like it'd be something
that might be worth a shot let go ahead
and close this unplug it and let's try
the iphone 4 and see if we have any luck
and I get a lot of questions about the
background that I use on these devices
actually posted it on technobuffalo go
and take a look when we get a big
success rate is not supported by the
iphone so if you're hoping to use this
on a non jailbroken iphone you are going
to be out of luck so this is really all
you need to employ your pictures upload
a spook send them to friends order if
you'd like from your digital camera i am
jon rettinger from technobuffalo i'll
see you the next video bye bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
