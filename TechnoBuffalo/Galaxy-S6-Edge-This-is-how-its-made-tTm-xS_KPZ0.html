isn't in from TechnoBuffalo we just had
a chance to see some of the components
here that are used in the galaxy s6 edge
I want to walk you through them that
starts with the firt the first part it's
a glass panel for the front of the
device here you can see it's slightly
ever so slightly curved at the edges
this is told hourglass 4 so super strong
and obviously super wise - yeah but
that's that and then here is the metal a
unibody part that's actually using the
device it's super super light aluminum
and I'm not allowed to see here but you
can see the edges are those that are
visible on the device itself so up top
you can see this image right where the
IR blaster is on the bottom 3.5
millimeter headphone jack and the
microUSB port and the new speaker work
so interesting they're super light and
then this is the back panel also glass
will last for it does get fingerprinted
kinda we saw but you can see it's again
super light and thin and we liked it
same some stitching plastic for the
glass on here and now I'm moving down
you'll see the different colors that are
being used here again see the edge will
come in a bluish color silver black
green and white version obviously so
that's just a sample here and then on
the final and here we have the new
modules so this is the 5 megapixel front
facing camera module Samsung's including
in the device and then you also have 16
megapixel camera module on the back of
the device and all the improvements here
on the software side as well as on the
hardware so we should see some of the
best pictures from a galaxy device ever
and we're excited to test it out in the
future but anyway quick look at
components here for the galaxy s6 edge
and studies</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
