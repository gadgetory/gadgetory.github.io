playing with phones for a living but at
my core I am a geek who just loves
mobile technology and I cannot wait for
what's next and the folks at one plus
they're keeping the 1 plus 5 under wraps
and it hasn't leaked yet we've heard
conflicting reports of where cameras are
going to be and I want the phone's going
to look like so I took matters into my
own hands sort of somebody else's hands
I commissioned Ben Gaskin to do some
mock-ups based on what we think the 1+5
is going to look like there's a lot of
conflicting reports those are official
renders it aren't based on any CAD
drawing it just based on the rumors that
we've heard and what we think it could
potentially look like so they say a
little bit about the 1+5 let me start
with why it's not called the 1+4 evently
the number four is unlucky in Chinese
because it sounds very similar to the
word death so consider like the three
Chi the one plus four and they are going
straight to the one plus five so a lot
of things it could be it could be the
ultimate flagship killer at an awesome
price which probably will because one
plug has a history of doing that there's
been some rumors that have leaked out
and things we think are true so here's a
spec sheet I think we can expect with
the one plus five first eight gigs of
RAM we've seen some about screens as if
shown eight gigs has been some
conflicting reports of it being six
eight gigs and make a statement eight
gigs would be over what Samsung's
offering eight gigs early beyond what
anybody else is offering that would be a
statement that we got in the drop that's
kind of exciting thing that oneplus
likes to do Snapdragon 835 that one you
could you could take it to the bank
powerful chip really good for battery it
should be powering to one plus five also
it's kind of storage 128 gigabyte should
be on board you can also expect a pretty
giant 5.5 inch 2k screen on the back we
ran into some trouble we're doing the
renders your very clicking reports
that's the dual 12 megapixel sensors be
horizontal or vertical
so we mocked it up a bunch of different
ways I thought that mocking them up
vertically just looks better but isn't
based on the insider information I just
like the way that looks so this is what
it could look like with those dual coil
megapixel sensors should also be eight
megapixel one up on the front we also
seen some Geekbench scores start to leak
out the one plus five I saw a single
core score of one thousand nine sixty
three and a multi-core score of an
insane six thousand six hundred and
eighty seven just for a baseline
comparison the galaxy si plus is six
thousand three hundred and seventy five
or thereabout so I think should be an
absolute screamer of a phone figure
price this going to have like a sampling
badge on at LG HTC one of the other
manufacturers it expect probably like a
thousand dollars plus the rumors are
picking this phone to cost about four
hundred and forty nine dollars which is
crazy I don't know what wizardry and
Voodoo Carl paying company I had to cut
or whether or not it's made with unicorn
and baby tears to get it to that price
uh but that is the alleged price of this
powerhouse girls ought to be fun to mock
it up it's in different colors so
they're just some random colors we threw
in there to get rid of look like you
don't know when it's going to come in
for every ports as early as June would
you know sometime this summer so I'm
hoping on the earlier side of summer not
so later so just as a fans who had had
connections to try and get these renders
made been guests ended naturally
incredible jobs sort of making these
renders what do you I think if this is
the one plus five is it the phone that
you guys would pick up you guys like the
way the one post live looks in our
renders you think it's what's actually
going to look like and if it is what you
guys think if phone's going to look like
let us know in the comments down below
and there's something new for us sort of
commissioning renders you guys like this
idea and you want to see us do more for
upcoming flagships or even smaller brand
give you a thumbs up to let us know
until next time I'm John render from
