to you by netflix welcome back to their
episode of ask the Buffalo we got a new
angle and new questions for you is the
show where you can ask me jon rettinger
any question you've got from the wide
world of technology and sometimes a
little bit outside up this week we're
talk a little bit about my personal life
what devices i am looking forward to the
most what is up with HTC One and
Facebook home and all kinds of other
tech goodness in one Tanek condensed
episode this has to Buffalo let's go to
get started so the first questions go
from Josh hey Jonah when your work day
is done and you go home do you watch
your own videos or just respond to
comments so the YouTube comments saying
I got a love-hate relationship with it
sometimes the comments can make you
super sad Internet can be a very mean
harsh place things can be along the
lines up I hate your voice your voice
too high your voice is too low your face
looks like it smells once every two
months I'll say you know what that's it
I'm not reading comments anymore and it
lasts for about a day then to the day
though I really like our audience and I
really like the people that watch the
videos they're there just a few bad
apples so Josh I do go home I do read
the comments and did respond to comments
we have so many videos up we have
thousands of videos usually only look at
the past two or three from that day or
the previous day and respond to things
but all the responses and they're always
for me I love to interact up to say hi
and it's great way to talk to folks who
support YouTube support technobuffalo so
if that helped answer question damage
once asked hi John what are you excited
about most this year and gave me options
iOS 7 iphone 5s android key lime pie
galaxy note 3 it's a tough one I'm
excited about all of them the Galaxy
Note line of phones have always had a
very soft spot of my heart just for
their freakishly large screen I think
it's more of a novelty and I'd love to
them I loved original Galaxy Note I
loved the original Galaxy Note 2 and I'm
guessing they're probably going to date
the Galaxy Note 3 in the iphones are
always exciting devices their big annual
events that come with a lot of fanfare
and excitement like the 5s are gonna uh
sure in iOS that wench is gonna be
absolutely tremendous but for me what I
am most excited about is key lime pie
I'm hearing
rumours that Google's got some crazy
awesomeness up their sleeve for android
5.0 I think we're going to see it in
just a few short weeks at Google i/o
we're hearing crazy things that there
might be entirely new way to interact
with chat messages maybe it's gonna look
like chat heads on Facebook home or full
support native OS for up to octa core
chips the nerd in me it's gotta be key
lime pie I can't wait plus it's tasty
fernando rider is asking what cell phone
plan carrier do you use if Eddie for
your personal phone so I've got my own
personal plan we actually have a company
account with AT&amp;amp;T and my phone line is
on that the phone that i'm using right
now is the HTC one hand down my favorite
phone of the year so this is my daily
Java right now because we test so many
phones you should my daily driver gets
cycled out for something different I
want to make sure that every phone i
used gets a chance to be that daily
driver q can learn so much about a phone
we actually use it you know if you're
just sitting there reviewing a phone you
might not know how it works it takes a
Bluetooth you might not know how it
functions when you get to messages at
once things that you just wouldn't know
if you don't use it regularly so it
switches out but right now when I'm not
reviewing a device HTC One is in my
pocket a neurotic wants to ask at John
for lakers after unboxing HTC first you
think facebook home will last long and
something people actually like and
actually use so that's a good question
I've just started my review process here
on the HTC first the honest answer is
i'm not sure i'm not confident yet and
using it to know whether or not folks
are going to want to use this as their
daily phone so by the time you guys
watch this video it'll be a filmed a few
days before you actually watch it so
perhaps i will have a different opinion
but i will say my first blush chat heads
is pretty awesome i really like to be
integrated with the coolest things about
the HTC first you can totally turn off
facebook home and get stock android and
still use chat head so from that
standpoint I think people are gonna pick
this up I think if you want to the nexus
s experience on AT&amp;amp;T and for 99 bucks
it's pretty sweet deal move that up and
your question so we take a minute for
