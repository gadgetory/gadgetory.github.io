welcome back to another episode of rumor
roundup this is the show where we round
up all the rumors from the wide world of
technology up this week we've got rumors
swirl another $99 Nexus 7 we've got
widescreen iPads is the HTC One X 5
actually the Nexus 5 and is the macbook
air and macbook pro going on a diet and
getting even thinner this is rumor
roundup let's go and get started
widescreen iPad is coming according to
analyst paul mueller exciting three
sources inside of apple that's saying a
wide screen ipad is on the way and is
not talking about the upcoming ipad mini
the iphone 5 just went pretty much 16 by
9 and the ipad is still four by three
the examiner as well as also had sources
inside of app will confirm what Mueller
has been reporting I was a huge
proponent of the iphone going wide
screen I've used widescreen tablets and
i actually prefer the four by three
aspect ratio on the ipad over some of
the wide screen options outside think
it's bad but personal preference i like
the way it feels in the hand so what do
you guys think could have possibly ipad
4 or newer ipad go widescreen that make
the size actually go from nine point
seven ish to 10.1 would you like a
longer iPad or did you like the size
that rat right now would you think the
iPad Mini is actually going to be wise
for that'll be interesting to see I love
to hear what you guys think about it I
do think though that we are going to see
why screen depending on what Apple's got
in the lineup but definitely widescreen
is going to be coming it's a wave of the
future black bars be gone time for
widescreen so one of my favorite tablets
of the past year was the Nexus 7 I love
the way it worked i love the simplicity
of it and i love the size looks like
it's going to get even better 199 price
point is going to shave off the one at
the beginning according to digit times
we've got a $99 version of the nexus 7
coming before the holidays they're
saying that actually an updated version
Nexus 7 is going to be coming it'll be
thinner have a smaller bezel depending
on different sizes will have one that's
going to keep the same price point at
199 probably larger storage
shin and one that's going to come in at
99 bucks which would absolutely fly off
the shelves and then dollars put them in
competition with some really low end
products but the awesomeness of tegra3
coupled with jelly bean would make that
thing absolutely fly I could pick up a
$99 nexus 7 that we might go to holiday
gift for everybody i know that tablet
was absolutely awesome I 99 bucks would
really get to that impulse buy price
point I think they would sell between
one and one point five bajillion so much
like supermodels thin is in according to
I fix it the macbook air and macbook pro
models are getting even thinner not by
much but definitely a little bit so
rumor has them going from point four
millimeters in the display at they are
right now 2.25 millimeters not much what
that's going to do is prevent keyboard
marketers showing up on the screen if
you use an apple laptop you know you
open it up you see all kinds of grids
from your keyboard now but don't like
that not going to be a giant noticeable
difference and I'll probably be a very
quiet update it's not going to come with
a huge keynote but it's nice to see the
already thin macbook air and they
already very thin macbook pro retina
display getting even thinner are you
