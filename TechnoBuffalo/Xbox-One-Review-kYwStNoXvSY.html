techno Balu here it's a full review for
you of Microsoft's latest the Xbox one
they've been years of hype and rumors in
the console is now a reality can be
picked up by you in store but should you
buy it
stick around let's answer that question
and make in the videos I do with all my
reviews with a big fat disclaimer I'm
using this console since launch day
these reviews and videos usually really
difficult to do since the systems are
constantly evolving think about how the
Xbox 360 was when it launched almost
eight years ago and what the 360 of
today is both hardware and software look
like totally different so this won't be
the definitive Xbox one review for the
whole life of the console we're actually
gonna update this review and every one
of the new generation of systems each
year on their launch anniversaries don't
have to keep talking about potential or
what might be coming down the road so
ahead of gaming Julie Davidson our
gaming editor Eric Fredrickson did a
really thorough written review which
gets much more granular than going to
today they and I Gifford on some things
which I'll call out the video link
that's gonna be down below if you want
to see everything they had to say
including galleries and images so that
said let's review the Xbox one as it
exists at launch let me get this one out
of the way and touch briefly on its
design it's huge it looks more like it
be home next to a computer monitor than
a television set Microsoft wasn't going
for industrial design Awards here at all
its function over form very clearly they
definitely didn't want to repeat it 360s
red ring of death so they allowed for a
ton of extra airflow and a gargantuan
size fan one thing they didn't put room
for that mammoth body that was a power
supply which in all candor seems absurd
I understand the argument that you won't
see after it's plugged in and having an
extra reduces heat but it's still an
incredible eyesore I'd wager that we'd
seen Xbox one slim version very very
soon so that aside it's a fine looking
console I do like the glowing Xbox logos
there's a touch sensitive button once
you find a spot for it though I guess it
just looks fine sitting there Microsoft
announced the one the Kinect was touted
as being the killer must have feature
the console in reality again its launch
formed kind of a mixed bag Ashley and I
filmed to demo the Kinect on launch day
notice it had a really hard time
recognizing her commands comments on the
video claimed her cadence was off or he
didn't space out the requests far enough
or the room wasn't quiet enough it's a
lot of excuses from something that
Microsoft
claimed she's just supposed to work with
normal conversation and it didn't just
work up with a success rate even after
calibration at around fifty to sixty
percent the biggest culprit of the miss
commands we found was background ambient
noise in a quiet room it was way better
but for console that's supposed to be
the center of a family room you're gonna
have a lot of trouble if your family is
anything like mine they don't just sit
there quietly especially with a newborn
at home this is one huge reason when we
take me second look at a console in a
year I assume most of the issues I'm
having our software base and hopefully
can be fixed voice commands aside though
it's crazy with the Kinect can do
measure heart rate muscle tension and
generally creeped me out I was saying
everything I have to say the coolest use
of the Kinect though was definitely
Skype it digitally zooms in and out
people when they come into a
conversation and it's just really kind
of neat if you have two people come in
it'll zoom out to both they're in frame
I just worked really well and was just
kind of cool to see on a giant
television set
speaking of Skype though you're going to
snap a Skype call while playing a game
so you can see a friend tear up you're
beating them let's say Madden or sneaked
up behind them as you're stabbing in the
back the knife and call up duty that's
not there yet which is one of things
that you're looking forward to but
Microsoft did say it's coming so I know
I'm probably the minority but for me
that Kinect adds a very little to
overall gaming experience I don't have a
good place to put it if my TV's mounted
on a wall and it's still really weirds
me out that's always listening honestly
I probably been unplugged and just plug
it in when I can play a game most
importantly for me that with a console
is game it's hard to evaluate what games
are going to look like based on the
launch lineup but if a game like rise
any indication that consoles graphic
prowess it's going to be gorgeous at
least initially the extra power of the
Xbox one versus the 360 is really
visible and textures background in the
face of the characters not to mention I
shared pictures of crash cars and fours
on Facebook that people thought were
actually real for games the future is
really really bright to play those games
though you'll of course need the new
controller I was a huge fan of 360s
controller and have gone on the record
saying that's why I preferred 360 over
the last generation of competition the
one controller is definitely iterative
and I totally don't blame Microsoft at
all if any broke don't fix it it's kind
of like BMW 3-series
change it just enough to make it new but
don't alter it makes it great
Joey however disagreed with me here but
I really like the controller leave
trigger buttons feel really solid I like
to color letters on black backgrounds
now for the buttons and
d-pad is improved but still not perfect
I will say though when I hold it
especially after a few hours a gameplay
controller starts to slip through my
hands especially around the palms but
again it could just be my sweaty sweaty
mitts I do like the battery compartment
it's now flush but double-a batteries
come on Microsoft don't make me buy
another accessory to charge my
controller having that said that though
the battery life is pretty awesome the
controller but you're going to have to
guess when the double are going to dies
and if you can't check your status
anywhere in the system the UI clearly
took a page from the modern interface on
Windows 8 and Windows Phone and they're
both based on live tiles which is
supposed to give you quick access and
see information just very quickly at a
glance I get how they work and I see
their places on desktop and mobile but
on a console there really isn't
information to show they're just really
large icons pitting tiles is neat and
snapping apps is surprisingly handy but
the UI to me felt cluttered and at times
really confusing I did like the NFL and
fantasy football integration and I
assume more apps will come to the
surface get it Microsoft clearly wants
us to be more into getting the machine
there after all it's called the one
could supposed to be the device for all
your home needs the problem though for
me is I have other shaping devices for
Netflix Hulu movies and television
I will admit though none of them have a
TV integration the Xbox has which is
pretty cool and cover more in depth than
the written portion which again link
down below if I didn't already have all
these other components Xbox want to be
pretty perfect after all one device for
all my gaming video needs done the issue
though is that I do chances are you
probably do too really am I can go to my
console take advantage of everything it
can do at all
maybe it's due to laziness just force of
habit but I just don't do it for me the
Xbox is used as a gaming machine and
that's not likely to change in that
regard though it's definitely a huge
success but at $100 more in a
competition and factoring in the current
inaccuracies of Kinect it's a
questionable value unless the law of
exclusives like Halo and Gears of work
calling her name I would have loved to
have seen a larger hard drive since the
ones is not user replaceable though
Microsoft did say external hard drive
support is coming but as a packaged Xbox
one is not about value chances are you
already know if you're going to buy one
or if you're one of the people who are
on the fence the value vs. the
competition comes down to Kinect will
you use it are you confident it will
improve if the answers to both those are
yes and jump in with both feet if no
then you might want to consider less
expensive alternative thank you guys for
watching our full review of the Xbox one
as I mentioned at the beginning we're
gonna be update
