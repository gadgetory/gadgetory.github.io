car of CES I'm Aaron Baker from
TechnoBuffalo and make no doubt about it
there's room in the market for a third
and even fourth mobile OS we've got
Windows Phone coming in in third place
that we've got kind of a competitive
battle between blackberry and then a
bunt too as well which was kind of
showing off a couple of days ago
admittedly I was traveling and actually
a work in Irvine so I didn't get a
chance to catch up on it as much as I'd
like to but I'll tell you one thing is
for sure there's room for it a lot of
different opportunities for mobile
operating systems let's take a look and
see what makes it great as opposed to
some of the other OS is on the market we
receive ones running on the phone it
basically the same 1/2 as running on
desktop or TV just with a new interface
with the optimized for the phone we see
over here basically is this the welcome
screen there's a visualization of your
personal data in a really nice way it
gives a very personal touch to your
phone
because it will be a physician unique to
everybody the other important thing is
we see over here is the no buttons and
no hockey burns and no sofa Cubans and
the reason is that the whole experience
is designed around the edges so the user
will interact with the edges and it
gives very fast natural way to interact
on the phone when I would use the left
edge you see that there's launcher with
my most favorite apps or we for example
notice was that people I use a selection
of apps most frequently and they can put
it in the launcher over here so for
example one this is the home button I
can basically go to the home screen this
is the home screen obviously my
frequently used apps my last call's
awesome content then I'm interested in
when I go left I see my people and it's
aggregated a few of my contacts and
facebook contacts over here my music
also music I can buy and when I go to
the other direction it's bad for running
apps my Frigga use apps installed apps
and also over here I have my videos and
also videos I can buy or download
basically over here in launcher you see
that we both have web apps which is for
example Facebook is web app it uses all
core components of the operation stem as
well
the advantage of a Bunter is that its
uses the advances of having all the web
apps are possible in a very integrated
way but also we can run native apps
there's the gallery app and what you see
over here is that we focus the free
on the content rather than on the
controls in order to interact with the
content so when I start strolling you
see that the header goes away as when I
scroll back the headers there again I
can change the view another thing that
we saw basically was that sometimes when
users are using apps they want to change
the setting we have a very new and very
easy way to change settings so then for
the top edge jaws so over here I drag
down and I can swipe left and right in
me basically immediately go to settings
menu so for example I can go to battery
over here slide back up and I'm back in
my app again or for example we also have
messages here I got some messages I can
reply immediately opening a picture over
here again the full screen dedicated to
the photo and when I want to do
something with a photo I use the bottom
edge for that the bottom edge brings in
control so I can for example edit or I
can for example share order Oh obviously
go back last as writer especially for
switching between apps super fast I what
we saw is that people often switch
between the last 2 or 3 apps take a
picture for example I want to go back to
my previous app there you go and that's
picture it in my gallery I want to use
this bottom edge swipe the leads there
you go I want to go back to a little
previous app right music player go to
the the camera again if I want to launch
the app I can also use launcher again
that's a wonderful do in a nutshell
exactly exactly so much you're welcome
