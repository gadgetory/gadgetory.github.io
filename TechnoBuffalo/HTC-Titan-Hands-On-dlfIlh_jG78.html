boyfriend i'm here with jeff on htc
who's going to show us the brand new HTC
Titan hey guys so we just announced HTC
Titan at meetups in London Paris Berlin
and Madrid this is an awesome device
running Windows Phone 7 mango so it's
really the latest and greatest of what
HTC is bringing to Windows Phone this is
a 4.7 inch screen which you just have to
see it in person to believe it but this
is a massive screen awesome for watching
video playing games or just simply doing
productivity things like writing a word
document having the extra space for the
keyboard or tapping cells Excel that
type of thing is wvga resolution we've
also got an 8 megapixel camera on the
back with f-22
we have 1.3 megapixel camera for video
calling we've got tango video calling
software built into it so you can easily
do that 16 gigs of memory built in which
should give you ample space for taking
those photos and downloading videos and
that type of thing and and just to give
you a sense of the thin this year this
is nine point nine millimeters thin so
this is one of the thinnest Windows
Phone devices on the market right now so
really excited about that and of course
we also have a bunch of HTC software
enhancements in here too so the htc's
hub has been built out more so it gives
you your stocks your news feeds etc
trying to bring a lot of that HTC Sense
experience over from our Android devices
we also have photo enhancer which is a
lot of fun to a lot of people to use
photos with many different filters and
effects
I think that picture looks cinnamon
let's make some fun
overexposed you get the picture so
that's a lot of fun be able to easily
send that to your friends as well as HTC
locations which is much like if you're
familiar with footprints on our Android
devices locations allows you to tag your
location on big maps and unfortunately
we're in a event space right now where
it's not pulling up the exact oh there
it is it is pulling up location so there
we are near the British Museum in London
right now tagging location be able to do
sort of a virtual postcard share with
your friends that type of thing a lot of
fun it really goes along well with a lot
of the new social media integrations
that are built into Windows Phone 7
mango exclusive to page to see that's
exactly right that's exclusive HTC as
well as other things like HTC watch
built into this for downloading videos
and TV shows connected media for DLNA
support watching all those videos on
DLNA TV the notes application is unique
to HTC it's kind of a fun and still
productive thing for being able to write
notes on the keyboard you can see how
big that keyboard is so we're really
trying to type you know be super easy to
type there as opposed to a smaller
screen
and all of this comes down to HTC
providing their sort of unique finish to
the device that our customers know and
love from us so there's a lot more to
check out be sure to see the review at
TechnoBuffalo coming soon the devices
themselves will be for sale in early
October and we're super excited about it
that's the HTC Titan thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
