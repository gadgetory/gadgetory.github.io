review for you of the samsung behold for
tmobile fat the phone for a few weeks
really had a nice chance to get to use
it become familiar with the user
interface he has all my previous videos
I walked you through feature by feature
about the new TouchWiz widget interface
so if you're curious about that sure to
check the previous video so the first
thing I always mention when I review a
phone is it's got to make good phone
calls how is called quality on this call
quality on this was outstanding and not
part of any other of t-mobile's phones
it was clear no white noise at my end
and no white noise on the collars other
end that were reported I was certainly
nice the speaker is quite loud when you
have it up to year well the speakerphone
lacks a little bit of the volume that
you would like them speakerphone but
it's certainly usable reception wise
it's not as strong with other t mobile
phones I've used antenna in there may
not be as strong whereas with other t
mobile phones I got four or five bars of
3g this one I was pretty consistently
hovering around three something to keep
in mind if you're in a fringe area if
you're in strong coverage won't be a
problem for you guys at all i really
enjoy the touch widget TouchWiz
interface it's very easy to use it it's
intuitive but like the samsung instinct
do not confuse this with a smart phone
smartphone meeting something that's
fully capable of handling your emails
all your PDA functionality so calendar
to-do lists this is not that phone so
the feature phone the browser on it is
decent but it certainly subpar to rest
of the rest of the smart phones out
there even putting the ones in
t-mobile's line up email on this is just
a java-based apple it's certainly very
weak so be wary of that when you go to
purchase a device if you're looking for
a phone to just make phone calls and
texts on a very usable on-screen
keyboard this is a fantastic device for
you if you're looking for email
eccentric web browsing touchscreen
experience than you and you're on
t-mobile you may want to look at a
device
the g1 but if you're just looking for a
simple phone with some kind of cool
features the same to behold is a great
choice and one that I can certainly
recommend I've enjoyed using it I always
liked using this TouchWiz interface I
think it's fun and that's it hope you
guys enjoy and give any other questions
about the behold be sure to send them my
way and for exclusive content be sure to
follow me on twitter twitter.com / John
for lakers boom last thing that I want
to mention is battery life battery life
on this and for a touchscreen device is
actually very strong you should easily
get through two days with normal usage
without charging something that most
touch screen phone certainly lacked
especially 3G phones so definitely kudos
to Samsung we're putting a strong
battery in this device also I really
liked the proximity sensor when you put
the phone up to your head cheese can see
those little dots right there I reckon
is that it's up to your head and it
turns off the spray tan since it's a
resistive screen you're not gonna
accidentally be hitting buttons with
cheek which is a very nice future and is
it's a very good sleep looking phone so
guys this is jon rettinger again for
exclusive content following on twitter
twitter.com / john for lakers and i will
see you in the next video bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
