they're a dime a dozen nowadays we had a
new one launched at the end of March
with Samsung's bixby but is now the
start of April and the folks at Razer
have a brand new take on the assistant
meet say so
so it's sa ISO not like say so like like
your mom's say so
it stands for sidekick artificial
intelligence sensei online and this is a
legit product fun fact we are like 30
seconds from razor's headquarters here
TechnoBuffalo
they invited us over to take a look at
Sato for an exclusive first look at
their latest product so it's a robot
obviously it's got robot parts and beeps
and Boop's but it does a ton more than
that say if it doesn't want to just like
live on your phone where you got to push
a button to launch him he wants to like
legitimately be your be your buddy let's
say you want to get your gaming on and
you just you just died or you try to
snipe somebody missed they stopped going
to call you out on your like he's not
gonna hold any like robot punches much
much like a real good friend but for
doing something well you know give you
words encouragement as well and if you
want to set like the ultimate gaming
mood of course chrome was built in for
those romantic gaming sessions you'd
like to have so since you're a human and
you sleep and say so is not human Razors
made him also an alarm he's gonna kind
of roam your house and use a series of
infrared sensors cameras and radar to
make sure your fly secure and if
somebody breaks in gonna yell at you I
don't think he's gonna like shoot
electricity out of his arm but it's a
razor so you very well could by the time
this comes to market just what a tech
crammed in this thing say so features
crazy next gen AI tech that kind of
wants it to be one step ahead of what
other folks are doing its local and
cloud-based AI system is always learning
which is awesome and I guess kind of
creepy to have this like talking robot
always be getting smarter a lot of nerd
stuff in here as well say so fully
support streaming API search services
like twitch and a future DLC voice packs
they'll speak like your favorite online
personality on fingers cross for like
like a Yoda Yoda say so I could
definitely do that was I was bad Yoda
but you get the gist so I was pretty
impressed with a razor shut off but I
want to reiterate this was a real
product that we legitimately saw movie
walking and talking and it was really
cool to see and I'm kind of excited to
eat they do with future AI say so I was
going to come though with his own
charging dock on him to refuel is
necessary I'll just kind of walking so
up into that razor also despite me
asking several times didn't comments on
pre-orders or availability yet but once
it's available oh well I think I could
order a say so I could use a buddy give
me some words of encouragement so I'm
not going to lie did seem a bit fishy
that Razer is choosing to announce this
on April 1st because April 1st is in
spring and it seems more like a winner
product today without the assistance
having to live on your phone what do you
think about actually having like your
assistant go with you like a real
assistant you can make say-so go pick up
my dry-cleaning say so
go get me donut stay so give me words of
encouragement because I'm having a bad
day
whatever you want face is going to learn
to be able to do it it was kind of cool
to see I'm hoping this is gonna come to
market soon cuz and get my robot on
leave me a comment down below let me
know what you would do with say so but
keep it clean sending you guys got you
get dirty mind so we'll talk about it or
reply to comments you can we talk about
robots hopefully this doesn't become
sentient
good thing I'm taller than him</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
