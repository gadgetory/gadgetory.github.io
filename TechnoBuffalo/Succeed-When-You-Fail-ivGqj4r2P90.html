business partner I filmed the
TechnoBuffalo story and I get a ton of
questions everyone asked the Buffalo
about some of the hardships that I've
gone through trying to start a business
and some of the successes that it has I
want to not rehash how we got here but
share with you guys some of the cool
things that have happened in my life
I'll sometimes I've made in the stakes
help you guys as you look to maybe start
a business or grow so definitely one of
the coolest things I ever got to do they
got recognized your commercials the
folks at collectively who actually
sponsored this video and wants me to
sort of share some the hardships that I
had trying to bring TechnoBuffalo to
fruition I mentioned I was liberal arts
painter I know business experience we
launched the company and in 20 seconds
the website crashed miserably and
crashed ethically because I didn't know
what it took to run a business I don't
know what it took to build a website but
I could go back and tell like younger me
some advice first would be to relax but
also to do more research do more
homework any project that you want to
start any passion you feel strongly
about you do work beforehand I've also
struggled to attack some buffaloed being
a newer brand we have a pretty large or
market share in terms of page views and
subscribers but I really the biggest
vine' share so it's been hard to try and
to rectify and PR people's mind agencies
mine Tector Buffalo is a big brand in
fact here the numbers to back it up you
know we're not owned by a large public
company like AOL or Vox we are
independent but trying to get other
people to know that has always been a
struggle so it's been almost a year I
got a phone call so the folks that
collectively it's one of the biggest
agencies you know that I know that do a
lot of work with huge brands do a
commercial and for me that was kind of
the culmination of kind of work on my
part everybody here detective Buffalo
sort of do this so as commercial for the
new Spectre the superspin new copper and
gold one that was kind of nervous to do
a commercial for tech products putting
my name or reputation as well as the
products that I'd like it could
potentially backfire so I went in saying
I'll do it but ask to have kind of some
creative control of what's being said so
it's true to me answer to the audience
the collectively was cool with it and I
appreciated that so it's kind of one
time where I got to be recognized I
guess for for hard work but also the
neck
for my kind of the integrity of what
I've built here it's kind of moley tried
to do a TechnoBuffalo we tell you how
long we've received products a lot of
folks don't do that you know it might
not always be the first to get stuff out
we always try to be the best we don't
always have the fanciest graphics but I
hope that the message that we share is
something that's always worth while it
has honesty inside of it I know it's the
kind of storytelling and kind of
rambling it wasn't for product focus but
I get the question a lot about successes
and failures and for me those are two
big ones that stick out in my mind so I
kind of want to know what your success
is until you're in business and life and
family sort of one of you guys been
trying to do if you want to see HP
videos I'll link to it down below only
to everything down below check out a
link to those videos I'll leave the link
to the folks that collectively you can
check out all that stuff so you can sort
of be aware of the story I want to give
everything context and I hope you guys
enjoy it hope you can relate to
something struggle so next time job
Ranger
