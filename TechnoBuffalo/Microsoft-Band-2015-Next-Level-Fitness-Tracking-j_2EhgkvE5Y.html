Hazleton I'm checking out the brand new
Microsoft band uh it's not really called
the band - but that's what it is it's
the second band you can see it's a lot
more I want to say comfortable already
and I haven't even put it on my wrist
it's a lot more ergonomic you've got the
heart rate sensor still on the bottom
the rounded nice metal body here with
buttons
of course the face is now rounded
instead of that square - uh carrillo
class three so it won't scratch it's bad
if you remember with the original band
you were actually they recommended that
you put a plastic cover on top to
prevent scratching we've got the blacks
theme here controls are mostly the same
so you're going through cortana a sleep
mode for sleep tracking mail calendar
golf so this can actually tell you which
tee box you're on how far away each hole
is depending on the course whether it's
we're not running cycling lifting
weights so you can you can load up a
workout then hit the GM and it'll tell
you you know you got reps to do
messaging phone calls settings haven't
really checked out what looks like you
know standard Bluetooth going to
airplane mode etc will tap the buttons
here looks like it's just a no real
ambient mode I can see now one of the
new features though and I'm not sure
where it is it could be anywhere might
be on the bottom or in one of these
areas is a barometer so that will depend
on on how quickly or sorry it depends on
your altitude but what kind of workout
you're getting at various altitudes so
it's only the only bands I guess it has
that built in and it also is capable of
measuring your oxygen levels so usually
you'd have to sort of jump on a machine
to try to do that this is able to do
that much easier
I just want to show you the class - it
kind of just slides on very similar to
before and then hold the buttons to let
it go so slides ons clip it's all in
place pull the button select go so it's
a lot less bulkier than before which
looks pretty good
obviously you can customize it with
themes shows the steps and all kinds of
stuff like that right up front but any
case want to show you a quick look at
the new Microsoft band this is Todd
