Hazleton from TechnoBuffalo checking out
the brand new Moto G and whoa look at
that back there we can now customize it
with moto maker it's actually available
today starting at 179 you get a 5 inch
720p display I was kind of bummed by
that at first but then I realized with
the 24-70 milliamp hour battery under
the hood and the promise of all day
battery life you kind of need a display
like that to keep the power down
speaking of power you've got a
Snapdragon 410 processing under the hood
clocked at one point 4 gigahertz you
also have either one gig of ram and
eight gigs of storage or you get 16 gigs
of storage and two gigs of RAM of course
that will change the starting price as
you start to upgrade that stuff up front
you get a 5 megapixel camera on the top
2 3.5 millimeter headphone jack again on
the back you've got a 16 megapixel
camera with a dual LED flash and this is
actually the same camera that Motorola
used in the Nexus 6 which is pretty
compelling moving around the device and
sieved up the volume controls in the
power button and on the bottom the USB
port so otherwise it's a relatively
similar in terms of really not the most
premium device but i'm not going to
knock it it's really cool you can
customize everything and you definitely
get a really great camera or hopefully
that's what they're promising so it's
not quite at the level of the Moto X
style or the Moto X pure edition as its
called but it's also a lot more
affordable so you also get a micro sim
card slot in here and I believe microUSB
somewhere along the lines probably under
the back cover that you can I'm sorry
micro SD that you can use to expand the
storage and it says up to 32 gigabytes
but sometimes you can sneak away and get
more than that this is running on AT&amp;amp;T
but right now we haven't had any word
about carrier sales really just going to
be direct through Motorola any case want
to give you a quick look at the Moto G
and while I'm here I'll show you one
with the blue cover pretty similar
design I like that blue back there and
again you can customize it today on
motorola's website and pick one up for
yourself this is Todd Hazleton from
