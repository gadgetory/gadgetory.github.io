to you by full sail university what's up
everyone welcome back to the episode of
renter's rants everyone john wren just
to show where I get super mad red-faced
and start to sweat profusely talking
about things that make me a super cranky
pants up this week I want to talk about
this guy well not this one in particular
but the general genre i wish it lives
batteries why they suck why they can't
get better and why they are the
bottleneck holding back electronics this
is rettinger trance let's get our
ranches in a bunch so if you're watching
this video you like me probably share
some passing passion with the world
looking super electronics you love your
get if you love your gizmos you'd like
to take them on the road you like to
take them on the toilet because i know
you play Angry Birds while you are
pooping and I'm actually pointing at so
in particular him I know that you play
Angry Birds while you are pooping we use
electronics everywhere they're
ubiquitous in our lives the problem is
they die so quickly not physically like
they fall off a cliff or somehow have a
electronics heart attack they run out of
battery life when we've seen over the
past almost 10 years better technology
has stayed almost totally stagnant well
processing power has gone way way way up
so therein lies a problem we have so
much power but not enough things to
provide power to the processor so what
happens does batteries get bigger and
bigger and bigger but the efficiency of
those cells don't get any better I'm
still using almost the same battery
technology we use almost back the
original RAZR phone yet processors have
gotten single core dual core quad core
octa-core so got me back thinking about
my old gameboy days you don't know what
the game boy was I feel very very sad
for you as an awesome thing to play
Tetris and black and white Mario and I
love the thing but I can only get my
game on and maybe for about an hour and
a half before the batteries died and I
figured as a little John would you know
it's just that Big John don't you worry
chin up battery life is gonna get better
by the time you're a teenager your Game
Boy will last you for four hours and by
the time you're in high school they're
gonna last you for eight hours and by
the time you're in college to lasted for
10 hours and by time you're a
an old man you gonna be able to play
your game boy for days and days and days
and I go back to the John when he was a
little kid you'd be very disappointed
right now because things just have not
gotten better so why haven't they gotten
better widen technology improved
lithium-ion is pretty much a standard
that's used right now it's actually
proved to save Santa it seems an
electric cars primarily just stacks and
stacks and stacks of cells are what make
these cars go what makes electronics go
up they still haven't improved there are
things that are coming you got
lithium-air batteries which supposedly
going to improve efficiency but the
innovation behind battery technology has
just not been there let's not a selfish
guy I want to use my phone for 19 days
and not plug it in the very least what
can i recharge it using the Sun or some
sort of other kinetic motion while I'm
running around battery life just needs
to get better things need to last longer
and I wish I wish they would so to you
battery maker to you panasonic anybody
else considering innovating don't
innovate and faster processors they're
plenty people to do that leave that to
AMD leave that to Intel leave that to
Nvidia and Qualcomm make better
batteries put the rd technology behind
that that is so important for how we do
think that only hear me out what reduce
landfills less batteries getting thrown
away it'll reduce the charge on the grid
so it'll be less energy being used and
whether you use a clean energy or dirty
energy which really doesn't matter
wasn't it will be used some more
efficiency will happen in the world to
be smiling and that kid me can play
mario brothers and tetris for 10 12 14
hours up having to worry or in
retrospect probably having to talk to
another kid so please work on it make
things better i want better battery
technology let me exhale we take a
minute to thank our friend sponsors at
full sail university listen if you use a
smartphone or tablet you know the mobile
web development world is on fire right
now in full sail university's mobile web
development program has the answer for
you i'm pointing at you so in this
degree you learn about the both the
programming and business development
sides of mobile application development
so that you can concept deploy develop
and market application from start to
finish you'll explore advanced
programming languages visual framework
usability principles and app development
for both iOS and Android through Full
Sail University's launch box program you
also receive a macbook pro so you've got
all the tools you need to start
developing between Apple's App Store and
Google Play over 50 billion
apps have been downloaded and many many
more every day so get on the bandwagon
give it a shot this is really the next
Gold Rush of the technology era so for
more information go to full sail that
you use / TechnoBuffalo to learn more am
I wrong I might just cranky my old age
I've been accused of worse I want to
hear from you leave that in the comments
right down below in my pants region and
guys for watching their episode of
rettinger schrantz check us out at
TechnoBuffalo conflation greatest tech
news i'm jon rettinger miss the next
