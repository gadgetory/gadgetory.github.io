technobuffalo here's an unboxing for you
of the pebble steel i'm really excited
take a look at this guy was unveiled at
CES just about five weeks ago I improves
on the original pebble a tad stainless
steel and a couple of little niceties to
go ahead and open the box and see what
it's all about let's bring in the
absolutely unnecessary and gratuitous
obligatory unboxing I've seen your
stabby well go ahead and cut the plastic
and rip it off this guy is going to be
available for 249 bucks which is a
hundred dollars more than the original
pebble both these are available
side-by-sides the original pebble and
this one no difference with the internal
it's all about the externals on this go
ahead and pull up the box and there is
the pebble steel little dusty go ahead
and pull it out through a nice quality a
packed material it's cardboard but it's
got sort of a soft velvet feel to it
comes with a actual watch pillow as well
push it out to the side for just a quick
second it's what else we are going to
have inside of the box get really nice
materials here I've got another watch
Benz available in this sort of brushed
steel also there's a sort of dark black
steel available unlike the original
pebble though this band is proprietary
to pebble but they did release the plans
for it online so we should see
third-party bands coming available very
soon it's not the 208 millimeters we saw
on the original pebble we should have a
charging cable here to somewhere out of
zoom see if we keep digging in there it
is there is the charging cable for the
pebble steel push all this stuff off to
the side and let's take a quick look at
the watch peel this off to get that
satisfying whooshing noise here these
guys are shipping now but a bit of a
delay usually about three to four weeks
before they actually get to your door so
each pebble is going to come with two
bands if you get the black one will come
at the black steel but they're both
going to come with this leather band so
the big deal here at the pebble steel
supposed to be a more premium look in a
premium feel for those that are sort of
watch kind of sore still want the
SmartWatch features of the peb
so on the navigation side so I got your
same three buttons feel now they're
steel I certainly feel a little bit
better to press also some improvements
here are in the charger now it might
look the same but actually it's got a
better connection and you now have a RGB
LED to let you know when it's charging
so you can sort of see your status
otherwise you couldn't really do it on
the previous pebble you also have
Gorilla Glass 2 years so make it much
much much more durable on the screen the
Oso is pebble OS two point oh it's the
same you're going to get with the older
pebble all the apps and stuff will work
on here internally it's pretty much the
same externally that was where all the
differences are so really the matter of
whether or not you like the sort of say
more grown-up look of the pebble steel
or if you prefer for the leather straps
and sort of the customizing options that
you have with the original Pelle you can
see the two of them here side by side a
little bit heavier but it's got a really
nice way to it see if they both look
like they're let's bring in some
comparison devices let's bring in at the
qualcomm toq you can see these two guys
it's really see difference in size being
both them and here is the sony
smartwatch to both of those there's well
i've been using original pebble for a
while not actually really enjoyed it so
i'm more excited to take a look at the
pebble steel actually I ordered one on
my own this is a review unit the folks
from pebble sent us to go and put on my
wrist and see what it looks like so it
definitely has a premium look to it on
the iOS side its iOS 7 or newer whenever
new operating systems come out Android
will be coming very very soon pebble
said supporting OS two point O switch
has support for their app storm a ton of
other nice features so you can see what
the pebble steel looks like I'll sort of
put this next to it here's the original
pebble you can sort of see the
differences when they are rocking it on
your wrist it really feels nice it does
have the pebble branding on the face of
it which you might not want to advertise
for them but it is there then all your
navigation buttons are there sort of as
you'd expect on the left hand side your
one button again you are three main
buttons for navigation and I guys will
do a full review of the pebbles you'll
try different bands anything particular
you want to see let me know and of
course we'll compare it it's the
outgoing pebble as well then guys for
