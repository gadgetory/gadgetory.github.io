from TechnoBuffalo and today I have a
review for you guys of the huawei mate 9
this is the bigger badder slicker
brother of the Huawei p9 which I
reviewed a while back this phone was
created in conjunction with Lika and has
some really interesting features with
the camera the size of the battery the
skin in terms of the UI and a couple
other things that I really want to touch
on let's go ahead and get started so
first off let's get the standard stuff
out of the way in terms of design I
think this phone looks really good it's
a standard well-designed phone that we
can expect from many manufacturers today
build quality is fantastic
feels really good in the hand and that's
kind of all there is to that on the back
we have a 20 megapixel dual camera which
I will jump into in a second under which
we have a fingerprint reader the
fingerprint reader is very very fast one
of the fastest I have ever used and very
well integrated I just didn't spend any
time thinking about it which is credit
to huawei the screen which is the main
thing you're going to be looking at is a
5.9 inch 1920 by 1080 display some of
you may want a 2k display instead for me
1080p is more than good enough and this
screen looks stunning it is so so sharp
colors are super vibrant everything
looked awesome it made for a really good
viewing experience no complaints here
there's also slight curves at the edges
nothing noticeable just very very subtle
which makes swiping left and right very
pleasurable and easy for your finger
other features to touch on real quick
are Android 7.0 is here you will find it
with all your favorite features however
it will be veiled under a skin it's
emotion UI which is always skin and here
it's in its 5.0 iteration which is a
little bit lighter than previous
versions but it's still one of the
heaviest skins on the market for me I
feel very neutral about it it has some
cool features but honestly I'm not a
huge fan of the aesthetic it makes icons
big and bubbly and I just like Android
pure and unadulterated that being said
one of the cool features is app twinning
which allows you to duplicate some apps
like Facebook and have to literal
versions of it meaning you can sign in
to two separate accounts for Facebook
and have two separate icons on your
homescreen which is pretty cool if you
are living a double life with the mate 9
we have the Karen 960 processor it's an
octa-core 4 2.4 gigahertz cortex a7 t3
and
for 1.8 gigahertz cortex 853 s long
story short it's a very fast phone
pairing that with four gigs of RAM it
can handle pretty much anything you
throw at it in my usage I did not run
into any issues always bragging about
their skin doing some optimization and
making the phone faster over a longer
period of time for that we'll have to do
a long-run review to let us know in the
comments down below if you want us to
revisit this phone in a month or two
after using it now let's move on to the
two most interesting features about this
phone in my opinion the cameras and the
battery the two cameras on the back are
120 mega pixel monochrome camera and a
12 megapixel RGB camera this is where
you're going to be getting your color
rendition from both cameras RF 2.2 and
do a pretty good job but the features
that really interested me was the
shallow depth of field effect we've seen
this feature employed in several cameras
now at this point on several high-end
phones and the effect is pretty
interesting it works really well like on
most other phones when you give it time
when you really set up a shot properly
focus on the right spot when you take
the photo very quickly and keep it
moving it tends to mess up more often
than not and by mess up I don't mean
that the photo looks unusable to the
average eye most people will be like oh
that's a very nice-looking photo with
some nice blurry background and a nice
sharp image in the front but one closer
inspection you'll notice that some of
the blur isn't appropriate some of the
stuff that is closer to camera might be
completely sharp and also part of it at
the same distance might be out of focus
it's important to remember that
blurriness and bokeh comes from the
effect of something being closer or
farther away from the camera and the
maintenance isn't always do a perfect
job of figuring out how much or how
little to blur certain things in photos
when you're moving fast the small
tendency I also found is when you're
going to be in this mode which is called
wide aperture mode the photos tend to
overexpose a little bit you're white
sort of clip into highlights it works
out okay because nine times out of ten
those whites are going to be blurry and
out of focus for you so it looks kind of
nice but I wish it could retain that
detail that it does in its standard
camera mode in my usage of this phone
more often than not I ended up resorting
to the standard camera mode and getting
beautiful 20 megapixel stills and I
gotta say the standard camera mode is
fantastic the photos are super super
sharp it doesn't look artificially sharp
so you see that 20 megapixels coming
through
rooo color rendition is really good and
it does a fantastic job of exposing
photos pulling a lot of detail from the
highlights mid-range and shadows in
terms of low-light and nighttime photos
this camera is a mixed bag on one hand
you have really good low-light for noise
it does a great job of reducing noise
you get very very little grain but on
the other hand the trade-off for that is
you lose a lot of detail so photos are
nowhere near as sharp as I would like
and nowhere near as sharp as what you
get with standard daylight well-lit
photos from the same exact camera of
course this is to be expected but the
extent to which it's happening here with
the Huawei mate 9 it is a little more on
the extreme side and whilst shooting in
my day to day regular usage it seemed as
I was getting a lot of camera shake like
the OIS wasn't doing that good of a job
of keeping the lens steady I would do my
best to hold the camera still as
possible and I would still get
incredibly shaky images I would say the
OIS for photos is a little subpar
compared to some other flagship phones
out there and last but definitely not
least the battery this is something
Huawei is very proud of and they've
managed to stuff four thousand milliamp
hours worth of batteries in here and it
lasts a very long time always bragging
saying it'll last me two days it didn't
last me two days last me about a day and
a half a day and a quarter that being
said for me a phone that'll last a full
day is pretty impressive considering how
heavily I use my phone I watch a lot of
videos go on Twitter Facebook Instagram
all your standard stuff but I've my
phone on pretty much all day I'm texting
around the clock and I use the phone at
75 to 80% screen brightness as well with
fast charging a power saving mode in an
absolutely insane ultra power saving
mode the huawei mate 9 is going to be
your best friend if you have issues with
your current phone battery life and so
those are really my thoughts and
feelings on the fall way mate 9 I think
it is a great phone compared to the p9 I
think it's taken everything to the next
level in the best way possible so props
to quali for that my big issue is the
skin I'm still not a huge fan of emotion
UI even though it is better than
previous versions that being said the
hardware on this phone is so spectacular
and I'm such a big fan of it I think I
can honestly put up with emotion UI and
I think I will I'm going to be trying to
use this phone as my daily driver over
the next
full of weeks so let me know what other
covers you want to see from us and I'd
be more than happy to create it give it
a thumbs up if you like this video thank
you for watching and I'll see you guys
in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
