TechnoBuffalo here back with another
smartphone Smackdown this time we've got
two heavyweights in the cellphone world
squaring off in one corner we've got
Apple's iPhone 4 and in the other we
have Motorola's own Atrix 4G we're gonna
push these two guys head-to-head in a
six round series so let's go ahead and
let the fight begin
so the six rounds that we are going to
cover our specs apps screen speed OS and
browser now certainly there are a myriad
of other categories that I would love to
cover but unfortunate interest of time
and having this not be a 40-minute to
probably a three hour long video because
you guys know I love to talk I had to
pick the six categories that I thought
were most important to the average user
I'm not to say those other categories
aren't important you were even to me but
it had to be pared down I read the
comments and all of my smartphone
smackdowns and I always see why didn't
you cut 4x and why didn't you cover Y so
that is the reason all right so let me
also say that there are huge amount of
supporters in Apple's camp Mary huge
amount of supporters in androids camp so
everybody trying to remain as unbiased
as possible and I will try and do the
same throughout my video I use both on a
regular basis of Magni driver I've got a
huge affinity for iOS and I've got a
huge affinity for Android and I think
that I like both equally so we'll go
ahead and proceed all right so let's go
ahead and start with specs now it's
interesting to note that this is these
are definitely two phones that a lot of
consumers are cropping especially with
the iPhone floor being out all under
Verizon Atrix 4G is a brand new phone
and probably represents a paradigm shift
in the spec department of phones packing
in videos dual-core 1 gigahertz chimp
meaning it's got two cores gigahertz
each it's got a gigabyte of RAM a 1930
milliamp hour batteries while a support
for HSPA+ the iPhone on the other side
when it came out in the middle of 2010
represented one of the best spec
Department phones that was available
with Apple's own a4 system on the chip
at one gears a 1420 milliamp hour
battery and 512 megabytes of RAM
now don't let the specs fool you here
apples got a completely vertically
integrated process meaning they control
the software how the software optimizes
the hardware so they can take full
advantage of what the hard
we can do Android on the other hand is
more of a windows Ã©sta proach they
don't make the or at Google who make the
operating system does it make the
processor doesn't necessarily make the
RAM doesn't necessarily control the
manufacturers particular case made by
Motorola so oftentimes that was some
devices these specs are fully optimized
for hardware however from a completely
spec department the Atrix 4G completely
Trump's the iPhone dual core chip is uh
is a beast as we'll see as we go through
this and it really is one of the fastest
phones I've used if not the fastest
phone that I have ever tested so this
background clearly has to go to the
Atrix 4G alright next let's talk about
apps and of course we are talking about
Android market versus Apple's App Store
now this was done six months ago as I
did in other smartphones smackdowns this
rally was always a blowout in favor of
iOS
however the applications that I use most
in iOS that previously weren't in
Android now are an Android they're very
full-featured applications so I have had
no trouble at all moving seamlessly from
iOS to Android the Android Marketplace
is really coming to its own
you've got the Web Store as well now
where you can download apps online send
them right to your phone these two are
coming very very very close to parity
however in Apple's App Store there are a
bit more applications I find more useful
on a daily basis and that may be a
result of the stricter application
policy that people have to go through
and developers have to go through while
you might not agree with the policies it
definitely sets a standard for quality
of applications an Android Marketplace
there a ton of quality and applications
in there however there are a lot of
applications that wouldn't necessarily
pass if there were stringent testing so
to get to those great applications that
are in the Android Marketplace sometimes
you have to wade through something that
aren't of the highest quality now I
think when we revisit these two app
stores in about three months this is
going to be much tougher round to call
and I know this is going to be around
gonna be a subject of much debate but
when it comes to apps I think Apple
still the king and this rounds got to go
to iOS so next let's talk about what
you're going to look at on a daily basis
these are slight devices so you're going
to be looking at these screens the
screen on the iPhone 4 and we are
looking at an AT&amp;amp;T version here no SIM
card in there is a 3.5 inch Retina
display with a resolution of 960 by 640
if you look at the Atrix 4G here you've
got a 4-inch screen which Motorola is
calling qHD with the resolution of 960
by 540 so let's go ahead and look at
some of the same images on both phones
here and we can talk a little bit more
about what the picture quality looks
like so I've got a TechnoBuffalo
wallpaper here on both it's the exact
same image from exactly the same source
now I will say the screen on the Atrix
does look nice and it does look sharp
but it doesn't look as crisp and doesn't
look as sharp as the retina display on
the iPhone 4 now despite phones that may
have you know potentially higher
resolutions in the future and phones
that might have bigger screens I really
haven't seen a phone that's come close
to matching the clarity of the iPhone 4
I think Super AMOLED comes really close
in a lot of ways Super AMOLED is
superior but that's not the technology
that we see here in the Atrix 4G we're
not even talking from a resolution
standpoint just from the average user
pictures and the same images look very
very very crisp on the iPhone 4 and it
looks very crisp on the Atrix 4G but
just a little bit better on the iPhone 4
text however on both look really really
good this is a case of fantastic vs.
awesome both are being really good
you're not going to go wrong with either
screen on each but when you have to
declare winner you put these two heads
ahead this one's got to go to iOS all
right so next let's talk about speed
which has really been all the rage with
the Atrix 4G 1 gigabytes of RAM and it's
dual-core processor does that translate
to actual speed usage and improvements
I've tested pretty much every Android
phone that's come out since Android
first came out and this one is
definitely the fastest so it's not
necessarily a fair test to open the
calendar application on iOS in the
calendar application on the Atrix 4G
because they're different application
made for different operating systems so
the best thing that we can do to really
compare speed other than you taking my
word for it I just open the same
applications on each so let's go ahead
and do that let's start with one of my
favorite and probably mine my biggest
time wasters here Angry Birds and I do
want to say that I've got really nothing
running in the background here on iOS
and I do have several applications
actually running the backgrounds here on
the Atrix 4G they've got a tax manager
built then you can see some what's going
on here so with that in mind let me go
ahead and try and launch Angry Birds
here at the same time and we'll see if
this gives us any semblance of what
we're looking at from a speed standpoint
let me go ahead and try and hit this
it's harder than it looks at him at the
same time I'm not gonna lie
alright so both are open so we've got
the row view application coming up
simply cancel there hit okay
and we're actually ready to play despite
the little bit of difference me having
to hit cancel on iOS then we're actually
on Android at least up to this message
let's go and hit hit play on both let's
just pick a level we'll pick the same
level on each hello cities thing at the
same time is so much harder than you
think it might be great okay so really
the more when it come something like
Angry Birds on a simple application is
both are very fast and you don't see
that dual-core necessarily taking
advantage of that alright so an
application like Angry Birds was kind of
a draw so what a lot of the speed tests
you are going to have to take my word
for it on all the Android devices I've
tested and as I mentioned I've tested
quite a few sometimes there's a bit of
lag as you use the device and sort of
more applications are used so even when
it comes time to moving applications
around there can be a bit of delay
whether or not you want to open the
camera application or open up any of the
core functionalities here there was a
bit of a lag the Atrix 4G however is
just a really fast phone and you see
that come into play a lot in the browser
as well
we'll talk about the browser and the
capabilities of that in an upcoming
video so if I was comparing any other
Android phone to the Atrix 4G the a
trips of winning a heartbeat it is a
blistering blistering fast phone and I
don't think we've seen applications even
begin to take advantage of the dual core
functionality it is running Android 2.2
Froyo which has some capabilities to do
some dual core functionality however as
the operating system does get updated
we're going to see more do more dual
core functionality and see it take
better advantage of the operating system
so this round may have to change in the
future but when it comes to speed these
are both blistering fast devices some
things and the clean core applications
are faster on the Atrix but some
third-party applications and not taking
advantage of the dual core yet are still
faster on the iPhone 4 so this round is
going to be a draw in the speed
department and that was actually quite
surprised I went through and used this I
really expected the Atrix to completely
trump everything I compared to other
Android devices it does but with these
sort of vertically integrated model that
Apple's got here the iPhone 4 takes
advantage of the specs of that it has
alright so next let's talk about
operating system I have talked in many
many videos about my feelings on Android
I really like it I think it's come a
tremendously far away and I've talked
quite a bit about iOS in recent videos
I've lamented that iOS is become a bit
stale it looks very similar and almost
identical in a lot of ways to what it
did when it first launched certainly the
App Store and third-party applications
have been the main differentiating
factor in changing how the operating
system looks and functions and that's
only because developers take advantage
of the API is that Apple is given but
the core operating system itself really
hasn't changed a notification system is
obtrusive if you have to hit cancel or
okay and it stops what you're doing on
the lockscreen for example you get
really no information here other than
the time and date can't see any emails
Mike and that's really not keeping pace
with the competition Android I think was
very deficient
first launched and has come a
tremendously far way so the Atrix here
is running motoblur which I am NOT a fan
of at all I don't like the big
cartoonish icons that it has I don't
like that there aren't choices to change
those icons down there at least within
motoblur however one of the great things
about Android is you do have the choice
so I don't like how this looks here on
motoblur I can go ahead and download a
new launcher I can put on launcher Pro
for example which I really do like I
have flexibility to make the phone look
and feel how I want it to look and feel
now certainly you've got options within
the jailbreaking world on an Apple side
and you can do other things with rooting
on Android but I want to keep this the
sort of end user experience from not
having to tweak and not having to go
through those extents despite how easy
or not easy Mike receive them to be
within what the phone will give you just
by using you know their app store
functionality or their Android
Marketplace functionality so I love that
I can change and I can tweak Android I
like the widgets that run in the
background not necessarily like the
motoblur ones but I can pick what works
best for me
I think notification system is really
good it's not obtrusive I can pull this
down and see what's there I really think
Apple needs to improve notifications and
some of the functionalities that you get
with the out break system so this round
around that used to almost always go to
Apple is now swinging back towards
androids Kim alright so for our final
round let's talk about browser and to
clarify that OS that definitely goes to
Android so in previous rounds I talked
about browser functionality and how the
iPhones browser at least from a speed
standpoint had still been superior to
what I've seen in Android the both based
on WebKit
standards however now with this dual
core functionality the speeds less of an
issue so let's jump back into the
browser here and let me show you what
I'm talking about
so let's jump to let's say TechnoBuffalo
and i've got that sort of queued up here
and ready to go so we'll go to
TechnoBuffalo I'll let that load do the
same thing here we'll jump over to
Windows and let's go to TechnoBuffalo
so the speed here
necessarily so relevant now that the
iPhone is on different networks AT&amp;amp;T and
Verizon these are both now using the
same Wi-Fi network the browser here's
work very well and is really fast you
don't get any that sort of checkered
pattern that you get with some browsers
when it's loading we'd actually just saw
it there on the iPhone 4 it works and it
works very very quickly pinch-to-zoom is
very fast without any sort of lag now
one of the big differentiating factors
here is a support of flash now on other
devices that are tested like the inspire
4G for example I turned flash off it
does drain battery but I had the option
to turn flash off flash constant on a
device like that it was a little bit
laggy nothing that I wanted to use on a
daily basis however let's look how flash
content looks on something like the
Atrix 4G so let's jump over to YouTube
so we'll go ahead and go back to Windows
I'll jump to John tor Lakers channel and
it picks up right where I left you left
off here and it is extremely smooth and
one of the best implementations here a
flash that I've seen on a mobile device
we've got an add point here it's a
little down the outside but it works
just extremely well it's gonna go ahead
and jump to that add flash is now usable
on a mobile phone it's not more of a Hey
look we have it but not sure what you
can do with that kind of thing it really
works very very well on the Atrix so
well in fact that you could very easily
watch Flash content and not have to
worry about that sutter so when you sort
of put these rounds head-to-head and you
give a big summation the picture seems
to become a little bit clearer so let me
recap from a specs standpoint the Atrix
4G one from an app's
standpoint we brought it back to the
iPhone from a screen standpoint the
iPhone took it from this speed
standpoint at least surprising to me
that one came out to be a draw from an
OS standpoint the Atrix took it and from
a browser standpoint because that's
flash ability the ability to turn it on
or off and sort of use it as you choose
Android took that round as well bringing
us to a final score of three to two with
one tie so the Atrix
G is our new smartphone Smackdown winner
and remains king of the smartphone world
so what do you guys think do you agree
disagree am i off not off love to know
your thoughts and opinions anyway guys
I'm John retina from TechnoBuffalo
and I'll stay the next video bye-bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
