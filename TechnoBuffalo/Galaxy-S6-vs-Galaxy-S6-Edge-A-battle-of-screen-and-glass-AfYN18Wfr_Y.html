brought to you by harry's what's going
on everyone john render from
TechnoBuffalo here there are a lot of
choices in smartphone in the world I
think Samsung has two of the most
compelling out there right now the
galaxy s6 and the galaxy s6 edge but
which wouldn't you get it's usually what
I do versus I'll compare screen I'll
compare battery life I'll compare it
build quality but essentially these are
the same phones they got the same 5.1
inch qHD screen what we're told the same
Exynos processor so the two quad cores
one to two point 101.5 same three gigs
of ram same 16 megapixel camera on the
back five on the front only small
differences in the battery The Edge has
a 50 million power advantage with 2560
versus 25 50 other than that they are
essentially the same except for a few
differences which what the vs. is going
to talk about we're gonna talk about
price and we're going to talk about
beauty so what are you gonna get with
the edge you're not gonna get it with
the s6 obviously you're gonna get an
edge that consists of two curved sides
of the screen so supposedly samsung says
it adds a bit of utility first you're
gonna get the people function so right
from your lock screen you can swipe it
from the top where you see a little
almost translucent bar and you can
access quick dial as you've access
information about certain people that
you want to set it's relatively simple
in addition to that you're also gonna
have the ability to show homeless news
feeds RSS feeds rather serve options on
the edge that's about it talked about of
the review I use any of those features
at all I turned to almost all of them
off and they became relatively useless
for me but what I did like about the
edge of wisdom looks I think when using
the phone it becomes almost an accessory
and less even utility than it used to be
she wants it's going to look nice and I
think that the s6 edge has incredible
looks and both these phones have the
same build quality they're made of the
same material it's the same Gorilla
Glass and the front and back the same
camera it's everything else is the same
but the way the phone feels a little bit
different the way the phone scroll is a
little bit different when you're
scrolling on a galaxy s6 edge because it
cursed the sides it looks like the tech
is coming out of nowhere and you feel
the phone it just feels different
because of that curve when you're
swiping through it's got a very smooth
motion the phone just looks beautiful
now that looks gonna college the next
costs $100 difference fortunately you're
getting exactly the same phone so the
question is is it worth $100
to you and that's gonna be a personal
preference I can't answer that for you I
will say I haven't ordered my own phone
in quite a while I've got the privilege
of being able to test almost every new
phone that comes down so really I don't
have much for reason to buy a phone
myself so I'm always testing something
new but I went and pre-ordered a galaxy
s6 edge I like to weigh the phone books
and for me that extra $100 was worth the
premium something that was new there's
not that much new out there the phone
world usually they're just different
rectangles with some buttons and the
same UI that you've seen and I like it
or something different but that might
not be the best for you the best thing I
can tell you is go to the store try them
both out see if one's gonna be better
than the other I will say when the only
difference is that I saw outside from
the looks a little bit worse battery
life on the s6 and presumably it takes a
little extra horsepower to sort of make
that curving happen and to show the
pixels on it look at me you can probably
assume there are two things I don't like
putting on nice clothes and shave them
up base and that's where our friends at
Harry's come in the folks at Harry's
offer super high-quality razors they
cared so much about the razor blades
they just freakin went out and bought
the entire factory in Germany where
these blades are made if you want to get
really good quality razors you don't
want to spend a ton of money Harry - the
place to go the starter kits just 15
bucks that includes a razor three blades
and your choice of Harry shave cream or
foaming gel I'm a gel man myself and
that's that bonus you can get five
dollars off your first purchase when you
use code TechnoBuffalo oh and use our
code you also get entire month worth of
shaving for just ten bucks
again that's code TechnoBuffalo make
itself smooth or just shave like
chinstraps that'd be cool or like a Tony
Stark beard you can I also want to say
that the edge feature if you put your
phone face Daniel I'll see the light
that will show up which corresponds to
the color of the first time you set
didn't eat touch but easy just turn your
phone over to and see who's calling
but other than that there really isn't
much of a difference and I know with
versus usually we compare everything and
smash from head to head well the big
question of beginning was which one
should I get
and the answer is you value the look if
you like the look of the edge it's worth
$100 for you better then go for it if
you just want the same experience you
want what Samsung has to offer in a
beautiful-looking package in its own
right go with the s6 if somebody handed
me both phones you know I would I would
pick the edge so I just want to make a
short video
talking about my opinion on which one to
get which one should you get you know
the lot of people have been saying in
the comments type in reading that it's
hard to pick up the s6 edge and first
have kind of trouble using it now for
about two weeks I've had no issue
picking it up it feels nice doesn't
really feel sharp anymore on the sides
it has a nice feel to it
you know so decide which one is going to
be best for you but for me I prefer the
look of the galaxy s6 edge what do you
guys think which one would you get would
it be neither would it be the s6 s6 edge
up to your comments leave it down below
again try to make a short video talking
about my opinion on it hopefully it'll
help shed some light on what you guys
should do for your next phone I know I
give the video a thumbs up to always
appreciate and of course you the big
subscribe button for all TechnoBuffalo
news that's coming right at you until
next time Jon render for TechnoBuffalo
