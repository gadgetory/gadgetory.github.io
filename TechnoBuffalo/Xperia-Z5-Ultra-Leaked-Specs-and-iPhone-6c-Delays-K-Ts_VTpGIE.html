Sangin from TechnoBuffalo and on today's
episode of rumor roundup will be talking
about Sony's Xperia z5 Apple's iPhone 6c
and the new Nexus phones this is rumor
roundup let's go ahead and get started
the iphone 6c may just be the biggest
mobile mystery of 2015 this week a
report suggested that the device would
in fact launch this year now a new
report argues that's not the case and
offer some solid evidence to back up its
claim talk about flip-flopping mobile
marketing firm fix you recently revealed
that it's been tracking two unannounced
iPhones the devices aren't listed by
name but the fact that apple's testing
two new phones instead of three suggests
that the iphone 6c won't be launching
anytime soon specifically fix you has
tracked 87 copies of advice would the
identifier iPhone 81 likely the iphone
6s plus and 67 copies of the iphone 8 to
likely the iphone 6s the report notes
that most of these new iphones are being
used in the US though a few have popped
up in germany in brazil the devices seem
to be doing everything you would expect
ranging from mobile games to popular
apps unfortunately there's no way for
fix you to spot any specific differences
between these models and their
predecessors of course this isn't
definitive proof that the iphone 6c
isn't already being tested it's possible
fix you simply hasn't spotted the third
nude apple smartphone however this isn't
the first time we heard the iphone 6c
has been pushed back to 2016 so you
probably shouldn't get your hopes up for
now Sony is expected to reveal the
Xperia z5 as soon as next month now it
looks like the company could also be
working on a super-sized version of the
flagship phone with some extremely
high-end hardware the Xperia z5 ultra or
possibly the Xperia z5 plus popped up in
a user agent profile recently revealing
a few specs for the rumoured smartphone
the device appears to feature a screen
with a 4k resolution of 3840 x 2160
pixels putting it well beyond the quad
HD displays currently rolling out with
other flagship phones the leak also
appears to confirm a Snapdragon 810
processor for the upcoming Sony phablet
and that's about it though you can
probably expect cutting-edge specs all
around from the Xperia z5 ultra assuming
it actually launches for now we're still
going off a few story
rumours so we wouldn't get too excited
yet we're also expecting both the Xperia
z5 and z5 compact to feature fingerprint
readers so it seems like a fair bet that
the z5 ultra will pack a biometric
sensor as well sony has a big press
event coming up next month at IFA in
Berlin so hopefully we'll see the new z5
family announced that Google is expected
to announce two new Nexus phones this
year and thanks to numerous leaks we
already have a pretty good idea of
what's coming now a fresh report is
offering us even more details on what
the 2015 Nexus lineup has to offer the
latest news comes from Twitter tipster
at on leaks who's apparently dug up a
ton of information on the nexus
smartphones coming from LG and huawei
later this year he notes that both
devices will feature a USBC connector a
fingerprint sensor in the back and front
facing speakers always 5.7 inch phablet
is also set to pack a metal body while
the same feature is likely but not
guaranteed for the 5.2 inch LG model
there's still a lot we don't know about
the new Nexus phones even after this
massive new leak the battery size
processors storage options ramen price
or still a mystery we're also waiting
for a good look at the rumored devices
though previous leaks have given us a
decent idea of what to expect when it
comes to the design Google typically
doesn't reveal new Nexus phones until
late October but at the rate these
devices are leaking we may not have to
wait much longer for their official
debut anyways thank you guys so much for
