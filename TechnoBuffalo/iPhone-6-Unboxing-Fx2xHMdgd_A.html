TechnoBuffalo here at an unboxing of the
latest iphone to come out of Apple this
is the iPhone 6 it's bigger than last
gen it's got a lot more power and a ton
of new features let's go ahead and unbox
it and see if it lives up to the hype so
this is the iPhone 6 of course there's a
6 plus as well we've got this guy in
gold look at the box you can't really
tell much about it although the side the
gold color let you know what you have if
you've got a Space Gray one for example
here's the box for our 6 plus you can
see the color difference other than that
though the boxes look absolutely
identical this is a 16 gigabyte variant
it's going to come in 16 64 or 128 we
will bring back our old friend the
obligatory the unnecessary hope I don't
start bleeding on camera unboxing knife
going to eat this guy looks like had a
chance to take a look at both iPhones at
Apple's launch event in Cupertino about
a week and half ago by Tammy watches
video maybe it was two weeks ago three
weeks ago a month ago year ago I don't
know I just went back and watch my 5s
unboxing yesterday to see what it looked
like let's make sure we kept things
consistent so you've got the plastic I
think ready to go off this thing there
are some key differences here with the 6
and the 6 plus primarily in the camera
and the battery department this has
digital image stabilization where the 6
plus has optical image stabilization
obviously the size difference as well
we'll talk about all that so here is the
phone it looks absolutely identical to
our dummy unit that we had for a few
months so here is the iPhone 6 push it
off to the side for real quick second
cos we're gonna have inside of the box
we've got the ear pods the wall wart
which is the same design that we had and
we've got a lightning cable with just a
regular one-way USB port you can't
reverse it like we had rumoured inside
of the design by Apple in California
envelope we've got things got some Apple
stickers an iPhone 6
you know Tips &amp;amp; Tricks doesn't say
fingertips though like they used to but
that's not why you're here you're here
for this guy this is the iPhone 6 and
feels ridiculously light feel like they
didn't put the battery inside of it
let's go ahead and peel this off
always satisfying boom and now we've got
the iPhone six unsheath I'll go ahead
power it on and went through some specs
so you've got now a larger 4.7 inch
pians up from the four inch that we saw
on the 5 and the 5s it's got a
resolution of 1334 by 750 which gives it
a ppi of 326 you're saying to yourself
self the 326 keep you guys on this
familiar it's because it's the same
hippie as we saw in the last generation
Retina screen so on the 5 and then the
5s it's going to weigh a really light
4.5 5 ounces or 129 grams it is six
point nine millimeters thick or point to
thinner than the 6 plus kind of cool
it's got something called dual domain
pixel the suppose are going to give you
a wider viewing angle which should help
powering it is the new AAA chip a 64-bit
architecture it's got the m8 motion
coprocessor so to can tell if you're
walking up stairs and all that kind of
stuff for elevation I fix it revealed
the battery is 1810 milliamp hours it
was 1560 on the 5s in case you're
wondering on a gig of ram which is the
same ram that's also found in the 6 + 8
megapixel camera on the back does have
focus pixels so it's probably gonna give
you way way faster autofocus and we
heard rumors itself I was gonna be use
on the phone but one place being used is
on that lens cover it does have digital
image stabilization as opposed to
optical which the 6 plus has does of
course 1080p video at either 30 or 60
frames per second slow-mo either 120 or
240 it's got a camera up front as well
it's a 1.2 megapixel job again available
in the same three colors is last gen
either space grace over in gold but the
gold looks a bit different as a space
grey it's a little gold gear available
in 16 64 128 gig variants going to cost
you 199 two-night or 399 on contract
depending on what you go for so a quick
tour of the device it looks very iPhone
ish you've got that 4.7 inch screen of
course right up front you've got your
home button with touch ID built image be
used for Apple pay left hand side you've
got a redesigned volume up and down
we've got your profile switch on the
rights that is your power and lock
button which is now moved from the top
to the side nano SIM tray the bottom
should redesign you've got a new speaker
grille does your lightning port I noise
cancel
mic a 3.5 millimeter headset jack on the
back that's where the camera is going to
live you still have that dual flash in
there but it's now sort of enclosed in a
single circle but the bottom is amber
the top is just regular I've got these
two antenna bands the top one is for NFC
which is going to be used for Apple pay
it's totally locked down though right
now maybe that'll be what they reveal
for the 6s but all you can do is for
Apple pay you can't share anything else
using NFC in the device really thin it
looks really nice of course we'll put it
through all its paces here's a real
quick comparison if you want to look
like the six or the six plus how they
look in normal hands and that kind of
stuff again we'll do everything we can
