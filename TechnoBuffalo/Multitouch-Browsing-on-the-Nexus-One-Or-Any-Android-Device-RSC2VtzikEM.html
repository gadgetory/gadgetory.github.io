technobuffalo here during my review of
the nexus one I gave in very high marks
and really praised it as being one of
the best overall smartphones available
however I did take a little bit of
umbrage with the lack of native
multi-touch support in the browser
multi-touch is quite important to me I'm
an iphone user and I'll become quite
accustomed to it I felt that if then
next is one or Android as a whole had
multi-touch capabilities that were
utilized meaning pinch and zoom would
probably be close to the perfect device
well the native browser found on the
droid or the nexus one does not support
multitouch right out of the box however
enter the android marketplace and the
dolphin browser which you can see right
there it is a free browser that supports
multi-touch and does just support
multitouch a little bit it's a full
supports multi-touch very well so
nothing me talking about it let me give
you a demonstration so here I've got
TechnoBuffalo loaded up and do the main
motion that I do quite a bit the pinch
in the zoom and it is extremely fluid
and it works really well there's no lag
or delay and that may be due to the
browser being optimized or the credibly
fast processor the nexus one but it
works very well it renders pages as well
if not as fast as the native browser and
Android I mean it just worked it very
quickly there's no ghosting at the
bottom none of that checkerboard pattern
it just works and the multi-touch very
quick and as you can see works quite
well and of course you've got your zoom
now the dolphin browser actually has a
few tricks up its sleeve more than just
a really effective implementation of
multi-touch first thing that you may
notice here are tabs Tim's got
technobuffalo right there then I've got
YouTube and you can manage your tabs all
the way across and an X shows up when
you want to close it so I'll go ahead
and close the YouTube tab now I'm right
back here on TechnoBuffalo and you can
browse just like you would normally but
there are a few downsides the first is
even though this is a free browser you
may see a few
google ads it show up at the bottom you
don't see them very often but they
definitely do show up so let me take you
through setting other features of the
device go ahead hit the plus sign right
there now you get sort of the menu
system that the dolphin browser uses so
here's your most visited you can star
the sites if you want in the upper right
hand corner notice that very
familiar-looking microphone that will
activate your voice search like you can
in any other text entry field so you can
say ww technobuffalo com it'll take you
there or Google search whatever you'd
like moving right down you've got your
stars so you've got your bookmarks we've
got a ton of Google services here so
you've got search Gmail maps talkin so
I'll just take you to the web portal for
all of these I google photos calendar
reader earth docs and it's a ton of
other things they're just really nice
shortcuts nothing you couldn't just type
your own URL into but it's nice to sort
of have them all laid out here for you
next you've gotta read it later if you
want to set a web page to read later
you've got delicious if you want to send
something right to it we'll go back
cancel and then you've just got about
the dolphin browser I give feedback
share with friends and a few other
things now this supports some gestures
but nothing that i found terribly useful
the real big selling point here is multi
touch and i gotta say it works it very
well this may make android the next one
particular probably the perfect phone
out there i'm really impressed the speed
of the device for a third party browser
it's one of the best out there now I
can't praise it enough supposedly it
only works with android 2.1 higher
devices although reports are saying that
if you've got a 1.5 1.6 advise that the
dolphin browser will still work for you
so flows you may be on a non firmware
updated g1's or my touches definitely go
ahead and give this a shot it's a free
download from the android marketplace
you got nothing to lose and if you see
an ad or to just be thankful it again
multi-touch i suppose anyway just want
to let you guys know this was out there
because i really had no idea it was
brought to my attention after my nexus
one review spaten revised my nexus one
review i would probably have to give
this a perfect five stars the phone is
now fast it's got every feature i could
have asked for
Google HTC and android really a come
into their own on the dolphin browser
takes it to the next level so go ahead
and get downloading I will see you guys
in the next video and the shorty awards
are still going on I mentioned this a
few videos back it's a video contest for
short video producers if you like what I
do when you know you have the time I
really appreciate your vote in a tech
category I'll put a link to it in the
sidebar hope you guys enjoy it and I
will see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
