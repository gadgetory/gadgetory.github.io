from TechnoBuffalo here with an unboxing
of what I think is the 2015 Moto e that
Motorola just announced it looks a
little different than most boxes fragile
breaking news slide to start what this
opposed idli is is a virtual press
conference we're right on the dawn of
Mobile World Congress motorola said they
didn't want to have people off to attend
another press conference for another
phone so I wanted to bring the press
conference to us so go ahead and slide
that off there is the new Moto e it
looks like it already flaps starting to
open up on this thing let's see I've got
my my press badge right here John Rhett
injure Moto e that's kind of cool push
that off to the side and see what else
we got on top welcome to the Moto e
press conference today we're doing
something different you probably I've
been to enough press events grab your
badge let's get started and go to start
with Moto e calm to begin your event
then come back here to collect your unit
we hope you enjoy the show so go ahead
and open this sucker up and this does
look like a press conference usually go
to a welcome desk and you sign up and
get your badge and they got the tables
all set up continue to open it up that
is really cool actually and this is our
virtual press conference you can go
ahead and have a seat
start with Moto e I can pull this out
look at that and we're greeted by a
teeny tiny Rick Ostrow who is a
president CEO of Motorola Mobility it's
kind of neat and then inside I think is
the reason that everybody's here this is
the new Moto e so all this virtual press
comic and stuff aside it'll push all
that off let's take a look at the phone
I get Motorola credit for trying
something new and different all right
we're gonna keep mr. Oshiro here so I
feel like I'm really at a press
conference and what we've got here is
the 2015 Moto e this is a pretty sweet
little phone for a not a lot of cash to
go and pull off this plastic
got it ha ha boom
alright so that's a corner that I want
to admit well go ahead and pull that
plastic off see we can power the sucker
on and I will tell you what this 4.5
inch screen phone can do
so first let's get the big news out of
the way it's available today starting at
119 that is now available with LTE for a
hundred and forty nine bucks four point
five inch print the resolution of 540 by
960 to 245 PPI at this coming with
Android 5.0 lollipop being powered by a
Snapdragon 410 s 1.2 gigahertz if you
get the LTE version if you get the 3G
version it's going to be powered down a
little bit and be a Snapdragon 200 but
still at 1.2 gigahertz it's got 8 gigs
of internal storage but you can't expand
that with a microSD card slot it's got a
pretty nice sized 2390 million power
battery on the back you've got a 5
megapixel camera that can shoot 720p
video 30 frames per second
little VGA camera right there on the
front essentially there are three
different versions of 2015 Moto e
there's a u.s. GSM LTE u.s. GSM and
global GSM the LTE versions have support
different bands they get the u.s.
international so be sure to check to
make sure you are getting the right one
this one looks really nice for an
incredible price point this is a great
deal if you just want to get a phone
that's gonna be able to make phone calls
browse the web and check emails not set
you back a lot of cash a lot of people
picked up the last gen phone I almost
used like a media player I really
expensive media player they can take
with them if they were traveling and
popular SIM card make phone calls with
this is a full-featured phone I know the
screen resolution is not very high but
it looks pretty nice just doing normal
stuff that you do with a phone quick
tour nothing on the left hand side on
the right hand side you've got your
power button and your volume up and down
the power button just some texture on it
which I really like overall a really
nice looking phone from Motorola north
at $149 price point it's really tough to
beat you're travelling again you want
international phones can be great one to
pick up or you just want to inexpensive
Android device I can do it or if you
need to this is going to be really solid
option for you guys love to hear your
thoughts on it what you think about the
II give thumbs up for some nice low cost
of Isis let me hear your thoughts on it
until next time I am John render from
TechnoBuffalo and mr. Austral oh and I
and you can play with this device</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
