TechnoBuffalo with a full review for you
of the latest flagship from Samsung this
is the brand new Galaxy s5 it's got a
lot of weight on its lofty shoulders
carrying the pressure of the success of
a galaxy s4 to three and the ones that
came before it
quit see if it lives up to the galaxy s
heritage it deserves a spot in your
pocket as I do with all my phone reviews
let me begin it a disclaimer I use this
for eight days two days with
international version in six days with
the AT&amp;amp;T variants if you want to get
more information on anything that we're
talking about or see galleries title 10
did a full written review hit the link
down below to go into more detail with
what I'm talking about here this reviews
is being broken down into seven parts if
you want to jump to any particular part
I hit the link to the side and go right
to it we're talking about call quality
hardware software new sensors that are
in it camera battery and then finally a
conclusion and ultimate score but before
we get there let's talk about call
quality since that is most important as
a phone after all doesn't matter what
else that can do call quality was
absolutely awesome I seem like a broken
record now with modern phones good they
also new be really good again tested on
AT&amp;amp;T in Southern California so your
experience might vary but cold cloudy
was crisp snow popping noise I know drop
calls and also the speaker was really
really loud on it so if we rely on
speakerphone a lot like I do you will be
very well served with the galaxy s5
alright get to the meat of the review
that's really the hardware so by just
glancing at the phone it looks pretty
similar to a galaxy s4 Samson clearly
gave this the s treatment if I can
borrow from Apple's roadmap these types
of iterations tend to improve on the
previous year's model internally without
making really the huge dollar could be
necessary for R&amp;amp;D for total complete
redesign that's usually reserved for
every other year looking at the phone
though it's still unmistakeably Samsung
from the shape of the device the shape
of the home button capacitive buttons if
your phone nerds you pick this phone up
blindfolded you would know right away
who made it but that's not necessarily a
bad thing either sammy is clearly doing
something right they're selling phones
about as fast as they can make them the
big design changes though come from the
back go device right now have a soft
touch dimpled rubber back sort of
resembling a bit of a band-aid ip67
water resistance making this also serve
as kind of an active device that
Samsung's had in the past we'll see
they've actually released a full active
device but definitely works in the water
and you know I wouldn't necessarily take
it in the pool
but if you drop it in water take to the
beach you're going to be absolutely fine
Samsung did up the screen size o2 5.1
inches this year in the 1920 by 1080p
screen is colorful and crisp it's Super
AMOLED display which is usually kind of
struggles in direct sunlight although it
actually looked really really good in my
test so I've tested a ton of phones
pretty much every phone that's come out
over the past four years and a lot of
phones obviously have a lot of screens
this one I can safely say is the best
screen I have ever tested Samsung has
reputation for screens and displays and
it's on full display here so to speak
there is no color thinking at all if you
had experiences with that with other
Samsung devices it is absolutely
stunning everything looks great on it
from images to texts videos games it all
works really just amazing
Samsung hit the screen right out of the
park the back cover is flimsy plastic
the same as it's always been
but it's got a nice soft touch field to
it we've tested a white model too and
that kind of dug the pearly way finish
on it under the hood though there's a
twenty eight hundred million power
battery stamped Dragon 801 processor two
gigs of RAM 16 gigs of storage or 32
depending which one you get and a slot
for adding storage up to 128 gigs so
I've said it before and I'll say it
again I usually like higher quality
materials but I get the plastic with the
s5 since it does add a water resistance
which you can't really do with metal
you've given Samsung crap in the past
for use of plastic like I have I can
actually forgive it here I think it
actually makes a bit of sense so that
argument at least for the s5 I think
doesn't stand let's talk about software
Samsung really since the galaxy s3 is
taking this off we're approached to just
throw everything at you and hope that
you like a few of the tweaks in reality
though you probably appreciate some of
the tinkering they've done and
completely ignored the rest the galaxy
s5 runs Android 4.4.2 kitkat right out
of the box and also includes Samsung's
new iteration of TouchWiz or nature UX
it just says color and full and
intrusive as it's always been buts
cleaned up in a lot of ways to the top
quick navigation bar is flatter and lot
easier on the eyes it also is much
quicker in general but it also might be
that standard I need a one under the
hood also here though is although but it
put a nature dropping noise every time
you touch the screen if you're like me
you're gonna quickly want to turn those
off so I really like the s5 supports
audio commands anytime the screen is on
and the Google search bar is nearby so I
can always say okay Google and as to
whether it's out tapping
for example it's not as good as you
always on motox but it's a really big
improvement over the HTC One doesn't
really offer that feature at all if you
swipe to the far left of this Pleyel
enter Samsung's my magazine interface
which is basically just like Flipboard
and a-singin
pretty close copy catalyst influenced by
HTC blinkfeed news interface in general
Todd and I agreed that we're tired of
TouchWiz even if Samsung does clean it
up just a little bit it's high-risk
company to try something new
hopefully with just fewer colors next
let's talk about new sensors Samsung
added a fingerprint scanner to its home
button the idea is that you can use your
finger to unlock the phone and purchase
items
samia's hooked up with PayPal to make
that happen it's the idea we've seen
before but it's really not that well
executed here so the sensor doesn't work
all that well and all I found myself
just turning it off completely after
four days of frustration I do like that
it's open but doesn't work or becomes
more trouble and it's worse than what's
the point the other new sensors a
heartrate monitor it's essentially just
software takes advantage of the camera
and LED flash to tell your heartrate it
works while you're sitting still but
what would you probably eat a heart
monitor probably not when you're sitting
at your desk your table if I want to
check it out when you're out on the run
or in a bit of motion and in those
conditions it doesn't work at all in
fact it tells you to stand still also
there are apps for iOS and Android that
accomplished exactly the same thing for
other devices so okay not much of a
selling point here at all but if you're
sitting still it will work let's jump
into camera next the new 16 megapixel
sensor is pretty awesome and arguably
one of the best cameras out there todd
has a huge gallery of images head on
over to the review to see those that
link will be down below the shutter
speed here is crazy fast it also records
4k videos the pictures look bright and
crisp
really well done Samsung I've been hard
on Samsung in the past for cameras and
they nailed this one
pictures look great 4k video looks
gorgeous probably one of the better
camera phones out there on the market so
you want to make sure that your phone
can last throughout the day let's talk a
bit about battery it is a 2800 milliamp
job it's got a really solid battery life
end of the day have about 35% left so my
general usage take off the charger
around 7:30 in the morning it's usually
connected to Wi-Fi at home or the office
I've got two accounts being pulled down
every five minutes a lot of social
networking going on obviously a lot of
videos that are being watched I'm just a
ton of phone calls on it uses my primary
device and 35% is actually really really
good
I like the HTC One m8 also has its own
ultra
or sittings mode that gives you
incredible standby time when the power
runs pretty low
this mode activated your screen will
turn into a kind of a grayscale mode and
all you have access to your basic apps
like your phone technologies calculator
and manually pulling email and sort of a
web browser among some others the idea
here though is in this mode your phone
will last way longer without things
running the background when our device
got down to 50 percent battery we turned
on ultra power saving mode estimated we
could leave a device powered on for
another four and a half days which is
really awesome although it takes a long
time to turn it on it takes about 30
seconds to turn on but if you're
desperate saving some juice it's
probably worth that weight so what's a
conclusion here the galaxy s5 on its own
it's a really good phone but it's not a
great one TouchWiz gets in its own way
and the new sensors are debatably
valuable the screen is absolutely
gorgeous and the camera is awesome
that's what's important to you you're
really gonna dig this device so I think
the phone is really competing against
the galaxy s4 in addition to the current
flagships like the iPhone 5s if you own
the last generation it's really hard for
me to recommend an upgrade here and I
probably would year to look forward to
see what the s6 is going to be if we do
jump in though I think you'll be really
happy this phone gets a very solid eight
on the TechnoBuffalo scale what do I
think is galaxy s5 your next phone are
you gonna wait for the s6 or maybe see
what Apple has to offer you're gonna
jump over the HTC One or wait to see
what Nokia's got next I want to hear
your thoughts please leave in the
