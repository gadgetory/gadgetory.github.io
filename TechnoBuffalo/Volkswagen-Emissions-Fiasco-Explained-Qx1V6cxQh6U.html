to you by the new LG OLED TV it's not a
new TV it's a new category of telling
what's up everyone
John Ritter from TechnoBuffalo here so
this is a bit different type of video
though I have usually done the past I'm
a big car guy and also I've got a guilty
pleasure of loving a good scandal and
there is definitely a juicy one going on
right now with Volkswagen so I thought
I'd explain what's happening with
Volkswagen might have heard about it in
the news and sort of explain it step by
step what they did and what's going to
happen and what kind of cars are
affected so here's a general overview of
what's been going on Volkswagen cheated
on EPA emissions test by creating
software that deliberately altered the
clean diesel emissions of their card
during testing it's kind of crazy how
they did it it was like a mad scientist
genius way detecting when the car's been
tested by the EPA it was able to test
steering wheel position speed how long
the engine runs on even atmospheric
pressure and all those things make it
impossible for to have been an accident
that the software is put in the car as
an accent of innocent it was very
deliberate and deliberately put in the
car
to skirt these EPA tests and to give
false results makes my everything has
happened including just recently the CEO
of Volkswagen stepping down Martin
vinkle horn just a few days ago the
first question that I had was how the
hell did all this happen and the funny
thing is that happened totally by
accident so a random third party not
government-affiliated actually was the
University was testing diesel emissions
was testing fuel emissions they were
being performed by the International
Council on clean transport the ICCT they
had first ones that discovered this
emissions issue other tests really just
setting out to prove the hypothesis that
Volkswagens new generation of TDI diesel
engines for cleaner than standard
gasoline engines but unwittingly exposed
everything shady that Volkswagen was
doing so they were trying to show how
good these cars were and sort of show
that Volkswagen promoting their Clean
Diesel as clean was really clean and
they stumbled on something that
Volkswagen is gonna haunt them for a
very long time
so the ICCT first tested several diesel
vehicles on a Dyna meter or a rolling
road you might have seen those things
and then in the real world so on the
rolling road things look pretty normal
however in the real world things just
did not add up at all so did a little
bit a road trip they hopped in the car
they drove from same day
to Seattle they enlisted the help of
West Virginia University the ICCT tested
the emissions of a Jetta TDI a Passat
TDI bmw x5 x drive 35 D now the road
trips the Jetta proves 15 to 35 times
the u.s. legal limit usually referred to
as tier 2 bin 5 of NOx which stands for
nitrogen oxides the facade produced 5 to
20 times legal limit and that's a lot of
emissions coming out of these supposedly
clean cars while BMWs emissions were at
or below the regulated rate so BMW good
exhale no one's mad at you this time at
the same time the California Air
resource board or carb tested the
vehicles in the laboratories and
vehicles passed with flying colors
I get very different results they got
for the is ECT so in May of this year
the EPA got wind of this and they
started investigating and that got us to
where we are right now these results
finally coming public so what cars are
affected a lot of them 2 liter TDI
diesel vehicles are fitted with the
defeat devices span from 2009 to 2015
from both OD and volkswagen the VW
models include the Jetta TDI Passat TDI
Golf TDI Jetta SportWagen TDI and beetle
TDI the Audi models 2009 2013 a3 TDI as
well as the new 2015
a3 TDI that was a lot of TDI's so right
now Volkswagens has not issued a plan to
fix the cars but I assume we'll have one
very soon roughly in the u.s. 482
thousand cars are affected and here's
where things get even more staggering 11
million cars worldwide could be affected
so what's looking like I'm gonna do
first I can change engine software which
will limit engine output and fuel
economy drastically or they could
install your urea treatment system which
not only required huge ran a vehicle
modification cutting the trunk space
cargo space but also cost VW thousands
of dollars per car the things are really
really bad here if you follow the car
world at all you know folks like me for
years have been touting Clean Diesel
don't worry about driving efficiently
dirty diesel engine and we've cleaned it
up it'll get great fuel economy get
instant torque and not pollute the
and those are all wrong so madness for a
second that you went and just bought a
new clean diesel car and you were
banking on insulating that car maybe
five or six years based on a high
residual value now your car is going to
ticky residual hit and not gonna be
worth what you thought it was gonna be
worth and beyond that and Volkswagen
fixes it you're not gonna get the fuel
economy thought you're getting and
beyond that now you're polluting the
environment up to 40 times that you
should be people are very upset
Volkswagen is going to face so many
class-action lawsuits and beyond the
billions and billions of billions that I
have to pay to settle that they're
probably looking at about half a
trillion dollar fines anyway real fast
let me exhale from all these diesel
fumes that I've been breathing in to
thank our friends at LG and tell you
about the new LG OLED TVs so
legitimately these things look
ridiculous if you remember the first
time that you saw a high-def TV versus
regular def TV you know it's a
staggering experience that's a
difference of seeing a regular LED TV or
plasma TV versus the brand-new LG OLED
sets they look absolutely incredible
just a little Oh in front of the LED
that stands for organic makes all the
difference in the world the TVs look
real it looks like a football game
you're watching you're actually at the
game it's staggering you'll see that
it's not just the new TV it's it's
almost like a whole new category of
televisions they just look awesome if
you haven't seen it for your own eyes
that's the best way to check a TV go to
a store see what the LG OLED TVs look
like in person and I promise you'll be
hoping this could be the end of
Volkswagen and Audi as we know it at
least into Volkswagen Audi in the u.s.
this is a horrible thing that they've
done it's not new in the carnot reason
happening for four years four decades
ago didn't replace a 50 cent part in the
Pinto for the firewall they knew that if
you got rear-ended the car would blow up
because they deemed that it was more
cost-effective to settle the lawsuits
and to fix a car so things that just
have been happening for a long time GM
had an issue Hyundai's an issue with
fuel economy numbers but this is the
largest most widespread egregious
blanket deception that we have ever seen
from auto manufacturer so if I helped
explain to you what's been going on if
you drive on these cars I'm sorry it's
hard but Volkswagens done I'm not sure
how they're gonna
this if they ever come out of it the
same way that they went in I'll tear
your guys thoughts on it and kind of
what do you think about it a departure
from the phone and what would they do
that usually do I've been following the
story really closely and I wanted to
sort of just share my thoughts and
opinions on it with you and I thank you
guys for watching hope you enjoyed the
next time I'm dry reading from
TechnoBuffalo
so you guys next video bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
