technobuffalo here with an unboxing of
one of the most anticipated phones of
2011 this is the droid bionic for
Verizon Wireless it is a carriers first
4g dual-core phone of course being
powered by Android we first saw it
debuted at CES 2011 in January since
then it's been delayed and reimagined so
let's go ahead and see if the droid
bionic it's been worth the wait alright
so the packaging looks very similar to
the other droid lines of phone with the
gray sleeve on top and that creepy i
sort of peering through go ahead and
pull off the sleeve here run through all
the specs and all that goodness in just
a minute there is the aforementioned
creepy I droid x onic grey box gray box
gray box alright let's go ahead and pull
the top off and unboxing striptease
style see just a little bit put it back
if you want to see the whole thing is
gonna be an extra twenty dollars you
have to go in a different room just can
alright so here is upside down the droid
bionic let's go ahead and post guy to
the box see what else we're going to get
here and run through all the specs and
that goodness 4g sim card this is LTE
LTE the GSM based technologies so it's
going to need a sim card to go ahead and
see if they put it in here usually yep
it is already in the phone um addition
to see successor you can get a ton of
other stuff can get laptop Doc's not
kinds of other goodness we've got the
port the plugs into the wall with the
USB port on the side there is the cord
is going to plug into it charge it via
micro USB and a manual just about it so
pretty standard not any headphones in
there go ahead and push this stuff off
to the side go ahead and peel off the
plastic whoosh I left a piece behind get
it off there we go all right I'm gonna
go and power this sucker up and or up
the specs because there's a lot of specs
here to go through so hopefully it's got
enough charge turned on maybe maybe it
does looks like it might be dead that's
too bad
power on not very well for the better
his life already just kidding alright so
let me run through the sex with this guy
and I'll power it on and come back and
show you what it can do alright so we
are looking at android 2.3 point for
Gingerbread and so one of the latest
build of Android with motorola's don't
call me motoblur on here as well as I
mentioned the first dual core phone that
has sported LTE network on verizon
wireless and that is one gigahertz on
each core it's a TI omap processor and
also has one gig of ram here so this
guy's pretty much what a computer was a
few years ago screen wise it's a 4.3
inch screen resolution of 540 x 960 that
qualifies as qhd or quarter HD with
corning gorilla glass so i put this in
your pocket with your keys they're not
going to scratch it up on the back 8
megapixel camera with autofocus LED
flash of course that can shoot full
1080p HD video so I don't need to bring
your camp coy with you when you go out
and about front-facing camera on the
front obviously for video chat taking
your sexy facebook photos you hold it up
to the front boom and snap your picture
32 gigs of memory 16 internal there
should be a 16 gigabyte card lurking in
here of course you can up that to 32
gigs I feel like the micro machine guy
at the way I'm talking court support
adobe flash on the rest of that goodness
i'm going to set you back about three
hundred dollars on a two-year contract
so what do we have on the phone we've
got four capacitive buttons menu home
back and search they'll sort of droid
chin that we've come to know or love or
low depending on which camp you're in on
the left hand side hdmi out and the
charging port for micro USB on the right
hand side very well pronounced a volume
up and down rocker in the bottom there
lives a microphone nothing else on the
top on the left hand side as a power in
lock button i prefer when it's on the
right but that's just me 3.5 millimeter
headset jack you can see there's a
little bit of a chin here the chin is on
the front
sort of reminiscent I guess of the droid
x on the back soft touch so it feels
pretty nice in the hand there's a camera
we talked about speaker grill and all of
your branding got verizon LTE with
Google the phone's not very thick to me
feels solid in your hand I like that
soft touch feel I prefer when the back
is sort of a metal type accent but this
really does feel quite nice let me go
ahead and pop this sucker off take a
look what else are going to have and
maybe there's a tab I gotta pull to get
the battery to work I'll try this live
on camera so here is the battery and
it's a gargantuan battery I can pull it
out of there try it come here battery
battery there we go um let's check the
size of this battery 3.8 bolts where is
the na there it is 1735 milliamp hours
it's big but it's also very thin already
see the comments about that one down
below there's where your sim cards going
to live and there's where your micro SD
cards gonna be so let's go ahead and put
some charges to this guy no offense to
the droid charge and look around alright
so we are plugged in and quasi juiced up
here this is what your droid bionic is
going to look like brick you got some 3d
animations and of course then the full
review I'll walk you through everything
this is just really the first time I've
turned the phone on here and thing is
snappy fast I you'd expect that I guess
from dual core processor and gig of ram
man this thing is blistering alright
let's take a look at some of the stuff
you're going to get on your phone so
here are the apps that you're gonna get
they are side-scrolling apps so you've
got a lot of custom Motorola ones and of
course the standard stuff that you get
with Android and some verizon business
here because because because you guys
didn't uh some more vcat stuff 3d
animations there what is that logo
camera it looks like it is a camera so
that's how you snap pictures yay alright
let's go ahead and exit out of here take
a look at the browser
for me the browser is what matters most
uploading time and all that stuff I can
handle as long as the browser is going
to be decent speeds so let's go ahead
and take a look at the browser and here
we've got hey check a look at that check
a look that take a look at that take
note buffalos new mobile version on the
thing is just about as fast it expect I
mean this just goes I didn't see a
checkerboard pattern at all this thing
is a speedy speedy speedy looking phone
so of course is very unscientific test
just first impressions again during the
full review and hands on I'll walk
through everything I'll run benchmarks
and I'll run different tests so I'll
show flash and the rest of that business
here this is kind of a neat little
add-on I saw it's for your contacts so
at favorite contacts if you pull down
it's going to pull it out a whole bunch
of contacts you can go pick who you want
and I'll so instead of taking up a whole
home screen with row after row it sort
of pulls all that down for you to do it
I really need addition that Motorola
added on here let's take a look at some
of the droid backgrounds always kind of
fun to see when Motorola puts on that
droid phones take a look at live
wallpaper sees anything new I don't know
why I care about this but I always do so
the standard ones and then there's the
droid bionic one which I think was the
one we had loaded there let's go ahead
and set that and see if the eye is gonna
creep us out or creep me out uh yeah I
feel like it's judging me uh so you can
change that if you want this has been a
very first look and quick look at the
droid bionic verizon's first dual core
LTE phone it's available now for 300
smackeroos on a two-year contract i'm
