John Rhett enger' from TechnoBuffalo
here taking a look at the just announced
Samsung Galaxy S Wi-Fi this sort of went
under the radar of Samsung's
announcements this is an mp3 player it
looks very similar to the galaxy s2 and
the note that we saw announced so from a
spec standpoint has got a 5 inch TFT
display of course capacitive it's being
powered by a 1 gigahertz processor that
single core Android Froyo so no
Gingerbread here on the back you've got
a 3.2 megapixel camera with autofocus
voice over IP of course video chat with
quick Wi-Fi b/g/n and bluetooth 3.0
let's take a quick look at the device of
course it's for your typical Android it
was a very light version of TouchWiz on
it you can see if they've got sort of
how all their applications are done and
laid out this new sort of 3 button
layout the big deal here is obviously as
an mp3 player to view back your video
content let's take a look what that sort
of interface looks like so we'll jump
here into applications and hopefully we
can find something screen capture built
in that's always nice and talking about
Android I can see what else here at your
typical array of Android stuff quick
manual you learn about how to video chat
Samsung Apps that sounds kind of new
I'll see what we got there
again no cellular radio here on this guy
at all
we've got the Samsung App Store for
Android
get all your Angry Birds on there let's
go ahead see what else we got in here
jump into applications
it looks to be the gist of it so you got
your standard Android applications
scroll on through here we'll go ahead
and do a quick tour of the device
definitely not one of the thinner
devices we've seen from Samsung left
hand side is nothing he's got this white
plastic back speaker grille a speaker
grille there's the 3.2 megapixel camera
on the autofocus on the right hand side
the volume rocker up and down power and
lock micro SD card slot on the top see
that right there the screen here is W
VGA which is pretty nice it's got a
pretty large battery here as well the
same battery I believe that's in the
note 2500 milliamp hour battery this is
going to work for quite a long while
probably accounts for its chunkiness
you've got your three point five
millimeter headset jack on the bottom
God's your microphone and of course your
micro USB charging this has been a first
look at the Samsung Galaxy S Wi-Fi 500
