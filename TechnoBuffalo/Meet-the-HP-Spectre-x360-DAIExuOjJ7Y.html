folks at HP while doing overviews guys
want to know more about the computer
want us to see us do a full review leave
a comment down below I really like the
spectre x360 line effects fun fact I
like the first generation so much I
bought one for my dad so it's kind of
you can take a look at this what HP
offered to send it to us so the first
you're going to notice is this thing is
crazy thin it's 13.8 millimeters and
2.85 pounds so if you travel a lot your
students you want something like to
throw in your bag this is an awesome way
to go all that thinness and lightness
aside here's something novel from a PC
manufacturer to USB C Thunderbolt 3
ports either which can use to charge but
that's not all how about a full size USB
3 USB a port so you can plug in your old
stuff Future Passed
and a computer can actually use today
something that I wish more manufacturers
would do now a couple other cool things
about it it's got this geared hinge
which means first when using it like a
laptop you're not going to have flaccid
hidden syndrome which something we
experience on flagship devices like the
surface book for example but it also
does more because it's a 3/16 inch name
you can pull it all the way around use
it as a tablet you can prop it up the
opposite way use it for watching movies
when you're on airplane which kind of a
days this for he's like a 10 super
presentation mode whatever you want to
do it'll Bend and the hinge will stay
wherever you want to leave it because
the computer is so thin and light I was
expecting have a sacrifice and battery
HP is claiming up to 15 hours and 15
minutes of battery out of something that
then but we'll test that in the full
review sounds a carb icing too much
layer power either it's got a seventh
gen cabbie Lake chip in here pricing is
all over the board depending on how you
option it up our version has e gigs of
ram and a core i7 chip in it you can go
up to 16 gigs of ram and you can up to
storage but whatever store would you do
get it is PCIe SSD so especially this
time of year pricing is again all over
the place so check with HP reverie want
to buy it to see where the pricing is
going to be they also worked with the
folks at Bang &amp;amp; Olufsen to tune the
audio they've got kind of a cool pattern
on the speakers its quad speakers with a
CH
Audioboo so it sounds pretty good I
really like the backlit keyboard there's
enough traveling still tell it's a thin
laptop but you can still have some sort
of tactile feel to it a full glass
trackpad I've seen sort of a move for
trackpads being sort of deep and not
long this one takes the opposite
approach it's sort of very wide
they've do a lot of scrolling left and
right you're going to really appreciate
what HP is done and also look at that
display it's almost the bed's less
desire I really like the 13 inch full HD
display and it is a touchscreen if you
guys do want to see us test this give
the video a thumbs up to let us know and
leave it in the comments and let us know
what particular you want us to see us
test and we will do that for you but the
meantime first look at the brand new
Spectre x-360 at first blush if you want
to get someone a gift for the holidays
maybe asking to your own wishlist
Spectre x-360 looks like a pretty good
way to go</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
