TechnoBuffalo here and I want to give
you a demonstration the video capture
capabilities found on the new iPhone 4
it's about 4 o'clock in the afternoon
there's a decent amount of sunlight out
here you can see what it looks like so
I'm a bit in the shadows right now you
can see how it handles in sort of lower
likes he had really captured very
quickly I'll react to the light change
I'm gonna step right into the sunlight
now see if there's any difference so
they reacted very quickly as well also
to keep walking you can see through
there there's gonna be shadows and
sunlight so I'll keep walking through
and see how this looks
it's right off the bat at least from the
disappoint looks to be pretty good you
can see my cat Mercedes sort of staring
at the window and try to tap the focus
right now a tap on or you can see if it
focuses and certainly does look to have
focused and I'll be doing the full
comparison of the video capture
capabilities on the iPhone 4 versus the
iPhone 3GS as well in case you're
interested I'm going to switch now to
the front-facing camera we're gonna see
what that looks like you can see my ugly
mug alright so now we've got a
demonstration of the front-facing camera
interestingly enough you can't switch
cameras while you are recording you can
do it when you're in FaceTime but not
while you're recording so this is the
front-facing camera you can still see
Mercedes sort of lurking behind me and
recently enough the tap to focus still
work so I'm tapping to focus right now
and it focused right on my face I'll
take some pictures too and I'll put them
up here and you can see how the camera
actually looks a 5 megapixel sensor and
also just to reminder there will be a
comparison between the iPhone 4 and the
iPhone 3GS showing all this stuff as
well hi guys I am John render a buffalo
and I will see you in the next video
buh-bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
