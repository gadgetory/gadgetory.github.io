is away with his baby so I get the
pleasure of unboxing this little beauty
the galaxy note 3 it's here it's in the
office so let's unbox it before we get
started on the unboxing I want to go
ahead and thank Negri electronics for
providing us with this delicious galaxy
note 3 but I'm sure that you guys want
to see what's going on here so let's
check it out obviously the very same
sort of wood grain box that we're used
to seeing from Samsung we've seen this
on the galaxy s4 and they're still
continuing with this sort of nature
theme you can see Super AMOLED this is a
huge screen it's a 5.7 inch screen Full
HD so you're looking at your full 1920
by 1080 screen it's gorgeous I saw it at
Aoife obviously running Android it's on
4.3 so this is the most recent version
of Android so if anyone out there is
just desperate to have the most recent
version here it is
you've got bluetooth 4.0 and I think
it's just time to open the box so let's
get up the giant knife and I will do
this with great care because I'm not as
good at it as jon is we've got a 32 gig
here with us but it'll also come in a 64
gig model the note a very popular device
very very popular so this is the US
model in white so we'll put the phone to
the side I'll pick this up real quick I
want to make sure we get that very
lovely film ripping off sound that all
of you so love but before we do that
let's check out what else is in the box
of course we've got some QuickStart
guides in many different languages check
that out smart switch so this is a very
interesting little thing it's a good way
to transfer data so they've got some
information there and of course all of
your cables got some clips your very
standard believe this is USB 3.0 oh yes
you've got USB 3.0 you had a full cable
for USB 3.0 if you're interested in that
something a little different this time
around and also your wall wart
headphones
are they alright here got some extra
extra ear phone sizes if you need that
and of course the battery so here is the
device let's check this out I'm gonna
someone I stick the battery in here and
crank it up of course that nice leather
back that the note 3 is going to be so
so popular with people with this is a
really cool packet it definitely feels a
lot more premium than the plastic we've
seen on the galaxy s4 and of course the
s-pen this is the new upgraded s-pen and
one of the things I really actually like
about the s-pen on this particular note
is that unlike the note 2 this is a
universal s-pen so you can actually put
that in either way which is really
helpful and I know that doesn't seem
like much but I can say that when the
iPhone went to lightning it was really
really helpful just to see it you know
if you're in the dark or if it's dimly
lit and you just don't want to deal with
it you can always just throw the pen in
doesn't matter what side and it'll
definitely go in there I'm so just a
nice little bonus something small but
the Devils in the details to me and I
always like seeing those nice little
details so thanks Samsung of course
you've got on the front here like I said
a full 1080p screen we've got three gigs
of RAM in this bad boy 32 or 64 gigs
onboard storage we've got our
front-facing camera right here this is a
2 megapixel camera and on the back a 13
megapixel shooter with image
stabilization so that'll be really nice
for any of you who like to get your
phone tog Rafi on let's take the back
off and check out what's under the hood
so to speak so it's still soaked in a
plastic but still feels better than the
the old-school the old-school SGS 4
plastic I hate calling SGS for
old-school a micro SD card slot so
expandable storage which is something
everybody loves it's always nice to have
all that extra space on your device
and honestly removable storage is kind
of rare these days let's pop the battery
in and you can see here is the battery
it's pretty big 3200 milliamp hour
battery that's gonna get you some pretty
nice talktime usage time all the good
stuff of course that comes with having a
5.7 inch screen so we've got everything
locked in there
let's boot er up shall we and I'm gonna
peel the sticker off are we ready
oh I knocked everything over I don't
care I'm too excited so seeing this
screen in Germany at Aoife it's gorgeous
I'm not gonna I'm not gonna kid around
you guys it's absolutely beautiful we
don't have a SIM card in there yet but
here is the screen I'm not gonna bother
with setting everything up because
that's gonna be John he's gonna do the
hands-on for this lovely lovely device
if you guys have any questions this is
rocking an octa-core processor the
unlocked version you're also gonna be
able to get this on all four carriers
here in the US major carriers AT&amp;amp;T
Verizon t-mobile Sprint and you'll also
be able to get it unlocked once again
thanks so much to Negri electronics for
giving us the pleasure of unboxing this
lovely note 3 as I said leave your
comments down below if you have any
questions for John during the hands-on

feature
