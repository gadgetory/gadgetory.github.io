brought to you by Netflix well how's it
going there gee it's John q here from
TechnoBuffalo and welcome to what's the
apps this week I thought I'd take a
break from iOS and jump back on to the
other oh so popular platform that is
Android so for this episode of WTA we're
gonna be taking a look at how you can
improve and enhance your Android Music
playback experience with a little app
called
power amp a while back when I had the
HTC Incredible S one of the things that
really really turned me off about the
phone was the music playback experience
I mean it sucked what can man but that's
just my opinion though it kind of had a
digital fake ish kind of empty sound it
felt like HTC thought okay guys we had
this phone here so we're gonna put a
music player in this phone because every
single phone has a music player now
we're gonna just allocate all of our
time money and resources to make 10 and
20 different phones at all look alike
and have the exact same specs but we're
gonna name them all something different
and no idea why they sound like that in
my head plus the volume wasn't really
too loud you see I was used to the sound
and the quality coming from the iPhone
and the iPhone is basically an iPod that
you can text and call people but iPod
that's a key word they're dedicated
music Blair what you're hearing right
now is Mike Snow's animal a song that
was included with the Google Nexus 1
playing on the Google Nexus 1 like the
incredible SC Nexus is made by HTC and
it shares that similar HTC semi quiets a
digital block and of sound the LG
revolution was surprisingly better and
has a richer more fuller quality to it I
can't put my finger on it but it still
doesn't really match that of the iPhones
and here is the song being played on
what else but the iPhone I guess this is
the control part of my not so scientific
experiment
just a heads up everything you're
hearing it's being played with a flat
equalizer and the audio is recorded
directly into my zoom h4n the Android EQ
and presets are too good either so let's
get into power amp finally and see how
it can fix all this nonsense here power
amp is an incredibly well designed piece
of app there's a free version but it
expires after a couple of weeks and as
you can see the UI is a little tacky
looking you know sort of reminds me of
some winamp skins I used back in the 90s
and I thought I was ballin cuz I knew
how to feed my music player PS power
amps does have a handful of themes
unlike the incredibly limiting default
to music app power amp allows you to
take full control of how your music
sounds focusing specifically on
improving the sound quality power amp
gives you a 10 band fully customizable
EQ a preamp as well as post bass treble
and volume controls if you're not too
comfortable tweaking and customizing the
EQ no worries my friends be cowards
there's a list of preamp presets
available it takes some time to find
tuning tweak the settings to match your
headphones that you want to use but once
you've found that sweet spot the
difference is like night and day
hey the difference is like night and a
pineapple the change is that's dramatic
seriously music playback aside the app
is feature packed to the max everything
you want to do with a music player like
last.fm scrabbling handsets cross-fading
scanning sorting and slip controls and
much much more are there it even comes
with four different types of widgets and
they all work beautifully speaking of
beautiful I'm gonna take some time to
give a shout out to a friends at Netflix

today back to the review
unfortunately a realistic downside is
that this is only an application
software it can enhance sound yes
but it can't fix sound for example after
spending a lot of time tweaking the EQ I
wasn't able to find something else
happy with on the Nexus I mean I can
tolerate it but the quality wasn't
something I can just sit back and enjoy
I had the exact same issue on my HTC
Incredible S so I just ended up not
listening to music on that thing which
that's not very happy man it's not happy
at all the LG revolution was surprising
though the music quality is actually
pretty good on this guy as you can see
music and sound it's a very very
subjective thing some people like really
crisp treble some people like the mids
really high some people like their their
beats fast and their bass down though
goodness that's a terrible song but it's
true but as far as usability quality and
control goes power amp is epic totally
worth the 5 bucks which is why I give it
a solid 5 out of 5 thank you very much
for checking out this episode of what's
the apps now this is the let's sit down
and interact with the audience part of
the video I have no idea okay no idea
what to review next so if you guys know
a really really cool application that
you think not too many people know about
or if you've heard of a really cool
application and you don't want to spend
your time or even you know one two five
or even ten dollars buying the thing let
me know by commenting okay so for next
week and maybe just here on out I'm
gonna be checking out what you guys are
saying and I'm gonna be reviewing the
apps that you guys are suggesting thank
you very much for tuning in thank you
very much for listening to me this was
John Q from TechnoBuffalo
