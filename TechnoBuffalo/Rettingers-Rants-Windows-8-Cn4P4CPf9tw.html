to you by netflix welcome back to
another episode of rettinger transits
the show where I rant and rave on
anything from the world technology and
sometimes a little bit outside of
technology up this week windows 8 it's
only a few days away from launched I got
a lot to talk about if your fan of
Windows 8 or not a fan of Windows 8
stick around let's get ranting so I'm
free to talk about it now I had the
distinct pleasure of testing windows 8
it's very early phases until a final
release candidate and it was a bit of a
mixed bag so the first equipment of
assessing windows 8 on was a
non-touchscreen device I had to use a
mouse to nip you like the not Metro UI
modern UI Microsoft does not like if you
call it metro even though it puts hair
gel on and wears tight jeans does not
want to be called Metro it was a bit
tough to use the beginning just using a
mouse and trying to use a cursor
manipulate the modern UI then I was able
to get my hands on a touchscreen laptop
a next-generation ultrabook and windows
8 something became much easier to use
but one thing became very clear to me
especially recently i was looking to get
a laptop for my mother-in-law on
deciding what to get Windows 8 has a
tremendous learning curve if you're very
tech savvy you'd like to update and be
the first one to update you're probably
going to like Windows 8 however a big
warning if you do not have a touchscreen
do not update to Windows 8 Windows 8 is
an extremely revolutionary UI for
Microsoft whether you love it or hate it
you gotta give them credit for trying
something new and it works and it works
really well with the touchscreen try to
manipulate all the live tiles just does
not work with the mouse think of it as
trying to use Windows Phone 8 without
your finger it would be very very very
difficult settings are hard to find if
you want to try and shut the computer
off for example to take several minutes
to figure out how to do it then little
things like that tend to add up time
overtime overtime but if you're like me
and you like to explore you're going to
love the opportunity to do that however
for like my mother-in-law it is going to
be an absolute nightmare so if you're
looking to get a new laptop the near
future for you or for somebody else or a
desktop think about who you're getting
it for before you decide if windows 8
going to be right for you
say could I use Windows a on daily basis
yeah I'm not entirely sure yet I think a
real yet to be seen as how developers
gonna respond to the Metro UI they can
develop apps either for the Metro UI or
just for the operating system that'll
work just as regular windows apps have
it's been a bit of a mixed bag it's been
very cool to see windows 8 go from the
very first beta textures an alpha test
that i had to the phone or at least
cannock it's coming in a few days on the
surface it's going to be very
interesting but having a chance to use
windows 8 on a traditional laptop form
factor maybe even more excited for the
microsoft surface they're dedicated
tablet I think windows 8 is perfectly
suited for a tablet environment
especially with that little folder
keyboard should be pretty awesome setup
but the purpose of this rant and I wants
to rent a little bit to Microsoft is the
learning curve on this is tremendous
going from Windows XP to vista to seven
pretty simple things didn't change that
much you I changed a little bit was
gradual it was gradual gradual things
worked the same totally thrown all that
out with windows 8 and it can be really
scary and confusing for a lot of people
I enjoy the challenge you might be like
me a new enjoy triodes up and new and
dive in figure out the nuances but if
technology is something that you just
use because you have to use it at work
or you need it when you got to write a
paper you want to browse the internet
it's going to be completely different
even browsing an dead Explorer for
example in windows 8 was entirely new
experience everything used to do on a
computer is rethought re thunk that's a
word I wouldn't be surprised though in a
couple months I see Microsoft add some
of the windows 7's features back for
anything since a traditional Start menu
is going to be huge emissions to some
people aren't going to get to their
programs they're going to hit that
windows but another keyboard and have no
idea what happens next when all that
live tiles start popping up and things
become completely unintuitive with the
mouse do you guys agree disagree am i
way off base with Windows 8 I love it
kind of hate it I'm excited to use it
but I'm not sure I can use it on an
everyday basis except on a tablet I will
have full microsoft surface coverage
