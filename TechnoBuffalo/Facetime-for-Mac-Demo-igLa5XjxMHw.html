technobuffalo here you are looking at me
looking at you looking at me through the
new facetime desktop application for max
and iphone fours and ipod touches i'm
gonna give you demonstration as to what
this looks like mac mac and mac to
mobile device let's go ahead and get
started i am going to call one of techno
buffalos finest sean piane i'm going to
call him first abhiya hands i'm at can
see how this looks interestingly enough
your contact list is imported from your
address book on your mac there does not
appear lisa first blush be a way to
directly add contact right in the
application so much or what you do if
you don't use out of this book you might
have to sync without it but just to get
people on here so let's go ahead and
call sean i'll go ahead and call this
computer first and super look like look
very familiar Posey to use facetime on
the iphone 4 and it's raining and we are
connected you can see you've got your
mute button down there your end button
and go ahead and make it full screen if
you want to see Shawn's face full screen
but we're gonna go ahead and make Sean a
little bit smaller uh so Sean we are
talking to you on your imac how is the
quality looking on your end it looks
fantastic I your smoothness can be I
feel like a prom date man eyes up here
yes I'm sorry ma'am I'm I'm here okay
I'm a person uh-huh your quality looks
pretty good the audio looks pretty good
began at fun with or what's the point
audience audio is pretty good um let me
go ahead and try calling you on your
ipod touch and see if we have a
demolition of quality and we're going to
say expand look me in the eyes
alright so now we are calling Shawn's I
far ipod touch rather to see what it
looks like over a Wi-Fi of course you
get the same button across the bottom
and here we are over the ipod touch and
actually looks pretty good quality isn't
like his high resolution but Sean
yourself around a little bit see ya the
refresh rate looks like looks pretty
good turn it around too and see that
looks like actually looks very very good
certainly usable you know if you're out
and you want to show someone something I
keep saying that this would have been
the best technology to have when we are
in high school to feel what I have this
video chat would have been quite an
awesome bit of technology so who's in
our high school right now appreciate it
please call it looks pretty good Sean
when you talk and let us see what the
audio sounds like well I want you to
notice that I'm holding it where I'm not
staring at your chest now here's that
you're staring at my chest I think
you're making assumptions there Sean
quality guys look to be pretty good so
this is sort of a first look at FaceTime
it's still just in Veda so presumably it
will get better but it's very very easel
certainly on par with what we seen for
skype from desktops desktop and now
you've got desktop to mobile and vice
versa very cool Sean thank you very much
for taking the time nobody goodbye
alright so that was FaceTime</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
