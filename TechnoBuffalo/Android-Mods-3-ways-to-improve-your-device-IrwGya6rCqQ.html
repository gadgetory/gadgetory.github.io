it from TechnoBuffalo and today I wanted
to share with you guys some of the mods
or apps that I'm currently using with my
Nexus 6 now all of these apps require
root and not every app or mod we're
showing you today will work with every
device but just as a small disclaimer my
Nexus 6 is rooted and is running the
stock rom from google now you can find
all of these apps from the Google Play
Store in the description below so what
does rooting your device mean well
rooting will give you root access to
your device which means you'll be able
to access and edit the system files that
Google doesn't really want you to mess
with there's always the possibility
things can go wrong so root at your own
risk
so the first one on our list is the
franko kernel app so just a quick
explanation a kernel is the lowest level
of software on your device it acts as
the go-between for your device's
hardware in the OS it essentially
controls the CPU and GPU speeds of your
device so with something like Franco
kernel you'll be able to control a lot
of what's happening on your device in
terms of hardware if you want to set a
maximum CPU or minimum CPU frequency
you'll be able to do that inside of the
franco kernel app no problem so if for
example you set a max and minimum
frequency your processor is just running
at those speeds and that can take a toll
on your battery life in both good and
bad ways depending on how you set those
parameters so I usually keep my CPU
level stock and I've seen a huge
increase in battery life and we're
talking about 20 to 30 percent here now
if you don't want to mess with the CPU
frequency there are three preset
profiles you can choose from that'll
optimize battery life and performance
well Franco kernel is great at improving
battery life I also like the fact that I
can adjust a color temperature of my
devices display now the Nexus 6 is
screen is warmer than something like the
iPhone 6 or galaxy s6 but fortunately I
was able to change the RGB parameters to
my liking now probably the most helpful
feature is the double tap to wake
feature just like the g4 you can turn on
your screen by tapping your screen twice
it's a super handy feature that I'm sure
you guys will enjoy using franko kernel
is available in a Google Play Store for
four dollars and 40 cents in I know it's
a bit weird but remember you do have to
be rooted in order to take advantage of
this app so the second one on our list
is light flow now on a Nexus 6 Motorola
disabled the notification light for some
reason but fortunately with light flow
you'll be able to enabled the
notification light and control the
notification LED on a per app basis in
addition to the notification lights
you'll also have control
/ the vibration patterns and sound
settings light bulb lets you control
notification colors for over 600
applications and system events such as
missed calls
low battery text messages Facebook
Twitter and many many more for certain
devices that support multi colored LEDs
light flow a lot of colors to pulsate so
for example you have a text message and
a missed call at the same time the
notification LED on your device will
alternate between the two colors and you
can also set which notification type has
the highest priority and let it flash in
just that one color unfortunately on the
Nexus 6 the colors are limited just red
green and blue but if your device
supports multi color LEDs then you have
more options to choose from it's a neat
little feature to have if you want to
quickly see if you have a notification
you might have missed without turning on
your device light flow is available in
the Google Play Store for 2 dollars and
50 cents so the last one on our list is
titanium backup now titanium backup is
probably the handiest app I've ever used
why it's because I can pack up and
restore my apps and data with just a
single tap now as the name suggests the
primary purpose of titanium backup is to
backup all of your apps data in your
device settings you can automate these
backups and also backup files to your SD
card if your phone offers external
storage now this is especially helpful
if you're planning on flashing a lot of
roms which will delete all of your files
after each install and you can quickly
restore all of your settings apps and
data using titanium backup there's also
a pro version for $6 which will remove
the backup and schedule restrictions and
you can also sync directly to Dropbox
Google Drive to access your files from
the cloud now in addition to the awesome
backup features the pro version will
also allow you to completely uninstall
bloatware which I know some people just
can't stand titanium backup is free but
spending that extra six dollars is well
worth the money and you can save a lot
of time restoring apps and settings
especially if you're constantly flashing
proms anyways thank you guys so much for
watching and if you guys enjoy this
video make sure to give this video a
thumbs up and we will see you guys in
the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
