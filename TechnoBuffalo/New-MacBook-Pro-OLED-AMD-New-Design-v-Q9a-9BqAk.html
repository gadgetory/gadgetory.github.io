the MacBook Pro and haven't jumped into
something else already I have good news
and bad news for you the bad news is we
are not going to see it the beauty I
remembered September 7th event where
Apple's of legend gonna take the wraps
off the iPhone 7 the good news though is
that we should see it before the end of
the year especially believe the folks at
Bloomberg have a pretty good reliability
record so let's talk designs of the new
MacBook Pro the usual Apple suspects are
here thinner lighter faster it's gonna
have a smaller footprint than the
outgoing MacBook Pros knocking out that
taper design similar to what we see in
the MacBook Air we should have that old
LED strip sitting right at the top of
the function keys you can customize do
whatever you want if you're playing
music customer music playback editing
and then playback whatever you want
touch ID should also be built-in
actually to the power button which
shouldn't make your computer more secure
and also enabled things like Apple pay
straight from the computer the forced
attract method to be wider as well so
more room for for doing this and some of
that so I've long begged on the MacBook
Pro for offering outdated processor
outdated graphics looks like Apple is
going to rectify that they are ditching
Intel integrated graphics been going
instead with AMD's Polaris for
integrated if you opt for the top-end a
MacBook Pro you will have a dedicated
GPU option Apple's going with AMD and
supposing this chip will offer and I
quote desktop level experience and
incredible VR so if can handle VR it
should be very powerful
hopefully these updates will be worth
the wait as of right now Apple is two
generations behind processor wise on
their flagship MacBook Pros capi Lake
has just started shipping at least in
slow bits so presumably it will launch
with that as opposed to launching with 6
gen skylake chips so MacBook Pro OLED
strip touch ID way faster processor way
faster dedicated GPU and a new design
seems to make for a well worth the wait
redesign one that I know a lot of people
have been waiting for for quite a while
hey guys want to see more MacBook Pro
coverage how much update these rumors as
they come if the thumbs up button to let
us know the next time Drive render can
