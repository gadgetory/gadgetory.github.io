technobuffalo here and today we're
taking a look at the latest smartphone
and verizon's lineup to rock the awesome
combination of dual core and LTE this is
the HTC built resound with Beats Audio
livin in there let's go ahead and see if
it's resounding as the specs would have
you think
alright so we are looking at a black box
this does look like the shipping
packaging that you're probably going to
get when you walk into your verizon
store order it but there might be a
little colorful sheath over it as well
this was sent to us courtesy of the PR
folks at verizon and HTC well go ahead
and take off a jacket because it's warm
in here and we agreed it with another
black box it got verizon embossed on top
HTC logo on the bottom Verizon 4G
certified with their blazingly fast LTE
network go ahead open this up and there
is the resound with a pair of IB Ted
phones take a look at those in just a
minute go and get this guy out of the
box or at least try to turn it over come
near phone boom here is the HTC Rezound
it certainly does not feel like the
finished phone on the market push it off
to the side for just a moment see what
else we're going to have in the box so
we've got damn i beats go ahead and pull
these out there we go take a look at
these again in a sec we're going to have
a little magnetic monster package with
ibeats logo all over which is going to
have inside i'm guessing your tips hot
different sized your tips for different
sized ears and a clip to clip it to
things push that off 4g LTE sim card and
this is for will the LTE network sim
cards already installed in the phone
push that off got some books and manuals
got a cable micro USB for syncing and
we've got see if it's got one USB port
or two I was checked that now one USB
port that goes into the wall alright so
let's take a look at the phone power
this guy on and we'll talk about all of
its specs and the stuff that it can do
Steve's got a charge in it power on
there we go awesome alright so let's go
ahead and get a bit more into me here
the camera on and as this guy boots up
alright so here is the HTC Rezound this
is going to be available for 299 on a
two-year contract on November 14th it's
running android 2.3 point for we have
heard anything about ice cream sandwich
coming into it but it is a just-released
phone so presumably Ice Cream Sandwich
will eventually make its way on here
from dimension standpoint it's five
point oh wait inches by 2.58 by pretty
hefty point five four inches so over
half an inch thick and it weighs five
point seven eight ounces it's got a 4.3
inch that's always measured diagonal s
LCD screen the resolution of 1280 by 720
and if you're keeping track at home
that's a 720p resolution so go ahead and
and pull us up here take a look at HTC
Sense and all its glory the battery is a
1620 milliamp hour affair it's being
powered by a 1.5 gigahertz dual-core
Qualcomm built processor with one gig of
ram 16 gigs of storage expandable micro
USD on the back it's going to take a
look at the hump of this guy it's got a
camera with dual-led flash that's an 8
megapixel shooter that can shoot 1080p
video and got a 2 megapixel shooter on
the front we've seen a 1.3 megapixels
become pretty standard HTC stepped it up
here with a surprisingly good 2
megapixel camera of course you've got
verizon's LTE speeds which are awesome
and blazingly fast if you have LT in
your area and of course you've got that
b logo on the bottom which means Beats
Audio technology they're also going to
get this here pair of Ivy's headphones
let's go ahead and take a look at the
phone itself you've got your typical HTC
Sense buttons here in bright red they
are backlit as well you've got home
you've got menu back and search let's go
ahead and see we got in the apps
department gets there anything new and
exciting living in here God let's golf
heart pursuit backup assistant some
verizon stuff mobile hotspot gotta love
that you got a scanning application
Polaris Office verizon navigator but I'd
use that when you get the awesome
navigation rolled into the Android
operating system on the left hand side I
device you've got a microphone and the
grand reveal of the sync and charging
port on the left hand side volume rocker
up and down almost flush the device a
little bit hard to feel without looking
at it so if you have it up your head and
you're trying to feel where it is
definitely you're gonna want to get used
to it bottom you've got microphones and
the battery door where that gets removed
on the top you've got a 3.5 millimeter
headset jack and your power and lock
button and the back is made of this soft
touch almost rubber feel it's got a
almost different raises sides of it
you've got that texture
HTC part this is not a film it's going
to fall out of your hand it's not a
phone it's going to slide all along the
desk go ahead and English it's really
going to sit nicely from where you want
it to be go ahead and run through a
setup process here skip setup I don't
want to say anything up so definitely
not the finished phone on department but
you are getting some some pretty solid
specs I'd almost say next gen specs but
at the rate of dual core phones its LTE
coming out it's definitely a current gen
alright so let's take a look at these I
beats and it's hard to sort of show you
or let you hear it over over YouTube but
these are the I beat headphones and you
can plug in any headphones you want but
when you use a pair of Beats headphones
which does have control for play forward
back and an inline mic warning next next
so much set up finish there we go you
are going to get some improved audio
fidelity I'm going to go and plug these
guys in and we saw this Beats Audio
technology with the HTC built sensation
XL they'll go and jump into music
hopefully there's some music on here no
artists found well I can't even show you
it's going to look like no music found
that's disappointing generally when you
plug it in you get music and I'll show
you guys this in the full review you'll
get a little red bee icons going to show
up there at the top when you've listened
to non beats headphones which is beat
headphones the idea is that you can
certainly hear improve the audio with
these guys so something to keep in mind
if audio is important for you this is
probably going to be a pretty solid
choice for phones so I'm going to
continue to look through and see what
else we got let's go ahead and jump into
settings and we'll take a look at the
about this phone let's go down to the
bottom see what kind of software
information we're rocking here so HTC
sense 3.5 as mentioned android 2.3 point
for is remember if you can count to
three four I can see the baseband prl
and I'll let PRI versions and the rest
of that software stuff let's go ahead
and jump home so as I mentioned this is
not the only dual core LTE device
there's another phone on the ball
walk that roxas actually there are two
other ones here it's bring in the just
release one this is the droid razr
similarly spect but you notice a big
difference if you look at these two
side-by-side the droid razr is just
incredibly thin hump or no hump it's
still a much thinner than the HTC
Rezound the presumably the idea fidelity
is not going to be as good on the razor
but we'll put these two head-to-head and
we'll do a decision but in case you
wanted to see what these guys look like
that you get a kick out of it so push
this guy off this is the HTC Rezound are
you excited you're not excited is this
going to be your next phone I want to
hear from you be sure to check this out
