to you by the all new G flex 2 from LG
life's good hey everyone this is Todd
Hazleton from TechnoBuffalo I'm here at
CES 2015 checking out the brand new LG
Smart Watch it was built for Audi and it
runs webos an open version of it has
tons of applications you can use it in
your car to actually turn on the car to
unlock it and of course it syncs up with
your cell phone and stuff so we'll show
you the user interface and then we'll
show you how it works inside the car ok
so now we're looking at the user
interface of this it's obviously run by
open webOS it's built by LG for audi
specifically for this show you can see
here there's the Audi app that when you
tap it allows you to unlock the car you
can start the car anything like that you
tap back on this button get to the home
screen you can see the full menu here
and then I believe if you tap that again
yep you get right back into the menu
here so you could make a phone call
directly from it go into messaging for
your messages and won't you text looks
like you have some music view the LG
Health application calendar email clock
voice memo q voice that's LG's voice
control command center remote shutter
for a camera gallery so obviously you
can see all these things will sync up
with your phone find my phone so pretty
familiar here but here we are looking at
the watch you can see it's got a
beautiful band here nice metal edges and
then three buttons on the right hand
side one for navigation and then I'm not
sure with these two can you explain real
quick and this one's the back button so
if you'll get back some way out here you
can somewhere in some menu okay then you
get up to many you can just go back ok
then we'll bring up the menu to which
shows you your connectivity here the
brightness Bluetooth looks like a
vibration mode battery life the signal
strength and all of that and then you
can see if we just look around the watch
briefly got a beautiful leather band
it's tagged LG here though it's built
for Audi okay so now we're going to see
how the LG Audi SmartWatch actually
works with NFC to both blot and unlock
the car so in this case the car is
already locked
now tap the car door is unlocked close
the door I'll just drink and it's locked
now let's see how it works it's starting
to cook with the peso now when you're in
the car you want to start it to similar
process you take your watch and chap it
to the pad and then you hit the start
engine stop button right here the car
starts off screen pops out and you're
ready to go so there's no need for keys
at all ok so that was a quick look at
the new SmartWatch built by LG for audi
and actually what it can do for the car
and that includes starting it unlocking
and pairing with NFC it's all kinds of
cool stuff so it's not just a SmartWatch
and while that's really awesome the
webos features and stuff it's really
cool to see what they're doing with Audi
