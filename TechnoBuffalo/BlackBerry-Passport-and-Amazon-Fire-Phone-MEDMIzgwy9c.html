to you by Linda calm what's up everyone
welcome back there pisode of ask the
Buffalo I am a buffalo of the show you
could ask me any question you've got
from the world technology sometimes
outside don't know what phone to get
don't know what tablet to buy can't make
sense of what might be coming ounces to
show you can ask if you don't know why
it hurts when you pee you're asking me
the wrong questions you should see a
doctor that's not good up this week
we're to talk about prime phones the new
fire phone from amazon new blackberries
and t-mobile's uncarrier five and six
there's a lot of uncured is happening
possess the buffalo start asking the
first question comes from user at super
scientific who asks at john for lakers
what are your thoughts about the prime
phones manufacturers or flagships only
be released once a year so a couple of
things their prime phones are so these
rumored devices that sort of come out
ahead of the flagship sort of higher
specs and what you see we just saw the
new Galaxy s5 come out and select mark
tires inspect in the regular galaxy s5
we're calling kind of prime devices
rumor was HTC at a prime HTC One m8 that
got killed so should flagship released
once a year it's a business decision I
shouldn't say they should because it
affects me and I want make sure I've got
a new film for a year to do anything
different then get a year a bunch of
jerk holes that's not sure things a
business decision all the phones at come
out it sort of trying to run a business
I try and make money for themselves and
their shareholders these phones make
money so they're gonna keep releasing as
many as I think they could sell as many
as I think we are going to buy do I
think they should probably not I think
it focused more appetizing dollars on
the phones is already out and sort of
spend more time with R&amp;amp;D to create more
differentiating phones and then creating
seven different devices with different
screen sizes and that's about it but you
know that just might do sense but I do
think that we should see a flagship and
a prime mom looks to be the new way
things are going to go probably one of
each every 12 months
next question comes from ads mobile
gadgets at john for lakers what are your
thoughts on amazon's fire phone and
should they have used a different
pricing model to be competitive now you
might mean by different pricing model
use the same pricing model every other
phone is it's cheaper on contract it's
more expensive we want to buy it
outright I people are expecting some
crazy subsidized device like other
amazon products where you can get you
know with ads it's they're gonna pay you
five hundred dollars to use it there's
going to be free sponsored data and
gonna be shangri-la and through unicorns
and rainbows are going to shoot out a
unicorn's butts it was never going to
happen i did a video on my thoughts in
the fire phone i thought from the
pricing are it is what it is it's
expensive phone they want to make some
money on it I would have thought taking
a loss on the hard work take it back on
the Amazon things are hoping you're
going to buy but they did not do that
and they're right to do so I think sort
of the 3d esque effect early 3d it's not
coming out what's more looking in it's
very cool I want to see it with my eyes
first to make a judgment on it 720p
screen 2 gigs of ram quad core processor
the rest of the specs are kind of on par
I can forgive the low resolution screen
it's got that crazy perspective screen
on it other issues though is sort of
Amazon's OS is really loses google
features since is a fortune of android
i'm going to access to the Google Play
Store although there are hundreds of
thousands of apps in amazon's App Store
I really want to use it first and get my
hands to Genesis or look at it play with
it and see if I could serve use it on
daily driver it looks really nice on
paper certainly very very very expensive
than I think that's going to be advanced
gonna hold the back wouldn't be
surprised to see the Amazon fire phone
to come out at a much lower price point

a calm / TechnoBuffalo back to the
questions that question comes from at
Bobby a winner who asked at John
flickers what do you think of the at
blackberry passport in classic and os
10.3 / 10-point 3.1 ashtag asked the
Buffalo we get accused all the time of
just trying to kill blackberry hate
blackberry you guys are the worst black
people ever reality is we don't need
blackberry at all if we report their
sales numbers as bad we're not hitting
on blackberry reporting what the sales
numbers are black bears got a weaning
market chair unfortunate but they are
trying to change that with these are new
device the new OS is I think they look
really nice first I love the classic I
think it should know what the q10 was
it's got her the awesome blackberry 10
interface which I really liked but
you've got an actual set button and then
button the navigation pad the middle way
everybody expects black brace to look
like I guess probably be a huge seller
as well as that awesome physical QWERTY
keyboard I think things like the
passport look crazy weird say a big
rectangle with the big keyboard in the
middle of it I'm not sure how that
sucker is gonna sell but the are running
great os's with 10.3 and 10.4 one which
they're now gonna have access to what I
just mentioned that's Amazon's apster
which is a gigantic coup for blackberry
I can't overstate how big a deal that is
for black bear to have that all the apps
that you couldn't get before people
weren't going to sideload things on
their phones folks didn't know how to
sort a little bit confusing even though
it's your streamline the process to get
other Android apps on there you can
still do that but I've got another app
store right on your device to download
applications and that I think is going
to make blackberry 10 really really
competitive right out of the box you now
have those great apps of the amazon has
and you can sideload all the rest of
stuff you can't get on there like Google
services which is really really
tremendous you kind of get the best of
almost 30 esas in one on bb10 so I think
BlackBerry's got a few tricks up their
sleeve and I think the end of 2014 early
2015 could potentially be a big year for
them and the last question comes from
our friends at techno previews to ask at
John for lakers hi John I don't
t-mobile's announced it would you make
this switch Thanks hashtag ask the beat
so t-mobile and John ledger have been
doing crazy on carrier stuff coming out
for where the past
almost now almost a year most recent was
uncarrier 5 which is also uncarrier 6
they announced was you can essentially
test drive their network with the iphone
5s for seven days see if it works no
commitment you just bring it back
t-mobile store I see if it works for you
which is really cool people don't always
know if a phone is going to work at
their home at their office that's really
handy they had 14 day a sort of no
hassle return fall to take everything
back if you bought it this one doesn't
cost me anything just put a hold of your
credit card you use the phone try the
phone you see if you like it and you
bring it back to mobile store they
inspect it that whole comes after card
and there's no commitment for you at all
it's a really cool thing to offer I'm
being able to test drive networking if
they're saying the network is really
fast they're saying it's reliable it's
got voice over LTE on a now they want
people to try it I give them credit for
trying it the other thing was that your
data whatever you've got one two three
five limited is when you're not going to
sort of be deducted you start streaming
music on sort of music streaming service
which is pretty awesome a lot of big
music guy but no a lot of you guys are I
probably spend a lot of your data on
Pandora Spotify Rhapsody and the rest of
it so I think it's a huge huge huge huge
deal and yeah I would absolutely make
this work in fact I signed up for their
uncarrier 5 announced an observer of the
seven nights dana taking a phone for a
test drive i wanna see how it works I'm
gonna report on it we have a ton of t
mobile phones here but I want to see how
we look I priced my competitive plan
that I'm on the business is on with 18 t
for some but we're on t-mobile it's
almost one hundred dollar difference per
month that's a big difference so we're
gonna give t-mobile shot we'll try it
for seven days see how it looks bit
reticent to switch for a few reasons
first for the looming sprint deal
without spreads going to buy c'mon
what's that's going to mean for t-mo
sort of a big question mark so i would
consider anything at least for me until
I know that's resolved and then with the
iphone announcement coming out and
obviously we review devices we want it
which we can get them from day one
t-mobile doesn't generally have iphones
on launch day or they're not always
unlocked you do it the contract i don't
want to buy things on contract like sort
of have them so same what's going to
happen with the iphone launch same
what's going to happen with the sprint
merger sort of everything's i'm hoping
off from considering moving to
always right now hi guys hopefully help
to answer questions I hope you enjoy I
always loved making these videos if you
want to ask question upcoming episode
