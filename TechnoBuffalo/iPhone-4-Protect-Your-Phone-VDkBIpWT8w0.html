technobuffalo here in the world of tech
there are things that are awesome
getting a new device that fresh gadgets
smell double rainbows what's not awesome
dropping your phone which is what I did
over the weekend I have a dramatic to
reenactment for you get to do ah fell
right onto concrete on the corner
something I was not overly happy about
fortunately however phone still works
not a problem but I got lucky I don't
drop my phone very often it probably
happens once a year if even that but
when it does happen it's usually not so
good so I actually tweeted out that this
had happened and the folks at a case
sent me over a case to protect my iPhone
so here it is super legre case let's go
ahead and take a look at this guy it's
going to work with the iphone 4 on AT&amp;amp;T
or Verizon if we're outside of the US
it'll work with any gsm iphone so i need
five phone that you've got in your
pocket that's an iphone for this sucker
should work it's going to set you back
about 16 bucks there's a link down below
take it amazon which actually for the
next couple days today's the fourth i
think in two of the six if use that link
you'll get a discount if you want to
take a look at the case so here it is
there's the box in the writing looks
like it's got a silicone case on the
outside and a hard outer shell much like
me my wife tells me I've got a hard
outer shell but I'm soft on the inside
just have to get to know me I can
already see the comments going crazy for
that one alright let's go ahead and see
what we got we have screen protectors
that's pretty awesome they're actually
two of them in there so you can protect
your screen as well microfiber cleaning
cloth they're also good for glasses as
well I clean my sunglasses with them I
don't know how I don't touch the lenses
my sunglasses getting nasty
we've got the case itself pull us off
there's a little bit show you what it's
going to look like and here is well
there's a really nice sort of silicon
shell hear that you actually come all we
almost use it as a separate case this is
going to give you some shock absorbency
then you've got the hard outside as well
which is pretty nice alright let's go
ahead and install this slide it in and
let me review coming to on this uh this
red iphone conversion that i had done
you still have access to your port
stumble it looks like it actually will
help protect it from water damage as
well it'll cover it up let's push it in
here that can see the comments there as
well and your phone is protected it does
add a little bit of bulk to it it comes
out on the outside so when your phone
lands like this you're going to have
that rubber on the side of it so there
really any way you drop your phone you
are going to be protected including the
dangerous drop it right on the bottom
here you're going to have this extra
layer of rubber feels pretty good in the
hand everything looks to be still
exposed so we got that on the bottom
your 30 pin connector left hand side
volume got separate buttons down there
covered you've got the rocker on top see
we can get access to that 3.5 millimeter
headset jack if you're actually out in
the rain or you're in a rainy area if
you hold your phone up to your ear and a
water drop should fall right in there
it's going to trigger your water sense
your favor try to take your phone back
to the Apple so we're going to say you
have water damage you'll be like AI
never dropped it in water but that one
drop of water will actually void your
warranty it's a really nice thing to
have it covered if you're in rainy or
snowy environment lock button still got
that so it works without any problem
nothing on the right hand side and that
is it your speakers are still exposed so
I'm going to go ahead and use this for a
little while it looks like it's got a
real nice feel to it so you put in my
pocket and see what it feels like but if
you drop your phone if you're a bit
clumsy like me this is going to be a
great case to check out or at least it
looks to be that way it is the
Superleggera mandame a secure that for
NCAA shin pro
the folks at a case links down below if
you want to check them out again there's
going to be a little bit of discount
going on for the next couple days if
you're watching this video early anyways
have anybody picked this up what do you
think what do you use to protect your
iphone have you dropped your phone or
your Android phone or your webOS phone
or your windows phone 7 phone or your
analog phone or your banana phone
there's just one of you guys i'm jon
rettinger from TechnoBuffalo see the
next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
