to you by harry's what's up everyone
john rancher from TechnoBuffalo here in
what phone wants would be complete
without a little preliminary friendly
competition so i present to you the
iphone 6 plus and the one plus she was
you guys decide what phone is gonna be
right for you chances are there's gonna
be two you're at least going to consider
out in the market let's take a look at
the aesthetics of them and we'll dive
deeper into the software and we'll
compare them how they perform we get to
the full review the oneplus didn't want
to just give an overview from a purely
aesthetic standpoint so a fingerprint
sensor is gonna live on the bottom of
each of course you've got touch ID here
with a physical button you can actually
depress and push in this one you cannot
depress but is a capacitive button which
doesn't work this appears to work
relatively quickly we haven't had time
yet to test how good the fingerprint
sensor is going to work though your are
gonna have two buttons flanked on either
side go ahead and unlock it you can see
them two dashes one for multitasking and
then one that's going to tape you back
the bottom tells a story of connections
we've got of course the reversible
lightning on the iphone 6 and 6 plus and
notice the speaker grille looks real
totally familiar of course you've got
them on both sides on the oneplus 2 but
that right there while looking almost
identical to lightning is USB type-c if
we do a really cool fan motion you can
see the cameras here 8 megapixel sensor
living on this guy
and a 13 megapixel sensor living on the
1+2
both though rockin oh is so you can get
your shake images to be pretty stable
he's that's one of the benefits of the 6
plus vs. the iphone 6 if you look at the
right side device to see some
differences here as well we've got the
power and lock button living on the
right hand side of the iPhone 6 plus
volume up and down and then your power
and lock button on the right-hand side
of the oneplus 2 we flipped these
suckers over that's where your volume
buttons are gonna be on the iPhone then
you've got your profile switcher this is
similar to profile switcher it's gonna
meet our notifications so if you're in a
meeting I just want to go ahead and give
us a quick flip up I gotta go ahead and
mute everything for you
I'm not customizable he's quite yet the
folks from oneplus and are telling us
the main version that one puts - that'll
be shipping with 4 gigs of RAM it's also
going to be shipping with dual SIM
something
i phone certainly cannot attest to 64
gigs of storage here this is available
in 16 64 or 128 no 32 gig option on the
iphone so from a purely spec standpoint
the oneplus 2 destroys the iPhone but
the iPhone of course never been about
just stacks about the software and
hardware experience working together so
we get the oneplus 2 back in fact in
buffo office we'll test it we put these
two head-to-head so let me stop this
real fast first to say hi how are you
friend and to tell you there are a few
things that that I really don't like I'm
a fruit snax don't have any grape ones
in them and haven't go to the store to
buy razors I don't like to shave
fortunately Harry's cut out the
middleman for him to go to the store and
buy razors their starter kit is just 15
bucks that includes an awesome razor 3
blades of your choice arrey shave cream
or foaming gel whichever one you choose
on I'm a shaving cream man but personal
preference as an added bonus you also
get $5 off your first order when you use
my code which is techno I've using that
code to get in tires month worth of
Shaving for just 10 bucks you're getting
high-quality razors at a really low
price and shipping is always going to be
free so boom shave your face but least
for right now if you had to pick from
one phone based on this video which one
would you pick would you go for the
startup the 1 plus 2 or did you go for
the stalwart the one you know the iPhone
6 plus off here thoughts I don't even
the comments located in my pants region
for you you can't see that until next
time John rende you're protecting a
buffalo so guys the next video
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
