Samsung a new design language give it a
compromise all for the sake of beauty
the galaxy s7 whose at Samsung can learn
and react quickly does it have what it
take to rise above the rest and reign
atop the smartphone mountain let's find
out the design of the galaxy s7
assertive incremental from last Jin's
already good-looking galaxy s6 a for a
few changes and now has the rounded back
we saw on the note 5 line of phones and
as we all tend to do from generation
generation got a little thicker it's now
seven point nine millimeters left
thickness wounds we have a bigger 3,000
line power battery and it also means
that camera humph that plagued es6 is no
longer a worry with the s7 also here is
ip68 water resistance so no need for
Samsung to release another active line
of phones still little fingerprint
magnet though just like the last gen was
Samsung's made some of the best displays
for years so cheap any surprises the
flagship phone has a flagship panel to
match it 5.1 inches is 2560 by 1440 and
looks absolutely incredible you'd expect
that from a Super AMOLED display the
blacks are really black the colors are
bright and vibrant everything about the
screen looks absolutely gorgeous
assuming you are staying indoors should
you venture outside and in direct
sunlight this means going look very
washed out even the brightness turned
all the way up so bear that in mind
Samsung loves to put the latest Hardware
in their phones that's no exception with
the s7 in the US it's got a Snapdragon
820 and four gigs of ram and they could
expect the thing is an absolute screamer
not once did I have any sort of slowdown
app stutter nothing at all everything I
wanted to do happen very fast including
multitasking and even split-screen
multitasking I will say though it did
get a little bit warm while playing some
games and because benchmarks which
didn't happen here's our antutu score
and quadrant Samsung's bucked
electronics trend up going thinner and
lighter at the s7 they've actually
gotten a little thicker at 7.9
millimetres but it came with a good
reason and I was the bigger 3000 amp
hour battery built in which is a welcome
change and not surprisingly battery life
has been really good buy into the day
usually have 65 to 75 percent battery
life of left which is about 10 to 20
percent more than almost any phone I've
tested over the past few years if you're
a power user you're really gonna like
the battery on the s7 of course it also
has quick charging built-in via micro
USB so plug it into the wall for a few
minutes or so and I want to Samsung's
wireless quick chargers you'll be good
to go it's one megapixel camera on the
back of the galaxy s7 is another way
Samsung's trying to separate the s7 from
the competition and as it expects they
did a nice job here before you start
saying 12 megapixels not enough
megapixels Jon I need more give me just
bade miyan megapixels I say to you
friend these pixels are larger and are
going to capture 95% more light all that
coupled with an F 1.7 aperture and you
get incredible shots in low light of
course you didn't get great pictures in
normal daylight visibility or indoors
and office space pictures are going to
look really solid and Samsung's camera
app which you get really granular with
the settings so
so if your DSLR fan you like to tweak
all the settings or nearly would on a
camera you can do that here as well I'm
not gonna be disappointed
whatever I use a new Android phone and
Matt is manufacturer the first thing I
always do is download the Google now
launcher so when I got a new Samsung
device with TouchWiz Samsung's not
calling it TouchWiz but that's what we
like to refer to it as I was tempted at
first to install Google now but I
figured as I'm reviewing it it should be
honest review so I kept TouchWiz on here
and to my surprise it's gotten much
better in fact
I'll even go as far as to say it's kind
of good now theming is on boards - nice
edition you can now change the grid
sizes and fill in they have nice and
genius ways to move apps from one screen
to another I like the way the settings
are set up I still wish the app drawer
wasn't all the way on the right and I
still wish I could just swipe to the
right it acts as a Google now but
overall TouchWiz got pretty good a
couple other cool UI things they've done
the always-on display is here works well
it's always on but it is not going to
show a third-party notification so if
you're expecting to see those you will
be disappointed you have to look for a
third-party app to do that one other
weird thing Samsung did it with the
device marshmallow has the ability to
take an external sd card and treated as
mountable storage so take your internal
and your external make it onedrive that
it sees Samsung didn't allow marshmallow
to do that so when you put up an SD card
it's gonna be truly expandable storage
you can take it out put it somewhere
else add pictures on and put it back in
so bear that in mind it's not
necessarily a bad thing definitely know
if you're expecting to pop in a 200 gig
card to get 230 gigs of storage combined
you're not going to have it overall I
think Samsung did a really nice job with
touch with not sure if I keep it on here
as I use this device for longer but I'm
definitely not sure that I would
uninstall at least another launcher on
right away so you couldn't tell I really
like the galaxy s7 things are important
to me are good here the screen the
performance most importantly the battery
life are all awesome
toss in nice extras like I 468 they've
got a really well-rounded Android phone
and it's an absolute buy for me and from
TechnoBuffalo
the only small and slight caveat to that
is if you're happy with their galaxy s6
then you might want to wait unless you
need one of the new features like
expendable storage or the IP 68 but if
you want to get a phone it's gonna be
good for the next 12-24 months or even
longer you're gonna be really happy with
the galaxy s7
seems like this one at the park who do
you guys think do agree disagree you're
more of an edge fan and one hear your
thoughts on it even the comments down
below put your video a thumbs up we
always appreciate it the next time I'm
John rende your TechnoBuffalo path you
