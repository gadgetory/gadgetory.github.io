hey this is audrianna for technobuffalo
calm I'm here roku
we're here at Pep comp at the CES 2012
show and you will not believe what I
have to show you now it is da da da look
at the Roku look at that USB stick it's
actually not a USB stick even though it
looks like that like doesn't it just
look like that ya know if you look very
closely it actually has an hdmi port and
why is that because it's designed just
stick right into your television
basically this is like all of those
drool-worthy Roku's that you know they
actually are small enough as they are
they kind of look like hockey pops is so
handy I know people even travel with
them but I mean this is a whole other
class I mean look at it it's not out yet
they're looking for a distribution later
this year but they're looking at a price
point that will be roughly about the
same as current model so that you're
looking at something between 50 to 100
dollars and it's going to give you all
those roku channels you're going to be
able to stream hulu or netflix or
anything else that you want this
available in their marketplace and it
fits in the palm of the hand look at
that
so definitely if your vocal pan or a
part of the rotation already you're
going to want to keep your eyes open for
this this is Mariana Tecna bubbler

a wealth of information to your car with
simple voice commands sink will help you
figure out the best route to take by

along the way sting services will use
your GPS location let you know if it's
time to look for an alternate route I'm

business altogether thanks to Ford for
