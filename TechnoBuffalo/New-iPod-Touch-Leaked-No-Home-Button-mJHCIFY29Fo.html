TechnoBuffalo here you ever had those
days when you don't want to comb your
hair well I'm having one of those days
today so I'm doing a voiceover the
earlier this morning the folks at crunch
gear got their hands on what appears to
be a leet ipod touch and whether or not
this is a next generation model or a
prototype that was doomed to fall off
the ipod touch family trees yet to be
seen what's unique about this guy is the
lack of a physical home button if you
look at the image you can see that there
is a capacitive home button on the
screen but we are missing the actual
physical push me in feel the actual
button miss don't forget we saw some
firmware tested a while back it was in
beta of sense of developers that use
some multi-touch gestures around the
display in the bezel area this could be
the realness of that coming to market
that definitely has yet to be seen the
device is marked with the DVT one badge
I've just found on earlier examples of
the ipod touch that was found in early
2010 turned out to be legitimate
exported a front and rear facing cameras
this particular model has 128 gigs of
memory which is double what the current
ipod touch has and it's running firmware
for point-to-point 1mc 14 so it's
running an older version of the form or
firmware it's got an aluminum back which
is supposed to be the same backing of
the new iphone 5 but of course nobody
really knows and really considering the
firmware so old on this it's kind of
apparent that this has been floating
around for quite a while at least that's
what crunch gear claims as well so what
do you guys think about this new rumored
ipod touch for me the most appealing
thing would be 128 gigs of memory
hopefully at the same price point losing
the physical button i think would take a
bit of adaptation but what we're
potentially looking at here is what the
iphone 5 could look like certainly if
you take cues from each other back and
forth and not have a physical home
button anymore
and go the route of a capacitive button
by just having that little white square
there and eventually probably a little
wide squared go away on perhaps an
iphone 6 so what do you guys think would
you missed a home but would you not miss
the home button do you not care I want
to hear from you i'm jon rettinger from
technobuffalo and i'll see the next
video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
