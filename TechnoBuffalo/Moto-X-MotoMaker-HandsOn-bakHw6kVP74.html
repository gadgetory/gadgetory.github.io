technobuffalo I just wanted to quickly
walk you through the Moto X sorry it's
the moto maker online where you can go
through and customize all the colors on
the phone so if I wanted to change that
to royal blue with the maybe we'll go
lemon-lime change the front face to
white here we go change an accent too
maybe blue there then add a signature I
love my moto you can customize that any
way you want if you go to features here
you can change the amount of memory you
go 3-2 you're adding 15 bucks that's 249
now change the power on so if I want it
the first time powered on I want to say
hi hi Todd apply to phone so it will
come on and say that you can change the
wallpaper so when it ships you already
comes with one walk on any I don't know
a ton and google sync so you could
actually log in with your account
clicking that here sign in with Google
so when you get the phone it already has
all your stuff on it just kind of neat
then you can also buy accessories so if
you want your soul headphones and a
specific color to match your phone we're
not like I just did you don't have to
we're wall charger and just add white or
black you can't change the color that
doesn't look like so neat thing is would
these are coming soon I think they said
q4 you got rosewood ebony teak and
bamboo well they said they're still in
testing and depending on what they
choose their and have one dark option
one light but maybe that'll change so
you can actually have a wooden one with
your own accents too or switch it back
to the plastic bag in case quick look at
