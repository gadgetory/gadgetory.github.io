to you by Linda calm what's up everyone
welcome back to the episode of renter's
rants I'm rios john renters to the show
where I rant and rave on something or
the technology or somehow peripheral II
touching or related to the world of
technology like a first cousin of the
world of technology of this week I want
to talk about you in particular in
previous weeks I've ranted and raved on
how mean of the internet is a particular
how mean YouTube comments can be but you
deserve a pat on the back I think you
might be getting nicer this is rengar's
rants gonna get started the Internet is
a wonderful place and Sebastian of
learning a place to share information to
just check out crazy new things and a
best place in the world to see videos of
guys getting hit in the balls and it's
also a place where you can get bullied
where people have an outlet to unleash
just crazy hatred and vitriol like you
would never believe and I've talked
about that in the past I how it's a
really hard thing to do to be a video
producer content producer have to deal
with that content that's a deal with
those a negativity and have to find a
way to force yourself throw would have
your skin get thicker and thicker and
thicker without it chipping away from
you and for me personally it's been
really hard to do that it was really
hard the first couple years I did this
I'm a pretty sensitive guy if you didn't
know sort of hearing all these awful
things like Android is the best you were
an awesome human being and you and your
family should rotten a horrible horrible
pit of death and despair crazy things
that you wouldn't expect a normal human
being to say to another human being and
we've talked about it and now I can kind
of say that I think YouTube is getting a
little bit nicer at least on our videos
things seemed to be getting a little bit
more civil baby steps I'm not saying
everybody super nice and we're living in
rainbow land with unicorn farts coming
out of the sky talking a little more
common decency as being shown in YouTube
comments and I kind of appreciate it so
I put up a video while back talking
about my updated thoughts on the
microsoft surface pro and windows 8 as a
whole to summarize that video I kind of
changed my mind i kept using the surface
pro my home computer wasn't working and
I really realized after a while abusing
I liked it and I liked Windows 8
my opinions that I had initially didn't
really hold up anymore so I didn't
update a video I figured I've got the
right to change my mind so people were
commenting oh you know nice things for
doing that then there was the obvious
stuff oh how much did Microsoft pay you
or windows sucks you should go kill
yourself kind of things another thing
all those negative comments are getting
voted down and marked the spams not even
showing up anymore trying to see that
happen more and more and more in our
videos sometimes I'll go in and I'll
reply the trolls and I know I shouldn't
the more I do the thicker my skin gets
but eventually you can make it you can
get in there and I get upsets what you
want some questions my integrity like
how much did someone pay you to change
your mind and not only is that awfully
illegal it's also super unethical I
consider myself to be a pretty ethical
person and if anything is sponsored we
obviously have to disclose all that we
do sponsored content but we always tell
the audience it would never masquerade a
video as something that it wasn't and
something that you know I get called out
on something like that or threatening or
something like that it really gets me I
don't know why because I try so hard to
sort of operated company at a high level
of ethics and I don't know just it
always gets me things like that I would
reply to it's like to see the internet
being like hey you're a wrong person so
I just want to pat you on the back
