to you by Linda calm welcome back to the
episode of rettinger wrist is to show
right awk about anything from the world
of technology and sometimes outside this
week it's part of that sometimes outside
it's like the beyond section of bed bath
and beyond so in the past I've done
advice for aspiring youtubers and a
spice for advice for aspiring tech
reviewers this week I want to sort of
continue that trend i've talked about in
the past to go back and watch those
videos where our products come from how
to get attention on youtube how to get
past all the negativity that comes with
comments on YouTube this time I want to
talk to some of those folks out there
who are trying to establish themselves
in the YouTube world not necessarily the
younger youtubers by age but younger in
terms of how long they've been on
YouTube when i started youtube back now
almost six years ago there weren't that
many people doing it it was very easy to
get noticed in the tech world because
there just weren't that many people
doing tech videos now unfortunate a lot
of people that have much more talent and
much more skill and I do having really
hard time getting noticed and I want to
say that there's a right way in the
wrong way to go about getting noticed
and getting attention on YouTube and on
the internet that let me right and wrong
like it's bad to steal is wrong I mean
right and wrong like it's going to hurt
you in your career and be a detriment to
get ahead so there are all kinds of
tricks and shortcuts you can take to try
and get ahead in life and YouTube is
certainly the same thing you can buy
YouTube subscribers you could buy
facebook likes you can buy Twitter
followers then make yourself look bigger
I know it's very tempting to do that but
before you go in search and hit the buy
button let me tell you that will come
back to bite you squarely in the ass a
YouTube for example YouTube will shut
your countdown if they find out if try
to make a career as a youtuber you don't
want to build a foundation something
that can get you shut down in the future
you don't get shut down right away you
might get a check on your accounts and
that's nothing that you are going to
want also huge disparity if you get a
hundred thousand subscribers I'm YouTube
videos are getting a hundred views
there's something wrong there second
buying Twitter followers you might think
hey it's going to
can you look better to PR companies I've
got more Twitter followers I can make
myself look bigger and better and puff
myself out the industry bad idea very
very very bad idea that number is very
easy to find very easy to see how many
Twitter followers you've purchased you
can see how many Twitter followers are
inactive very simple tools give any PR
company ability to do that in fact more
PR companies are taking proactive
approaches to see what sort of followers
have been bought or purchased so it's
not going to make you necessarily look
good at all facebook it's very very much
the same thing in fact Facebook is
cracking down on people had to pay likes
by replacing peg legs with actual likes
so if you actually get a real person
liking your page your numbers not going
to change at all you are just going to
be hurting yourself so please think
twice before you do that and try and cut
corners there really is no easy way
success in life and YouTube is
definitely sort of continues that trend
second be honest and I'm not saying this
from an ethical standpoint saying it
from a business standpoint PR people are
smarter than you guys might think
they've been around this industry for a
while don't say that you might know
somebody when you don't don't claim that
there's an event when there's not don't
say you have a product when you don't
have a product people know and it's
going to hurt your reputation in the
industry and all the PR people they
talked quite a bit just cuz you're
dealing with someone you know from
sprint does me they don't talk to
someone from AT&amp;amp;T or Apple's I'm talking
somebody from google it's really going
to hurt you and it's going to come back
to bite you right in the butt second one
actually the Bobby the fourth one do not
buy stolen products this won't be a go
without saying but just don't do it
there might be a new phone coming out
and you might see a listing for one on
ebay before it gets announced guess for
that phone came from it was stolen from
the comfort that made it we're stolen
from the store we were supposed to be
sold at you are liable for all of that
content only can get your account
flagged it can get your account shut
down and legal ramifications could
happen it is never worth it do not do it
I see it happen all the time you want to
get ahead you want to get one quick
video that gets a hundred thousand or
two million whatever it is
video views or page views depending on
where you publish and then suddenly boom
your account gets shut down people know
where those phones came from there were
those tablets came from it is never ever
worth it and last do not pay for leaks
if somebody emails you saying I got a
picture of the new iphone for example
give me 500 bucks for it don't do it not
one maybe is more in the ethical
standpoint then really is going to hurt
your account but this one's something I
personally just feel strongly about
don't do it and encourages stealing I
think it encourages sort of monetary
gain now listen I know my bit
hypocritical we've got a tip section on
techno Bob when people send us tips but
we do not pay for those tips we have
never paid it for those tips and I
implore you guys to never do the same
thing and biggest video came across as
me sitting on a high horse but I see so
many people out there struggling and try
and find success on eating on the
internet and I see them going about it
the wrong way and I know that's gonna
come back to bite them and I know that
they might be hardworking and dedicated
and they might want to get that success
right away but there's no shortcut it's
going to hurt you in the long term
people are going to know and your site
your YouTube channel ever it might be is
going to pay the price no long-term so
these think about it before you guys go
and there might be a shortcut to get
ahead hence the really really isn't the
only substitute for hard work is even
harder work and that is very true on
