TechnoBuffalo here with a double dose of
unboxing for you a two-for-one we're
gonna take a look at Microsoft's kin one
and king two for Verizon Wireless I have
not seen either of these devices so I'm
kind of here to see if they look like
you sort of straddle a line between
smartphone and feature phone I guess
you'd call them a smart feature phone
they utilize Microsoft's new kin loop
and kin spot the loop being operating
system which is a way to integrate with
all of your social networks and to
dynamic tiles and the spot is a way to
share information share pictures photos
messages with friends and I suppose
family as well and I'll give you guys
the demonstrations to how all this stuff
works but in the meantime let's go ahead
and hack on in and do our unboxing I'll
go through the specs of each of these
and of course we're gonna use the big ol
knife and just sort of filling the bag
here you can tell me boxes are different
they're actually round most of the boxes
that I get her free square so this is a
much easier package ton box all right it
looks like here we have the Kin - kind
of interesting packaging looks like some
of those carnival peanuts where you
pulled out the snake jumps out of there
and we have the kin one in white I think
there's something else in this bag I
think it's the top two that kin two came
off I'm gonna put that right back on
alright so let's take a look at these
two phones let's start with the smaller
less expensive kin one and let's talk
some specs so they came one both these
are available on Verizon Wireless I
should mention the King one is going to
set you back just about 50 bucks so it
would be 149.99 after 2 year contracts
then you've gotten on like this down of
a hundred bucks so about $50 is going to
get you a phone with a 2.6 inch TFT QVGA
capacitive touchscreen so that's a lot
to sort of absorb essentially it's a two
point six inch capacitive touch screen
with a resolution of 320 by 240 you are
going to get a five megapixel
which is actually pretty good four gigs
of on-board storage twenty fifty six
megabytes of DDR Ram and battery that's
gonna last you about two hundred ten
hours of standby time and three point
I'm sorry three hundred forty minutes of
talk time on a package that weighs about
three point nine ounces that was a lot
of specs it's going to take a look here
so this is obviously a very
untraditional box sort of our round
cylinder is a little bit weird so go
ahead and open this thing up it looks
like this is still sealed so I can be
reviewer number one on this device cut
the tape there get the tape here how are
you give Microsoft credit for improving
their packaging other devices so I'll go
ahead and open this or at least try to
open it comes off like a cork pull
what's out you got some cardboard tab
nothing else in there but is green this
is very interesting packaging kind of
cool like will pull off it's sort of
elastic oh I think trying to get this
back in a box maybe a monster paint will
pull that off I would guess that it
probably opens up and it does open up
these are previously codenamed I believe
the turtle you may have seen this on
other sites I'll go ahead and pop that
out that is unlike any other phone I
have ever seen put that up to the side
for just a minute it almost looks like
I'll watch like a big fat watch more
than a phone love the way we talk
designed by Microsoft in Redmond no I'm
just kidding uh you turn me on
kin all about the kin settings dashboard
this does have zoom subscription service
integrated so you do get pretty much a
zoom player as well a little bit of
music with the Zune Pass and products
and warranty stuff push it off to the
side nobody cares about that let's see
what else we gets we have a little wall
to USB adapter that's probably Tommy's
laying around but that's all that is
let's see what else we have here we've
got a pair of headphones always a nice
increase
and the sink and charging cable which is
micro USB so would you have a standard
and we've got the battery here which is
of size
I'm gonna guess 1100 milliamp hours
based on the specs but let's sing ripped
open the package we are of size done -
done it is a sharp battery nope I was
wrong it is 1240 milliamp hours so it's
a pretty decent sized battery for a 3g
smartphone let's take a look at the
phone itself cuz this thing is super
weird it's got that little Ridge on top
gentleness fact I mean it is very very
small I mean it really does even look
like a phone I wonder helps would be to
hold up your face does have a slide-out
QWERTY keyboard see how this feels
keyboard actually has a very nice feel
to it the keys are very spaced out
generally I'm not the biggest fan of
this orientation slider because you
don't get a wider Keys but this is not
bad if you look at the keys compared to
say the Palm Pre Plus you can see that
there's much much more spacious here on
the Kin than it would be on the palm now
the screen is definitely on the small
side there has the dedicated smiley
button right there if you can see in
focus which is kind of neat this sort of
the evolution of the sidekick I suppose
since Microsoft acquired danger which
made the sidekick devices so very very
small Windows Phone Verizon sharp it's
got sort of a plastic back to it let's
see what else we got on the phone so on
the left hand side we've got the
charging port and I don't know if you
can call that the top or not but it
looks like the head of the volume
rockers up-and-down 3.5 milimeter
headset jack I'm guessing that is the
lock and power button there's a little
thing right there up that pops out
that's for the back it looks like we
have a hardware button on the side which
is probably for the camera let's pop in
the battery this thing live on camera
and see what this looks like on because
I'm very curious about this kin
interface so this may be a long video
here especially unboxing two of these
phones so I'll pop that off throw the
battery in and while it is booting up
we'll go take a look at the kin
to the Keen ones a big brother I gotta
tell you I was a little bit skeptical
looking at this but the hardware is kind
of fun I don't know if I could use this
as a daily driver but it's a very unique
form factor for a phone that interesting
looks like there's also another button
right there menu button in the middle of
the screen go ahead and turn that on yes
I think that's the power button we may
not have any set for charge at all in
the battery to power icing on it looks
like the battery is completely dead so
we have to charge it you're gonna have
to wait to see what this device looks
like for the next video we'll go ahead
and push all this stuff off to the side
all the Kin oneness and let's take a
look at Big Brother dressed in black the
kin to so let's talk specs of the kin -
it has the same resolution 320 by 240
but it does have a three point four inch
screen which is quite nice it's when I
set you back just about $100 so $200 on
a two-year contract and then $100 of
online discounts comes in at four point
seven ounces you're going to get about
three hundred and sixty five minutes of
talk time so you're gonna get about
twenty five minutes more of talk time
versus the King one and your when you
get up to two hundred and thirty two
hours of standby time this one has
actually eight megabytes of on-board
storage and 256 megabytes of RAM and has
an 8 megapixel camera which is pretty
impressive and these things are both
pretty well stocked with chorded
keyboard speakerphone GPS and the rest
let's go ahead and pull this off when
this top was already awesome when it got
shipped for the same experience green
side black bugs push that off same sort
of elastic go ahead and let's go bring
up like a coffin oops
good things go fixed around here alright
so here is the Kin - this one's got a
more traditional smartphone feel to it
push that off to the side probably got
the same sort of books in here I would
see you turn me on looks exactly the
same
but the Zune path and how it works we
just saw that in a minute ago we've got
the same charger we saw in the king one
USB to your wall
probably the same slew of accessories as
well you've got the headset and the
micro USB charger and the battery which
is difficult ly larger is of size any
guesses maybe thirteen hundred million
of hours it's always fun to try and give
it the battery life although this
plastic is harder to look at so it
entertained you and hopefully I don't
slice my finger off we're gonna go to
the big ol knife to rip this plastic
there we go
let's see what we got going on here this
is battery of size one thousand three
hundred ninety million of ours so a bit
bigger and that's probably why you get a
bit more talk time and it's powering a
little bit of a larger screen let's take
a look at here so we've got as you just
mentioned the three point four inch
capacitive touchscreen with QVGA
resolution you've got the thing gets
upside-down
you got the microphone port sir that yes
it's a home button of some sort you've
got your microphone or speaker rather
top on the left side of the device
appears to be nothing on the right side
it looks like where all the action
happens got your volume up and down
power button shoulder button under maybe
that's the power button perhaps that's a
camera button and there is the eight
megapixel camera that this thing has
which is a pretty powerful camera 3.5
millimeter headset jack and it has a
slide-out QWERTY keyboard these buttons
are a little bit weird very round I'm
not sure what that green button does
again I've never even used an idiot keen
devices so this is all very new to me
it's a pretty simplistic slide-out
keyboard really just your standard it's
three rows or keys at the fourth row
being a monster spacebar and if I don't
have dedicated number pad you got to
probably at the green button which is a
shift and then go to your numbers let's
go ahead and pop in the battery for this
one see if we can get one of these power
on these give you a bit of a sneak
preview as to what the device looks like
and I was probably hitting the wrong
button on the Kin one turn it on would
be would be my guess let's see if we can
Jimmy out the back of this thing here
yeah I tell you sometimes getting these
things open as a hard part let's see if
one of these other butt
on the Kin is the power the key in one I
gotta tell you on first blush I'm kind
of partial to the way the kin one looks
and feels it's just it's very unique
the kin two has a more a traditional or
smartphone feel to it you know the slide
out but this is just it's a tiny with a
surprisingly usable keyboard although
I'm wondering how usable that screens
going to be so we're getting our kin
animations here on the Kidd one I was
incorrect by saying that that was a
power button the big one it's probably
the camera shutter button the power
button is actually that right shoulder
that's probably the lock button as well
so I'm like doing this little kin thing
here alright that's like that's just its
boot up screen change your language
I don't think me to do that cancel it's
already in English we'll go to English
connect the Verizon network so I'm not
gonna make you guys watch a list it just
calls Verizon lets you know that the
phone is activated it's waiting for
instructions that's about it but it's a
very interesting phone with the really
surprisingly spacious keyboard I'll do
some hands-on time with both these
devices if you're considering the key in
one or its big brother the kin two to
see which one is right for you so what
do you guys think about these kin
devices I gotta say overall it without
even using them yet
I'm impressed the packaging it was a
very high-end experience and the phones
themselves appear to be relatively high
quality although how the operating
system works how it integrates with the
phone who knows how that's gonna be but
for right now it doesn't look half bad
much better than I expected
