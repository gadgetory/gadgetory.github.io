the senior editors at TechnoBuffalo comm
and I just wanted to give you a quick
rundown of some of the PS Vita's user
interface features all right so when you
actually pick up your PS Vita if you
actually pick up a PlayStation Vita
you're gonna be greeted with a few
features when you fire at the system and
through your daily use it works a lot
like a cell phone actually with with all
touchscreen based manipulation when
you're inside the main OS of the device
that's the lock screen obviously with my
custom background there so this is it
this is what you're gonna see sans that
wallpaper maybe this one when you fire
up the system for the first time that's
the default set of applications up there
and it's several pages worth of content
you can add and remove pages as you see
fit I just put my games down on the
bottom page for a matter of organization
these are interfaces a lot like a smart
phone is and there's basically
applications here that you can launch by
tapping you cannot stack them
unfortunately so if I were to launch
into the customization screen you can
drag you can drop them but you can't
stack so if you're a neat freak like I
am when it comes to this stuff you won't
be able to stack your your individual
apps and the single trays or folders so
the system is actually pretty sweet I
have to commend Sony for what they've
done here they they worked basically a
new level of immersion into the device
and into portable gaming
you have a notification which you can
see spinning here the notification
bubble it just tells you what you're
doing on your on your PS Vita at all
times and you're notified when things
finished downloading when you unlock a
trophy and then there's the really
really great multitasking something that
to be honest isn't even handled that
well on the PlayStation 3 is handled
extremely well here and the machines
never really sluggish I mean it's super
snappy as you can see these are all the
applications I have open now just just
to kind of illustrate what it's capable
of if I were to actually launch a game
for instance so you can actually update
from here you can go to the game's
instruction man you can search for it on
the web you can download the updates you
see that ball that popped up it's the
activity log shows you what I've been
doing and wipeouts and if I wanted to
quit any applications I can just peel
back this sticker here so when you watch
a game what's great about the PS Vita
and one of the things I love about it is
that it does have full-on gameplay
experiences but then it also kind of
touts this mantra of pick up and plate
it's so standard and portable today you
can suspend the game at any time I could
lock it if someone walks in or I need to
be doing something and when i unlock my
device it's it's ready to go
it's pretty much exactly where I left it
um and that works for the PS button as
well so I can go and I can look at my
friends list if I want to think I have
that open actually just hop in our
friends list and look and see what's up
yeah yeah plus is thinking with the
servers here but that's fine so I can
hop in and check things out and then hop
out
now I may actually do some gameplay
videos later if you guys want that but
for now this is basically what you can
expect when you're looking at your PS
Vita for the first time it's really
smart multitasking decent UI some of the
customization things are going to bug
you like app management that type of
stuff but honestly this is a fantastic
interface for the device and stay tuned
is technical for more PlayStation Vita
