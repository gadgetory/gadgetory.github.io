gotten a lot of requests to continue
comparing the iphone 3g in the palm pre
there are a lot of features that people
wanted to see head to head and wanted to
compare Wi-Fi speeds when the iphone 3gs
launches next week start a whole new
series comparing the 3gs with the pre
that will be comparing modern hardware
versus modern hardware let's go ahead
and get started first one lock both
devices picture twice dragged up and
slide over now the first thing that I
want to compare is time it takes to get
online so I'm going to push the browser
button on the iPhone and push the
browser button on the pre but note that
the iphone takes you right online the
pre take you to the bookmark so we'll go
from bookmark to bookmark actually so
we'll launch that and here we have the
pre so we'll go ahead and launch will
launch like website so we'll launch
youtube at the same time so I'm going to
type that in okay so youtube drama for
lakers and john for lakers here on the
bookmarks and will do exactly the same
time over exactly the same Wi-Fi network
so this will be a very fair test and
they are both off and looks like the pre
is already done handily beating the
iphone 3g certainly when the 3gs is
launched it expect possibly different
results but this is launched an exact
same page at exactly the same time on
exactly the same Wi-Fi network so this
is mostly a test of the hardware of the
two devices definitely something to keep
in mind also people said that my screen
rotation comparison that i did in
previous videos wasn't necessarily fair
and accurate because the pre just had a
web optimized page on it and the iphone
3g had an actual page so let's go ahead
and compare screen rotations on each so
let's start with the iphone 3g and i'll
show you this on its own
and then do a head-to-head comparison
take the phone hold on side and there's
the screen rotation go back up let's
pull out the pre let's try the same
thing so let's try the two together and
see how we do it zoom out just a bit
that was actually relatively close and
the pre was still just a little bit
faster I try that one more time it once
again the pre is just a little bit
faster but you almost would expect that
from a faster processor and a little
more modern hardware the pre was just
released last week the iphone 3g is just
a week old again the 3gs you'd probably
expect relatively different results so
let's talk a little bit about navigation
here we'll go back to the home screen on
each I'll throw this card away the
navigation on the pre is very different
from the iphone but in a lot of ways the
same if that makes much sense so on the
iPhone you've got your four icons across
the bottom and you've got your home
screen that you can scroll across and
the icon stay static on the bottom on
the pre you've got your five icons on
the bottom and I should correct myself
as well from a previous video saying
that these can indeed be customized and
anytime you want to scroll from the home
screen actually have to launch a
launcher and then you can scroll through
your icons like that and they can be
rearranged on either screen so let's
compare one of the applications that I
use quite a bit Google Maps we're going
to compare it for the iphone which runs
natively or the palm courage actually
runs google maps via the web since this
was a web operating system so it's very
interesting how they were able to
optimize a web app let's go ahead and
launch google maps but i can find it
there we go and google map should be
very familiar there was a pizza place i
was looking up if you ever use google
maps the iphone version is quite similar
found my location you can move around
you can zoom in it's very smooth being
a native app and now connected over
Wi-Fi you peel up you can drop your PIN
show traffic satellite view hybrid or
list now on the pre it's interesting
let's go ahead and launch this and it's
a little bit of a different UI actually
so it actually has to connect to web
site and download all the information
since it is just a web app but it
definitely enough it works just as well
do you get that same icon to find your
location so you can go and find my
location and there is and you can do
that same multi-touch zooming if you
pull up the menu which are just the same
as peeling back that page you get very
familiar options show traffic get
directions satellite fewer clear map so
getting traffic is a pretty intensive
thing so let's go ahead and put on
button let's go ahead and show you what
that looks like you can see that it's
actually very quick pulling up the
traffic again this is over a Wi-Fi
connection but a lot of concern was how
the previous going to interact with the
web and how these web apps were going to
work and I got to say so far they almost
look native and been very impressed with
the palm pretty so just wanted to give
you another head-to-head comparison of
the 3g and the pre just a few features
that i use all the time probably you use
all the time as well and the last one
that i want to show you is the phone
application let me go ahead and open
that up on the iphone 3g it should be
very familiar to a lot of you most
people have or most people watching my
videos at least seen an i phone dialing
application but you may not have seen
one on the palm pre let me show you what
it looks like and you'll see that they
look very similar and there's a reason
that they look very similar actually one
of the head designers on the iphone
actually left apple to work for palm is
actually now running palm as how come on
the iphone esque Hughes will say came to
the pre will say the pre was influenced
by the iphone but in all fairness most
modern touch screen phones were
influenced somehow by the iphone so
here's the dialer application very nice
and similar there is no visual voicemail
however as of yet on the palm pre and
it's relatively what you'd expect
the speaker on the pre though I will
tell you you could probably hear it
right there is crazy loud from that
speaker on the back it is really really
really loud actually had to turn down
the volume because it was too loud so
hope you enjoy to make sure you stick
around next week for a comparison of the
3gs versus a palm pre and we may have
very different results hope you enjoyed
