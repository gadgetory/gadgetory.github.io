TechnoBuffalo here I've been a big fan
of the Microsoft Surface line ever since
the very first surface pro what we've
got today to unbox is the latest in that
lineage it is to Surface three not the
surface pro 3 this is going to be a
little bit speck down but certainly much
lower priced option and you are going to
get a full version of Windows here not
getting any sort of RT and also of
course upgradable to Windows 10 when it
hits alright let's go ahead and unbox
and see if the surface 3 has to offer
starting price is $499 compared to the
starting price to the surface pro which
starts at just about 800 the box though
looks identical go ahead and slide that
out nothing else on the lid go ahead and
pull this out and there is the very thin
surface 3 so else we're going to have
inside should have an accessory pouch in
here which we do and inside of that
we've got and that's about it we've got
a micro USB charger to charge the sucker
up and a very long USB cable and a well
work with one port to connect it with
and that is it to put all the stuff off
the side let's talk about why you're
here and what I want to see at the
surface 3 alright so here is the surface
3 as I pull this out of its plastic
hopefully get my satisfying we should
know is that I love there it is we are
greeted with a ten-point eight inch grey
dense 1920 by 1080 with a three by two
aspect ratio available in two different
sizes configuration it's either 64 or
128 powering this guy is a quad-core
Intel Atom chip you want to get
technical
it's the x7z 8,700 processor with two
megabytes of cache one point siga hertz
with intel turbo boost tech up to 2.4 it
weighs a relatively light one point
three seven pounds or 622 grams and you
compare the weight of this to the new
macbook which comes in at about 2 pounds
significantly lighter rams a bit
different you get 2 gigs of ram with 64
gigs or 4 gigs around 128 gigs if you go
those storage routes so bear that in
mind there also are ports
plenty on the sky we've got a full-sized
USB 3.0 port you've got a mini
DisplayPort and you also have a micro SD
card reader on the back of a megapixel
rear facing camera with autofocus and
we've got a 3.5 megapixel sensor on the
front you're gonna have 10 hours of
battery life - added this guy and of
course what the surface is famous for is
a kickstand you've got a three-point
kickstand as opposed to the sort of
multi-point kickstand on the surface pro
3 see the different ways you can display
this as I power it on we'll also walk
around the device and take a look at all
the buttons so similar place we've got
your power button your volume up and
down nothing on the side top or bottom
magnetic ports down below which can be
used with the surface type cover which I
really like that's docks it nice and
easily
this goes ahead and uses a magnet to
sort of prop itself up bust out the
kickstand any direction you want now
you've got a full functioning laptop
pull it off and you've got a tablet here
I've got a full track pad that can click
and you can also take advantage of the
surface Pen features if you're a fan of
those are sort of been admiring your
friends to have a surface pro 3 you can
use that here with the surface 3 alright
so you've got this guy all signed in and
restore from backup from our surface pro
3 and like I mentioned you've got full
windows here you are not having any sort
of pared down version you get full
access to the desktop and of course you
get the Start menu with the live tiles
everything you want different windows
you are going to get here and of course
when Windows 10 it's that will be a free
upgrade here as well all the
multitasking and stuff you'd expect are
all here on the computer and for the
price of 4 on you and it looks to be a
pretty good deal but I'll reserve
judgment until I get a chance to
actually test it and see how it performs
playing video hooked up to the dock and
even doing some light gaming on it
anything you guys want to see about what
it can do or what it can't do even the
comments down below I will check it out
make sure we cover that in our full
review the video a thumbs up I was
appreciated until next time I'm John
renter from TechnoBuffalo
see you guys next video buh-bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
