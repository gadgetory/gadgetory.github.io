jeffrey TechnoBuffalo here i'm taking a
look at the ipad pro but also the new
smart keyboard that's going to go with
it so this is made out of a woven fabric
you can feel a bit of texture to drag
your finger over it but it feels very
smooth and type on it's almost a very
similar throw but you've got in the
current MacBook that's because it's got
the same switch keys that are found in
the current generation Mac luxe also
typical computer Keys you see here
control your option and your command
keys the throw on it is pretty similar
again to the MacBook not super deep but
keep it up - you're definitely pressing
something what's new here though is how
it's going to connect to the iPad pro
you can take advantage of sort of a
three magnetic connectors on the bottom
so to pull it off
just pulls right off and there you can
see those three little magnetic
connectors and to connect this again
it's very simple process just go ahead
and put it right on as you expect it'll
dock right in and fold in addition to
being a really usable keyboard it's also
going to protect your iPad as well got
that microfiber cloth inside of it go
ahead and close it up and you are fully
protected it doesn't add much thickness
to it and it feels very similar to the
smart covers that we see right now if
you look at pick up an iPad pro for
productivity Delta XS you're going to
want to look at if you're thinking about
that three prong connector being used
for other things apple says it will be
used for a slew of other accessories
