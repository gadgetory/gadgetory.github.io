them but does this year's entry from
Asus have what it takes to tango with
the big boys I'm our percent over
TechnoBuffalo and this is the Zen watch
too just a quick disclaimer on the top
of the video I use these n watch to over
a period of three days I'm going to
continue using it for a little while but
that was the official review period does
that watch'd use primary selling point
is its affordability the base model
comes in at a cool 130 while competitors
like the Moto 360 are asking twice that
price the model that we have here in the
office to test is the $150 model with a
leather strap once you become pretty
accustomed to Android wear most devices
running it kind of meld together so
let's focus on what makes these and
watch two different does it much choose
form factor is a bit striking when you
compare it to other wear devices
probably because of those giant bezels
seriously the giant bezels
they're huge aside from the bezels
though I actually kind of quite like the
look I'm usually not one for the square
wearables but the rounded corners on the
device and the kind of subtle curves
around the back almost almost make me
forget that the display itself is square
overall though it's the kind of
unassuming device it's like pretty
enough it's not ugly aside from the
gigantic bezels it's actually pretty
decent wear I hope the Zen watch too
would Excel was in its battery life and
fortunately it didn't disappoint in fact
I found it on par with the brand new
Moto 360 this year's Moto 360 it can
easily make it through a full day day
and a half with some juice left in the
tank and that's with ambient mode turned
on the display is much smaller than the
Moto 360s but the colors are still
pretty strong and the screen is just as
responsive as most wear devices so at
least so far as I can tell the
accelerometer is super responsive to
everything behaves as it should lifting
it to your fate in fact maybe the
accelerometer is even just a little bit
too responsive lifting it to your face
everything works as you would expect it
to in fact everything else on the device
is pretty standard Android wear fare
four gigs of storage onboard half a gig
of ram Snapdragon 400 clocked at 1.2
gigahertz you know all the usual stuff
it does have a slightly lower resolution
screen at 320 by 320
for a PPI of 278 but it's more than
enough to get the job done and
truthfully it's small you know it's on
my wrist I'm not watching movies on the
thing I'm not huge on the charger that
Asus provided but it's the least of my
worries to be honest the one notable
omission here is the heart rate sensor
but to be honest I find that to be more
of a novelty than anything else I don't
use it all that often on my motor 360
and I have a hard time believing that
people do use that often to begin with
of course in typical Asus fashion there
is also a plethora of software features
that you can take advantage of if you
should so choose I'm super thankful
though that Asus made most of these
optional downloads and didn't saddle the
device down with them so Bravo AC is
nicely done there are just too many apps
integrations and Asus specific features
to outline here but suffice it to say
that if you're an Asus ecosystem you're
going to be pretty happy with the
features offered you can do custom watch
faces you can have alerts based on your
issues phone all kinds of fun stuff if
you're not an Asus user for your mobile
device you still have an Android wear
device so it's really no skin off your
back I keep waiting for a big catch here
the device itself is half the price of
some competitors so there must be
something that I'm missing right well
doesn't seem like there is to my eyes is
that much to is a fantastic bargain at
its price point my only reservation is
that the look and feel the device might
not be for everyone so if you like or
can deal with at least the giant bezels
the Zen watch 2 makes for an excellent
choice for those of you looking for a
wear device on a budget there you go
guys my thoughts on the Zen watch - I
actually really enjoyed using this thing
I'm super surprised and I'm kind of
surprised with myself because I'm
considering keeping it over the Moto 360
especially given the price point I want
to grab one for my wife too because
there are only a hundred fifty bucks
what do you guys think
are those bezels just a little bit too
much for you guys not quite enough to
justify that hundred fifty dollar price
point let me know in the comments you
can also hit that subscribe button if
you'd like to come over to my house for
a awesome tea party than I'm having this
weekend otherwise thank you guys so much
for watching be kind to one another and
I'll talk to you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
