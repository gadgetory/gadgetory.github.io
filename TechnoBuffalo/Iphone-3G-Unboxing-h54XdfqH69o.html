well wherever you are aunt I've got a
much-anticipated and much-hyped unboxing
for you guys today one I'm very proud of
one that got me up at 5 4:30 in the
morning one that took a just nine hours
to actually get had some troubles but
I'm proud to bring you an unboxing of
the 3G iPhone the iPhone 3G or actually
a rien boxing since Apple has to open it
up before they give it to you first
thing I want to show you guys is the bag
it came in case anybody cares white bag
iPhone I got the black 16 gigabyte I was
thinking about the white the white one
looked really slick by the end I'm on
black and 16 gigs iphone 3G so let me
show you guys the box here and it's
upside down and I'll get to the unboxing
picture the phone on the front iPhone 3G
inside all that business on the back i
phone 3g so let's go ahead and get to
the unboxing hopefully this will work
out so I got the box like I just showed
you opens up very similar to the old one
there's a screen protector on this year
hence a little air bubbles haven't come
out yet it's just about an hour old got
the iPhone itself put that aside I'll
walk you guys through that in just a
minute this I haven't really even opened
up yet so we'll see what's in here got a
WoW tiny little wall plug
wow it's nothing to it in the USB goes
right in there I mean that is small
very slick looking so I'll put that
there
got the USB cable for the phone and
we've got a set of headphones that's
what's in the box
and it looks like also underneath here
is a little bit of business so let's see
what you got going on in here oh this is
the infamous sim removal tool
right here that little metal thing you
can pull it out oh it's like a paperclip
you just stick it in the top of the
iPhone you guys can see right there is a
little hole you just pop it in and your
SIM card comes out so simply move all
tool really exciting fingertips that's a
clever play on words I guess iPhone 3G
or some information and the obligatory
Apple stickers I don't the fingertips
are make a call go home kind of shows
you how to work the phone and it's like
they give you a little cleaning cloth as
well um that's new and handy and it's
emblazoned with the iPhone logo right
there it's very faint I'm if you guys
can even see it let me show you guys a
little bit about the phone I'll do a
full hardware or if you have it later
but want to make sure you guys get a
chance to see this and you'll be able to
see this video on my youtube channel as
well as my website @
www.projectorpheus.com down on the above
the volume up in the volume down you've
got a ringer toggle which will change it
from vibrate to ring we just flip the
switch very handy on the top you now
have a flush 3.5 millimeter headset jack
which is very nice and you've got the
hold and power button at the top the
left side of the phone doesn't have
anything get back here is your charging
port and syncing port we've got a
speaker grille and you've got a
microphone and then obviously there's
the speaker for your earpiece the back I
got the black which does appear to be a
fingerprint magnet and you clean it up
way before I show you guys I'm not
embarrassed with that handy included
cloth there we go
shiny and black concede or even RC
reflection iPhone 16 gigabyte I'm just
gonna be nice and obviously there is a 2
megapixel camera the same one that was
on the first generation
i phone let me show you guys just a very
quick comparison between the iPhone 3G
and the edge version of the iPhone the
og iPhone the original so let me go
ahead and pull this down and show you
guys just real quickly from the top its
kind of tell a difference but this one
here is the 3G phone they look very
similar again this being a 3G very
similar footprints as you can tell side
views both look you know pretty
identical and the backs really where you
can see the most difference the iPhone
3G does feel a little more solid in your
hand feels a little nicer to hold
because of the tapered edges pull us
back up here so how do you guys and if
you I'll show you the headphone jacks on
top but you can see the difference
between the recessed and the non
recessed turn us around for you notice
right there you have to actually push
the headphone into that little slot so
most headphones don't extend that far to
plug in the iPhone 3G fix that it was a
real big flaw the original iPhone that
was it guys just wanted to give you a
real quick unboxing of the iPhone 3G we
