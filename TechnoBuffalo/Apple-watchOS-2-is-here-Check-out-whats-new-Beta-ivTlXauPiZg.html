hanging from technobuffalo and in
today's video we'll be showing you guys
some of the new features included in the
latest watch OS to update for the Apple
watch we've been playing around with a
new update for a few days already and
here are some of the new things we found
so the first one in our lists are the
native apps on the Apple watch a big
focus of the new update was on making
the experience of using the Apple watch
richer and more engaging and Apple is
hoping to achieve that by letting apps
run natively for better performance this
means apps for run entirely on the Apple
watch instead of loading them through
your iPhone apps will also be more
powerful this time around because it'll
take advantage of the Apple watch's
hardware like it's digital crown for
such technology in its heart rate sensor
number 2 is a time-travel feature time
travel basically lets you see what's
coming up in your day things like
upcoming events the weather and more up
to 72 hours ahead and you can also see
past events 72 hours back by turning the
digital crown to see what you've been up
to the feature is executed by using the
digital crown and it's particularly
useful when you have a lot of different
complications which are the little
pieces of information that shows up on
your watch face as of now you can only
use this feature by using the modular
watch phase number three of the new
watch faces during WWDC Apple showcase
two new customization options for the
Apple watch one of which is a new time
lapse watch face which shows a
time-lapse video of iconic locations
around the world like Shanghai New York
London Mac lake and Hong Kong if you
want even more personalization you can
use either a photo album or a single
photo the photo album option will cycle
through the photos you have sync on your
Apple watch while the single photo
setting will let you set a particular
image as your watch face background
nothing too complex but a nice way to
make your Apple watch more personal
number 3 is a new nightstand mode this
new mode will enable the Apple watch to
serve as a bedside clock at night when
you lay the watch on its side it will
display a large digital clock as well as
other information like current power
level and an alarm it's strange that
this feature wasn't here from the
beginning but it's certainly a nice
addition when your alarm does go off you
can press the digital crown to snooze or
the side button to turn it off number 4
are the new features in digital touch
and friends and watch os/2 you'll now be
able to see multiple colors in your
doodles but unfortunately only watch
os/2 users can see the additional colors
in the drawings users who are still on
watch OS one will only see single colors
also you can add multiple friends screen
on the latest update
as well as add users directly on your
Apple watch previously you'd have to use
the Apple watch app on your iPhone to
add friends number five is the ability
to play back audio from the Apple watch
the new update will also allow its users
to play back audio directly from the
Apple watch a lever your music has to be
coming directly from the Apple watch in
order to play back audio a can stream
music from your iPhone so you need to
sync over your music by using the Apple
watch app on your iPhone unfortunately
in this first watch OS to beta this
feature isn't working properly just yet
but hopefully we'll get to test this out
in future updates number six is the
ability to use the onboard mic for
third-party apps during apple's keynote
Apple mentioned that the watch os2 will
now allow its users to use the onboard
mic for third-party apps which means
apps like Shazam or we chat will now let
you use the onboard mic instead of
feeding off of the mic from the iphone
number seven is a smarter Siri now just
like an iOS 9 Siri can do more you can
now use Siri to start and end workouts
and you can also check your glances get
transit information look up a word in
the dictionary and calculate a tip
number 8 is the ability to reply to
emails directly from your Apple watch
that's right you can finally reply to
emails on your Apple watch just like the
messages app you'll be able to reply
with canned responses or use voice
dictation and that's about it for this
beta there's still a lot of new features
that we haven't tried yet like the new
wallet app that can store credit cards
and reward cards for stores and the new
maps app would transit information watch
always too is now available for
developers and will be available to
everyone else's fall anyways thank you
guys so much for watching and if you
guys enjoy this video make sure to give
it a thumbs up and we will see you guys
in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
