lakers calm it's been about 24 hours
with the new macbook and i wanted to
give you guys my first impressions of it
i had to bring it into the office today
because i have class tonight so i'm
actually filming this on the isight
camera on the macbook and that's why you
guys get some new surroundings behind me
instead of seeing my dirty bedroom can
now view my office first impressions i
love the computer the first thing that i
really want to talk about is a battery
life as soon as i got the computer
installed microsoft office i had to go
to study group with the brightness
turned all the way up and with wireless
and bluetooth on and while typing a
paper i got close to five hours of
battery life which is unbelievable and i
still had some left and i was done
probably about fifteen twenty percent
left which is really unbelievable for a
laptop heat was not an issue at all i
really didn't feel anything while
sitting on my lap probably has a seventh
or eighth less heat than my old macbook
pro did so that's something Apple
definitely got well the heat
distribution which is something that is
very nice and was an issue I had with
the macbook pro the next thing I wanna
talk about is to track that after only
24 hours are using it I've already
gotten accustomed to it very quickly one
thing of note though the whole track pet
doesn't actually click just the bottom
half does and while it is glass doesn't
feel like glass it feels just like the
old plastic but the coating on it makes
it much easier for friction using your
finger again I got used to it very
quickly I've actually been using the
four finger gestures for expos i never
thought i would use that but it
definitely does come in handy so
trackpad is big thumbs up the build
quality on the computer is fantastic
while typing and we rest your hands to
the left and right of the trackpad
there's no denting or dimpling any more
like there wasn't a plastic macbook the
whole thing just feels solid and thats
thanks to the unibody aluminum
construction so definitely have to have
to recommend the macbook case anybody is
is looking for things along those lines
the next and i think most important
feature is the screen the backlit LED is
actually fantastic it really does pop it
does have that instant on and it looks
to be as vibrant as the macbook pro
screens were and currently are as far as
gamers arkansas
I've installed in games on here but has
seen some videos the new nvidia chipset
while its integrated graphics is five
times faster and better performance than
the old intel integrated set so that's a
massive step in the right direction for
Apple people were complaining that there
wasn't really a price drop on the new
models when steve jobs announced them on
tuesday and one thing that i wanted to
bring up an address was well that wasn't
a price drop people will actually I
think end up paying less those who were
teetering between on the old versions
pro or macbook kitten might have gone
the pro rap because they needed a little
bit better graphics performance you know
but now the macbooks really are mini
macbook pros if firewires not a concern
for you here and you're not doing a
stiff a'kin amount of gaming or video
editing you know you can use a mac book
now for things that you had to get the
pro for in the past and that's
definitely to apples credit so that's
about seven hundred dollars less that
those that the particular group would
have to we have to spend so well it's
not an official price drop certain
people will be paying less money so guys
in conclusion I couldn't be more happy
with the computer feels fantastic I
think it looks great the keyboard feels
very nice to type on it's the same as
the wireless keyboard I know much to
people chagrin I did install windows
vista on it because I had to for some
school programs and vista works and runs
perfectly on it no driver issues
everything works great I did it via
bootcamp and all the stuff I'm talking
about here the keyboard the mouse the
build quality i'll talk about in
separate videos but i just wanted to
give you guys just some general overall
impressions of the computer so i hope
you enjoyed again this is jon rettinger
