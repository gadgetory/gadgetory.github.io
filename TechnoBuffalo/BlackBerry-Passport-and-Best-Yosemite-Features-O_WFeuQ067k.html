to you by Linda calm what's up everybody
walk back there pisode of aston buffalo
i'm yours jon rettinger is to show you
could ask me any question you've got
from other technology and sometimes
outside like this week we're talking
about sports we're also going to talk
about the blackberry passport android
wear in yosemite not the place you want
to go camping and look at bridal veil
falls the OS for mac it's going get
started earlier in the week we ran some
news on BlackBerry's got a hip to be
square blackberry passport and i'm kind
of excited about it and this question
has to do you from twitter user at sa
hondro asked at john for lakers any news
on blackberries passport and classic you
20 where are they still just rumors they
are not rumors they're coming they're
definitely gonna come we just don't know
when let me focus on the passports that
one just seems crazy to me it's our
differentiate yourself of a smartphone
world they all kind of look the same
there are various versions of different
size 0 volts whether they're rounded or
at angles the passport is just like hey
screw you convention we're gonna make a
square phone with a physical keyboard
which i'm not sure people are gonna want
a physical keyboard anymore or wat
square phone the blackberry is gonna try
it so benefits could be quite a few
don't worry about rotating your screen
you get through a really nice aspect
ratio right from the get-go so very nice
there as well get the option to use
either an on-screen keyboard or not
on-screen keyboards got a 4.7 inch
screen so there's plenty of screen real
estate it just looks weird but a lot of
things look weird before you try it so
i'm kind of optimistic the fact now that
blackberry 10 with 10.3 has access to
amazon's App Store whereas you can
sideload pretty much every android app
on their you get the best of both worlds
black bears you i think is absolutely
awesome now you get android apps on top
of that although you get to do it on our
server weird affleck ratio i'm kind of
excited to try it actually really
excited try it's probably wanted device
coming out over the next few months and
i'm kind of can't wait to get my type ii
fingers on what you guys think i don't
know if this is BlackBerry's last effort
i know i kind of sound like
broken wheel here but maybe it is this
device gonna save them certainly wasn't
we expected from blackberry but maybe
something we didn't expect is exactly
how the folks in Canada needed that
question comes from at Eric underscore
who asks at John for lakers after using
smart watches like this guy with Android
where do you think they'll be using a
SmartWatch to assist your daily driver
so I just before I film this finish
filling my review of the gear live which
you can check out to put a link to it
down below with been published rack this
is live but i'll give you a spoiler if
you haven't seen that it is not very
good I don't think Android wear is doing
all that much right now it's got a lot
of potential a lot of potentials there
can think of it as like a freshman year
of high school LeBron James you know
it's got a lot of potential that was
gonna do great things but it's just not
doing it right now so I don't want to
wait for years oh not literally for you
but you want to wait to timesthat to
develop it's gonna be up to you but kind
of a lot of money to wait two hundred
bucks I hope it might get better and
speaking of LeBron James our friends
mark watson and john morrison from at
soldierknowsbest net tldtoday treated me
the same question at john for lakers
what do you think about LeBron returning
to the Cavs hashtag asked the be so I'm
not gonna explain the whole backstory
you should all know that if you don't
know that they probably don't care i'm
going to say about anyway what i find
funny about the whole thing is that
Cleveland has Miami's first-round draft
pick and 2015 as part of the original
LeBron deal when he went to Miami so
they get the player and they also get
the draft pick for this year than
Cleveland's gonna get a really nice
position it was definitely more mature
LeBron doing we didn't have a whole hour
long decision where he tells they were
taking his talents he wrote a very nice
sorting very mature thought out peace /
Sports Illustrated said he wives going
to Cleveland more about basketball and
more about the city and the state which
I could respect on everybody Miami was
super duper sad face I get it why
they're sad I'm a Laker fan it was a
really bad last year we've had a great
you know decade it's hard to sort of get
past sort of when things don't go your
way but did happens in sports port your
teams are good in the bad i'm excited
for a city of cleveland happy that the
whole drama is over i mean
sit through an hour-long special and see
Jim Gray and LeBron James tend to talk
about something you stop the questions

next let's talk about Yosemite at Dan
Smith 8 45 s at John for lakers what
your favorite feature in OS 10 Yosemite
so if Lucy guys have might not know been
running a late 2012 I'm active course
been running Mavericks and I've been
having crazy Wi-Fi issues about every
four to 15 minutes my wife I would drop
out and this happened up the entire day
you're in a business like I am that's a
big problem trying to skype call upload
videos have IM conversation to just
didn't work so it's debating but i have
to just buy a new computer i thought
something was wrong with the Wi-Fi card
i went through several stages of
conversations with apple and they
couldn't figure out really what was
wrong with the computer so i figured you
know what I'm thinking about buying into
a computer which is really don't need
right now and it's a necessary
especially with all these upgrades
coming presumably for for the imac soon
hopefully retina display i figured i'm
just going to sort of bite the bowl and
trapper into yosemite it's in its third
beta i will give it a shot ralph
Lorena's upgraded to the betas of
Mavericks started with beta 1 they said
it worked pretty well as i figured i'll
just try it and now with you of somebody
i gotta say first of all I haven't
dropped Wi-Fi not a single time i also
have had a single crash yet it seems
really stable i don't use that many
third-party apps I think things like a
DM tweetbot and a few other chatting
amps with no issue whatsoever your
somebody's been you be really good that
was what your question your favorite
feet from your question what's your
favorite feature my favorite feature is
that my Wi-Fi stays connected but if you
had to pick one on this side from that
the new spotlight
has been really nice and I kind of like
having widgets to you can sort of pull
down but really my wife I think
connected has been the biggest one which
kind of pissed me off because if it
works in Yosemite not mavericking it's a
software issue an apple should have
written be able to fix it in Mavericks i
shouldn't've had to go to a beta OS to
use Wi-Fi but maybe that just mean being
pissy thank you guys for watching
