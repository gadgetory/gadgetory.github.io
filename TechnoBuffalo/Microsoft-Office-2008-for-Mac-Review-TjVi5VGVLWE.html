of office 2008 for Mac so enjoy doctor
guys soon but alright guys so here is
the overview of Microsoft Office 2008
for Mac you can see most of the programs
here in my doc first one I'll show you
guys and this will just be a real quick
kind of overview and a general review at
the end of Microsoft Word 2008 open her
up cuz little dance and loads up this is
your main screen here you notice it
looks like general general word on a PC
you've got your formatting pane here you
can change your font color objects
anything you wanna add is all right
there just like on a PC but one thing
this does have which was very new and
extremely helpful is this document
elements bar right here you can click on
it and insert color pages always cover
page choices you can choose from two
pages of them table of contents always
table of contents choices headers
footers do biographies quick tables all
these cool tables you can use makes
charting really easy inserting some
graphics and WordArt it makes everything
really easy I use office 2007 for PC at
work I don't like Word 2007 but work
2008 for the Mac is great it's got all
these cool new features which I found to
be really helpful everything else just
like normal word any type just like just
like regular word 2008 gets a big thumbs
up it's been really rock-solid it works
quickly delivery they need it's easy to
do just like regular word and you can
save as and really any format you want
the new dot docx which is for 2007 and
beyond
or you can save it back as a regular
docx or any of these formats make it
really nice so
big thumbs up to word 2008 so let's
close word don't save I don't show you
guys Excel real quickly I've had that
much time to play with Excel just made a
few spreadsheets but generally just
works as you'd expect got your
spreadsheet spreadsheets in front of you
you can add your cells you need to put
your equations or formulas up here and
the old formula formulating palette
right there you know pretty
straightforward again thinking here you
can make some quick sheets that you need
to make some charts same type of thing
make it real easy you know account
balance business checkbook checking
ledger credit card statement you know
really make it easy to look at
everything so let's click credit
criteria and show you what that looks
like so enter your account name date all
that stuff you know right there you know
to go through and do it yourself which
makes it really handy so Excel
definitely thumbs up as well let's close
that don't save PowerPoint which
actually I really haven't used so much
at all but it looks just like PowerPoint
like it expect from a PC exactly the
same gets that now you've got the same
little bar at the top themes
presentation themes custom themes you
make your own slide layouts new
transitions this bar at the top on all
the applications just make things really
easy to use so PowerPoint again thumbs
up
I've really enjoyed office now the next
cool thing I really want to show you
guys this Microsoft project gallery
which comes on every version of work
2008 for Mac this up U is actually a
tremendous amount this gives you
templates for everything you need blank
documents they're always calendars and
events templates that you make yourself
brochures you pick all these different
brochure samples and to start editing
them calendars CD labels coordinated
forms I mean all this stuff that you
need faxes business cards memos
events to make your own awards
invitations postcards you know ton of
flyers if you want to send out labels
I know it's marketing stuff men use
signs
I mean resumes I mean just keeps going
you know it opens up in the appropriate
program so this has been a really huge
advantage don't have to do you know that
much work to make a resume for example
all the templates already there for you
just fill in your information invoices
things like that for a business just as
a nice added feature to office 2008
let's close out of this
the last program that comes on which I
don't really use but it'll show you is
entourage which is the Mac equivalent of
Outlook which is a mail program I was
also a messenger I'll show you too so
this is what the home screen looks like
it looks just like Outlook pretty much
you know your inbox if you have it set
up
I'd just booked without your contacts
calendar some notes if you want tasks
new projects you know just a great way
to manage your manager mail and not your
contacts and this thing cool thing
called my day which pops up and kind of
you know view what you have going on
that day there's a nice little feature
I'm sure there's a lot more to this but
I don't want to open a login but I
haven't really used it that much so I'm
just want to show you what it looks like
I can't really review entourage but it
seems to be seem to be nice it also
comes with Microsoft messenger which I
don't use but people that have used it
you can go through and the webcam works
just like Microsoft MSN Messenger I mean
everything works just like you'd expect
so overall guys have been really happy
with office 2008 I was happy to with neo
office which is a free alternative but
office 2008 really blows it out of the
water as far as features go all those
templates and everything already made
for you just make it so much easier to
do general projects new office is good
just for general
spreadsheets and creating text documents
but even anything really further more
in-depth as far as graphics or
formatting really office 2008 is it's a
great way to go
highly recommended guys and I think that
it's it's a must-have for anybody who
wants to use their Mac for the business
world and again guys this all these Word
Excel and PowerPoint documents are fully
compatible with any PC Word or
PowerPoint or Excel document so you open
them up it looks just like it would on a
PC and you can send it to somebody and
don't see just like you would see it and
vice versa
so highly recommended guys if you're in
the market for for this office sweeter
looking upgrade certainly a worthy
worthy upgrade anyway guys hope this
helped a little bit shed some light on
it helped you make a decision ask
questions away and don't forget to check
