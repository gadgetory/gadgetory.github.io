technobuffalo and just two days ago rim
research in motion finally announced
their new tablet and every tech youtuber
that you can think of as either made a
YouTube video or is gonna make it
YouTube video talking about said tablet
and mr. John for lakers even made one
himself so I thought hey I should make
one to peer pressure powerful stuff
speaking of peer pressure if you're
somehow peer pressure into doing drugs
don't do it cuz drugs they bent for you
this is sort of similar to the whole
Apple iPad dealio everybody thought the
ipad was gonna be called the isolate
isolate remember that no no good cuz it
doesn't matter anyways personally i
think the name black pad would a suit at
the tablet rather nicely as you know
it's all pad like and it's black but i
think rim wanted to have more fun
approach but to me the word playbook
sorta reminds me of the things that
sports coaches write their strategies or
plays on you know other things with X's
circles straight line sometimes diagonal
lines and also sometimes very very fancy
arrows yeah those things and the
blackberry playbook isn't really a book
nor is it play not to mention a sort of
sounds out of place compared to the
other blackberry devices such as a bold
storm javelin very mmm devices you're
gonna do that mmm face when you say the
name cuz they have so much um I don't
know and also the pearl in the curve if
you guys want the full specifications of
the playbook make sure you check out
John for lakers video linked in the
description box there now I'm pretty
sure the first thing that popped into a
lot of people's minds would be how does
the blackberry playbook fare against the
iPad often people would ask me
comparative questions between two
devices such as evil 4 gr iphone 3gs
which doesn't really make sense because
the iphone 3gs is a lot older compared
to the evo 4g it sort of seems that they
set up that question so that you'd pick
the one that they'd want to pick not
really fair is it it's kind of like okay
playstation 1 or xbox 360 okay go come
on d useless not to mention rather rude
even though the original iPad is gonna
be around a year old when the BlackBerry
PlayBook launches in 2011 is it fair to
compare the two devices at the moment
heck yes I mean it'd be more fair to
compare the PlayBook against the
second-generation iPad but
we don't know anything about that yet
because Apple likes to keep things
secret because they sneaky like that
looking at both devices based solely on
specifications the PlayBook dominates
the iPad in every way minuses screen
size but then again that's relative to
the overall device size itself which
makes it even for both which leaves us
with software meaning the operating
system and the support for applications
now something I've learned over the
years would be no matter how impressive
the hardware is it's a software that
counts the playbooks operating system
looks amazing with their native flash
support desktop like web browsing
experience and oh yes let's not forget
about the multi tasking or multitasking
either way you want to say it if you
didn't see the preview the multitasking
looks very very fluid it's very
organic-looking and almost seamless the
ipad looks and works pretty much the
same way minus the you native flash
support which might be a deal-breaker
for some people another thing we have to
consider is mobile software my mobile
software i mean apps and when it comes
to apps Apple's App Store is Kang like
burger king or king kong king spelled ki
ng but pronounced ka ng for some reason
sure there are a lot of garbage fart
apps but within the library of one-time
novelties are timeless application that
you probably won't find on any mobile
operating system other than iOS and if
you happen to find them on other mobile
operating systems they probably won't
really work as well a very good example
would be skyping the iphone pulls off
scott beautifully and it only comes in
second compared to the experience you
would get on a computer at the moment
blackberry OS doesn't really support
skype unless you have some verizon
package thing which sucks as you can
probably tell i like applications it
keeps the device interesting and I think
iOS and Android OS has most of the
mobile platform device application
developer people and I doubt they'll
flock over to blackberry OS anytime soon
unless they absolutely have to of course
hypothetically speaking if I was gonna
buy a tablet I'd still choose the iPad
over the blackberry playbook the thing
that's holding me back would be the OS
after owning and using a black bear for
a while I can confidently say that I
don't like the OS sure the OS is
improved for blackberry OS six and the
new tablet OS but it's still a
blackberry device and BlackBerry devices
have a very business feel behind them
and that's because they've been if
device
and the reason why I say business is
because hardcore people say business but
still the BlackBerry PlayBook in my
opinion is completely necessary and I'm
glad rim took that bold leap to not only
create an iPad competitor but also to
move the tablet market forward due to
the overwhelming extended H right there
specs of the blackberry playbook Apple
Samsung and other mobile tablet
producers now have to think dang what
can we do now to one-up the blackberry
playbook which in the end means better
tablets for users and hopefully better
prices as well so if you're ever in a
situation where you have to choose
between an iPad or a blackberry playbook
I would recommend you consider the
software before the hardware and of
course if you can try out both devices
before making your decision sure a
dual-core processor and 2 HD cameras is
great wonderful fantastic but it doesn't
really mean anything of all you want to
do is play multiplayer scrabble with
your friends on a rather large tablet
each screen so that's it for now this
was john from technobuffalo and i'll see
you guys in the next video later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
