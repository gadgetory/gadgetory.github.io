TechnoBuffalo and just two days ago rim
research emotion finally announced their
new tablet and every tech youtuber that
you can think of as either made a
YouTube video or is gonna make it
YouTube video talking about said tablet
and mr. John four Lakers even made one
himself so I thought hey I should make
one too peer pressure powerful stuff
speaking of peer pressure if you're
somehow peer pressure into doing drugs
don't do it cuz drugs they bent for you
this is sort of similar to the whole
Apple iPad dealio everybody thought the
iPad was gonna be called the isolate
isolate remember that no no good cuz it
doesn't matter anyways personally I
think the name black pad would a suit at
the tablet rather nicely as you know
it's all pad like and it's black but I
think rim wanted to have more fun
approach but to me the word PlayBook
sorta reminds me of the things that
Sports Coaches write their strategies or
plays on you know other things with X's
circles straight line sometimes diagonal
lines and also sometimes very very fancy
arrows yeah those things and the
BlackBerry PlayBook isn't really a book
nor is it play not to mention a sort of
sounds out of place compared to the
other BlackBerry devices such as the
bold storm javelin very mmm devices
you're gonna do that mmm face when you
say the name cuz they have so much um I
don't know and also the pearl in the
curve if you guys want the full
specifications of the PlayBook make sure
you check out John for his latest video
linked in that description box there now
I'm pretty sure the first thing that
popped into a lot of people's minds
would be how does the BlackBerry
PlayBook fare against the iPad often
people would ask me comparative
questions between two devices such as
Evo 4G our iPhone 3GS which doesn't
really make sense because the iPhone 3GS
is a lot older compared to the evo 4G
this sort of seems that they setup that
question so that you'd pick the one that
they'd want to pick not really fair is
it it's kind of like okay PlayStation 1
or Xbox 360 okay go come on D useless
not to mention rather rude even though
the original iPad is gonna be around a
year old when the BlackBerry PlayBook
launches in 2011 is it fair to compare
the two devices at the moment heck yes I
mean it'd be more fair to compare the
PlayBook against the second generation
iPad but
we don't know anything about that yet
because Apple likes to keep things
secret because they sneaky like that
looking at both devices based solely on
specifications the PlayBook dominates
the iPad in every way - is screen size
but then again that's relative to the
overall device size itself which makes
it even for both which leaves us with
software meaning the operating system
and the support for applications now
something I've learned over the years
would be no matter how impressive the
hardware is it's a software that counts
the playbooks operating system looks
amazing with their native flash support
desktop like web browsing experience and
oh yes let's not forget about the multi
tasking or multitasking either way you
want to say it if you didn't see the
preview the multitasking looks very very
fluid it's very organic looking and
almost seamless the iPad looks and works
pretty much the same way - the you
native flash support which might be a
deal-breaker for some people another
thing we have to consider is mobile
software my mobile software I mean apps
and when it comes to apps Apple's App
Store is cang like Burger King or King
Kong King spelled ki and G but pronounce
ka and you for some reason sure there
are a lot of garbage fart apps but
within the library of one-time novelties
are timeless applications that you
probably won't find on any mobile
operating system other than iOS and if
you happen to find them on other mobile
operating systems they probably won't
really work as well a very good example
would be skyping the iPhone pulls off
Scott beautifully and it only comes in
second compared to the experience you
would get on a computer at the moment
BlackBerry OS doesn't really support
Skype unless you have some verizon
package thing which sucks as you can
probably tell I like applications
it keeps the device interesting and I
think iOS and Android OS has most of the
mobile platform device application
developer people and I doubt they'll
flock over to blackberry OS anytime soon
unless they absolutely have to of course
hypothetically speaking if I was gonna
buy a tablet I'd still choose the iPad
over the BlackBerry PlayBook the thing
that's holding me back would be the OS
after owning and using a black bear for
a while I can confidently say that I
don't like the OS sure the OS is
improved for BlackBerry OS 6 in the new
tablet OS but it's still a black bear
device and BlackBerry devices have a
very business feel behind them and
that's because they bidness device
and the reason why I say business is cuz
hardcore people say business but still
the BlackBerry PlayBook in my opinion is
completely necessary and I'm glad rim
took that bold leap to not only create
an iPad competitor but also to move the
tablet market forward due to the
overwhelming extended H right there
specs of the BlackBerry PlayBook Apple
Samsung and other mobile tablet
producers now have to think dang what
can we do now to one-up the BlackBerry
PlayBook which in the end means better
tablets for users and hopefully better
prices as well so if you're ever in a
situation where you have to choose
between an iPad or a BlackBerry PlayBook
I would recommend you consider the
software before the hardware and of
course if you can try out both devices
before making your decision sure a
dual-core processor and 2 HD cameras is
great wonderful fantastic but it doesn't
really mean anything of all you want to
do play multiplayer Scrabble with your
friends on a rather large tablet each
screen so that's it for now this was
John from TechnoBuffalo and I'll see you
guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
