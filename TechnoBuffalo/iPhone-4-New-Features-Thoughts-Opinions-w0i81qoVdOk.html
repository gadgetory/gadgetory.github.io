technobuffalo here and i want to recap
some the new features found on the
iphone 4 so the first one of the biggest
one on everybody's mind is the new front
facing camera and facetime video chat
capabilities first of all I know that
other countries have had this for a
while but we haven't had it in the US
but I've had a chance to really
experience really video chat on a phone
yet I gotta tell you I'm very very
excited about it I think of all the
times it would be really useful I know
there have been many times when I'd say
my fiance is out shopping and wants to
pick up pick me up a new jacket or
something she couldn't show you what it
looked like she take a picture email we
prefer to come and look at the picture
and then I have to take a look at it now
I can sort of see things remotely my
sister and brother-in-law and my two
baby nieces live in Los Angeles in about
45 minutes away i can now see them live
on the camera using FaceTime I mean the
uses are endless not to mention the
dirty dirty dirty youssef's that I know
you're thinking about our certainly
options that you can do with facetime
and I really like how you can switch
from the front camera to the back so if
you want to have you know just look at
yourself talking you want person to see
that you're cool with want them to see
what you see using the back camera you
can switch automatically which is really
neat and certainly using portrait or
landscape it's certainly something that
you need you've gotten by without the
you a chat for a while it's more just a
cool kind of Wow feature I do wish that
it wasn't Wi-Fi only which apple claims
adjuster 2010 that is a bit of knowing
but with the prevalence of Wi-Fi
hotspots I think it's something that we
don't be able to like to get by although
if you do have a mifi device or a device
I can use as a mobile hotspot with you
and they can sort of get around that and
use it Mia serve network Wi-Fi if you
want I just think it's going to be cool
and fun film that I'm really looking
forward to the video demonstrations I've
seen of it do look like the polity is
actually pretty decent it's something
that I think is going to be the
determining factor about whether or not
this is successful one thing that I
would be disappointed that we didn't see
was a desktop client so why can't I use
the webcam on my imac behind me to talk
to saying my fiance or a buddy who's got
the eye
phone for I think that's something that
we're going to see coming I would have
liked to seen that but overall I just
sort of i am giddy to be able to to use
this for those you guys that have the
evo 4g you probably been using the video
chat for a few days it's really cool and
very fun i think it's something we're
going to see on a ton phones coming out
i think apple once again sort of paving
the way for mainstream or in this case
maybe even following behind what HTC is
done the next thing that I think is
really kind of neat is a design just
from a hey that's cool sand point twenty
four percent thinner than this that's
about a quarter thinner than the iphone
3gs is really neat and i'm very excited
to use it and try it maybe without
sacrificing battery life to get
something that thin is going to be very
very impressive certainly the new design
as well sort of goes along with that
you've got a now strip of stainless
steel all across the bottom creating
more industrial design it's using a very
high test grade of glass which is
durable and supposedly i'll scratch
proof i guess once you throw it on the
ground or drop right on the corner but a
very durable glass on the front and back
to make the phone really laughs a little
bit longer and look new or a little bit
longer something that i think that Apple
really did well the next thing which i
think is super neat as well as this new
Retina display at a high resolution
display which is double the resolution
of the current iphone 3gs so i know
there's a lot of times when i want to
retext around looking at TechnoBuffalo
calm or reading a newspaper and the text
just doesn't look crisp or clear those
concerns are going to be totally gone
certainly you're not gonna be able to
change that you're reading stuff on a
three and a half inch screen but it's
going to look much clearer crisper
pictures and video we're going to look
better everything is just going to pop
it's a higher resolution even then Oh
LED which is very impressive actually
the highest resolution screen now ever
on a phone which i think is going to be
absolutely fantastic and the thing is
also going to be a screamer running the
a4 system-on-a-chip custom silicon that
Apple development developed so it's
really going to be fast knocking
sacrifice battery life its clock Tonetta
gigahertz which I think because the
hardware and software made to work
together specifically
it's going to probably noticeably faster
than other Snapdragon processors which
also have the same clock speed also
think you'll record 720p video on a
phone is going to be very nice no this
is a feature we see on a few other
mobile devices it's nice to see it sort
of go mainstream and just iphones was
typically sent to see a port of adopt
the HD video that people have been
clamoring for i think overall the iphone
4 really is a very big step up from the
3gs from the initial iphone to the 3g
really we just saw the App Store and we
saw 3g capabilities from the 3g to the
3gs we just saw speed increase this is
really the first giant upgrading to the
iphone and the iPhone platform so I
think that's really is a very well up
going just going to set the stage for
the rest of nearly the mobile atmosphere
Apple generally has blazed the trail and
other manufacturers have sort of caught
up to them and oftentimes really past
Apple I think that nap will sort of jump
forward again to that I think feature
for feature it's going to be a very
comparable with new phones coming out
phones are already out I like evo 4g but
certainly going to be more advanced than
the majority of those that are beyond
the out in the ether rates UV purchase
so i just want to talk about the
features i'm just been very excited not
as a tech reviewer but as a user i'm
going to be a lot of fun to sort of
check out some of these new features
i've been using what's now called iOS
four for quite a while it's quick it's
fast multitasking works and it's going
to be great to have it on a faster
device with better battery life so it
hasn't been killing my battery at least
testing it on the 3gs also i kind of
like the colors now it's not just colors
on the back of the vice color on the
front as well my opinion the white one
does look pretty hot and if you are
considering getting one and you want to
do with these two mount of the video
shooting on it you might want to look at
the 32 gigabyte model excite soon that
shooting 720p is going to take up but on
up space so anyway guys just wanted this
sort of rant and talk about the new
features a little bit more than I did in
my recap video what are you guys think
are you excited not excited are
you mad at Apple fanboys or are you
still in androids camp or Windows Phone
7 scamper webos or you just sort of has
a tech fan excited about what might be
coming pretty curious to hear what you
guys have to say I know I jon rettinger
from technobuffalo I'll see in the next
video okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
