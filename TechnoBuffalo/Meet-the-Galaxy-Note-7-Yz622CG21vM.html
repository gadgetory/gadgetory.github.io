ip68 cuz it's been leaking like a faucet
Samsung's Note line of phones have long
been the favourites for those that like
a stylus input or just like the bones
big let me introduce you to the Galaxy
Note c7 it's a Galaxy Note 7
so aside from skipping a number there's
a lot new with the note 7 let's start
with how you're gonna unlock it it's got
an iris scanner built-in which is super
fast to set up and unlocks phone just by
looking at it this is not a face
detection unlock code we saw with older
version of Android it's actually uses
your eye and Samsung's integrating the
iris scanner into more than just how to
unlock the phone there's actually a new
secure folder section of the device
where you can put apps documents and
whatever you want
it's simply protecting it with hardware
encryption and it's Knox framework so if
really don't want someone to see what
you're hiding on your phone just throw
it in there something they don't don't
cut out your eyeball but once you do
unlock that screen with your iris you're
gonna be looking at a 5.7 inch quad HD
display of course the Super AMOLED it's
got a whopping 518 PPI so screen should
look really good I think Samsung makes
them the best displays in the business
those you worried about storage 64
gigabyte is going to be the only version
available and 64 gigabytes internal but
of course expandable keeping this thing
humming along is going to be 4 gigs of
ram with LTE cats
12 different processors are gonna be
powering this device pinning on where
you live
us is gonna get the Snapdragon 820 other
markets and get an Exynos octa-core
powered by two separate quad-core chips
a 2.3 gigahertz and a 1.2 C Gertz
courses running Samsung's own software
but space on android 6.0.1 Samsung did
not give us a timeframe for Android 7
presumably that will be coming soon
other notable changes here gone is
microUSB welcome USB type-c the rest
suspects are gonna be pretty reminiscent
from the galaxy s7 so 35 hundred million
power battery 12 megapixel camera 5
megapixel front-facing sensor for those
of you guys excited about VR Samsung is
expecting the device to support daydream
they said and they quote they need more
information from Google Samsung has been
refining and slimming down the UI for
years and that's the same here with the
note 7 fewer icons more funding for hand
operation they didn't have to compromise
at all on the one hand e grip a new
phone deserves two new accessories and
of course the note is coming with a
brand spankin new s-pen
is now also ip68 water and dust
resistant which means you could actually
use the phone and the s-pen under water
there's two times more pressure
sensitivity here it also has the
always-on display from the Galaxy s7 so
you can pretty much jot down a note
second you take it out but can also pin
that note to the front of the screen for
those of you that are wondering how it's
hidden compared to note 5 it's two point
two millimeters narrower this guy's also
coated in Gorilla Glass five they've
upgraded their metal to aluminum 7000
grade which is supposedly much much
stronger all that couple of diapey 68
you should have a pretty durable phone
if you're a samsung fan looking to make
a switch to Android or maybe just want a
new phone or a larger screen the notes
that it looks to be a really nice object
you guys want to see more coverage on
the note 7 give the video a thumbs up to
let us know we'll do a ton more videos
of cleaning comparisons hands on camera
samples and whatever else you want to
see thank you guys for watching I'm John
render from TechnoBuffalo see you guys
