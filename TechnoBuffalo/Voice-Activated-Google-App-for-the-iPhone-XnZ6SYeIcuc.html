lakers calm and i want to give you a
demonstration of the new google
application for the iphone that's a free
download from the App Store and there
was a Google application there before
but this new one adds voice-activated
searching which is very cool so we'll
give you guys a real quick demonstration
show you what it does so there's the
application right there you can see in
the upper corner on the other side the
big G so good go go ahead and hit that
and I'll actually take advantage of
accelerometer so you put it up to your
head you'll hear a beep you can say your
search so I'll give you guys an example
right now oh go ahead go ahead and hit
the applicant the button say launched up
move it to my head John for lakers it's
working soon as I put up to my ear I
heard a beep as well finished try for
the glare there guys John for lakers
technology video news and review you can
just hit it it's great if well you're
driving you want to do a quick google
search and wanted to do a real quick
search don't want to type it in find the
i have phones keyboard annoying whatever
it's really a nice application another
neat thing it does is take a protected
Vantage of the built-in GPS and the
phone so for example I'm going to search
for Chinese food give me a second in
Chinese food working I love Chinese food
so and it pulls up a full list of
Chinese restaurants in your area which
is very cool so you can search for any
sort of restaurant or any sort of
business that's in your area and it'll
pull it up it can also search your
contacts and you can use it with the
other Google applications as well it
really seems to be an sameet feature
it's not going to revolutionize anything
it's just another added bonus that you
get with google and apple on the iphone
