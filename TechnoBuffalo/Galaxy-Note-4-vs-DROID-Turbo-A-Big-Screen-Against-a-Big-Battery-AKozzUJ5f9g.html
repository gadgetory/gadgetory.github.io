to you by Squarespace what's going on
guys a mark in sanger from TechnoBuffalo
and what i have in front of me are the
samsung galaxy note 4 and the verizon
exclusive motorola droid turbo two
incredible devices that feature quad HD
displays and top-notch specs but ask
yourself this do features matter to you
more or battery life let's go ahead and
see which one deserves a spot in your
pocket now like the usual comparisons we
do we talk highly of specs and these two
are nearly identical both are using
Snapdragon 805 processor is clocked in
at 2.7 gigahertz both have 3 gigabytes
of RAM belton and both our equipment qhd
displays which look absolutely gorgeous
now while specs and screen resolution
are largely the same the droid turbo
sports a smaller 5.2 inch display a 21
megapixel camera on the back a
ridiculously huge non-removable 3900
milliamp battery and non expandable
storage options of either 32 gigabyte or
64 gigabyte the galaxy note 4 on the
other hand is rocking a bigger 5.7 inch
display a built-in heart rate sensor
fingerprint scanner a 16 megapixel
camera and a smaller 3200 20 milliamp
removable battery it also features 32
gigabytes of expandable storage up to
128 gigabyte via microSD card the galaxy
note 4 is available for all four major
US carriers and is going for around
three hundred dollars with a 2-year
contract now while the droid turbo is
exclusive to verizon and is going for
two hundred dollars for 32 gigabyte
variant and $249 for the 64 gigabyte
model under the same terms both devices
have solid build and are nice looking
and easy to hold however I feel like the
Galaxy Note 4 still has a slight
advantage over the droid turbo in terms
of design the note 4 just feels and
looks more premium than enjoyed turbo
and that's not me bad-mouthing the droid
turbo at all because i love the sturdy
durable design it's just that the full
metal frame and soft material on the
back offers a much better feel compared
to the droid turbos plastic body i do
love the unique ballistic nylon offered
on the droid turbo but ultimately it's
not quite as nice as a note for now form
factor is also a big thing for a lot of
people and if you don't have relatively
big hands the note 4 can definitely be a
bit unwieldy compared to the more
compact turbo i personally prefer the
droid turbo smaller footprint and
thicker design and i think it's a
perfect size risk
our phone its hefty and it's a device
that can handle one handed for me I'll
take the smaller form factor over the
premium build any day after using a note
for for longer stretches however I
actually found myself getting used at a
larger size often utilizing the s-pen so
you make the note 4 sides more
manageable it takes some time getting
used to but the note for size isn't that
big of an obstacle during everyday use
now like I said I still prefer the tour
both smaller size but Samsung does a
pretty decent job of making a note for
size more manageable once the S Pen
comes into play the 5.7 inch Super
AMOLED is playing on a no for looks so
awesome the colors are super vibrant
contrasting and the viewing angles are
great the droid turbo is 5.2 inch screen
with AMOLED is no slouch either but
still not as good-looking as a note
fours watching videos and playing games
or just browsing the web the note 4 is
much better when it comes to consuming
media content thanks to its better
screen both these devices are running
android 4.4 point for kick out of the
box but the experience couldn't be more
different the no 4 has touchwiz on top
of android which i have mixed feelings
about whereas the droid turbo is rocking
in almost vanilla android which i really
enjoy using are some cool software
features that the droid turbo has that
the note 4 doesn't offer and vice versa
though the droid turbo features moto
display where a selected part of the
screen lights up to show you the time
and your notifications without turning
on your device and this feature alone
helps a ton when you want to save on
battery life there's also moto is's
actions and voice assist essentially
change your phone's behavior based on
what you're doing or what your day is
like with voice you'll be able to
activate Google now with a custom phrase
and with actions you'll be able to
dismiss an alarm or call by waving your
hand over your phone many of these
software features you just won't find on
a note for now the note 4 has the s pen
though which is a huge selling point for
the note series and what sets the note 4
apart from its competition but in terms
of software features there are few
notable additions there's multi window
support which essentially allows for two
apps to run at the same time and
one-handed operation which is super
helpful if you want to be able to reach
across your device one-handed there's
also easy mode for parents and
grandparents who want to simply looking
you why little software features that
make the user experience much better
other hardware and software related
features are the fingerprint scanner
which samsung has been improving quite a
bit recently there's also the heart rate
monitor on the back under the camera for
help nuts I know I know let me stop the
video for just a quick one and thank our
friends over at Squarespace Squarespace
recently launched our latest version of
their platform Squarespace 7 and it's
amazing I personally use square space to
build my website and it's probably the
easiest platform of use it now
integrates with getty images in google
apps so i can find and use images and my
google apps easier and now offers new
templates which looks amazing you don't
necessarily need to know CSS or HTML to
build a good website just use one of
their existing template and make it your
own if you want to try the new
Squarespace 7 go to squarespace com and
enter the promo code techno with a
capital T to get ten percent off your
next purchase trust me it's worth it
looking at the back of these two devices
you have the 16 megapixel camera on a
note for a 21 megapixel camera on the
droid turbo now right off the bat you're
probably going to say well the droid
turbo has a higher megapixel count so
that's definitely the much better camera
here no the note 4 features an optical
image stabilization which is very
helpful when shooting low light in
filming a video where as the droid turbo
features digital stabilization which
isn't as good nor as helpful especially
when filming a video both take great
pictures and good lighting conditions
though the Troy turbo still has that
shutter lag i mentioned in our review
which is where this device fall in terms
of camera UI the droid turbo is very
simplistic you have very few options to
choose from and it's a complete opposite
for the note for the no 4 offers a ton
of options and tweaks you can mess with
and a few different shooting modes as
well it's worth noting that the note 4
also features a pretty decent 3
megapixel ultra wide front facing camera
and it's ridiculous so many comes down
to camera experience overall I'm going
with the note 4 on this one with all
that being said after testing these two
devices when it comes down to battery
life the droid turbo lasted for days
maybe two days in a few hours I
constantly use it I had push
notifications coming from Twitter gmail
and other social networks I made calls
and it lasted forever the note 4 would
need to be charged every day or so
depending on what I was doing and I
don't think that's bad at all however
it's still not as good as the droid
turbos battery life both feature call
comes latest turbo charging technology
so you'll be able to get about six hours
of usage in about 15 to 20 minutes and
honestly it works well something that I
wish every phone had so if you're more
of a power user and want to be able to
do two things at once and you want a
fingerprint scanner a stylist then a
note for has a software and hardware
features to provide you with what you
need
if you want a simple device and a
battery that will last forever and a
more manageable form factor the droid
turbo is your choice I personally think
the note 4 is still the better device
here just because I can do more and I
think the camera which is incredibly
important is better I can run two apps
at once use s pen to draw or jot down
notes on a go and enjoy the bigger
screen for media consumption anyway
