TechnoBuffalo I'm here taking a first
look at the Sony SmartWatch 3 it's the
first SmartWatch from Sony to offer
Android wear the new operating system
that we've seen on other devices but as
you can see here it's got a nice kind of
rubbery band that runs around it I can't
really tell if it's replaceable I assume
that you could probably pop it off but
it doesn't seem to have the clips that
we've seen on other devices but i'm not
positive from now I'm just honestly
seeing it for the first time here with
you guys as you can see it's running the
demo software so we're getting kind of a
look here at how it works you're
probably already familiar with it but
you get to hang out certifications there
you can say ok Google and then there's
of course the clock and it's going
through its loop here but just wanted to
bring you a quick look here at the Sony
SmartWatch 3 and this is Todd Hazleton
