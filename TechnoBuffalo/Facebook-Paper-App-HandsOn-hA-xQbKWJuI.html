checking out Facebook paper this is a
new app that Facebook has just released
and they're kind of hoping that you're
gonna replace your regular Facebook app
with it but can you replace your regular
Facebook app with it we're gonna find
out in this video so stay tuned okay so
we have our Facebook paper app installed
it is in the App Store it's free you can
go download it but unfortunately if
you're using Android you're not going to
be able to use fake paper right now
because it's not available and it's also
us only so us iOS users you can go get
it right now in the App Store
but it is a very small team and this is
an experimental app that Facebook is
kind of hoping will sort of grow into
something bigger so over time I'm sure
we'll see paper available on other
platforms as it becomes more successful
so let's take a look ok so this is the
layout of Facebook paper as you can see
it's very magazine like you might be
reminded of maybe Flipboard or other
magazine s caps that you use to access
things like RSS feeds this is actually
my friend feed so this is my news feed
it says Facebook right here and these
are the different posts from properties
that I like so you can see I have a
Disney one in there and of course
TechnoBuffalo is all over my newsfeed
which is cool and if I'm really into a
story I can just tap on it and it will
bring that right up and then if I want
to see the actual story I can go ahead
and open it so you can see as a little
card animation opening up and it will
take me right to the actual
TechnoBuffalo mobile site and we can
read more about Facebook paper it being
available for iOS and then all you have
to do is just slide down to close that
card and slide down again to go back to
your newsfeed you can go through and if
you look at things like pictures you'll
notice maybe there's a little bit of
something cut off here actually if you
just move to the side you can see the
rest of the pictures and for anything
that is landscape it's gonna be a lot
easier for you to see what's going on in
the picture and it's kind of a cool
effect but not necessarily anything
that's gonna you know make you go
download it immediately now if I swipe
over you can see now I have headlines
at a Facebook here and these are
different topics that I've chosen to
sort of populate inside Facebook paper
so here's headlines I have tech I also
have pop life well-lived I have cute so
if we want to see adorable animal
pictures this poor little dog has an
ouch apparently I can do that I can
switch over to lol which is a lot of
comedy stuff and I have things for home
so that's where it stops if I want to
actually add more things or if I want to
post a status update to Facebook I just
swipe down and you can see here's my
profile I can create a post here and
it's very much like the regular Facebook
app you can choose who it's visible to
in your newsfeed you can add pictures
you can add your location anything like
that but if I want to go back and edit
my sections I can do that so here's all
the different sections you can add you
do have a limit you can't add every
single section that is available to you
so here's your newsfeed you have
headlines tech everything that I
mentioned before but let's say I want to
add creators so all I have to do is just
take this and drag it right up here if I
want to add more you can see I can do
that and it'll actually tell me your
paper is full so you can see now it's
saying no you can't quite add that we're
just gonna put it back down here so if I
said whoops I didn't actually want to
add flavor I want to add score which is
the sports section I can do that so now
I just hit done and you go right back to
your news feed and then you can swipe
over to the section you just added so
there's score where to go check out this
story on on poor Peyton Manning because
he didn't have a very great day
yesterday but yeah so this is this is a
little bit of Facebook paper
you're probably wondering maybe where
can you refresh your stories actually
that's something that Facebook paper
does for you the cards will actually
sort of deal themselves to you as things
get pushed to these content creators RSS
feeds which is very interesting and I'll
show you a picture that I thought was
really cool that was sort of easier to
sort of check out and use that that
tilts a little more so you can see now
you can see this whole landscape picture
it's just kind of neat
in this beetle story which is kind of
fun but it's very very simple you've
probably also noticed as I've been
swiping through here there aren't any
ads and that's something that is
happening in Facebook paper for now it's
not exactly it's not exactly 100% on
whether or not they're gonna add ads to
Facebook paper I would imagine it's a
little bit of a catch-22 if you are you
know if this happens up becoming very
popular it's probably going to get ads
but if it ends up not being very popular
it may stay ad free and get no support
so again kind of a catch-22 there but
overall a really beautifully created app
and something that we're really looking
forward to seeing how it evolves in the
coming months so that's it for Facebook
paper there's a short tour little
hands-on of this sort of media heavy
magazine like format layout for your
Facebook app now as to whether or not
you can use this as your main Facebook
app you guys are gonna have to figure
that out for yourself but until the next
video I'm Ashley Scavo TechnoBuffalo and
we'll see you in the next one hey guys
