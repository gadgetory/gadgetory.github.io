to you by full sail university what's up
everyone walk back there pisode of ass
the buffalo i'm your host jon rettinger
show you could ask me any question
you've gone from the wide world
technology and sometimes outside and
this is the first video we're filming in
front of one of our new sets gonna start
looking a little bit different behind me
you can see light start popping up and
logos and all kinds of other things so
bear with us as we get our studio up to
date first question comes from at small
1996 to ash at john for lakers what's on
your wish list for the nexus 6 there's a
lot of stuff on my wish list but was not
on my wishlist for nexus 6 was a 5.9
inch 2k screen a figure we're never
gonna get that it looks like that might
be exactly what we get I've always loved
in excess land devices I think that
they're just pure Android in its on
adult rated form has been absolutely
awesome we've never been through the top
to your spec because it never really
needed it looks like the Nexus 6 might
totally go a different direction and be
a larger version of what we see for the
Moto X second-generation built of course
by motorola with a ridiculous to case
screen with the latest Snapdragon 805
processor supposedly three gigs of RAM
and of course Android Elvis think she'd
be an absolute screamer and not just a
flagship Nexus phone but flagship phone
/ also as an android fan I can't wait to
get my mitts on it next one comes from
at se hundra who asked well the
blackberry 10.3 update support to Google
Play Store an amazon app stores and what
about blackberry blend so we're gonna
have a full review of the blackberry
passport which is our first 10.3
official device that we've tried the
amazon appstore is going to ship out of
the box on 10.3 so it'll be there all
the apps you can buy from amazon will be
available you're not going to have
access to google play as you see on
android device but you can directly
download the apks and install them
either on an SD card or on the vice and
run your applications that way and of
course you can also have access to black
berets own app world so you really get
three app stores available which kind of
makes blackberry have the most apps of
any platform serve a really cool move so
look for our 42 the blackberry passport
coming student it's to stop a quick sec
to thank our friends at full sail
university their mobile development
bachelor's degree program is offered on
campus and online you can go wherever
you are and teach your students how to
develop apps and utilities their courses
that cover both iOS and Android
development so you've been thinking
about a nap you got the next row view
the next Angry Birds they can help you
fulfill those dreams to learn more about
full sails weapon technology programs
visit Full Sail edu / technobuffalo and
the last question comes from at ruskin
Gonzalez who asked at John for lakers
which you prefer the iphone 6 plus to
the iphone 6 and why we're going to film
a whole video on this question but the
short answer is I like big phones and a
cannot lie so the 6 plus is for me
Brandon's using the six we're using the
six for testing for upcoming review and
I really like the way it feels in my
hand but if I had to pick one device I'd
go big I like the 6 plus I liked having
0 is built in but aside from that I
think the 6 is an awesome phone really
there's not one that's best for
everybody try both holding in your hand

think you guys for watching hope you
