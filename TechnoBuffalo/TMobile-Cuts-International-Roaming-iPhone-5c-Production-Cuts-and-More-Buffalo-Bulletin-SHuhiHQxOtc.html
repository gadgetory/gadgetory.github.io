roaming plans iphone 5 production halved

hello internet and welcome to the
Buffalo bulletin where we recap five
major stories from our site
TechnoBuffalo calm every tuesday and
friday if you're interested in reading
more about any story check the
description for links or click on the
graphics for each story if you have
annotations available and toggled on I'm
Ashley sceva here your top stories
t-mobile held another uncarrier event on
wednesday and this time around they
aimed their crosshairs at international
roaming charges they detailed a new
unlimited international data and texting
service for over a hundred countries
starting on October thirty-first with no
additional cost for simple choice plan
subscribers a no word yet though on data
speeds or caps but just the idea alone
is pretty promising my t-mobile CEO John
llegara is a real firecracker the iphone
5c is a good mid-range device but it
seems to be getting some lukewarm
reception by consumers CNN is reporting
that production for the colorful iPhone
is being slashed by up to fifty percent
50 which is a pretty huge indicator
sales aren't exactly what Apple hoped
they would be we'll see if retailers
don't also slash prices for the 5c even
deeper than they've already been cut but
either way I just want to know if this
means the iphone 5c is apologetically
plastic now I mean I'm totally asking
for a friend in gaming composer and
former Red Hot Chili Peppers drummer
cliff Martinez accidentally let the Far
Cry 4 cat out of the bag by telling
outlet lost in the multiplex he was
working on a new installment in the
franchise it hasn't officially been
announced yet though so now that
Martinez has confirmed his involvement
will likely hear something from Ubisoft
sooner rather than later maybe when the
new consoles launched Square Enix also
in the news this week announcing plans
to launch Square Enix collective in a
partnership with IndieGoGo the program
lets indie devs pitch their game ideas
and then raise public awareness and
support for them if the project is
successful Square Enix will step in
estimate a budget and help make the game
happen who knows how this will develop
or end up in the future but we're going
to keep an eye on it since some really
great games might come out of this
collective and finally our wildcard
story this week involving apple and
it's today nope it's not what you're
thinking no Patmore's apple filed this
week for a patent that seems to be a
form of protection for your phone when
it falls to the ground so the patent
calls for a motor and devices that sense
a fall and then rotates the phone to
impact in a less vulnerable area of
course it may never see actual
real-world use but I think it's a lot
better than tying a cat to your iPhone
