of those questions you could do it one
of two ways first every Tuesday on

the Buffalo go ahead and leave your
questions down below there or if you're

ask questions from the comfort of your
couch you can always do it on twitter
using hashtag ask the be on this episode
of techno Buffalo we're going to talk
cell phones we're going to talk my new
surroundings we're going to get a bit
philosophical about technology and work
of course going to talk about Apple and
Android so let's go ahead and get
started with another episode vas the
Buffalo
our first question comes from the
website user drew who asked John if
mango is what's supposed to be we
consider using it as your daily driver
I'm a big fan of windows phone seven in
fact I've been a big fan of Windows
Phone 7 ever since Microsoft first
announced it I think it's a solid
operating system with a lot of great
potential and a lot of that great
potential is now finally realized with
the now just rolling out mango update
samsung focus right here mango can be
run on it ton of new features on there
including multitasking that's cool
tombstones what they've called it
essentially freezes an application go
ahead and go back and forth unified
inbox finally support for front-facing
cameras and all the awesome things that
you thought that Windows Phone 7 needed
now i'm going to have i think that if
you're looking to get a new smartphone
and you're looking at the obvious
contenders android or the iphone yote
yourself to look at Windows Phone 7 it
really might surprise you I think that
Microsoft has probably one of the best a
native on-screen keyboards I'm not that
big into swipe I know a lot of you guys
love swype but for my money the best of
virtual keyboard definitely belongs to
Windows Phone 7 check it out I'm a huge
fan so the answer to your question drew
yes I think that mango definitely
deserves to be looked at all right so
our next question goes to Twitter and
comes from user eadric 386 who asks at
John for lakers which is my personal
handle if you want to use that as well
how will the future of technology shape
the world I think the future technology
is already debating to shape the world
you can look at how the internet plays a
role in most people's everyday lives you
know those people speaking most about
the US since that's where I live and
that's what I know um shapes our lives
quite quite a bit first look at email
you know we've seen regular mail go down
in prominence and down importance you
can email now you know as opposed to
having to pick up a phone and call
someone and you can say what you will
about personal interaction FaceTime and
the decline certainly true but email
certainly change the way that we do
business it's changed where we shape the
world
you look at now cell phone cellphones
became these giant huge boxes and then
they became something this big that Zack
Morris carried and now there's something
you know that big and that thin that can
be just about everything and really
changes the way not only make phone
calls but how we consume media how
interact with friends how we do a lot of
things technology is definitely making
us a bit more antisocial as well I know
technologist or the influence me
personally I remember not having
internet I remember my family first got
prodigy before AOL knew those two were
competing and you had a gonna use the
dial-up modem one key and finally
connected I able to get email was
awesome I remember going into for Sam I
saw chat rooms able to talk about sports
nothing dirty because I know what your
comments are gonna be saying your purse
you're all a bunch of pers the first
time yeah I was able to use instant
messaging and all that stuff it was it
was really cool so for me the biggest
thing that's changed my life is
obviously been the internet now that's a
big huge answer but you know what is it
for you alright so things like turn
behind me let's talk about this new
setup actually leads me to our next
question which comes from the website
user Lee who asks John could you please
do a video tour of your next office well
Lee a video tour of our new offices
coming fills you that follow us check
out the website you know we've moved
into a new office space in a building
real office which kind of awesome with
desks and monitors and all kind of stuff
so that will be coming at the question
I've been getting quite a bit recently I
can see little snippets of it in certain
videos but eventually we'll show you
guys the whole thing as soon as it's
already alright so speaking of already

to the questions transition alright this
one comes from twitter user Sasha Mahal
I'm sorry if I massacred your last name
asks which do you like better android OS
or iOS where another OS and why lots a
tough question I tell us the fanboys get
ready to do their typing get ready to go
uh well it's right now I'm using a
blackberry bold 9900 my daily driver so
for right now the answer is neither this
is what i'm using why I'm using it I
like the limitations of blackberry know
that sounds weird I like that it's good
at email I like that's got an awesome
physical keyboard to type on it's not
really that good at much else I'm not
distracted with apps I'm distracted with
games and all that stuff these to take
time from my life it does email does
phone calls and it does all that very
well the browser is ok I can use it when
I need app support not very good app
world is not as robust as the other
operating systems infrastructures that
you mentioned or ecosystems route that
you mentioned but when it comes down to
Android or iOS depends on the week for
me so I review a lot of cell phones I
have the distinct honor to be able to
check out all the legends
a cell phone that are coming out so as
my daily driver you know generally it's
an iphone at least it was before I
started using the blackberry bold 9900
however with all the new android phones
coming out generally you'll find an
android phone in my pocket that i'm
testing in the iphone just wasting away
in a drawer so thank you guys for
