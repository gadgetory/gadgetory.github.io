awesome opportunity to come to CES and
check out the world of tech and during
those seven years we've done countless
videos from boost products but I've
never had the opportunity to take you to
CES with me this year for the very first
time we have access to some 360-degree
tech so I want to give you guys a tour
of what CES is like and show you some of
the highlights 360 technology is still
very in his infancy so if watching this
video on a phone the quality is not
going to be the highest check it out on
a browser though you'll get 10 80s and
of course if you got some cardboard
throw your phone in there and just look
around and explore with me also I
recommend while watching this video give
it a pause scroll around see everything
that's here at the show floor so let's
start at Mercedes to highlight is their
concept I a a this car actually worse
for better efficiency really
cool-looking car in person we don't take
my word for it check it out yourself
arguing one of the stars of the show
came from Chevrolet in the form of the
production bolt we actually have a whole
video detailing all about this car but
check it out in all of its 200 my
electric range under 30 thousand dollar
after incentive glory
probably the coolest car came from
Faraday this is your FF 0 1 concept did
a whole video running through the top
five things to know about Faraday so
check that out all links will be down
below but here's this all-electric
looking Batmobile that we will never
ever ever see in the road it's not a
concept car they say two car of concepts
of course CES 12 would be complete
without checking out some the big guns
so let's go to LG we've got phones we've
got refrigerators we've got clothes
hangers at jiggle and vibrate to get
wrinkles out your clothes LG's got
everything
let's last go to Samsung one of the
biggest boobs here at the show and they
just like LG have absolutely everything
from see-through displays to phones to
gigantic tablets that should never be in
existence it's the whole variety of
Samsung products were here
Oh
CS is an incredible experience and
exhausting experience and I want to give
you guys a sense of what it's like to be
here you guys like these 360 videos
please let us know in the comments down
below of course the best way to let us
know you like this is to give it a
thumbs up let's see your suggestions
about what we can do to improve or other
things you want to see hope you guys
enjoy until next time I am John reading
from technobuffalo and i'll see you at
CES 2017</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
