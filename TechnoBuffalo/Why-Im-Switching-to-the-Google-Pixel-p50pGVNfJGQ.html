phones your techno buffs well I
generally don't have a phone that's like
my phone that I'm using usually I'm
testing something new which is a really
cool problem to have I've got a bit of a
lull in my testing now and I've gotten
at the opportunity to look at what phone
I want to use just to use a phone I
found myself drawn back to the beauty of
the pixel xl3 my reasons the first and
big one is oh that camera so sweet and
so nice the pictures that come out of
this thing are incredible even when I'm
not using the pixel generally I'm
carrying it with me to use for photos
because they look absolutely incredible
I figure instead just carry two phones
might as well use the thing also I'm
moving in about two weeks
and I'm currently with AT&amp;amp;T but my new
house doesn't get good AT&amp;amp;T servers at
all in fact it just disconnects down to
no service I'm not the biggest fan of
Wi-Fi calling gently when I leave the
house if I'm on a phone call it'll drop
but Verizon gets really good service
where I live my new place I'm gonna be
switching to Verizon the pixel obviously
works with Verizon that's one of the
reasons I'm also considering making the
switch I like the convenience having
USBC I can carry just one cable with me
and carry one cable for my computer one
cable to charge my phone and be just on
my way so looking forward having like a
quiet period of using the pixel for me
though the big reasons were three you a
speed camera and screen I love the
screen I love the speed and obviously
that little tiny camera doesn't have a
camera hump makes a pixel XL an awesome
choice so expensive they're still kind
of hard to find to get your hands on a
pixel or pixel XL you're gonna be really
impressed and I think especially for the
crowd that's coming from iOS you're an
Android user y'all ready to know how to
use a pixel it's gonna be the best pure
Android experience out there if we're
coming from an iPhone like a lot of you
guys are considering I think the pixel
really does a nice job of bridging back
down the big question is what phone are
you using if you could pick any phone
that's out right now to use which one
would you pick and why for me though at
least for right now it's the pixel XL
if you watch this video chances are you
love tech but if you're passionate about
science technology and kind of the
future of where all that stuff's going
to come together you might want to check
out the folk seeker there focus on
explainers documentaries and all kinds
of other stories just about the world
and they show it all kind of through the
context of science then YouTube videos
up every day check them out if you got a
cool one on how we could back up the
entire Internet with just a gram of DNA
which sounds gross but also awesome if
you're more of a reader check them out
at seeker comic got a lot of great
stories about space technology energy
and kind of thing science</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
