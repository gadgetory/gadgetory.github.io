very few products are as polarizing as
their new line of MacBook Pros with the
touch bar I was excited to test it had
to put it through its paces and see if
it could perform for me as a daily
driver I'm really impressed with what
Windows is doing so I approaches to
someone who is looking for a new
computer which exactly what I am so I
figured the best way to test this is the
test like I do a phone to use it as my
everyday computer it was my only
computer at the office my only computer
at home for the better part of seven
days so I chanced early know how it
worked how it performed while dock at
the office and used only as a laptop at
home two different versions of the
15-inch MacBook Pro Brendan he did the
full written review tested the base 2400
I tested a built order machine the
processor is a 2.7 gigahertz quad-core
i7 I didn't up at the processor to the
available 2.9 gigahertz quad-core i7 I
did up the hard drive it's a 1 terabyte
SSD and upgraded the GP to the Radeon
460 with 4 gigs of RAM I honestly have
both computers perform them be sure to
check out Bryon's written review to see
how he did on his daily usage of the
computer design of the computer is
gorgeous it's a machine this is
aluminium and it looks stunning I really
liked the hinge I liked to open it with
one finger I really appreciate that out
where he moves the plastic antenna band
from the back of the MacBook Pros it's
now a single hinge similar what we have
with the MacBook I haven't used a
15-inch laptop in a while so I forgot
how big it is but if you use a 15-inch
it's gonna fit nicely in your bag the
screen is still the same 15.4 inch
display that we've had before and the
resolution hasn't changed either it's
still 20 and 80 by 1800 but the panel
itself is very different and it's
noticeable apple claims it's 67% writer
and I can't quantify the percentage but
it does like notice will be sharper and
brighter than the outgoing 15-inch it's
also wiggly less reflective than before
you need to work outdoors without having
to worry about angling it properly be
able to see your screen in fact I did
work outdoors I appreciated the anti
glare that Apple's added keyboards
different here to uses the 2nd gen
butterfly switch is found in the 12-inch
MacBook and I really liked them it
doesn't keep getting used to though if
you're used to the older version you got
to give it at least like four or five
days to be comfortable after that though
you won't notice much of a difference I
know this is a personal thing here but I
kept hitting the caps lock key most the
time when I want to hit the a key so for
that mine morale though if you're
worried about the keyboard don't
be the force touch trackpad here it
looks like it took some serious HGH it
is huge it's almost close to the same
size and Magic Trackpad accessory Apple
is happy to sell you the same shout
is before it's just huge
sure this eyes really can project your
hands if you have to rest on it while
you're typing I don't have any sort of
jumps or jitters with it at all
it works well it's just gigantic which
brings us to the biggest changes
generation the touch bars that morphing
OLED strip setting with the function
keys used to be and a lot of SEOs kind
of ambivalent to man when I first are
testing the computer but the more I use
the laptop to where potential actually I
saw in the touch bar first Jill there's
any sort of haptic feedback I was kind
of expecting that it's not here but you
can't customize what it can do and what
it shows if you guys want to see some
customization options let us know down
below make a dedicated video showing
that I absolutely loved using it as a
media scrubber when watching videos grow
through my timeline of final cut it
looks really cool what a call came in
two people were kind of upset about the
Escape key placement that's a big deal
for coders and the key is offset and it
is in the touch bar-b-q pretty much tap
anywhere in your at Fir to work I was
also kind of originally annoyed and took
extra taps dude enormo things like
change the volume of rightness but if
you just tap it and hold you can scrub
it with just one press album cleared for
a lot of thoughts a touch bar I think
once it mature it's going to be
incredibly useful so I change of initial
opinion on it
it went from cool gimmick to actually
being surprisingly helpful
so all the fancy screen tech and touch
bar takes battery and I put claims in
ten hours of battery life here and I
have no idea how anyone could reasonably
get close to ten hours of actual usage
from a full hundred percent charge with
zero apps open as I projected four hours
of battery life now the longer they left
it open to calibrate the better it got
in fact when it's high as five hours and
45 minutes with no apps open after
calibration and writing to set to about
60% Brendan had similar experiences with
his your experience is good and very
obviously and how you the computer for
battery life will continue to be a
concern especially if you venture away
from Safari and use Chrome or do any
editing on the go that battery though
can be charged via any of the four USB C
Thunderbolt 3 slots I like that as a
smooth transition
the lack of i/o is going to be an issue
and you're going to have to carry
adapters and dongles wherever you go if
you want to do things like transfer
files via NSC coach is important for
folks like me or oftentimes editing or
being on the go and I get that Apple
removes slots like that because your
quote Unger's and dongles hanging out
the side certainly ungainly as well this
is gonna be a personal preference if you
don't mind clearing adapters and dongles
don't you're gonna lose them you're
gonna be fine if you do mind that you
tend to lose cables you forget to bring
things with you you might find this
computer not useful if you forget your
SD card adapter for example while
shooting footage on me goes I get a lot
of questions on the speakers and these
were definitely louder than before
applicants are 58 percent more volume
and 2.5 percent more bass I don't know
how to test that they are super loud and
don't sound very tinny on the processor
side I would have absolutely preferred
until 7:00 Chen cabbie Lake instead we
have Intel's 6 gen skylake chips they
aren't any slouch there's still plenty
fast the custom machine pulled in the
really solid Geekbench scores which only
slightly higher than the entry level at
brandon tested benchmarks don't mean
that much to me though performance does
my presage in the real worlds what
matters to me machine is a beast
even when docked to a 4k display and a
thunderbolt display plugged into it I
never felt it struggle to keep up and
for that matter I even rarely heard the
fans we're gonna do separate videos on
editing and gaming but not surprisingly
it flew through final cut but it was
slower than expected with Premiere Pro
which is on Adobe's end and should
improve with software updates like games
like Starcraft or perfect on a 4k
display I was able to easily get them a
1080p a 50 frames per second I can
probably go even higher but again with
the separate ated videos on gaming and
editing wanna say anything particular in
those videos and see tests let us know
down below I'll make sure we include
them in those videos I was also quickly
surprised how fast the PCIe SSD is in
the machine there's going to be a huge
benefit when it comes to video editing
so conclusion on the MacBook Pro the
piece of a machine but it's expensive
starting at $2,400
if you're not tied into Apple's
ecosystem you can get a lot more bang
for your buck in the PC world so that's
nothing new here that's always been the
case at Apple's machines if you are in a
physical system you want to stay in
Apple's ecosystem they're much of a
choice for pro machines than the MacBook
Pro now be aware though you have to pay
extra money for dongles and just make
sure you carry them with you but you can
get past the dongles and you can see the
future it's going to be USB see
Thunderbolt 3 and you're buying into the
future with this computer you're buying
to the future of one cable to rule the
and we're just not there yet but my can
continue using this my everyday computer
I don't know yet
I wish battery life was better which I
have to carry Dom booth with me on the
other hand four months has been
absolutely incredible and I feel like it
can handle anything I throw at it
so I can't necessarily say this is for
everyone but I can't say it's not for
anyone either you got to figure out if
you want to spend the money if you want
the features if you do it's a great
computer definitely know what you're
getting into with the 2016 MacBook Pros
so what'd you guys think did you buy one
you're skipping it leave this in the
comments down below please give the
video a thumbs up where it's really hard
in this video until next time I'm done
range from TechnoBuffalo path you guys
the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
