TechnoBuffalo here with a virtual sort
of unboxing of my new video camera this
is the canon vixia hf g10 if you guys
know me you don't know throughout the
past three years i have been using this
guy my faithful loyal sony HDR sr 11 but
unfortunately like all good things it
became outdated my audio I'm the first
one to admit it it sucked my audio was
so bad I had no manual controls I
couldn't control anything with this
camera the new guide gives me full audio
controls there's something called
peaking now which I'm learning about I
could see it moving as I'm talking so to
help me improve the audio and sitting on
top of it is this guy the rode videomic
so hopefully we'll see some improved
audio the video quality should be much
improved as well with the new camera
I've got a ton of like balance options
and aperture settings and stuff I don't
know what it means but I'm learning and
to help me learn is our camera editors
Mike Pearlman who's actually the one
that did the unboxing I figured instead
of making my poor poor Sony film its own
death sort of facing down we would have
Mike do it have the expert actually
explained the camera and he got this
camera in a few weeks ago so if you're
interested in it you liked the unboxing
we have the full review as well ready
and posted on TechnoBuffalo the link is
going to be right down below so
hopefully you're gonna get improved
video you may have noticed the past
couple of videos will be or have been in
1080p this one is being filmed with the
camera will also be in 1080p use this
part of it so you can get your 1080p on
you can see the improved quality you
might also see this guy make a cameo in
some videos it's a wireless floppy it's
a wireless floppy mic from audio
technica so if you see the helmet pin to
my shirt you will know why all to just
get better audio and video quality I
think we needed
and I certainly heard you guys when you
were asking for it as well
so enjoy mics unboxing of the canon
vixia hf g10 you can see it right there
boom and if you want to read his full
review the link is going to be down
below and of course I'll use the camera
for a while let you guys know my
thoughts I'm John retino hey guys and
gals this is Mike Pearlman from
TechnoBuffalo and today I am unboxing
the canon vixia hf g10 camcorder
retailing for 1500 bucks
I know it's expensive but it might be
worth it I've been waiting for this
camcorder for about five years the
consumer market is really stepping it up
when it comes to its consumer camcorders
and this is almost on the borderline of
a prosumer camcorder here we have the
box
it's canons typical red and white candy
cane box and there's the beauteous vixia
hf g10 and on the box we can discern
that this is a full HD 1080p beast but
to my knowledge this camcorder can
record note native 24 p that is awesome
it also has canons new HD c MOS pro
sensor this camcorder is optimal for the
budget filmmaker if you don't want to
spend a you know 2 grand or 3 grand on a
super expensive prosumer camcorder this
is an option let's see what we have here
we get the warranty card for the hft 10
and typical to any Canon camcorder we
have big bag filled with CDs and the
manual and
this is just not your typical camcorder
manual I mean this means business this
says there are lots of exciting manual
controls in this camcorder this
camcorder kicks ass that's what this
instructional manual says ah ready to
unshift the holy grail oh I've been
waiting for a camcorder like this for so
long you know classic little Canon Vixia
tag and our fancy little logos here and
one exciting thing about this camcorder
is its iris it has an 8 bladed iris the
bouquet effect that can be achieved
should be pretty substantial I'm excited
about that it also has a 3.5 inch wide
touchscreen LCD and that 24 P you see
there like I said in the beginning
native 24 P and that is excellent so
here it is here is the big guy and this
is just quite a divergence from what you
typically see last year's Canon Vixia HF
s21 was devoid of this chunky giant
smooth that's like Country Crock it is
just a nice lens ring here the back for
the big battery we also get an
extendable viewfinder here and here's
the cap for the hot shoe and this is a
Canon proprietary hot shoe so we're
looking at accessories are specifically
canon or third-party accessories that
are compatible with canon close mofo ok
so right there it's hard to close this
try not to take that off this is a
different zoom rocker 2 this is one of
the flat slide zoom rockers instead of
there they're kind of zoom tab that pops
up it's more of a flat slide it's smooth
it's not bad at all
let's see how comfortable this thing is
on the inside we have this kind of like
faux suede we've seen that before from
canons
bad very comfortable definitely very
comfortable and yeah very ergonomic
superg anomic camcorder let's see what
do we have here we have a custom button
and what that most likely is for in a
jog dial what this combination most
likely is for is manual controls jogging
through the manual controls
here's that gigantic screen and this is
really nice to have I'm really glad that
they kept that viewfinder in there too
for the sunny days on shoots and auto
focus manual focus that's a nice quick
function to have right there powered is
I'm I'm hoping that this is going to
meet the Panasonic power oh is and mega
o is that we've seen so let's jump
inside here we have a dual SD card slot
and to my knowledge they are they can
hold up to 64 gigabyte cards each and
one when one fills up it spills over to
the next card and this is just the
refinement on canons camcorders in the
higher-end range it's just fantastic
ports here we also have component out
and an AV out there's the display and
battery info button that tells you how
much battery life you have left this is
the playback button let's shoot on over
to the grip side here we notice there's
a playback speaker and we have the
remote HDMI and USB terminals covertly
hidden underneath the strap so this is a
typical Canon design although we are
given this nice lens ring and we also
haven't unearthed the most exciting part
of this camera and that is the Canon HD
video glass with a 10x optical zoom and
this lens will accommodate 58 millimeter
attachments so this is just a very nice
lens
we'll see how it performs I'm very
excited
and let's actually reach in here see
what else we get we get this nice lens
hood let's throw that bad boy on there
put it on there we go
and that is to block out light though it
can cast a shadow so you have to be
careful the lighting situation to use
this in this is the plug this goes to
the plug for the battery charger and lo
and behold they give us an HDMI cable
that's rare
you rarely get an HDMI cable so that
that is a definite plus
figure a good HDMI cable you looking at
35 to 50 bucks for a good one so factor
that into the $1,500 price tag on this
here's a remote we get see what else
there's the battery not a huge battery
let's see what we got for juice looks
like okay the BP 808 and it's an 850
milliamp battery 850 milliamp battery
you're definitely going to want to get
an extra battery or at least a couple of
them if you want this thing to last
throughout the day especially on shoots
ok whole County of things in here this
is the charger okay and we also get the
this is probably has been in Canon
camcorder boxes since I don't know I was
in high school we get our AV connections
here we also get our USB cable just
standard and of course there's no juice
so you're just gonna have to wait for
the full review of the Canon Vixia HF
g10 this should be year's best camcorder
I'm predicting but we will see about
that hope you tune in for my full review
of this camcorder and
otherwise stay safe out there this is
