coverage what's up everyone jon
rettinger TechnoBuffalo here with the
just announced and soon to be released
LG spectrum coming to verizon wireless's
4g LTE airwaves it's going to a closer
look at the device so it's going to be
on verizon wireless as i mentioned 4g
LTE from a size standpoint 5.3 three
inches 2.71 wide by a pretty spin point
42 inches and it weighs four point nine
nine ounces so the display here is
really what LG is talking a lot about
it's a 4.5 inches of course that's
always measured diagonal true HD aah IPS
display to give you a resolution of 720
x 1080 so we've seen a lot of
high-resolution displays come and go
through the smartphone world LG is
really touting their IPS display as
showing more pixels so what LG is
claiming here is that you're going to
get truer colors so you've got more bars
of green more bars of blue more bars of
red to get it more true pictures as
opposed to this sort of pentile display
that super amaral it has you can see
it's a little bigger bit of blue a
little bit of green and then some red
the screen here does look very nice
alright so let me run through a bit more
of the specs here so it's gone a gig of
ram 1.5 gigahertz dual-core cpu and it's
in the snapdragon family to actually the
scorpion chip on the back of the device
you've got an 8 megapixel camera that
can shoot 1080p video of course you've
got LED flash front-facing camera lives
on here as well there are three buttons
at the bottom and these are all of the
capacitive variety that one in the
middle of the home button looks like a
real button but it is actually a
capacitive
so this is running Gingerbread LG has
announced an Ice Cream Sandwich will be
coming sometime towards the middle of
the year this is going to be available
January nineteenth for a hundred and
ninety-nine dollars on Verizon Wireless
