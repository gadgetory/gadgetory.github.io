technobuffalo here you can probably tell
by the title this video what I'm going
to talk about or even looking at your
wrist can thinking man I can see too
much skin I wish there is something
there that could give me notifications
tell me the time and also show Mickey
doing this well friend you are in luck
because we want to give you an a
particular we want to give you this
Apple watch it's the one we use in our
reviews the one I had on my wrist and I
want you to win it now we'll ship it to
you it'll come in its box all nice and
wrapped up but this is the one this
exact one is the one that you can win
it's a 42 millimeter sport obviously
with the blue band unless you're
watching me on gray scale and we want to
give it to you to have and to hold and
to cherish through better and for worse
there's a lot of both i fade in CR
review so the way we made it super easy
first international as long as you live
in a country with an address that except
shipping you can enter it's going to run
for two weeks from today may fourth yes
maybe always be with you until two weeks
I'm today which by my king map is the
18th I'll end at eleven fifty-nine p.m.
pacific standard time on the 18 if you
want to enter for watch this video on
youtube hit the link down below but the
article on technobuffalo calm we've got
a widget there you can enter 10
different ways you get different entries
for doing different things just makes it
way easier we'll pick one winner at
random and ship them this watch it if
you're the winner make sure that you
have a way to access to email you
register with so we can email that
address we know that it really is you if
well anything else if you want a note
for me or if you want something sign if
that's something that you'd enjoy I'm
happy to do that for you as well we'll
clean this up make sure it's all spic
and span but i figure there's no point
that's like hoarding things i don't feel
right returning a product to Apple that
we've already sort of used and we've
already reviewed so I figured what
better way than just to give it to the
folks that help put food on our table
