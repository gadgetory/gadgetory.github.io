review for you of the Apple iPhone as
you see I'll get into the features of
the iPhone let me tell you a little bit
about the phone itself first off this is
the phone I'm sure you've all seen in
videos or the Apple Store it's got one
button on the bottom which there's the
home button it's got the speaker right
there that we'll see here on the top of
the phone is the headphone jack with the
3.5 millimeter headphone zones because
it's recessed I'm not sure why I've
looked at that but it is got the power
button right there the back of the phone
it's got the Apple logo here is where
your antenna is the left side of the
phone has a switch that turns the ringer
on and off and a great simple for
meetings and a volume up or down bottom
the phone's got the familiar iPod docks
but used to charge it with and the right
side of the phone has nothing so you
guys can see it's very very very thin
and the back to also is a camera right
there overall I've been using the phone
since it came out pretty much I've been
very very very pleased with it the call
quality is good no better worse than
anything else the build quality the
phone seems excellent the built-in
speaker is is good when listening to
music it's actually very loud the GUI on
the phone itself you can tell why it
took Apple so long to come out with the
phone for those of you that might not
know GUI or GUI is a graphical user
interface essentially the operating
system what you've seen you look at the
phone and I've never seen anything more
fun to look at
it's got even when you're minimizing
applications the zoom out effect as you
guys will see when I get into the review
even though all these effects might seem
just more like fun features the phone
does serve it's a very powerful business
tool email functionality is certainly
serviceable web browsing is by far the
best I've used on any phone and I've
certainly used my fair share across all
platforms and most carrier
is one of the complaints I've heard with
the iPhone is ATT coverage I can't
really speak to that it varies more you
live where I am 18 t covered as
excellent I had 18 TV four so there's no
trouble there at all lack of 3G is
certainly a problem but you know that
going into the phone that doesn't have
that eight gigabytes of storage which
what I have seems to be plenty for me
but I can see why people would want more
and I'm sure future models will have
that again overall I'm very very very
happy but it with the iPhone everywhere
I go it seems like there's a crowd
around a I just wanted to see it in play
with it it's that that big net exciting
of a product so it's in conclusion if
you have the resources to pick one up
it's absolutely worth while it's a great
phone for me activation was a piece of
cake it took 10 minutes by the people
are having some trouble but Apple is
doing their best I know to to fix it any
questions nor go to your Apple Store
call AT&amp;amp;T or app so guys here is part 1
enjoy the review ask questions if you
got them thank you all for subscribing
enjoy guys let's get down to it so here
we have the iPhone in its off position
first thing that you need to do turn the
iPhone on is either push the one button
here or the button on top the power
button push the menu button comes up
pumping you down lock slide the lever to
the right unlock and that brings you to
the iPhones main menu and you can see it
consists of four rows of three and then
a bottom set of four hot keys walk
through kind of quickly each one here
but you'll see it's text calendar photos
camera YouTube socks
maps weather clock calculator notes
settings on the bottom you have phone
mail Safari and iPod so we'll start from
the top here first thing you have is
text click on text it pulls up your most
recent text
if you push the Settings button it gives
you a list of all recent people that you
you texted the texts are set up very
easily very similar to I chat in firm X
you can scroll through what I've typed
appears in the green what here in this
case my girlfriend is typed is in the
grey and you can scroll through very
easily go back to settings one cool
thing that the phone does in order to
delete text if you slide your finger to
the right over the main pulls up a
little delete thing hit delete delete
the text kind of cool calendar is the
general calendar I'll show you what it
looks like what you have today I get
something going on today it shows up
below there photos is I think one of the
shining features of the iPhone hit
photos it pulls up all the photos you
have synced I'll pull up my camera roll
can go taking with my camera let's give
an example put a picture of my cat
it lets you scroll through just by
flicking your finger go to the next
picture and like we'll get to on the web
you're able to zoom in just by zooming
if I were to if this was a landscape
picture for example if I were to turn it
sideways as you can see the picture
would rotate with it
kind of a cool feature you also have the
option for photos too on arrows instead
of scrolling your finger go to next
here's a picture you want to delete you
can just hit delete and very kind of
cool fashion gets has to be deleted get
sucked right into the trashcan you also
have the option in photos you hit the
menu button down there to use this
wallpaper email photo
assign it to contact or cancel get out
of photos here camera is a very simple
camera big shutter appears and then
you've got your viewfinder there is no
way to zoom on the camera there are no
functions
it's take a picture of what you see that
is definitely one of the drawbacks of
the iPhone and you push the button right
there to take the picture YouTube is
actually one of the features that I
found myself using the most and one of
the features that I didn't think I was
going to use at all it's actually very
cool
you hit YouTube and you can search you
can view featured videos most viewed
things you have bookmarked or even a few
options I'll show you real quickly what
it looks like we're going to featured
and it's fun one here ok should I pick
one reply turns horizontal turn it for
you starts the buffer and there goes
very cool which that's half the screen
menu pops up you can pause fast-forward
rewind bookmark email it and you can
fast-forward by dragging your finger
across which you're done simply get done
pulls you back to the main menu okay
sorry I got a breeze over these kind of
quickly YouTube cuts me off after a
couple minutes stop hold up stop soft
quotes
it's got Google Maps that's very
familiar environment for online I'll
show you real quickly take Google Maps
there's a local Apple Store hit maps
again pulls up just a very very familiar
Google Maps application weather pull up
weather for where you are clock pulls up
the clock calculator to calculator notes
just simple notes program settings gives
you a very limited customizing ability
airplane mode turns off the wireless
features Wi-Fi some usage which tells
you how long you've using the phone
since you're less charged how long you
been using the phone period for call
volumes and how much data you set to
received and you have the option of
resetting that information as well</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
