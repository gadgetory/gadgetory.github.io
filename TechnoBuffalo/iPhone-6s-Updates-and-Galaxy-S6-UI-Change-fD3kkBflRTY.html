to you by Squarespace what's going on
guys a mark and sang from TechnoBuffalo
and it's been a while it feels good to
be back doing rumor roundup but today
we'll be talking a bit about the iphone
6s and what we might see you later this
year the galaxy s6 and TouchWiz and last
but not least a 12-inch MacBook Air
everyone seems to be going crazy about
this is Ruby roundup let's start running
those rumors of iphone success isn't
expected to launch until later this year
but if you recently suggest we already
know what's expected an upcoming handset
the usual anonymous sources say the
apples next flagship will offer a
pressure-sensitive touch screen similar
to what we'll see with the Apple watch
and basically what that'll do is use the
sensors built into the display to tell
the difference between a quick tap and a
long press and responds differently
depending on which one you do if the
rumors are true it definitely changed
the way we interact with our smartphones
maybe with iOS 9 will be able to Center
drawings or heartbeat through I message
who knows but beyond that the same
reports claim will finally see 2
gigabytes of RAM built into apple's next
handset and no less than 32 gigabytes of
storage yes and it also come with an
upgraded camera what a dual lens system
in optical zoom now essentially what
optical zoom will allow you to do is to
take clearer shots when zooming in on a
subject as opposed to software enables
zoom which sometimes leaves the final
shot looking blurry or grainy now at an
optical zoom you'll get sharper shots
without the weird software artifacts we
usually see existing iPhones produce now
if all these are truly included in the
next iPhone I'm really excited to see
how Apple intends to use these new
technology within its software as of
right now it's only just a rumor and I
guess we'll have to wait for a while to
see what Apple has in store for us
moving on to Samsung in the galaxy s6
the company's new device is expected to
represent a fresh start for samsung from
a hardware perspective and it sounds
like Samsung will take the same approach
to software as well a new report claims
that the upcoming device will feature a
totally redesigned version of TouchWiz
UI that's less bloated and more
efficient than ever the report also adds
that the new TouchWiz is designed to
look a lot like Google's own stock
Android UI on devices like the Nexus 6
and beyond improving its look Sampson
wants to offer a smoother experience and
take up less storage space within its
own software we're expecting to see the
new software to be unveiled alongside
the galaxy s6 this March at Mobile World
Congress and I personally have been
asked
for a stripped-down version of TouchWiz
for quite a while now and hopefully
Samsung will deliver TouchWiz is a great
to a certain extent and offers a lot of
cool features that you won't really find
on stock Android like multi window mode
and easy mode just to name a few but
there's too much unnecessary bloatware
pre-installed and hopefully during
Mobile World Congress will see something
great from Samsung let me stop the
rumors for just a quick second and thank
our friends over at Squarespace
Squarespace recently launched our latest
version of their platform Squarespace 7
and it's amazing I personally use
Squarespace to build my website and it's
probably the easiest platform I've ever
used it now integrates with getty images
in google apps so i can find and use
images and my google apps easier and it
now offers new templates which looks
amazing you don't necessarily need to
know CSS or HTML to build a good website
just use one of their existing template
and make it your own if you want to try
the new Squarespace 7 go to squarespace

techno with a capital T to get ten
percent off your next purchase trust me
it's worth it last but not least we
can't miss out on this during the buzz
of CES 2015 last week 9to5 mac published
the first details on Apple's rumor
12-inch MacBook Air it's expected to
offer a thinner profile a single USB
type-c port a brand new industrial
design and more now a fresh report from
DigiTimes claimed that we might expect
to see the alleged 12-inch MacBook Air
hit the market pretty soon the news
outlet said Tuesday that quantum
computer recently started manufacturing
apple's new macbook air and and the
apple is on a scheduled to launch it
during the first quarter of this year
now according to that time frame this
means we should see it available for
purchase between now and the end of
March apparently Apple has plans to
replace the current 11-inch macbook air
with a new 12 inch model but will
continue to sell the 13-inch model as
well this is still very much a rumor but
Apple's MacBook Airs certainly due for
an upgrade particularly to include a
Retina Display so what do you guys think
of a 12-inch MacBook Air are you excited
for it or are you more excited to see a
retina MacBook Air let us know in the
comments down below anyways that's it
