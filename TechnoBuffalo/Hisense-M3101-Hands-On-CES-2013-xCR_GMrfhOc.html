go further another day at CES in another
tablet how's it going guys marin baker
from TechnoBuffalo this is the Hisense
m31 01 specs wise packing ICS also known
as the android 4.2 saraly a stock build
at ICS got some customizations that
hisense and implemented on this device
but packing some pretty cool spots all
around a one point three gigahertz
nvidia tegra 3 cpu so you know you look
at this knife que CES 2013 we've seen
the Tegra 4 we've seen definitely jelly
bean from past couple months a little
bit behind the spec race still I think
this can be a great competitor in
certain markets pass to touch 10.1 inch
HD IPS display so nice HD display here 1
gigabyte memory apt rights of internal
storage microSD card up to 32 gigabytes
5-megapixel rear-facing camera let's see
if I can pull it without setting the
alarm our intimate set the alarm off
it's a little bit tight down there so
we'll take a look at it just a minute
6400 milliamp hour battery and some
preinstalled applications here I don't
know how much of this comes from tysons
and how much this is stuff people have
installed since it is Wi-Fi connected
right now as you can see down here so
little bit of a customization you see
the buttons down here customized lock
down here is customized where come over
here and take a look and see where comes
on the top since it is unable to be
moved volume rocker and power button
over there looks like you're pretty
clear my greatest be charging board down
at the bottom of this device keep it
locked on technobuffalo for continuing
CES 2013 coverage tablets phones TVs all
that good stuff at technobuffalo calm
i'm aaron baker i'm on twitter and aaron
c baker and our facebook companies at
facebook.com slash technobuffalo thanks
so much for watching Fordyce just
announced the automotive industry's
first open mobile developer program
enabling developers to integrate their
apps with sync applink the sdk has a ton
of tools and you'd be keeping company
with apps like USA Today bacup Lee and
kaliki yet another way that Ford is
keeping you connected especially thanks
to forward for powering our CES coverage
