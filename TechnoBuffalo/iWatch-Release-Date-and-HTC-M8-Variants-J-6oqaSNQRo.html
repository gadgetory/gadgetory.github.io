to you by loot crate what's going on
internet welcome back there episode of
rumor roundup i'm your host jon
rettinger and the title should give it
away but this to show we take all the
important tech comes from the week we
pick and choose most important ones and
i serve them up to you on a silver
platter of rumor awesomeness up this
week it's the old saw worth the iphone 6
is back the i watch an HTC maybe some m8
variants are coming and coming sooner
than you think this rumor roundup to
start round them all up
let's begin with the iphone 6 so a news
report from the Taiwanese industrial
commercial times claimed production on
the first two that's correct to iphone 6
miles begin as early as July pointing to
a sep tember launch for the 4.7 inch
phone and the larger 5.51 though is
going to be a staggered release cycle so
we don't know if Apple's gonna announce
just one of them be like hey another
press conference bigger phones coming or
if they'll announce both and say you
know maybe in September the 4.7 inch
iphone 6 is coming and then the bigger
one maybe a few months later we don't
know but a staggered release cycle does
give Apple a little bit more time so
other changes you can expect are
expected to use sapphire and design this
year to make it super super durable as
probably replacement for traditional
glass screen we don't think it's going
to be sapphire on the back like glass
was on the iPhone 4 and the 4s also
hearing rumors specially this week of
voice over LTE calling I know the iphone
5 had LTE but you weren't doing any
voice dialing over that thing at all is
really just for data so that should mean
to be able to get HD voice the voice
should sound much much better because
for lack of a better analogy the pipes
are bigger more data can go through them
to make your voice sound much better i
know IRA can see the names being made
bigger pipes also expecting iOS 8 to be
on board emphasizing new apps focus on
health and fitness and possibly take
advantage of some new sensors built into
the iphone 6 I love big screen phones at
5.5 inch iphone would make me super
happy but even a 4.7 inch phone is point
force of inches better than what I've
got right now so I think would be great
to have a second except I think does
make sense i would say September though
we will see an announcement of both
phones and hopefully we'll know more you
know as we get closer as soon as parts
start to leak this is production starts
to start we'll see Sir these phones
start to come out Apple's did a really
bad job the past few generations of
keeping things under wraps so it's only
a matter of time now it looks like
summer and fall is going to be a busy
busy time for the folks from Cupertino
if you believe in your report from
Chinese newspaper easily enough to
pronounce the economic daily news via
digit times so they are claiming that
apple SmartWatch is going to launch in
q3 of the sheer
according to asian supply chain sources
which I don't know if those sources be
the sources are so sketchy sometimes it
could be like according to that dude
it's coming soon so if we take the
source at their word Apple is reportedly
working with a number of suppliers to
ship around and get this number 65
million smart hot units this year that
was not a typo I didn't say it wrong 65
million with an M not a B which is still
freaking crazy well you're like oh John
so many people have pebbles well they've
only shipped 400,000 units in all of
2013 so think about that so the
Taiwanese company Rick tech is
apparently tastic manufacturing i watch
processors while tpk is producing the
touch panels and quanta computer is
going to take care of all the rest of
the business report adds the productions
but to begin in august so maybe sep
tember when then iphone 6 or iPhone
sixes get an ounce maybe an accessory to
go on your wrist and they're expecting
to ship that many they're gonna start
building them very soon like now which
also means more leaks yeah so get your
blurry cams ready folks in those
factories because we want to see what's
coming let me take a quick minute to
thank our friends over all good people
at Luke rate listen i unboxed up for
living I like opening up things and this
is something that shows up every month
that I get a look forward to and I know
is going to have cool stuff in it so
Luke rate is a subscription box service
for geeks nerds and gamers like us that
the liver pretty awesome stuff to your
door for about 20 bucks or so each month
shipping and handling totally included
this month it was all about titanfall
but previous crates have included things
from Marvel Nintendo blizzard and way
more I've got an idea for something
awesome like if you want to techno
Buffalo crate just saying you could tell
them Luke rate will sort of put it into
their queue and perhaps they will make
one for you because they want to serve
the geek in all of us if you like to
open up fun things at that cool unboxing
experience if you like salt water
calculate put in here which was quite
delicious I check out loot crate calm /
technion to be ten percent off your
first order again that's loot crate l 00
t CR 80 e calm through your fan of the
new HTC One and may put your like John I
wish to add a bigger screen well HTC
might have something for you
you the flagship variants are the new
thing right now it looks like HTC won't
let that m8 send the shelves without any
siblings for much longer a blurry photo
of a device allegedly called the HTC One
m8 ace and I've been trying to put that
on a tag was posted online earlier by
our friend on Twitter ethnics who has a
really really ridiculously solid track
record prick ting phones soon after
though a second picture of the same
phone from HTC tipster this is on
Twitter at HTC family underscore are you
appeared to sign without the blurry
screen that Evelyn's had and it clearly
showed it running sent sick software
although the big unfortunate thing here
is the phone doesn't tell us that much
about the device supposedly it's going
to gum and bright red ants up to the
picture was it has thinner bezels it
also has ginormous speaker grilles on
the front panel that could just be due
to poor picture quality so to figure out
what this phone might be let's go back
in time last month when HTC announced
the HTC One evelyn's hitted the company
is also planning an m8 mini and an m8
ace so based on that lineup would guess
DA's is probably to the super-sized
version of HTC One similar to what we
saw with HTC One max although it could
also be a cheaper full-size version the
m8 maybe for developing countries but
that could be something else totally
entirely there's no way to know
obviously for sure but hopefully if
she's gonna make it announcements soon I
love bigger phones i think the HTC one
is a perfect size but you know folks out
there would love a 5.7 or even a 6-inch
phone so maybe HTC has gone an answer
for you so what you guys think iPhone 6
i watch gigantic size HTC one's finish
called HTC to which it probably should
have called the MA in the first place I
