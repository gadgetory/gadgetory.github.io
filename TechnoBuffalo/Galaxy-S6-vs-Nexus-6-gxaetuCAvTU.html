you're from TechnoBuffalo here there are
ton of ridiculously awesome Android
phones out there right now it's hard to
pick which one is best for you without
you want to go in s6 HTC One m9 you want
to go the Nexus route they're just a ton
of options so I thought I would take the
last two phones that I've use as my
daily driver the Nexus 6 and the galaxy
s6 and the galaxy s6 edge they're
essentially the same phone's not going
to talk about the edge features on
either so you could assume that this is
a versus battle essentially both these
devices versus the Nexus 6 they really
bring some unique things to the table
that no one has done before but they're
also very different devices I'm going to
end this with one that I would pick if I
had to pick one phone for the next 12 to
18 months and hopefully it'll help you
decide which phone is going to be right
for you officially I've liked really
large screen phones always I was very
excited about the Nexus 6 then I got a
chance to see the screens on the galaxy
s6 galaxy s6 edge and I became very
impressed for part of the video that I'm
just going to call it the galaxy s6 and
the zoom I'm talking about both because
I'm just gonna start garbling my words
if I'm like s6 s6 edge Nexus 6 2 minus 6
is it's going to get started so these
are phones version formulas you're
looking at this screen almost
exclusively so let's talk about that
screen a same resolution on both phones
you've got a 2560 by 1440 it's 5.1
inches on the s6 and it's much larger on
the Nexus 6 at five point nine six
inches obvious differences in PPI and
screen sizes at 676 versus 493 all those
specs don't really mean that much
they're really high resolution phones
what matters though is how you use them
I've had a really big issues with
screens outdoors I'm outdoors a lot I'm
taking my son to the park I've checked
my phone and I can't usually see this I
kind of bring this all the way up
actually pretty good outdoor visibility
on the galaxy s6 line of phones they
believe outdoors really well I haven't
be able to say that with many phones
also had really good viewing angles once
I got outdoors Nexus 6 that even the
brightness all the way up this toy
different story I couldn't see it as
well outside out either squint sort of
do a little hand over the screen thing
that we've all kind of done I despite
the same resolution images look just
sharper on Samsung's offering Texas a
little bit Crips Chris Berg colors a
little bit brighter
some people can say they looked a little
oversaturated it's mostly due to touch
which put a launcher on there you're not
going to see it things can't let give it
a little bit washed out on the nexus 6
it's not that it's a bad screen Nexus 6
actually a pretty good screen it's just
not the best one out there when you
compare it to I consider now the
flagship of screens on the Samsung
Galaxy s6 line of phones this one
becomes a no-brainer
I have screens important to outdoor
visibility is important to you
Samsung is going to take this one
obviously performance is a big issue now
in the reviews of both phones I ran
through quadrants and into two tests
though this is about this is about
actual usage the s6 has just an insane
processor next no7 it's got two
quad-core process for octa-core just
gargantuan witness
whereas Nexus 6 has I guess a more
pedestrian a quad-core Snapdragon 805
the bottom line both are ridiculously
fast yeah the test score is going to be
faster on the Nexus 6 but I have had
zero performance issues on either phones
both are fast both open apps quickly
both scroll there's no lag on either
devices the processor that's what your
difference here at least not yet in
either of these phones so if you're
worried about how it's going to perform
versus the octa-core I wouldn't worry
about that one at all
I have no preference even either one
next let's talk about that camera on the
back 16 megapixel on samsung and 13 on
the Motorola built Nexus 6
obviously megapixels don't tell whole
story I'm gonna really matter if we kind
of zoom in quite a bit I will say I
haven't been the biggest fan of
Motorola's cameras recently in general
dating all the way back to the Moto X
things did get better if they haven't
gotten great this is kind of same story
the screen it's an average camera onto
the Nexus 6 decent pictures not great
not the best in low-light the ring flash
looks cool doesn't really add all that
much it can be a lot of noise and
pictures it's usable certainly if you
want to take figures upload them to
Facebook or Instagram takes great 4k
video but it's not the best camera out
there now the Samsung camera is not the
best camera out there either but it's
definitely better than we're seeing
right now the Nexus 6 even with the
software updates that have come it's
great in low-light 4k video looks
awesome
pictures came out really sharp even when
zoomed in this is how I determine which
one I would pick by both of these on a
table and I'm going out for the night I
want to take pictures and I wanted to
pick one phone 10 at 10 times I'm
picking up the galaxy s6 alright next
let's talk about Android experience next
device you can get the latest offered
from Google and that is currently
sitting at 5.1 on the sexy in xe6 all of
these Samsung devices
it's 5.0 point 2 with Samsung's TouchWiz
on top and listen I've been really hard
on TouchWiz in the past look really hard
on it it's much better here it's much
more usable you have to go through just
a billion setups you don't have to go
through a ton of tutorials the bleeps
and bloops are all gone the cartoonish
colors are still there in fact after I
did my review and even towards the tail
end of that I put Nova Launcher on here
and got rid of almost all of the touch
with stuff but something that is good I
think the quick launchers are really
nice it's a lot a big fan of how the
settings layout is but I can live with
it it's a much more usable experience
and we've seen in the past it's also 40%
lighter having said that though I still
preferred the look of sake Android in
fact I use Nova Launcher because I want
this to look more stock Android so this
is again a personal preference but for
me based on just experience when Android
is going to be like really like when the
Nexus has to offer so when it comes to
Android experience Nexus 6 all day
alright so what about something to
random things and there obviously are a
ton of other things we could cover but I
wanted to sort of talk about the most
salient ones least to me
so battery I've got a twenty five
hundred million power battery on the
galaxy s6 50 milliamp hours bigger just
for a fun fact on the edge and it's 3220
on the Nexus 6 battery life on the
Samsung phones is not awesome you can
charge it wirelessly in quick charge I
get all that actually quick charge on
both of them it's not in your charger
not going to get long lasting battery
life so be aware of that
now battery is not super stellar either
on the Nexus 6 but is definitely better
so if you have to go for a whole day on
an external battery charger with you
can't plug in then I go Nexus 6 if you
have the ability to serve charge during
the day you can plug it in and
connectional charger with you
then sake to make that much of a
difference neither has expandable
storage neither has removable memory so
that's kind of
cheers well but it comes down to which
one I would pick in fact which one I did
pick I love the Nexus 6 is one of my
favorite phones that I've checked out
but I get the privilege of checking out
every phone and things tend to get
better throughout the year so you get to
be released that's kind of the case with
the same thing devices and this is
really when the first times actually
remember saying I prefer a smaller
screen phone over the bigger one
I love giant screen sizes in fact I'm
super excited partly like you are for
what the note 5 is going to be or than
the note 5 edge or they decide to call
it but if I had to pick one of these
phones to use the next 12 to 18 months
I'd pick the a Galaxy s6 in fact I pick
the galaxy s6 edge because I love the
way that looks want to see your versus
battle between the two of these we did
will link that down below as well you
can see the difference that would pick
the Samsung devices over the larger
screen Nexus 6 and not say that six is a
bad phone it's still a great phone gotta
pick one up yet the option to buy it
unlock use it on pretty much any carrier
AT&amp;amp;T t-mobile Verizon it's going to work
right out of the box for you but when it
comes to way the screen looks when it
comes to the features and I hate to say
it but I still kind of like TouchWiz I
would go for the galaxy s6 what do you
guys think you agree disagree if you
disagreed tell me why don't you yell at
me or call me names or call each other
names in the comments give a valid
reason why you disagree love to hear it
and I'll respond to comments you can
sort of have a discussion about it the
video a thumbs up we always appreciate
it until next time I'm John ranging from
TechnoBuffalo to big subscribe button
for the latest greatest tech news I will
talk to you dear friend in the next
