by domain.com how's it going guys my
first time here with TechnoBuffalo and
this is our review of the HTC One a9 I
thought we do this a little bit
differently because we like to do things
yeah differently oh by the way John's
here put ginger of techni Buffalo as
well so first off I know you didn't use
this device I did for about 4 days we
didn't get it working on LTE in the US
because this is an international model
but I did use it like crazy in the
office and at home on and off of our
Wi-Fi it's an interesting device it is
just a polarizing the right waving
polarizing is absolutely the right way
to describe this thing I haven't felt so
conflicted inside me about a device for
a while so it's like the eating meat of
phones yeah a little bit like tastes
delicious but I realized it's bad for
the environment and a bunch of other
things like so speaking of days
delicious
it runs marshmallow it's the first non
Nexus device to do so and they got that
out to market very fat for fast I mean
it was what a week after the Nexus
devices yes and they even went so far as
to make a commitment that 15 days after
Nexus devices this is gonna get worse
recent software so outside of the two
Nexus phones this is going to get the
latest software before anything else
before anything else which is cool
there's some similarities to some other
devices in terms of build it's a
familiar-looking design it's a very
familiar looking feeling design but the
phone itself isn't bad
like that's not where I have major
issues with it a lot of this stuff that
I've been looking at lately has been
like the more budget affordable stuff
and when I was looking at the price
point for this at 400 bucks
I thought cool I can compare it to those
the original price point the original
point and that's kind of one of the
cruxes of the issue is that we're
looking at a device that costs $500 when
you know what else costs $500 yes at the
price is going up a hundred 100 bucks in
a month yeah right so it's basically a
little sale that they've got going on
for launch the fingerprint reader works
great and runs marshmallow so it works
with the native api's for it which
fantastic it works with LastPass that
you know that's a big deal for ya
especially since we set up phone so
often processor wise it's a 617 so in a
vacuum it's fine it runs fine that was
like the right place to like make a
decision about what processor to be
running that is the latest Snapdragon
it's the newest one of the next one
coming out is the 820 so it's literally
the newest one that Paul come has out
right now
ok so it is bleeding edge that's for
sure the problem with the 6:17 is that
it doesn't support 64-bit which
marshmallow is which all about it's a
it's a flagship feature not to mention
it's clocked at 1.5 it is octa-core I
believe ok which is yeah good to know I
just it's a 6 17 it's it's not the
flagship spec line and we just talked
about the name of this device it's the
one a9 it's their flagship line like you
said earlier there is a an utter
Pantheon right now so we can kind of
like look it look the device in a vacuum
good device good build quality yeah
decent enough processor was it was it
slowed you aren't any laughs no no I
didn't run into lag I didn't run into
stuttering I didn't run into anything
like that it screams like it's a brand
new device and it's running a modern
processor I just worry about its future
so in terms of performance it's great
what about opening apps everything opens
I didn't have a major issue with opening
apps I know that Todd mentioned in the
written view which has like a ton more
detail photos and all that stuff check
that out link will be down below boom up
down everywhere he had a little bit of
issue with loading up games yeah he said
vainglory some of the bigger stuff like
that it was so slowly - just gave up he
gave up and was like I don't need to
play anymore which I didn't experience
on this but it's definitely a valid
point the camera isn't anything that I
would look at and say this like if you
want a great camera this is the phone
again and that's really kind of the crux
of the issue the the big major crux
there isn't really enough here in any
one particular place to get me to say
like cool this could fit someone's size
it's not the best we could take if you
want the best camera right buy this if
you want the best screen buy this if you
want the best value buy this you want
the best battery you
I want the battery battery the battery
was okay okay I'd like across the board
like it's just I I just feel I'm not
underwhelmed I'm not overwhelmed just
whelmed just what is the right amount of
well just whelmed you know it's a it's a
phone stepping out of that vacuum mm-hmm
it's tough to find that you said who
this device is meant for at $500 the
same price as 6p yeah you could buy two
one plus X's two for that same price
yeah in the pantheon I it's a can't in
good conscience say it's a buy I gotta
say that it's a don't buy because
there's enough stuff on the market right
now that it just doesn't do enough to
differentiate itself compared to those
two make me tell anyone go grab this in
fact you know what the only person who I
think would want this one in particular
is like an HTC diehard if you are in
love with HTC and you love their build
quality or maybe you're looking for a
particular kind of build quality in your
hand running a different OS then the a9
makes a lot of sense yeah you know when
I first announced at home that said
updates every 15 days I thought awesome
but if you're buying the phone to get
the latest version of Android right we
look at a Nexus device presumably at
least yeah and then it's especially at
these four the 6p at the same price
point right and then maybe even lower if
you go to the 5x there's nothing that
cents is doing to make me sacrifice
going to a nexus yeah and pay attention
to this so I think overall unfortunately
I think it's a don't buy that's what we
thought about or at least that's what I
thought about the a9 hopefully you've
learned something in the process as well
yeah let us know what you guys think I'd
really be curious what you guys think
about who this device is for for example
if you are buying a 1 a 9 please let us
some of the comments and tell us why you
decided to make that purchase and if we
get a compelling reason where we can
find out maybe who this is for and we
missed it
we looked in it absolutely I would love
to update it anyway thank you guys so
