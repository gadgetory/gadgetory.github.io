the TechnoBuffalo here there are a few
things in life you can always use more
of you can always use more love you can
always use more friends you can always
use some more money
and you always need more jeez well now
we've got an extra G from what we had
before you can see that's 4 G's which
beats three GS by one you've got an
unboxing of the Samsung 4G LTE SCH LG 11
LC 11 actually it is a 4G mobile hotspot
you can play a drinking game at home for
how many times I say 4G it's a mobile
hotspot
it replaces the my5 2200 which was
previously in Verizon's lineup as their
main mic by device which is only 3g
we'll take a look at that guy in just a
minute let's go ahead and get to the
unboxing so that was a crazy long intro
I'm feeling one of my a little bit
stealing mood so they're bear with me
with this one guys
let's go ahead and run through some
prices this is going to set you back 270
dollars if you decide you don't want to
sign a two-year data contract which is
the route that I recommend is that the
rate these things come out and the rate
that wireless network share changing you
definitely might not want to be stuck
into a two-year contract if you do want
to go the two-year round however it'll
cost you 9999 on contract and to get all
of your data you can either get one of
two plans you can get five gigabytes for
50 bucks with $10 over per gigabyte or
if you are a heavy heavy Internet user
you can get 10 gigs for $80 in that same
$10 per favore used any sort of MiFi
this is going to look pretty identical
to anything else it looks like a few
credit cards stacked you may have seen
what the my fight 22-hundred looks like
I'll go ahead and whip it out and show
you for size comparisons here there's my
fi there's the Samsung 4G one they look
exactly the same
- a few buttons this one letting you
know that
where G is there go ahead and turn it on
for just a minute and I'll show you what
some of them LEDs looks like inside the
box I'm guessing you guys can guess
what's in here nothing overly fancy
schmancy got a power cord go into the
wall with a connection on the end for
USB which gets used with this cord right
here it's got micro USB for charging and
it's a cord always funny to see these
now in Verizon boxes actually it's a SIM
card which this was sent by Verizon for
for review so they actually already
installed the SIM card but that's where
this SIM card lives you've got some
instructions here for how to use this
nothing terribly fancy how to how to
login you can treat this just like any
sort of wireless router and you can
change your password and change your
network name and all that stuff and then
some master your device things I can get
out so here is the device and you know
it's working you know you got board G
when it's all green if you're not in a
4G area you can use this as a 3G hotspot
4G will technically get you possibly
perhaps if you're lucky ten times faster
than 3G look at the back of it I had a
look for awhile for where the SIM card
would go right there's where you're
gonna get charged on but this actually
does have a removable back which is kind
of nice
let's go ahead and remove a setback I'll
do a little striptease music here's I
pull it off so I have removed the back I
got my finger covering all of that
network information business here is the
battery realistically you'll probably
get about four or so hours of a battery
life you can keep it charged while using
it so you can plug it into the wall or
plug into your computer whatever your
SIM card lives with standard battery
fare here three point seven volt battery
in case you're wondering or keeping
track at home go ahead and pop that
manage amma back in i'm gonna do some
speed comparisons here with some other
4g devices that we've got kicking around
we've no shortage of data options here a
TechnoBuffalo we've got Verizon's other
actually one of their first 4g options
this is the pantech modem that's plugged
directly into the computer speed tester
always fun so stay tuned for another
video
seeing which one's faster whether or not
using Wi-Fi or plugging directly into
USB is going
quicker I'm guessing if I was a bettin
man that plug into USB it's going to be
quicker than using the MiFi but I've
been wrong many many times as my wife
will tell you so you can see if this is
one of those cases anyway guys I'm John
Breton jure from TechnoBuffalo this has
been an unboxing of the Samsung SG h LC
11 I'll see you the next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
