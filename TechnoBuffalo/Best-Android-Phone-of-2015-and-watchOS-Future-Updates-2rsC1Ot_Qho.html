to you by harry's hello internet friends
i am jon rettinger and welcome back to
the pisode of ask the Buffalo the title
should give it up is I'm not an actual
Buffalo this is where you get asking any
questions you got from the world of tech
and oftentimes like we far out of the
world attack the first question comes
from you one slavin who asks at john for
lakers what is the best android phone so
far in 2015 best one is subjective but
i'll tell you looking the best one for
me so far in 2015 and that is if I get a
drumroll please run the galaxy s6 edge
is been my favorite phone of 2015 I went
and bought one myself I love the way
looks of the way feel the way I
performed at which battery life was a
little bit better I don't mind the lack
of expandable storage removable battery
I just like me that phone next question
comes from at Matt hit 27 who asked at
John for lakers how likely is it for
apple tree plays the home button they
virtual buttons powered by force touch
the answer is very very likely forced
touch currently exists on the Apple
watch and if you ever use an Apple watch
you can really see how that integration
could work on a mobile device that was
my first thought when I used it but
according to the not reliable folks did
you time the time is like tech
equivalent of being like hey I heard
from a friend friend friend who heard
from a friend heard from a friend that
you don't like me you like me like me so
take this like a grain of salt that's
like like that but that big but does
your head big but they are saying that
Apple's new touch and display driver
integration or just called TDD chip I
will make it possible to offer an even
thinner device with less of the bezel
and a whole plane display instead of
just pressing the home button you'd
simply just touch the screen Oh to
feature the built-in fingerprint sensor
I'm guessing though Apple could also
just use some version of for such a
similar experience of pressing down on a
button but it's looking like that will
see that I wouldn't bet on it happening
for the 6s or the 6s plus but probably
on the generation after that the iphone
7 so we look at this face what do you
see chances are your first thing you're
going to say is rugged really just good
looks the next thing you're gonna say
it's just too much facial hair
I've convinced myself that I don't shave
often because I don't like it but really
shaving just got kind of expensive
fortunately the folks at harrys are here
to help they offer premium razors at non
premium prices the starter kit is just
15 bucks that includes a razor three
blades your choice of Harry shave cream
or foaming gel personally I'm a gel man
like animus shoes and on my face as an
added bonus you can get five bucks off
your first purchase when you use code
TechnoBuffalo all one word and lowercase
after using the code you can also get an
entire month worth of shading for just
ten bucks cheap great quality razors and
then you can be baby soft and smooth
next question comes from at mad have
shin knowing who asks at john for lakers
what do you think of watch OS Apple's
new watch OS you think there will be a
new watch / OS every year like the
iPhone yes I think every year we will
have a brand new Apple watch because
from a profit margin standpoint it just
makes sense force new products on people
people will buy them will buy apps and
its way apple is doing the business for
years so yes I absolutely expect a new
watch in a new OS to come every single
year so at this point you know maybe
wait for the Apple watch you already
hearing rumors it's going to feature a
camera so that could be kind of bull for
facetime calls and also probably
creeping around in public and other
editions that we could see including a
thinner casing better battery life and I
think you guys watch the episode of ask
the Buffalo I hope you enjoyed I love
making these questions keep them coming
until next time jon rettinger that's you
guys next video bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
