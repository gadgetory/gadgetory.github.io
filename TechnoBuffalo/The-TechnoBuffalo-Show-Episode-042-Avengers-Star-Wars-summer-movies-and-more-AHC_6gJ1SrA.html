TechnoBuffalo show I'm live your to host
for today Sean ani editor and chief of
the site and i'm joined by a deputy
managing editor Todd Hazleton everybody
how you doing today Todd I'm good since
this is episode 42 this means this
episode will contain the sort of life
the universe and everything yeah that's
right okay cool well I ain't America we
don't want people to leave so early I I
always forget 42 is actually the answer
it's figuring out the question yeah
that's right it is is the big part but a
little Hitchhiker's Guide I read those
are you Hootie it's part of a series
right only read the first one thing yeah
there were five books er was um
hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy
restaurant at the end of the universe I
want to I forget what the third one was
called then there was like so long and
thanks for all the fish yeah I read them
all way way way back it looks like back
back when I was in grade school I was
reading those back in the 80s so on this
week's show we're going to be discussing
a lot of upcoming movies you know we're
entering into the summer blockbuster
season and also you know I know you all
love are talking about phones but there
also is the fact that we come out once a
week and phones do not come out once a
week so every once a while we're going
to have to diverge into other
territories that being said during the
question and answer session the show
you're more than welcome to ask any
questions you may have about fun meeting
class but the the big story of course
this week was hey here's the Star Wars
digital edition breaking coming Friday
okay here they are there come on Friday
yeah what the heck was that I don't know
and it's crazy because if you look like
I was on PlayStation last night I mean
Google Play Store you look everywhere
and all of a sudden you know they all
have that banner like pre-order now
coming yeah Friday some of them have the
packages for 89 99
I um the crazy thing is when there's
that many people involved you think that
the date would have been leaked earlier
and I don't think I saw it anywhere did
you see it yeah I mean first leak I
traced it back to a Star Wars fan site
called yak face calm which I won't
bother explaining why their name is yak
face but the they had a picture back on
April first which everyone took into
camp that was on April first that a
Walmart somewhere had accidentally put
the banners out on there theft-deterrent
stands early so that was the first time
that the dates showed up even at that
only nine days out is a major yeah
especially all the hands involved in
that yeah and then voodoo which is
partially owned by walmart screwed up
and had the information up early that's
apartment I drive this cheaply so yeah I
mean the fact it was the fact that it
was announced on officially announced on
Tuesday and then boom here we go and
it's released on Friday night and what's
interesting is the following week is the
Star Wars Celebration out in Anaheim you
know are actually yeah it's it's the
following friday so why they didn't wait
for that is also curious but here we are
finally after yo years and years of
waiting and I do say we have a question
from sasha baja art such an Mahal i I'm
sorry I got so used to saying it the
other way why did it take so long for
the Star Wars movies to come to digital
well part of the problem is even after
disney purchase Lucasfilm 20th Century
Fox actually has the distribution rights
to episode for a new hope through 2020
so Disney had to make a deal with 20th
Century Fox to distribute all six films
otherwise it would have been five of the
films and the original one would have
been included so yeah that was uh that
was
a lot of the reason right there was just
trying to work out the deal with 20th
Century Fox hard thing I'm trying to
your eyes like which store do I buy it
from and that comes out of the whole
ecosystem thing we've always talked
about when do I get it through itunes
and amazon google play store I don't
know police station i was thinking i
think i'm gonna do google play store
just cuz you know right get that on iOS
and then chromecast well for me it came
down to either apple or Amazon because
if i did through amazon then I could
play through any of my Roku's but I also
you know I as everyone knows I'm a big
movie watcher on planes but I do all
that through itunes so I finally fell on
the side of itunes but i really was good
would you oh yes tough they can use for
everybody while we're on here I like to
do this during his show I are I'm sorry
OS X 10.8 n point 3 with photos is out
now we'll be right awesome uh so yeah
it's I greeted that actually was a big
debate for me and Amazon was slightly
cheaper but still I wanted the ability
to slap him on my iPad and take them
with me yeah exactly that's the thing
you know it's always hard for me to
choose like where am I gonna buy this
movie yeah and I find that most of my
collections actually in Google Play
oddly enough I mean I use Android all
the time but for some reason I'm like
you know I have an ipad 2 and I think
maybe I'll just do the writings so the
big question since all six films are
coming out do you have a personal
ranking of which one's the order in
which you like them I don't but I know
you do I wasn't a fan of and I know you
like one of the newer ones better than
one of the older ones mm but I I prefer
the older ones i think it's just sort of
the sentimental thing I watched him with
my father when I was younger and the
newer ones I just you know I don't feel
that attached to we also don't like Jar
Jar Binks but a lot of people concern me
a hair took because I rank my order goes
for 5362
one and the reason I put a new hope
episode 4 above episode 5 is yes episode
5 is a better film without question but
I have a lot of sentimental attachment
to four I also realized that we would
not have gotten four or five one and two
and three without 4 or 5 6 1 2 and 3
without for you know so for just for its
place in history for what it started and
quite possibly set me down a life path
at the age of six you know that's why
for just like you have sentimental
attachment to the original trilogy I
have a very deep sentimental attachment
2 episode 4 as for ranking episode 3
above episode 6 I will never forgive
Lucas for the Ewoks I actually despise
the Ewoks more than I despise Jar Jar
really wow ok I would like to hunt he
walks and roast them over a fire okey
carpet make a nice carpet and also have
a nice ewok brisket for Sunday dinner I
hate so yes might so my order is a
little controversial 4536 one third to
one and i say i will already put seven
above one without even having seen it
yeah that's how much I hate episode one
so yeah Star Wars is finally finally
coming along digital now I assume you
already on these two corners comments
they have the VHS tapes which I love I
have them on VHS I have them this is the
one that will blow everyone's mind on
laserdisc nice mask on DVD and on
blu-ray and now initial and now
digitally yes i still have my laser
discs that's awesome yeah which actually
gives me a leg up over many people
because i have the original theatrical
cuts
and not the special editions Wow yeah so
no bad CGI java in Mos Eisley so the
other big thing of course is Avengers
age of Ultron is premiering on may first
or releasing in the US and May first

age now where I'm just like eh Krabs I'm
sorry wait Mike ate at you crap on kids
exactly I don't want especially my
little dinky theatre I you sit right on
top of each other yeah so I don't want
to sit there like this the entire movie
with my arms crossed I've never been to
one of those theaters where they have
you know the meal service and the drinks
and all that I huberman I want to go to
why this so bad seems cool yeah like the
Alamo Drafthouse down in Texas yeah
there's a couple of mountain California
think they with you too yeah I would
love to go to a theater like that I mean
I hate buying overpriced bags of M&amp;amp;M
peanuts and when you can have an
overpriced eek exactly exactly I mean
like I'll go out to a theater you know
when I man California there's one
specific 1i I go to sometimes and I'm
just like you know you want 454 a bottle
of water yeah you know and folks yes
that's how movie theaters make the
majority of their money but I'm sorry I
sneak bottles of water in I I I break
that rule of no outside food or doing i
I'm sorry water is a basic human right
I'm sorry if I want to take water in
with me I'm taking water but uh you know
what are they gonna do but no Avengers
I'm excited for you know I'm excited to
see the Marvel Universe continuing yeah
I there was definitely a time in my life
where I would have killed for one decent
comic book movie and now you I get to
three a year just to meet you
from what did it well I was just like
last night you know i was watching
agents of shield i'm like i never
thought there would be a time where i
would be watching a weekly comic book
television show and I've got agents of
shield arrow the flash izombie Gotham
who knows what's going to happen with
Constantine supergirls in pilot right
now have you unbelievable Oh John just
updated me via IM he will be there
straight at five-thirty pacific time and
coverage starting around six-thirty so
around six-thirty Pacific is when you'll
be able to tune into John's social media
and see what's going on but definitely
make sure you tune in and see all the
excitement there but yeah I mean we're
living in a magical time where you know
I can I i I'm actually overwhelmed with
how many comic book shows I have to
watch every well yeah I mean it's pretty
soon that's why we decided to have this
podcast topic just all the different
movies that are coming up I'm Brandon we
started a new column and runs on Fridays
sort of just covering you know all this
media news movie news that happens
during the week sometimes doesn't worry
you know necessarily its own post but
this were out of posts and last week we
had a we had a big one yes yeah no it's
amazing how many people are and there
there was definitely a title i I've
lived through the time where geek was a
dirty word nerd was a dirty word and
only comment you know comic book readers
were just people that lived in their
basements and all that you know and it
last year I got to go to San Diego
comic-con for the first time in 18 years
and the difference between the last time
I'd been there and this time was
astounding mmm I it was unbelievable how
the industry has changed and how geek
culture has become accepted now yeah
yeah it's become part of pop culture
that's great and I think we're now to
stage where it's never going to go
completely away i think the popularity
will wane but i don't think it will ever
go completely away we won't
back to well only you know guys who live
in their parents basement you know read
comic I yeah I think those days are gone
and I'm thankful for that but so we have
some questions coming in on these topics
from such an Mahal uh what are the top
movies you want to see from now until
the end of 2015 I have a bunch is there
anything that's really sticking out to
you to ask me I think Avengers is
probably the first one and you know the
one that I have my eyes on I'm not a big
like go to the movies guy I love
watching them at home and I watch
obviously all the ones that came out
earlier this year but they weren't
really the comic book movies so much
yeah I have like guardians of the
universe i love that movie yeah I uh I'm
not that big on going to the theaters
anymore and you know just because of the
crowd situation and also the expense but
uh of course avengers age of ultron i
can't wait to see ant-man which is the
second Marvel movie for this year star
wars the force awakens spectre the next
James Bond movie I still can't decide if
I'm actually excited about Mad Max fury
road or not because I know it's going to
be just essentially a 90-minute car
chase right I know it's already out but
I'll wait until it's out on home video I
do wasi furious I was gonna say that too
I was talking to brand about that
recently like I saw you know the first
one I saw Tokyo Drift I was like okay
here's our great he's like no these are
awesome movies like you have to see them
and I don't I just can't get really into
them maybe I well I caught the fifth one
by accident able one day and I was just
like oh you know what I'll finally watch
one of these I'd always avoided them I
was like I'll finally watch one by the
end of the movie I was like I actually
should this one what's going on here
versus mine now you see whether seven of
them yeah and I I've watched the first
six now and for anyone that's curious
5463 12 uh yes I actually like Tokyo
Drift you can all just
yo week alone ah but those weeks episode
shud just rates movie series I'm
surprised you can do that in your head
I'd have to like go through and look at
everyone I well I haven't I've never sat
down done the marble movies I should do
that sometime i can tell you though the
iron man two or incredible hulk ooh
either they fight for last place last
please yeah yeah the game song kind of
Hulk um original Iron Man gardea ends at
the galaxy r the Avengers would have to
fight it out first first place yeah I
think of those 3i love guardian see
galaxies guardians of the galaxy really
in the soundtrack I expected to like it
I didn't expect it to like it as much as
I did ooh and it came out digitally just
before I left last year for my vacation
in England I think I ended up watching
it on the flight going over in the
flight coming back after having already
watched it it's just it's a great movie
it sucks you in and the soundtrack is
awesome I have it on Spotify like great
classics on that yeah oh yeah no I was
an awesome soundtrack from brazen Franco
what are the chances that spider-man
will be part of the vengers this time
I'm well there's no chance he's going to
be part of age of Ultron unless it's the
tag in the end credits but we have heard
that he is going to show up in captain
america civil war which is the third
captain america movie which is just
about to go into production so
spider-man is coming but i would expect
him to show up in age of Ultron right um
and I saw that yesterday they're not
gonna they have a fun little teaser the
shwarma scene may begin of the first
Avengers and they're not going to do
that again but they might have like a
little clip I guess is what they're
saying well if you saw the first
Avengers movie do you remember about
halfway through the credit there was a
scene with the big purple guy yeah yeah
that's what their type they're going to
do something similar to that they call
that a tag
tag and then the post-credit scenes are
usually called skimmers so there's going
to be a tag but no stinger is what
they're saying inter Sam which is fine
with me because I hated sitting in the
theater waiting to them of the credits
yet stores yeah it's really it's
horrific it's your like and the thing
was I had seen the shawarma scene leaked
before I win saw the movie in the
theater and I still SAT there and I was
just like let this let these credits in
please oh good grief from brazen Franco
uh yeah this is one that will fire me up
why there still isn't a transformer
movie centered on Cybertron war for
those that don't know the history of the
Transformers before they came to earth I
I I know Todd I know I don't wait too
much of this stuff before the Autobots
fled to earth and the ark they there was
a giant war on cybertron and why I I can
see because that would almost be like a
cgi animated movie but why they still
have not made a Transformers movie that
actually focuses on the Transformers as
characters is beyond me the fact that
they keep throwing in these humans that
are useless and annoying is unbelievable
to me have you seen the fourth movie yes
okay so I watched it on a plane I think
I do you remember the did you remember
the conversation about Mark Wahlberg
gets all annoyed by his daughter dating
this guy he goes yeah it's illegal she's
17 yeah in a movie about giant robots we
had a discussion of statutory rape laws
in Texas I'm sitting on the plane I
started looking around like is anyone
else seeing this is really happening yes
this is really happening so
unfortunately you're white why
spend more time with Optimus Prime in
the Autobots when we can be educated on
the statutory rape laws of my state of
Texas that was amazing to me uh brysen
Franco are you saying that Ewoks is
worse than the old droids cartoon series
now okay that's mmm the droids and Ewoks
cartoons both were horrific Lee bad I
would still have to say I hate the Ewoks
more because especially if you've ever
seen the Ewoks TV movies would you even
know those existed time I know the joy
cartoon series the joys cooking they did
to live-action made for kids TV movies
of the Ewok adventures they did not
feature any of the regular characters
except for wicket the Ewok and they were
painful if you ever wanted to torture
information I have somebody make them
watch these I kids even enjoy them know
how they how they made two of them I
will never know they're almost as bad as
the star wars holiday special which is
have you ever seen that nope old movies
you can find it online it aired once on
television in 1977 it was the story of
Han trying to get Chewie back to his
home planet of cash to spend life day
with his family he and all the original
cast is in it as well as Earth Wind and
Fire okay uh Bea Arthur Art Carney uh
yeah it's there's a reason it only aired
once it is it a musical to then like
welcome there's music and dancing in it
as well Wow yeah yeah they Lucas locked
it in the vault I think most people
would prefer to he burned the negatives
uh
yeah it Wow yeah mm-hmm it was a quite
impressive anyway I going down through
the questions uh from David can-can I
hope daredevil is about marvel super
heroes right yes daredevil is a marvel
superhero for those that don't know
premieres on netflix on Friday April
10th it'll be 13 episodes it is part of
the Marvel Cinematic Universe so it does
follow the same continuity as all the
movies and agents of shield daredevil
for those aren't familiar with character
is about a blind lawyer named Matt
Murdock who was blinded when he was a
child by toxic chemicals and he received
enhanced other senses so he also has
like bat-radar her and he decides to
fight for the people of hell's kitchen
neighborhood in New York nice it's
awesome character he's a really great
character from the same gentleman is
laserdisc a CD kinda a large one the
hatred they were the same size as vital
albums and they were digital and they
were my favorite part was you always had
to flip them when you got halfway
through a movie unless you had one of
the fancy players I could play both
sides nice hey you you still I remember
I got the do you remember the movie The
Crow yeah okay I got the crow on
laserdisc and I had a steady stream of
people coming up to my house all week
can we watch The Crow because they all
wanted to see it at yo on big clear
picture yeah fine yeah I got to the
point where I'd start doing other things
around the house while they watched the
crow but we can launch was it that much
clearer than VHS and everything like it
was is notice Lee it was noticeably
clear it they also had a far better
sound reproduction yeah see I remember
we had a laserdisc player in school you
know and they would bring
the carts in with the TV on it and
that's how I saw these you're just but i
don't think i remember you know being
blown away by its quality think we were
watching like science programs on a you
know yeah yeah no it's oh yeah laser
discs and they were huge in japan for
whatever reason i mean the first time i
went to japan in two thousand there were
still laserdisc stores everywhere huh it
was crazy they how much more popular it
was over there that's like many disks
too right well yeah Oh many discs they I
think they just stopped making many
discs Wow in Japan yeah they were still
going why I have no idea uh in the realm
of our normal coverage from Benjamin
McDonald I got a moto 360 yesterday what
apps do you recommend you've used
android wear far more than I have yeah I
think we covered this a little bit last
week the big thing I use honestly is
just the google street art background i
really like the wallpapers um it's free
and it just changes through various
street art pictures all day long that's
like for me Android wear is just really
hands off and I like that about it i
really only go there to see
notifications and otherwise I just
appreciate that the changing wallpapers
are really cool designs that google has
there and again sort of last week to the
reason i don't really rely on so many
apps is because i found i was installing
some then my battery life would be
really bad so i really just keep it
pretty bare bones but that's just the
way i use I'm out of 360 there you go
bro i also i should say back to like I
tried the delta app for boarding passes
it didn't work like for whatever reason
my screen wouldn't scan when I want to
get on the plane and all that kind of
stuff to you so I just really haven't
bored I find that a lot with phones too
though I mean I whenever I'm boarding a
plane I am most I still just go ahead
and get a printed tix o'clock it's like
just a safe fall back you know yeah
exactly because what if something
happens and your battery runs down yeah
you know it so yeah I always still go to
the kiosk and check in and get a printed
ticket yeah uh from know gaming I just
ordered the nexus sick
should I get an Android wear device and
also with the six inch screen should i
sell my 2013 Nexus 7 hmm um yeah that
can all comes down to how you use your
devices yeah I found actually with the
six plus and I was using a nexus 6 for a
while to now i'm using the s6 edge but
when i have a bigger screen on i haven't
been using a tablet as much either so if
you if you find you in the same use case
and you know maybe you should sell the
nexus 7 but if you find that you know
you always use that nexus 7 for reading
books and you're not doing that on your
phone then keep it android wear yeah i
would probably wait and see how soon
motorola releases the new 360 it could
be as soon as you know this tune during
google i/o if they decide to you know
have a bunch of new products there
otherwise the original moto 360 still my
favorite especially for the wireless
chart train stuff like that really
convenient the orici welcome yeah or you
could go pebble we both pre-ordered the
pebble time we should start May and
we're excited to check that out I'm
super excited to check out the pebble
time yeah very excited color screen with
seven days of battery life sold yeah and
they have a huge developer base and
everything she knows there's already
tons of apps and they're already gonna
work with it so yeah yeah exactly also
from dole gaming and this one we'll just
watch Todd glazed over and on the topic
of back to the film's why has a hot rod
Rodimus appeared in the movies when
Galvatron has okay I Todd just yep right
over my go okay Galvatron but yeah um I
think Galvatron was kind of like a last
minute addition to the last film i think
it was just michael bay doesn't know
what the heck he's doing a essay it's I
mean the Dinobots were such a throwaway
they should have had far more screen
time than they did a better introduction
than they did so who knows if he'll ever
get to the whole hot rod Rodimus
storyline I hope he does actually I hope
somebody does not him Michael Bay just
needs to go away I got it on samsung
stage Oh
I still laugh about that that was the
most amazing thing ever for those that
don't know what we're talking about it
was CES 2014 14 years samsung had
brought Michael Bay and to talk about
their new televisions the teleprompter
goes dead during the presentation
instead of just winging it he just goes
uh bye turns around walks off staying I
can't do this yeah I can't do this it
just walks off stage and we're all
sitting in the press room none of us
were in the in the Samsung presentation
we're all to say the press room watching
the live feed were like that just
happened that just happened and John and
Ashley immediately ran over and did a
reenactment oh that that was one of the
most amazing things ever Oh Michael Bay
from Vivek Nick the Scarlet Witch and
Quicksilver know that their father is
magneto is there a chance of Wolverine
to come in future movies they cannot
mention Magneto and they cannot mention
will rain because currently all the
x-men films are tied up over at 20th
Century Fox so long as 20 Century Fox
continues to make x-men related films
the rights cannot revert back to marvel
they also are not allowed to use the
word mutant so they are referring to
Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver as gifted
and so if they'll I don't know how they
are definitely still brother and sister
or they're still twins and avengers age
of ultron but i don't know what they're
gonna say about their father because
they cannot say the name magneto hmm you
could be a profit-sharing right Hey well
I mean marble just worked out a deal
with Sony for spider-man they're sharing
spider-man now at this point I think Fox
just they're doing so well without
marvel that they're just like why bother
sharing any of the by
right yeah also I don't know oh great
question from Britain Franco is that a
must quote unquote to who watched the
Marvel TV series i'm so over one by the
spring anime season i don't know if i
should make some space for them dare
double i would say yes because it's
completely new character I look at
agents of shield while I enjoy it it's
more like a if the camera in a Marvel
movie pan 45 degrees to the left you
would see what's going on on agents of
shield so it's not essential but
daredevil since it's it's own original
character in its own storyline I would
say make time for daredevil but you
don't necessarily have to for agents of
shield have you ever seen the the
musical Wicked Todd and that's the
that's the way I always described it to
people it wicked is like if the wizard
of oz camera had just been turned
slightly to the left you would have seen
the than what was happening and wicked
yeah yeah yeah I love Wiccan I've seen
her twice you know I actually I saw it
the same time I saw it was in London so
hearing them doing the talking portions
with British accents was just making my
mind melt was like okay I don't get it
another question from bruising Franco uh
why did Disney stop doing animated
movies i miss my youth they still do it
made movies a frozen big hero 6 I think
a lot of people get confused not all
animated movies with the Disney name on
them or pics are there are actually
there's pics are and there's disney
animated right so like wreck-it Ralph
tangled princess and frog frozen big
hero 6 all those are actually disney
animated movies and they gotten really
good the past couple years have you seen
big hero 6 yeah I Jenna I watched it
early right when I came out of
I guess nevermind still been in theaters
like you know how the early rentals come
through yeah yeah I love those until I
look frozen yeah yeah uh let's see here
ooh from such and B hall who's your
favorite Star Wars character and why on
I really do that little thing i feel
like for me it's like darth vader like I
don't know well Preisler cool okay so
once he has the armor on yeah yeah once
okay sorry um I would say hon and then I
despite as bad as the prequels were I
thought he wouldn't McGregor did a great
job as obi-wan hmm I really really liked
his take on obi-wan yeah and this is for
anyone else out there if you've never
watched the star wars clone wars cartoon
which is actually now cannon it's
awesome you really really should watch
at it it really expands on the obi-wan
character a lot oh let's see what else
have we we've got a lot of questions i'm
just looking through here I hate it
would this is the one thing i hate about
Google Hangouts I was just about to
click on a question and it moved on me I
wish they wouldn't move around uh from
Michael the sale hey guys I'm shopping
for a new laptop for work at school have
any recommendations hmm 20 depends on
your budget I'm still on a 2012 macbook
air that has lasted me for three years
it's it's it's pretty much dead now the
battery's dead the screen flickers and
all my stuff and it's very me oh but you
know there aren't many laptops out there
that last that long these days I find
I've tried some the yoga 3 pro not crazy
about it it runs on the core em chip
that Apple just put the new macbook and
I found that it the battery life on the
yoga 3 pro wasn't great and the chip
found a little bit underpowered we'll
see how it performs on the macbook which
I'm really interested in other I look at
you know a macbook air and in some of
the new windows
it really depends on your budget but
like I have my my other main work
computers on Windows 8.1 machine and I
have that one hundred and forty dollar
net book that I've talked about on
preview shows so it really depends on
your budget if you have the money you
know I really like macbooks it's really
up to you and if you have the money and
don't want a macbook you want windows
John has a surface pro 3 and he really
loves that and and now thats the surface
3 is out it's a little a little
underpowered i'd say to you it's an atom
chip which is similar to what's in my
netbook but yeah ends on your budget
okay brazen franco cleared up he meant
cartoon anime and not see GMA if you're
talking cel animation it's gone on it's
a sad sad stat I love animation cells i
have several from various WB shows i
even have a couple from who framed roger
rabbit I have a lot from animes i love
cells but unfortunately i think that's
just not it's so much cheaper and
quicker to do a computer now that i just
don't think souls are ever going to come
back from the averaged and completely
off topic but i'm curious does google
plus handle the transitions between the
two of you and integrate with youtube or
do you have a third-party software
playing a part curious about while
building my channel this is one hundred
percent Google+ Google Hangouts we just
record the audio using software called
audacity and then Sean puts them
together and creates the audio podcast
right so that when we release the audio
podcast that that is done with
third-party software called a city like
Todd just said but the the transitions
the camera switches between time I
that's completely handled by Google
Hangouts and when we announce you know
when we publish that we're going to be
doing the show that immediately goes to
our YouTube channel and that's all we
have to do is super super easy you all
you have to do is connect your google+
account to your youtube account which
takes like 30 seconds but no this is
great great software super easy to use
and it if you do want to record audio
again it's called audacity which is
spelled aud a CIT why I just look doing
around with the mp3 plug in she's easy
yes don't don't forget thing I don't
know why that's not included used to be
part of the package it really should be
it's so silly oh oh come on Franco I
know I don't remember the names of the
four clothes that make up Delta Squad I
don't it five that's the only one i
remember is fives i I may be a geek but
I may have a silly amount of knowledge
in my head but even I have my limits
tryna trying to screw with me from such
a knowledge from along the same lines of
the Star Wars question who's your
favorite Avenger and why and it doesn't
have to be one of those currently in the
Avengers movies or marvel cinematic
universe well Todd you would only know
the movie ones yeah I was gonna say um
if you include the comics the problem is
everybody in the Marvel Universe at one
point or another I would say though just
sticking with the Marvel Cinematic
Universe a Robert Downey jr. has brought
such an amazing presence to the role of
Tony Stark it's just hands-down Tony
Stark for me yeah I think I like 20
starts the best team yeah it's 90 night
stark in the comics is he can be a not a
nice guy especially if you go back to
there was a story line called demon on
the bottle where Tony actually became an
alcoholic and he can be a he's a
womanizer he's all that stuff but Downey
has as far as I'm concerned just defined
iron man at this point as I do people
frequently ever compare yah on mosque to
Tony Stark oh yeah if you did I thought
so I just want to make sure the third
Twitter feeds dedicated do it
really yes have you never seen the
twitter feed board Elon Musk nah oh you
have to subscribe to it I'm gonna find
this it's just completely random
inventions that supposedly yaaaaah musk
is coming up with what he's bored but no
oh yeah Brandon and I even make the joke
all the time when's he just going to
give up the ghost and build an Iron Man
sack yeah exactly I'm I i Wasi Elon Musk
flying over the United States and a suit
of armor yeah here's one alarm clock
that releases spiders now you're up
trick what you want to follow you know
oh no it's awesome uh from never ends
this guy asked me characters now hey
Sean who's your favorite transformers
character old show and movie sideswipe
red Lamborghini from generation one um
but Cory Optimus Prime has a huge soft
spire my heart but if you're going to go
back to old school transformers
sideswipe um did you also always liked
hound a lot right now I can just hear
Todd going what the hell no those are
words well weird spends all that time
playing altum online yeah we're just
about done for today but let's go out on
a totally off the wall question from
David can carry it if you could be a
chicken or a monkey which would you be a
monkey monkey hands families I won't be
able to fling my feces of people yeah

McDonald's menu you know I'd be in a
bucket yeah well folks thank you very
