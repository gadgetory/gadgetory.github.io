World Congress in Barcelona as you see
planet cool this year they waited till
Tuesday to get the stage of themselves
to have their press conference where
they announced a bevy of new devices and
i'm here at the stand where some
efficiency is going to take us through
one of them SI got the HTC incredible s
the idea of this price and I guess you
guys might assume this from America so
you in America they had the incredible
new york we didn't so this is the next
version and we are committed in europe
as well the idea is that we've gone with
them to our design so for getting the
serial number that won't be on the
output devices and everything including
everything down there HTC symbol at the
back everything is blacked out much as
it can be it's very much into our design
incredible it's a 4-inch touchscreen
that's really between the for us the
desire and desire HD so slightly smaller
than that evo or already those who you
guys and we've got me this innovative
new soft touch design the whole idea is
that in your hand it feels much smaller
it's all about that designer feel so
obviously our gingerbread running on
there and we have the new since you I so
it's just a few extra noise or creatures
you extra nice little little bits and
bobs on there but mostly it's about the
look and feel the folks watching in the
US have seen the new sense UI on the
inspire they joined the US version in
DRL today so and the camera on the back
door with respect to Emma said eight
megapixel camera dual LED flash you have
a front facing camera as well okay video
captured absolutely we have at the new
one gig processor from Boca and if you
go up in our internal memory directors
for holding apps and then all your Roman
lands and any information on
availability what over sugar I don't
know anything about you to the American
market I just know about the UK and what
they're saying around Europe is
beginning to q2 q2 and Europe show
roofing all right it's the incredible s
our friends with my friends on this side
of the pond because I'm on the other
side of the pond from where I am getting
a little bit of incredible we're all
going to get it and it's blacked out
very cool at the HTC stand up nor from
