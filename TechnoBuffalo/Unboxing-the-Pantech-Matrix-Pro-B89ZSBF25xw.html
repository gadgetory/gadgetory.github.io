unboxing for you of the pantech matrix
pro for AT&amp;amp;T it is a dual sliding
windows mobile 6.1 standard phone it'll
be available in stores next Tuesday
which is februari 24 for 180 bucks after
manufacturer rebate and the required
two-year contract let's go ahead and dig
in the scissors off here the PR material
here is the box for the pantech matrix
pro if this film looks familiar to you
it looks very similar to the ocean to
which is out for virgin mobile's Helio
service that's because the same maker
pantech also makes the ocean keep that
office will sign go ahead and open it up
and see what's included in the box so
first score some specs on the vice dual
slider like i mentioned windows 6.1
standard it's a tribe and 3g phone with
850 900 and 2100 it's got assisted gps
2.4 inch display it's got a 2 megapixel
integrated camera it can play video
audio voice command and all the rest of
that fun stuff that Windows Mobile can
do i'll actually never used a windows
6.1 device looking forward to using it
and seeing how it fares to something
other phones i've tested just some paper
on top here's some booklets getting
started probably never really look at
that but it's nice to include it in case
you're interested some more tissue paper
like stuff and since this device is not
yet released I'm the first one to
actually reviewed this one so it's still
sealed in the plastic go ahead and push
that off to the side
let's see what else comes in the box
first we have a wall charger with a
proprietary ports that's socks I hate
when they include project reports but it
is what it is I think we have a 3.5
millimeter headset jack adapter to that
fly in port on the end it's like they
also included some sort of case open it
up and see what it looks like and what
it's made up a fake suede material in
it's just a bag I don't know who really
use a bag for a case but if it's your
thing it's included in the box here is
the battery I believe it's a 13 20
milliamp hour battery which should be
more than enough to power this but let's
take a look to be sure pantech yep 13 20
milliamp hour batteries or three point
seven volts so there's a decent size
battery and push that off to the side
what else comes in the box USB cord for
syncing and probably charging the back
of the phone the requisite windows
mobile CDs probably activesync and some
other software on there but all that is
periphery let's take a look at the phone
itself take out of the bag it's got a
decent amount of weight to it actually
let's put the battery in and see what it
feels like i will put the back of the
phone on
you know it's got a really decent mount
of weight to it it slides put it down to
show you it slides out revealing just a
typical number pad you can close it up
and you can slide it the other way
revealing a full three row qwerty
keyboard which is actually very nice the
keys have a decent i depress to them
they are a little close together and
they're flush with the device to be able
to slide in there so there isn't much of
a raised Ridge to feel them but it does
look to be a very type of book keyboard
dressing slide both ways so I'm going to
pop a sim card in here and i'll do a
first boot up for you guys alright so
the sim card is in let's go ahead and
peel off the plastic on the front and
power this on
there's a separate power button
there it goes boot enough you got a sort
of vista looking windows logo do the
windows mobile splash screen
looks like from a cold boot up it's got
a little bit of time and the colors down
here the sending end buttons are glowing
and I'll walk you guys through the
hardware in just a minute if we do a
first boot up you get that unnecessarily
loud AT&amp;amp;T 3g logo and that's it we are
in click Next to set up your windows
mobile base device go ahead and do that
little bit later let me walk you guys
through the hardware so there's the
front of the device you've got a send
key and an end key down at the bottom
you've got two hot keys here one for
whatever shows up down the bottom left
whenever shows up in the bottom right
you also have a home key and a back
button on the left side of the device
you've got a record button and a volume
up and down rocker on the bottom you've
got a expandable microSD card slot I
believe this will read up to a 32
gigabyte card on the right side of
device you've got a dedicated camera
button right there and that must be
where the charger goes underneath that
little door slide off the door plug it
in and you are good to go so guys have
just been a real quick unboxing of the
new pantech matrix pro again this will
be released februari 24th four hundred
eighty dollars on ET and T's network
I'll use it for a little while and give
you guys my opinions hope you enjoyed
