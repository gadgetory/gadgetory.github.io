10 from technobuffalo I'm here checking
out the brand new experience e3 from
Sony that was announced at Ethan Berlin
it's a smaller device 4.5 inch display
and it looks like it's the more
affordable of the new experience that
were announced today including the c 3
and c 3 compact but it's got some pretty
decent features we're talking about so
you're looking at the 4.5 inch display
with an 854 x 480 pixel resolution it's
got a 5 megapixel camera on the back up
front you've got a VGA front-facing
camera you're also seeing this version
in white but it's also going to launch
on black lime and copper under the hood
you've got snapdragon processor clocked
at 1.2 here it's that's a quad-core it's
got the Adreno 305 GPU one gigs of rent
one gigabyte of RAM rather up to 4 gigs
of storage and then you can add more
with a 32 gigabyte microSD card so when
it says up to 4 gigs it sounds like
that's kind of the minimum but you also
have to take into consideration the
available storage with Android
pre-loaded on here too another was a
2330 milliamp hour battery so moving
around the phone you've got the 3.5
millimeter headphone jack up top nothing
on the left but that metallic looking
plastic along the sides power button on
the right next to the volume controls
there which are kind of hardly placed
easier if they were up top here any case
that's a quick look at the Xperia e3
