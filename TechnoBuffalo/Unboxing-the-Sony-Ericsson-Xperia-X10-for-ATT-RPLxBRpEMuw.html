TechnoBuffalo here with an unboxing for
you of the Sony Ericsson Xperia x10 for
AT&amp;amp;T this is as bonus been kicking
around since late last year and unlocked
for my even took a look at it a few
months back but now we've got it in its
18 t clothing let's go ahead and take a
look so this is set by the folks at each
India we're going of course use the
obligatory box to dig in and hopefully
not slice off fingers and I'd say that
every time but every time I do this I'm
still a little bit nervous let's go
ahead and that hack through the
packaging I'll go through the specs as
well this is going to set you back about
a hundred and fifty dollars of course on
to your contract with AT&amp;amp;T looks like
you're a traditional 18 t packaging this
was just released so here we've got a
Sony Ericsson Xperia x10 I picture the
device on the front and a you know is
running Android is connected it does
have a pretty whopping eight megapixel
sensor so what's in the box package
contents no need to redo that so we're
going to take a look at it let's look at
some of the specs on the back so it is
running Android OS I believe it is
running Android 1.6 although sony has
said they will update it although it's a
very very very heavily skinned Android
1.6 the Sony Ericsson's a time to even
Mediascape puts all of your media and
such and sort of almost a deck of cards
like feature not a deck of cards like
the Palm Pre or the pixie on webOS that
sort of stack on top of each other
three-dimensional format I'll show you
guys what that looks like
in a later video it is very nice and
very quick packin me a 1 gigahertz
Snapdragon processor however because
this is running Android 1.6 I don't
believe word when you get any
multi-touch here although you can't
download third-party browsers that will
give you certain multi-touch in the
browsing capabilities like the Dolphin
Browser
so of course it's quad man it's got
Wi-Fi 802 and G and used for 18 T Wi-Fi
hotspots I believe it's about a fifteen
hundred millionth hour battery which
we'll check in the box give me give you
two hundred ninety eight minutes
talktime up to 256 hours of standby time
up to 16 gigabyte expandable memory of
course it's microSD the one gigahertz
processor we mentioned 3.5 millimeter
headset jack 8.1 megabits of camera with
face detection and recognition which is
kind of cool it also has smile detection
so when you smile a lot of active snap
the picture something is really known
for that 8 2 D P I'll course all the
rest of the stuff that expect from a
full-featured Android phone enough of me
yappin about let's go ahead and take a
look and see if the 18 T version looks
any different than the unlocked we've
seen they'll go ahead and open this up
it's sort of a new 18th T type box that
doesn't just slide open anymore and of
course there's a bit of tape right there
there's a little bits of information now
in the lid or used to just be a tray
with the phone there we go it should
make opening it up a bit easier so you
got decent amount of system
documentation sitting there in the lid
there's a lot of stuff let's see what we
get so we actually there are your sony
ericsson 3.5 millimeter headphone jack
stereo headphones with microphone looks
like there's probably some getting
started guide information in there as
well of course got assisted GPS for AT&amp;amp;T
Navigator or of course Google Maps
Navigation port information and the rest
of that interesting that they put the
headset in the front of that maybe there
wasn't room in the box but let's go
ahead and see here you got your Quick
Start Guide and here's the phone itself
it is a four inch capacitive touch mean
we'll talk about the specs in just a
minute see what else we're gonna get in
the box wall charger USB there's your
micro USB cord and the battery and see
if we're right with the size here it is
made in China and is of size 1500
milliamp hour battery power so a pretty
nice sized battery for a 4-inch phone so
talking about specs and speaking of
screen it's got a resolution of 480 by
854 so relatively a high resolution
screen here on there it's the stuff
you'd expect from a really a high-end
phone weighs about four point seven six
ounces side wide it's four point six
eight by two point four eight five point
five one and that is really
these are the most important features of
it on-screen QWERTY keyboard no slide
out here let's go ahead and take the
phone out and do a real quick
walkthrough on it so you've got a sort
of a unique array of Android buttons and
this is very specific to certain
Ericsson Timescape and Mediascape we've
got a menu button pulls up different sub
menus and application launcher and a
back button on the front you've got a
proximity sensor there is the mate
megapixel sensor with LED flash
it looks like AT&amp;amp;T left this phone
relatively attacked from the way Sony
Ericsson
first made it the only way you can
really tell the difference we unlocked
version is a little 18 T logo right
there and there is your megapixel sensor
volume rocker on the right hand side a
hard button to launch the camera and
nothing on the left top you've got the
micro USB port 3.5 millimeter headset
jack lock and power button on the bottom
you've got a little lane here slot let's
go ahead and pull this out and see
that's where the micro SD card lives I
would assume that's where it's going to
be pull off the back you've got a SIM
card and then the micro SD card slot is
right there go ahead and put this back
on and let's do a a real quick size
comparison with some of the competitors
or like stablemates so here we have the
iPhone 4 see a little bit difference in
the screen size I can bring in a little
bit larger the Evo 4G is through the 4.3
inch screen there versus the forint get
those all in frame for you they can do a
quick thickness test about these all as
well see the size difference we can also
bring in yes and some captivate also for
AT&amp;amp;T a very similar in size both running
Android AT&amp;amp;T is really rounding out
their Android catalog they've got quite
a few now and finally let's bring in the
sliding blackberry torch you can see the
difference here
size-wise and thickness wise so we'll do
a full review of this I'll show you the
operating system and show you what it
looks like and see whether or not this
worthwhile Android phone on AT&amp;amp;T hey
guys I'm John retinue from TechnoBuffalo
and I'll see you the next video
buh-bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
