to you by domain.com what's up everyone
jon rettinger from technobuffalo here
some of my favorite phones get really
simulate annually are the Nexus devices
I love pure unadulterated unmolested
Android good and make the jokes but you
know it would be better than one nexus
this many Nexus is as my son would say
rumor has it google released not one but
two new Nexus phones later this year
unveiling an LG made smartphone and a
phablet from hallway which is the first
time that the Chinese manufacturers ever
made a Nexus device so according to a
new report from a friends at Android
Police they're claiming to reveal the
details and specs of both hopefully sexy
devices first up let's talk about that
LG device code name angler follow up on
Google's aquatic animal names usually
what they pick for their coatings Nexus
devices smartphones reportedly couldn't
be a 5.2 inch screen twenty-seven
hundred million power battery and a
Snapdragon 808 chip before you start
yelling about not having a 10-8 away
it's pretty good no overheating issues i
know the e10 isn't officially have an
overheating issues but if i had a pic 1
i'd probably go 808 so kate bear that in
mind so some of the other specs are
still apparently still being decided is
it's still early development cycle but
overall it sounds like a pretty nice
upgrade for the two year old Nexus 5 so
look at this as an upgrade for that
device that was also lg-made meanwhile
hallways bullhead is expected to be a
much larger device the 5.7 shiz boy also
reportedly offer that snapdragon 810 and
a 35 hundred million power battery it
sounds like the follow-up to the Nexus 6
of a slightly smaller footprint entering
police would want to say that both Nexus
devices should launch around the same
time this fall looking at probably an
October timeframe as for Google's tablet
lineup hope you like the Nexus 9 I know
I do because the pony be stuck with it
for at least another year before another
tablet comes if it ever does isn't the
first time we've heard a Google might
launch to Nexus phone 2015 but now still
we're starting to kind of all come
together and drink police seems to be
pretty calm this is going to happen so
look for it sometime soon Google i/o is
by time you watch this video either
tomorrow or already happens maybe we'll
see some sort of tidbits about this come
out at their keynote more likely though
probably not but we will see at Google
i/o is Android M so expect these to be
the first phones to come out
that launched with Android latest
Android M marshmallow malamar Mars bars
marmalade Milky Way ma mama manual merp
mixtape my legs are hairy that's
probably probably what it's going to be

higher end sort of served tutor friends
folks but also two different price
points to make the Nexus line up a bit
more accessible to focus pecially in
emerging markets or also folks that
don't want to spend a huge amount of
money for a flagship phone I'm excited a
