show you one of the cool new features we
just added to technobuffalo it's our
smartphone buyers guide with the
holidays in full swing imagine a lot of
you are looking to pick up a new phone
or give one as a gift I think this
buyer's guide is really going to help
you decide what you want so when you go
to the main technobuffalo home page
there's a new button right here
smartphone buyers guide go ahead and
give that a click and everything is
going to be broken up by carrier so
you've got this is all just for the US
AT&amp;amp;T sprint verizon and t-mobile let's
go ahead and click on one of the ATT
images it's going to bring up a much
larger image and here we've got all the
blackberries broken down by price
operating system connections storage
screen and navigation keyboard camera
and app store the pricing is probably
going to change a little bit we're going
to keep it updated on a weekly basis but
definitely for the most up-to-date
pricing I check out the carrier's
website but this is always going to be
most up-to-date with all the new devices
so you can compare them and see what you
want like in this case you want to get a
blackberry and Wi-Fi is important to you
we don't necessarily need to have 3g or
you can go ahead and look and say okay
here's just edge and Wi-Fi the
blackberry curve 8900 is probably
perfect for me if you're on another
carrier you want to look at different
phones go and scroll down and find
anything that works for you so here's
one for save verizon looks like this one
focuses on Android and Windows Mobile so
you can go ahead and take a look at
everything here and find a phone that
really suits your individual needs this
is a really handy to what I've actually
used it when I make my reviews to help
see the specs on different devices I
hope you guys find it useful I certainly
do especially thank you too to Chris
Ward and TechnoBuffalo staff for putting
this together and I hope you guys
enjoyed and I will see you in the next
video bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
