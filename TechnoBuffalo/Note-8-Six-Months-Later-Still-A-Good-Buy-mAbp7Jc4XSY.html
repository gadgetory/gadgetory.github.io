old the Galaxy Note 8 came out and
August 23rd which makes it almost
halfway through its lifespan trying to
believe my favorite phone of the year za
was gonna be replaced and I want to
revisit the Galaxy Note I've been using
it quite a bit I always come back to it
but Before we jump into it I want to
thank the folks at bud bow for
sponsoring this video
what makes bud bow unique is that the
art an existing company they're not
trying to raise money and so they could
form their already existing the arty of
a product and a product that works
essentially they're trying to bring a
really hyper fraction industry together
and I give them a ton of credit for that
and they're using blockchain to do it
which is incredibly impressive so a few
things let me get this out of the way
there has not been any slowdown there's
not been any sort of Samsung lag at
favorite associated other devices that
were before the galaxy s5 it's been
incredibly fast maybe it's a processor
maybe it's a six piece of ram I've had
no silicon issues the OS is faster than
when it first came out a couple other
things have changed I've noticed a
little bit of warmth phone gets a little
warmer when I use it pretty heavily
which is a little off-putting for for a
note device don't think that's gonna
like fry off my pocket or my my man bits
when it's in there but it is getting
warmer than it was initially it has an
impacted performance or battery life
which is still been stellar and as good
since the first day that I got the phone
one thing that I really love about the
no date is is the ip68 actually about
three days ago I was given my kids bath
and I know I did I usually don't but I
answer the phone and I had sort of up to
my ear and I was leaning over and
bathing them and you could you could see
where that went the phone fell directly
into the tub I was able to pick it up
dry it off and obviously no issues so I
was thankful for the ip68 it's something
that I guess I don't think about that
much anymore but if it was a lot of
other phones perhaps it would have been
ruined
maybe I / 67 would have been enough but
it just nice to know everything was was
okay when it comes to the s-pen a lot of
the reasons people get the note
I really haven't used it I use it a lot
when I first got the phone I used the
simple notes and then I just kind of
forgot that it was there another thing
I'm not using as much as I thought it's
kind of the edge panel is I'm also not
using multitasking his website thought I
was going to release multitasking with
the app on top and bottom split screen
apps I just I think I just forget that a
lot of that stuff is there
what I do use a phone for and what I
love is a camera the cameras are
absolute incredible I love the way
pictures look they're vibrant and you
had pictures print it out and give them
to my parents give them to other people
this takes incredible photos it's still
really quick
the iris panning is great the
fingerprint sensor is still in a
horrible location you can get on the L
you want that it's just me and if I put
a cape on it's not gonna matter but it's
bad for me it is a bad looking just a
finger breaker I've talked about that
kind of ad nauseam so I'm not gonna beat
around the bush anymore I still like
having a headphone jack I put in some
headphones there's an audio book that
has been really nice to have I don't the
word that I was carrying Wireless or
Bluetooth headphones but commend Samsung
for sticking with that the quick charge
stuff we've been really nice as well
when the phone dies I can plug it in for
like 10 minutes and it boosts itself
back up and just the screen the six
point three inch screen that Samsung's
got on this phone is incredible their
screens are gorgeous they're beautiful
they're vibrant but this is the best of
the best this is still six months later
the best screen on a smart phone I will
stand five at and does everything just
better than well it's not bad at
anything which is awesome to say for for
a modern phone so I still love the no
date in fact I would still recommend
buying the no date now halfway through
its lifecycle you can get some credible
deals on it I still think you're getting
the best phone on the market so I mixed
at the beginning of the video I wanted
to thank the folks at bud bow we've been
talking a lot about crypto and
blockchain here on the channel Fred I
think a really good reason it is
changing the way the world is working
now and going to change the way the
world is going to be working in the
future blockchain is incredibly powerful
you probably heard a lot about tokens
and I SEOs if you're gonna remotely
plugged into the crypto industry but
what makes but boo unique is that the
already an existing company they're not
trying to raise money and so they can
form their already existing they already
have a product and a product that works
so the focus this token sale
just to rebuild bud bow with blockchain
adding in way more layers of security
and transparency and also complying to
the government essentially been trying
to bring a really a hyper fraction
industry together and I give them a ton
of credit for that and they're using
blockchain do it which is incredibly
impressive with a community of over
100,000 mobile users and the support of
over 2000 dispensaries but BOE has
launched the sale of tokens for its
platform which the company is building
on blockchain technology it's actually
based on the etherium blockchain but
bosz vision is to mobilize and disrupt
the growing cannabis industry providing
users dispensaries growers and others
with the necessary technology to record
information in an immutable ledger but
BOE has operated as a mobile platform
since 2016 providing users with the
ability to match a cannabis user with
their preferred stranor product with
brought chain technology bud bo will
ensure the industry is safe for all
interested parties from supply chain
management to regulation that means the
safe transfer of goods verified stream
potency and more the presale tier 1 and
tier 2 for the tokens sold-out sway in
advance and bud bow is currently in
Phase three of their token sale which I
believe ends on March 3rd if you want to
