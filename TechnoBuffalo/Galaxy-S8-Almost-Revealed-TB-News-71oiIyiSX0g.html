CES 2017 you wouldn't think something's
not even here would be dominating but it
is as new leaks of what a phone that
actually appears to be the real deal
galaxy s eight made the rounds on the
Weibo forums recover the galaxy s a
quite a bit but now we get chance to
actually see what it looks like and it
matches the earlier renders that we've
seen so a few things are giant ly
different about it let's start with the
kind of minute the logos move from the
top to the bottom and also those bezels
are almost non-existent you can't see
bezels on the left or right it's got a
wraparound screen so gone will be the
edge of Aryan every version of the s8
will have the edge so while this does
tell us a lot of stuff there are few
things we don't know first is it going
to have a home button and where is it
going to be it certainly not on the
bottom where it's been on previous
Samsung devices has some rumors floating
around it maybe the screen itself will
be used for a home button or Samsung
could sort of follow the trend and move
it to the back of the device we also
don't yet know screen size I've heard
rumors anywhere from five to six inches
and maybe different variants in between
we don't know what the screen is going
to be for the rumors from 2k to all the
way up to 4k like you think they're
holding 4k for the new Galaxy Note 8
coming later on in the year and also
some sort of pressure sensitivity akin
to 3d touch or force touch what Apple
and others have done with their phones
here's what we know the galaxy SI it
looks a hot we don't know is a lot we
know a little bit about the processor we
know it's probably gonna put the six
gigs of RAM it's going to be beast
intellectually will also work with the
s-pen ova won't have a slot for the S
Pamela be sure of an external accessory
can carry with you looks to be pretty
nice but the big news that might be true
is that Samsung set to reveal this on
Tuesday April 18 which is a very like
exact exact day which is not that far
away usually we see the samsung
announced a new phone and mobile world
congress to push back a little bit april
eighteenth coming soon what do you think
about the galaxy s eight it was to cool
the phone and took of a picture not
share with you guys so long to do a real
quick TV news from the show floor so you
guys think got the galaxy s akin video a
thumbs up to let us know and hit the
bell make sure notifications are turned
on you know when you taking a bus full
of videos are coming see you guys next
