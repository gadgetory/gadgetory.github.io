to you by domain.com inside of this box
we have a gigantic ipad also known as
the iPad pro box feels a little inflated
I don't know why because the iPad pro is
got inflated ego what it can do its
clammy can replace a laptop we'll see
though I've got the GREs excuse me
pardon me silver virgin here available
in the usual tree of apple colors - the
rose gold the maybe you're hoping for
maybe not so space grey silver and gold
are available the box looks like de
MacBook box because the screen is the
size of a lot of the Mac books and the
MacBook Airs and even your friends
the MacBook Pros so standard Apple box
says I've had Pro we got some business
written on here it is the 128 gigabyte
version it's also available in your
ridiculous 32 you should not do that if
you're looking for an iPad pro all for
the reasonable starting price of $7.99
reasonable let's go ahead and cut the
plastic and I shall use this because I
don't know why not so we'll go ahead and
slice the plastic I was at the event had
a chance to take a look at this guy and
it was nice but it's a wondering what
this is like oh should I try it you have
an iPad air at home or an iPad Mini
just imagine a giant and that's that's
pretty much what you're getting I'll be
some of the differences here you got
more RAM a faster processor four
speakers and it's mostly pretty good
battery life but mostly it's a gigantic
iPad with a high res screen someone
actually shrink your hands as well or it
might I mean looking at this box it
looks like this is what mighty roll
looks like when he's holding like a
regular iPad and I got I got big mitts
so just it's a gigantic gigantic iPad
I'll go ahead and slide the top off my
favorite things to do push all this off
to the side for a quick second and here
in the box
we got the iPad pro it's a twelve point
nine inch screen
super-high resolution at 2732 by 2048
I shall commence tab pulling look at
this it looks
like a gigantic iPad and for saying that
looks awesome I can't wait to use 3d
touch on it
you should reference my previous rant
video because no 3d touch on this guy
pushed off the side or real fast also
inside of said box you've got your usual
Apple things that you get including a
lightning cable and power brick and a
booklet because you know you'd like to
read maybe something maybe you're on
bossiness on toilet you're like oh I pad
pro with some bits on the iPad Pro and
stickers there two of them they are
white and you could decorate things you
can choose two they're also available in
here as well and then just your really
long lightning cable and power brick but
that's not exciting so I'll take this
box I'll just go do it on the floor
floor meat box all right I got the
tablet I just please
so iPad pro first time this is ever
gonna not have fingerprints on it the
back looks familiar iPad it is pretty
thin though and it's pretty light to it
one point five seven pounds and mostly
this is battery an apple claims to get
10 hours of battery life but will will
test that let's go ahead and pull off
the plastic here I will get Apple credit
that was probably among the most
satisfying of wushi noises that we have
ever had
thank you like Star Wars noise like lord
Vader yeah rise there it is the iPad pro
gigantic iPad and all of its gigantic
iPad glory other stuff you'd expect
though with an iPad are here including
touch ID so that's awesome I guess iOS 9
of course and this should be really
great for multitasking now the hope here
from Apple is that what is running
mobile OS can also replace for a lot of
people what you do on traditional laptop
so even you were processing your
mailing and that kind of thing on this
gigantic screen and certainly having a
screen you know this size twelve point
nine inches versus the little bit under
ten inches that you get with like
something like the iPad air 2 you can do
a little bit more than what be casting
and certainly it looks like like a
before and after for my go weight-loss
show when you put these two things to
each other big difference this now looks
ridiculously tiny so we've got the iPad
all set up and there's a lot of space
between those icons but it looks like
iOS fee differences you might notice
though on the tablet a speaker grilles
now in every corner of the device so
speakers supposedly should be awesome of
course we will test that in the full
review I promise the middle accessory
action because make accessory in its own
video it's you guys we're a one-stop
shop so we don't want to double-dip
let's take a look at the Smart Cover
zoomable II like the iPad is gigantic
Smart Cover we will pull this tab open
the sucker up and see what looks like
you can protect your probably $1000 plus
investment I should also mention that
cellular models are available in either
32 or 128 gigs so okay covered smart
silicon case cone Silla silicon aloo
aluminium that's not how it's pronounced
Jonathan um I don't know obviously
things every different way and people
can pronounce it this is I'm you like
it's got like it's not like floppy it's
uh it's hot point like a tiger it is
like a tiger designed by Apple in
California assembled in America China s
feels feels heavy
this feels heavier than the advertised
one point five seven pounds when it's
fully sheet it's not gonna get any
diseases from other people
it's a sheathed cheap she's shy shy shy
it's a shiz neck for macbook iPad pro
there's what the back looks like I'll
use it we'll test it we got some
I didn't do for the review which you
guys hopefully will see a relatively
soon but anything you guys want to see
in particular test guide pad pro let me
know of course we're gonna check
multitasking we'll check the sound we'll
check battery life how videos look on
the screen and we'll check the
accessories too as income in the pencil
and smart keyboard but you guys know
whether it's worth buying or not I think
this is a big question mark a lot of
people and hopefully we can help answer
questions anyway thank you guys for
watching I am John render from
TechnoBuffalo and I will talk to you all
of these cameras they're looking at me
in the next video bye guys
this thing is Shane uni this is gonna be
like the iPhone my Kate and it's like
hold on I can't hear you yeah I think so
I think we're gonna have to go through
your pockets I'm gonna need like much
bigger pants dot ninja in order to take
this thing around
I wonder if you're going to feel like
silly like walk around with the tablet
this big like what if you're at an event
you want take pictures like use this as
your Ruby finder I think you'd do that
right and and you could make a website

the shower dot NYC you could do that be
easy right domain.com use promo code
