from TechnoBuffalo and today it was a
big day for lay echo in San Francisco
they announced two new phones a lake pro
three and delay s3 both sort of budget
Android phones that come in at very very
affordable prices
packing insane specs so let's go ahead
and go over a quick overview of what
these phones bring to the table the lay
pro 3 is the higher end of the 2 it has
a 5.5 inch full HD display dual stereo
speakers Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 1
processor 4 gigs of ram an absolutely
insane 16 megapixel rear facing camera
that of this 4k video and an 8 megapixel
selfie camera with 64 gigs of storage
metal body fingerprint sensor and quick
charge 3.0 are all great features to
have it'll come in at $400 which is a
really good price but if that wasn't
good enough for you
Leigh EKKO is doing $100 instant rebate
at the moment so you can get this phone
for $300 moving on to the lower budget
one delay s3 it's a very very similar
phone except for the processor and a
couple other features we solved the same
5.5 inch full HD display we have one
less gig of ram at three gigs of ram now
still have quick charge 3.0 same
fingerprint sensors same 16 megapixel
rear facing camera 32 gigs of built-in
storage instead of 64 and both phones
have ditched the headphone jacks on
Android users and share the misery and
sorrow of iPhone 7 users as well with
the s3 Leigh echos taking budget phone
to a whole nother level in my pain it
sells for $250 but like the lay pro 3
you can get $100 instant rebate on top
of that so now you'll get this phone at
a hundred and fifty dollars both phones
are unlocked so you can use them with
all sorts of carriers and last but not
least laical also talked about their
skin their EUI software which puts a
high focus on video by swiping a right
from the home screen you can get to a
full screen of TV shows movies and all
sorts of media they also announced late
Echo's echo past subscription that
includes 5 terabytes of cloud storage
unlimited photo storage all sorts of
stuff it's free for the first three
months when you buy a lay pro 3 however
they haven't mentioned anything on what
pricing is gonna be after those 3 months
and so that was really an overview of
what we saw at the late Ecco event today
in San Francisco it's pretty exciting if
you ask me for budget smartphone buyers
it's true
of the competition amongst oneplus and
other budget phone manufacturers but let
me know what you guys think in the
comments down below are you excited
about lahic those new phones if so which
one
I'm very curious to hear give us a
thumbs up if you like this video and I
will see you guys in the next one thanks
