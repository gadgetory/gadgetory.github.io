here i want to give you a quick overview
of Chrome OS this is working via vmware
fusion can get this working on the pc or
mac it takes a little bit of elbow
grease to get it going but it actually
you can this is a very very very early
look it's not even technical preview so
it's pre alpha clearly as you'll see
things aren't working at all but you
can't get a sense of what the operating
system is going to look like and what
it's going to do for you so thoroughly
that might have missed my overview of
Chrome OS when I sort of walk you
through what it is I'll recap it as I go
through and show you what the user
interface looks like so i can't really
click around because things aren't quite
working well you can't see up top right
here the familiar tabs that you use in
the chrome browser and there's a big
difference between chrome browser and
Chrome operating system right here's
where yall your gmail tab will show up
so i'm logged in sort of a defunct gmail
account right here as you open up
different web applications that open up
in new tabs this is an operating system
that's stored completely in the cloud
meeting it's completely stored online so
nothing is on locally on your computer
so if you go to your friend's house you
log into your Chrome OS account all of
your files will be there all of your
Google Docs or whatever else you're
using will show up right now it's only
going to support computers with flash
based hard drives so people are thinking
this is probably going to be an ideal
solution for some of those loan costs
and netbooks it will support the x86 and
some of the other architectures so we'll
be sort of widely available and why we
use fact that this is working right now
is quite a shock but I didn't want to
show you what to expect when chrome OS
is released you can see this is a very
early build this little chrome icon
right here would be akin to your Start
menu when windows or your application
the window if your Mac person this is
where everything would show up all the
applications and programs that you have
unfortunately it doesn't work so i can't
really show you but right now we're in
sort of stuff into google calendar we
can only get out of it
right here you've got some options which
may be a let me open doesn't look like
it wants to this is where all your
options would show up your power options
right there and a little bit more
dropdowns from what you can do a
customized y'all prank system
unfortunately I can't show you that I
just saying columbium right here which
is the mac browser version of Chrome
since this is running on a Mac that's
what is using for browsing purposes but
now I hope this is helpful and give you
guys from the first look more to expect
when chrome OS launches you can see what
it's going to look like and what you can
expect to have although certainly by
then and we'll be working you be able to
click around and when i'm jon rettinger
from TechnoBuffalo hope you enjoyed and
I will see you guys in the next video
bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
