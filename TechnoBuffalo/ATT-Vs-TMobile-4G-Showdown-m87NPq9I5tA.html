technobuffalo here it's hard to throw a
rock and tech industry without hearing
the term 4g thrown around whether it's
referring to LTE wimax or hspa+ there's
no doubt that all of the major networks
are tatting their 4g prowess what we've
got right here is a test of 2 4g
networks in this case the hspa+ variety
on the left-hand side we have t mobile's
4g network being tested on the galaxy s
4g on the right we have 18 piece 4g
network being tested on the inspire 4g
AT&amp;amp;T has an LTE network coming which is
going to increase speeds but for right
now we have hspa+ which is what both
carriers are referring to 4G so I'm
gonna be interesting to a speed test on
both and see which almost quicker now
certainly this is going to vary
depending on where you are in the
country right now I'm in Southern
California so these speeds a really only
representative of my area wherever you
are your signal strength might vary
strangle signal strength here is pretty
even we actually have two bars each you
can see the h plus icon right up at the
top on the inspire and 4G icon right
over there on the galaxy s 4g so we've
got the same speed test app here on both
we'll go ahead and run them you can
certainly see a difference here between
the Super AMOLED screen on the standard
LCD so like at begin test suddently
matter bake it at the same time we're
just testing the speeds and Wi-Fi has
been turned off on both them doesn't
really matter what else is running as
long as we're testing the network speed
sir so we'll go ahead and let these
begin latency test was a little bit
quicker on the galaxy s 4g and then
we're going to look at megabits per
second t-mobile claims it can get up to
24 megabits per second in 18 teeth
claiming I noticeably slower here so you
can see there's a significant difference
here with the speeds so this is 1.28
megabits per second here on the download
48
T and that's 2.75 they're showing their
their main kilobytes but we can go ahead
and convert it that is a significant
difference on the download on the upload
t-mobile's giving us 1.5 whereas II TMT
it's giving us point to two significant
differences here let me go ahead and
I'll change the settings so you can see
what it looks like in megabits per
second but those results are quite of
sounding so you can see that there's a
giant difference now is one test
representative maybe not let's go ahead
and run more and we'll see if there's
any difference I'll actually have now
one extra bar of 4g hspa+ on AT&amp;amp;T
compared to the two that we still have
on t-mobile's let's go ahead and test
these guys again and see if the speeds
give us the same result so we'll go
ahead and load both this and already you
can see that there's a difference now
with with AT&amp;amp;T AT&amp;amp;T gave us 3.13 down
and t-mobile gives 2.87 this is a fun
game to play keep test the networks I
found myself doing it over and over and
over again I'm like a kid in a candy
store here testing speeds so we can get
see there's a huge difference in the
upload speeds the download speeds now
AT&amp;amp;T came in faster we'll do a quick
tiebreaking test then we'll try loading
some website and see how real world
usage varies so i'll go ahead and test
again and i will say that's eight out of
ten tasks that I've run the t-mobile 4g
has been noticeably quicker than AT&amp;amp;T as
you can see right here 2.89 versus 3.6
on the down the upload appears to not be
much of a competition the mortal being
however that the download speeds on both
are relatively quick but no pair near
what the advertised network capability
is 24 megabits per second on t-mobile
and about 12 or so with ET you know
we're getting a 12th or tenth of that
depending on what your score is whether
it's in the ones or the threes big
difference is here so let's go ahead and
try and load a couple of web pages
keeping all of these scores in mind all
right so I've got ESPN the full version
loaded and ready to test on both devices
of course as you can see it this is a
site that has them loaded before on each
i will say that plugins have been
disabled on both browsers meaning flash
has been turned off so it gets for the
most optimal performance that we can and
again we've got t mobile's 4g on the
left and 18 TS on the right and a
quickest way to make sure i can hit them
at the same time is just to do simple
refresh so i'll go ahead and do both
those here go and hit the Go button one
more time I'll go ahead and hit the Go
button here hold it down and the Go
button here as well and we'll let them
go at exactly the same time and see if
we have any sort of speed difference now
keeping in mind that t-mobile's was
showing us actual faster downloads you
can see a 20 is almost done t-mobile's
almost the same spot 18t finished just a
little bit before t-mobile did and i
will say despite the maybe one mega
megabit per second difference that i saw
an actual tests t-mobile was on the tad
bit faster certainly you know we can
read load webpages and keep reloading
web pages but it's only going to show
one time in one instance on video both
were very quick both were notice will be
quicker than 3g but certainly you're
getting nowhere near your capabilities
if you have to pick a three a 4G network
and assuming you're in the area of
service for both t-mobile's are going to
serve you a little bit better on the
short term with their hspa+ network
however what AT&amp;amp;T is true 4G LTE network
coming soon you may be better off taking
a little bit of a speed hit now with the
notion that you're going to get better
long-term data speeds in the future
they're both fantastic networks that'll
be fun to sort of test both these guys
and see what you guys thought so anyway
i'm jon rettinger from TechnoBuffalo
with the short fun network speed test
which camp are you in whether or not you
consider hspa+ 4g there's certainly no
debating that the marketing folks and
the carriers are treating it as such
anyway guys I will see you in the next
video ok
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
