with TechnoBuffalo and we are gonna
cover some stuff with my buddy here
hi I'm mark burst and Wow Wow
that was my impression that was very
good I do the can just for clarity I've
actually Bart and I am John rhett injure
yes don't want to confuse anyone we
always get a lot of questions about what
device people should get yes and our
review this guy went up last week this
is the blackberry proof yes and this is
the Nexus 6p both powered by Android
both powered by Android and a lot people
are wondering which phone to get
especially heading to holidays maybe get
an iPhone for themselves
yep perhaps a super expensive gift for a
loved one in the case of the Prive yes
it is a little bit more expensive
there's also you know cyber monday Black
Friday coming up very soon yes so we
figured we'd help maybe you guys decide
which phone you should get and these are
phones that we both used like yes I
legitimately like the pre-owned Venice I
didn't pick the British side because
it's not to make a good video i right
actually really enjoying also I didn't
get to use the pro that's a daily driver
so I'm actually very curious about what
your experience is like I've been using
the 6p as a daily driver and I loved it
I think it's a great fun I use this
experience our daily drivers during the
review and I liked it a lot right but
then after that I use this guy why are
you still using that one and did not go
back to the 6p so a few things I liked
about the parameters get this out of the
way like I understand yeah no
fingerprint sensor on the back run or
side button 6p does have and that is it
as an issue yes um and the price at 70
bucks expensive right what's the price
one in the 6500 it is a little less
expensive a little less expensive
what does say less expensive mm-hmm so
the few things I really like about the
print that I think are unique to this
device yeah
so the curved screen maybe not new in
the phone world same time doing it but
actually useful the cover screen do a
little swipe in from the side depending
what side you want yeah and Josh
side-to-side right yeah and you can pick
what you want access your calendar
whether you want to enter text or your
to-do list or people it's actually a
really useful menu option and the big
thing about the print I think slide that
sucker out the keyboard yeah which I
didn't actually use a keeper that much
type I was gonna say it didn't seem like
as comfortable as blackberries best you
know it's definitely not the bold 9900
keyboard was a baller and awesome so
this is all capacitors you guys use it
like a touchpad to scroll and
that John Rhett injure is very useful
really mark so we're really excited
about it I did Matt it's awesome
I really like the 6p I am a actually one
of my first videos actually I think was
my intro video someone called me a nexus
warrior and I was like oh yeah I mean I
wouldn't say I'm a warrior but I would
say I'm like a Nexus Vic scavenger I
mean there's something basic I like a
vulture more like a this is loyalists
alright there you know I really like
using Nexus devices I like getting the
bleeding edge of stuff I love being able
to know that like next year when the
next version comes out I can flash
whatever the dev preview is strength of
the next version of Android because it's
also sake Android doesn't have any
bloatware on it marshmallow runs on it
like a dream
Nexus devices also have their own set of
issues like the camera the camera this
is the first time that they have nailed
it on the optics but the app is
atrocious yeah but you can't download
other cameras right you can totally
download other camera apps but things
like just using the shortcut to open up
the camera it's nice and a pleasant
thing but I missed so many shots on this
thing and you're a bummer but the
results of the photo it does take good
pictures it takes phenomenal photos and
that's a big deal for me because I
really like taking pictures of my dog
not to say this doesn't take this takes
great pictures too it's got the 18
megapixels Schneider Kirsch - Jay it's
great it's a great game your rear facing
camera rear facing to the front facing
on this is a paltry to make a 2
megapixel front facing cameras and it
should not be on a phone of this price
right it really should be there's no
excuse but I do have a number of things
that you don't I have the fingerprint
reader on the back which you mentioned
can't argue against it can't argue that
and the price point is quite a bit more
accessible I think the screen on mine
looks better than the screen on yours I
think that you're wrong Wow
I mean so resolution the same yes
resolutions the same five point four
inch ink is a nice like screen size yes
I would tend to agree I think a little
smaller wouldn't hurt for me anyway like
I've been a big proponent of the 5x with
6p specs I really like so you like a
smaller screen size you're using the
phone with the larger screen says yes
because I need I
the beef where's the beef John build on
this as much as I love it get that
smooth aluminum on the back it's so
slippery so so slip are using in a bed
and it's a larger device you have the
back on this is awesome I don't know
what it is is it rubber they've had this
back on other old devices it's like a
fait it's a blackberry on this material
really yeah it's like a faux carbon
fiber we the phone feels awesome
it feels spectacular in the hand and and
I have I've never felt a phone that has
felt so grippy yet smooth yet not it's
just it's such it's got its got feel
that I think what we mean to say here is
these two are relatively comparable
devices good good both good phones both
good phones but I feel like saying
they're both ku phones catch everyone's
best for you is kind of a cop-out I feel
like it is I feel like it is so I think
just based on a stability be respects
because I've got an eight tenant you've
got an 808 the fingerprint reader the
price and the fact that it's my
selection I think the six piece got to
take it between the two C expandable
storage mm-hmm credible battery life I
will take the 808 over the a-10 really
even with all that warmth even though
it's a campfire 8008 d-10 I'm not not
gonna sweat it okay Lawrence has been
awesome on either way it's tested it
works before it is incredible I'll
sacrifice a fingerprint sensor for the
keyboard for the keyboard build quality
is absolutely awesome it's as close to
stock Android you can get yes out being
an X device you get the added benefit
and security but what if you want areas
device me by next device but I don't
want an exit device you guys heard it
here first John said buy a Nexus device
I don't want a Nexus device I want the
best Android experience and I'm getting
that with this if you feel you get up
with the print it's secure yeah I get
that awesome curved screen I get to
slide out keyboard I get a baller camera
yep I get great build quality how about
this thumbs up yes thumbs up for the
privy s thumbs up for the 6p thumbs up
for the 6p if you want the 6p thumbs up
for the proof for the Prive can't decide
subscribe
we're done anyway mortal being there two
great phones yes
and I'm legitimately and I'm didn't do
this for video I would buy the prytt
over the 16 if you've heard software
bugs
Tod's device we did the Britney of you
had it Maya had a newer firmware version
didn't have any of those bugs so if
they're not already fixed already with
the build phone you would buy they'll be
fixed over-the-air so don't don't let
that yeah don't worry and I also feel
the same way about the short comes in
the shortcomings of a nexus because
that's always true the first few months
are always a little bit rocky and then
things really smooth out for the rest of
the year so I think this these are we
live look man we live in the golden era
of all kinds of stuff bones being one of
them the blackberry probe is close to my
heart close to your heart mine's close
to my pants region your Schneider my
division writer optics my Schneider
optics down here anyway thank you guys
so much for watching we really hope you
enjoyed this kind of roundtable chat
with the both of us I don't even know
which camera to look at now be nice to
each other in the comments and what do
you say when you're done thanks for
