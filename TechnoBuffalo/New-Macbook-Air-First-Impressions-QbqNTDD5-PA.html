TechnoBuffalo here we're gonna do a
first boot up and initial impressions of
the just redesign 2010 MacBook Air this
is the 11.6 inch model and I gotta tell
you it is extremely thin and very light
I'm wondering if it packs any sort of
punch for such a diminutive size let's
go ahead and get started alright so this
guy has never been powered on before
it's go ahead and open it up and it's
almost jarring to see such a small
screen with a full-size keyboard the
keyboard extends out past where the
actual screen is kind of interesting so
let's go ahead and turn this on the
power key is actually a real button
outlook sort of inlaid with all of the
function keys on top so honor that
little circle that's embedded in the top
of the chassis let's go ahead and power
this thing on see if it's got some juice
to kick on here it looks like it does
it's always kind of a satisfying
experience hopefully we'll get the the
Apple dancing music there doesn't seem
open up so you guys can see it I'm
generally got a minute or two wait while
it boots up and does its first
initialization and of course stay tuned
to TechnoBuffalo and the youtube channel
at youtube.com slash John four lingers
for sort of all the information the
MacBook Air I get this guy for just
about a week and really gonna put it
through the paces to see what it can do
and what it can't do for that matter so
here we are go ahead and use English is
the main language some of these things
I'm gonna have to cut out some to put in
passwords and that kind of in so I'll go
ahead and keep going
The Snow Leopard and leopard welcome
video welcoming you to match alright so
bad dancing decided this like we're just
about done OS 10 under what the OS 10.7
lion and look like here alright so we
are in the United States to continue the
trackpad to you should be pretty good on
first response the MacBook Airs
was the last of the Apple align to sort
of have a physical button that's now
just this whole kooky trackpad it seems
to be pretty good they continue it
doesn't have as much throw as the
trackpad on the Mac books and MacBook
Pros but does not be semantically penis
so we're not going to transferring
information right now just a demo yet I
continue and if you do want to use
migration assisted you could certainly
use one of the USB ports or do it all
over Wi-Fi go ahead and connect to Wi-Fi
here go ahead and push this off to the
side and type in my password
alright so that is all set up and I will
see that in first blush just me keyboard
seems to be pretty good it does feel
like using a standard Apple keyboard the
option and all keys look to be a bit
small although the four-way navigation
is pretty decent size and the keyboard
itself feels like a standard sized
keyboard will go ahead and not take a
picture let's pick a Sherdog hit
continue and now we're gonna see how
this thing handles with some HD movies
just do some sort of general quick test
with it so to give you some first
impressions and of course I'll do sort
of more thorough testing on it to see
what it can do and what it can't do so
here we are we are now in the MacBook
Air is has never been turned on before
never big packed
line let's go ahead and jump on over to
Safari and let's see how it handles HD
video which you assume would be quite
good with the NVIDIA GeForce graphics
processor hasn't here in a full Core 2
Duo chip
good to give us another welcome to
Safari thing ignore that let's go ahead
and jump on over to my youtube channel
so youtube.com slash John for Lakers
youtube.com slash John for Lakers it's
nice now I'm trying to type this on a
smartphone keyboard I always screw up
whenever I am on camera all right so
it's going to load and it still is a
little shocking to see a full size
keyboard on on a laptop is small
while that's loading up it's actually
look at the track pets or a first
impression saying the trackpad is a
little sunk in little more sunk in than
we've seen on previous generations of
this sort of all glass trackpad I wonder
if that's unique to the MacBook Air or
not they had to make some sacrifice to
have it be clicky well in such a sort of
razer thin profile right there so we do
not have adobe flash that is very sort
of typical Apple I think in gadget X
reported these were shipping with out
adobe flash so I'll go ahead and install
that and come right back all right so we
got flash installed it appears his
apples wore on Adobe continues let's go
ahead and bump this sucker up to 720p
and let's hit play it's going to
fullscreen it and not surprisingly plays
very smooth you'd expect that with the
Nvidia chip in here work you can sort of
get a little sense with the speaker
sound like too
they're a little louder than I expect
them to be they're certainly not gonna
rock the party with these tiny speakers
but you can definitely listen to your
music or watch a video or two overall I
take a relatively impressive at least
YouTube's performance so I'll put this
thing through more tests will try bulu
and will try other HD video I'll have to
do a first boot up and show you guys
just generally without pin system look
like and how quick or or not quick was
an overall it seems to have pretty
decent performance certainly it's not
gonna compare with the core i3 i5 or i7
but it's just a either secondary or a
primary computer for someone who doesn't
do very heavy heavy things this may be a
really nice companion to have with you
I'm looking forward to having one of
these for traveling and taking to and
from school and we're guys anything that
you want to see I'll leave it down below
I'll be sure to get to it I am John
Wright and you're protecting our Buffalo
with a first boot up and I guess a first
look at the 11.6 inch MacBook Air see
you guys next video bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
