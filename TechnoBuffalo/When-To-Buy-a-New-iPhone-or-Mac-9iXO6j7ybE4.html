kidding um just got back for a buddy's
wedding was actually in the wedding
party hence the fancy getup and I
figured a class up my video a little bit
and I wear the tux to talk to you guys
so consider this to one time jon
rettinger gets classy so one of the
emails that I get really all the time
and I start to get it kind of more and
more as the Apple conferences
announcements come up are when should i
get my computer should i wait to get my
iphone should i wait to get an ipod
touch so i'm going to try and answer
those questions for you and tell you
whether you should get a computer when
you shouldn't and if you can wait or if
you can't wait so to start Apple's
Worldwide Developer Conference or WWDC
is coming up in June it's actually the
eighth to the 12 I did a previous video
on predictions for that so go ahead and
check that if you want to see sort of
what i think is coming but if you're in
the market for a new computer right now
so macbook imac really any sort of apple
laptop or desktop and you don't need it
right the second you're not traveling
tomorrow where you gotta have a computer
to take with you or you don't have to
have something that you try to paper
with if you can wait until june i
definitely recommend waiting until june
i think apple probably will update the
line probably spec update certainly not
a complete redesign of the macbook but
it's worth holding out for if you can
you can wait the month I'd end it so
that's kind of my advice those do
they've been asking I need a macbook
right now on imac right now what should
i do wait definitely wait the extra week
and you know see if it's and it comes in
so within computers i can recommend
strongly waiting where you really gotta
wait or you're gonna be disappointed is
it when it comes to the iphone i think
for sure beyond the doubt apple is going
to announce a new version of the iphone
hold off on buying an iphone right now
you've held off this long definitely
wait save your upgrade save your cash
wait for the iphone that rumors kicking
around that Apple may even lower the
data price definitely wait until June if
you have to have a phone right now go to
your local
18d store or o2 store ever your at buy
one of those pay-as-you-go phones have
something to tide you over we definitely
recommend waiting for the new iphone at
least see if the new features are going
to be worth it to you because you never
know what they might announce next thing
are the ipod line if you're looking to
get an ipod touch ipod classic or nano i
think you're safe apple doesn't
traditionally update those until around
the sep tember line so you still got a
couple months left if you can wait until
June just see what happens in case they
do update it you know definitely do that
but if you want something right now if
the immediate gratification I think
you're going to be okay holding a brand
new iphone in your hand before june and
note that won't get updated so there's
just some real quick advice hope you
found it helpful nice opportunity for me
to keep wearing my tux and i hope you
enjoyed this is jon rettinger for
exclusive content sure to follow me on
twitter twitter com / John for lakers I
was thinking about doing some sort of
James Bond thing you know with the
handgun biting at the bow tie so I Nikki
was going to work you know put some
James Bond music your pictures behind me
but figured I'd just do it this way and
we guys bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
