to you by domain.com hey what's going on
guys a mark in Sangin from TechnoBuffalo
and on today's episode of rumor roundup
we'll be talking about the galaxy note5
and s6 edge+ yet again LG's playing for
Google's next Nexus smartphone and the
oneplus 2 this is rumor on oh let's go
ahead and get started the oneplus 2 is
set to pack some powerful hardware but
the new phone could be lacking in one
important area a new report claims a
device will still pack a 1080p
resolution for its display despite the
widespread adoption of quad HD across
the industry this year the choice was
probably made to help keep the cost down
this new rumor comes from a Weibo users
is built up a bit of a reputation for
revealing Chinese phones the leak
actually offers a full list of specs
suggesting the device will pack a 5.5
inch 1080p display a 3300 milliamp
battery a 16 megapixel rear camera in a
5 megapixel front-facing camera the 1+2
has already confirmed to pack 4
gigabytes of ram a modified version of
the Snapdragon 810 processor a USBC port
and a fingerprint reader rumor has it
the device will also feature a metal
design though it's still unclear exactly
what it will look like the oneplus sue
seems pretty similar to the original one
when it comes to design based on
previously images but we won't have to
wait too long since the device is
expected to be announced on july 27
samsung has two big phones on a horizon
the galaxy note5 in the galaxy s6 edge+
now it turns out the two devices could
be pretty similar at least on the
surface a new report from Sam mobile
claims both the galaxy note5 in the
galaxy s6 edge+ will feature 5.7 inch
quad HD displays and will ship in black
gold silver and white color options the
two phones are expected to adopt the
glass back design featured on the galaxy
s6 and we're guessing that means the
upcoming handsets won't offer renewal
batteries or expandable storage either
now for the differences first the
obvious which is that the galaxy note 5
will feature a flat display while the s6
edge+ is curved peeking under the hood
Sam mobile claims the note 5 will
introduce a brand new X you know 7422
processor which includes a 64-bit
octa-core CPU a new graphics processing
chip RAM storage and LTE all in one
place meanwhile the galaxy s6 edge+ will
allegedly pack a snapdragon 808
processor 32 gigabytes of storage a 6
megapixel camera a 5 megapixel front
facing camera and a 3,000 milliamp
battery we expect same thing to reveal
the new phones in September at IFA in
Berlin but we'll also keep an eye out
for any more news this summer ahead of
the official unveiling over at
TechnoBuffalo calm last but certainly
not least rumor has it that LG is
teaming up with Google for a new Nexus
phone but if you're expecting a rehash
of the LG g4 think again according to
android pit the upcoming stock Android
phone will be an entirely new device
instead of one based off of an existing
LG smartphone the report which cites one
anonymous source claims a new Nexus
phone is based off of it and release
prototype earlier rumors suggests LG's
new Nexus will pack a 5.2 inch display a
two thousand seven hundred million
battery and a snapdragon 808 processor
meanwhile a second Nexus device from
Huawei could feature a larger 5.7 inch
screen a snapdragon 810 processor and a
3500 million battery that seems like a
good Nexus device to me we've still got
at least a few more months before google
reveals a new Nexus lineup and the
company typically waits until October
when it also reveals the finalized
version of the latest iteration of
