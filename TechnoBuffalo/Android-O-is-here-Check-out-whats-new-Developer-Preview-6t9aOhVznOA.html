marshmallow you're probably reading
articles about phones getting nougat and
I'm about to make you feel a little bit
worse for yourselves and I apologize but
today Google took the wraps off Android
Oh at least a very first Developer
Preview came out so we installed Android
Oh on our pixel and you can install this
on a lot of different devices do it on
the Android emulator 5 X 6 P player any
of the pixel devices so it's regular
pixel pixel XL or pixel C but again do
with caution this is meant just for
developers it will be a consumer version
though plan later in the year 1 a huge
area of improvement you can expect from
Android o is battery life
Google's giving additional limits on
what apps can do in the background which
is similar to what Apple does with iOS
so gone are the days of background
processes running what this going to
mean for the end user is just much
better app management and battery life
notification channel is also new here
users can be able to block or change any
vacation behavior on each channel
individually how about some pip some
picture and picture display is now
available on phones and tablets but you
keep watching a video while you use
another app so just an improved picture
in picture we also have adaptive icons
now system icons can add out whatever
environment they're in whether on a
Samsung or LG device so depending on the
launch we've got going on the adaptive
icon also a lot of ella purrs integrates
their app icons with the devices
existing UI you now have wide gamut
color for apps apps and take advantage
of new devices it'll have wide color
gamut for color capable displays so just
brilliant better colors googles are
working with different partners trying
to improve experiences so for better
audio they work directly with Sony so
you should get way better audio when
you're just plugging in your headphones
so I'm sure this is just the tip of the
iceberg what Google is going to announce
for Android oh what features are
eventually going to come baked in - oh
I'm going to call an Oreo whatever it
eventually comes out I'm excited
hopefully you guys are too many features
you guys most excited about let me know
in the comments down below and we can
talk about them the next time John
