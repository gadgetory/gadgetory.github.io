go further how's it going guys and aaron
baker from TechnoBuffalo if you followed
the Hisense videos that i've done on the
site to date I was talking about all the
ones having Android 4.1 this is a high
sense device it has android 4.1 also
known as jellybean this is the Hisense
you 958 it's packing some awesome specs
all around the most case you guys so
this is being kind of a mid-range to low
high-end device in the u.s. not to say
that it would ever come to the US but
that's what I would see if this device
were slated for launch and our native
land here you got android 4.1 here you
can see little customization so compared
to see other hisense devices that we've
taken a look at you can see that the
customizations have kind of gone down a
little bit on the Hisense device with
android 4.1 you do get dual SIM card
support on this device and then you got
some buttons on your menu home and back
as well the typical Android look and
feel with five home screens on this
device of course Google now integration
and project butter integration as well
out-of-the-box applications Angry Birds
let's take a look down through fruit
ninja keep going down there probe on
managers you can see some very minor
customizations weather and then within
the widgets I imagine we'll see some
custom widgets for the Hisense you 958
let's see what we've got looks like
pretty stuck in terms of the widgets
don't really see any custom widgets
there that are specific to Heist it's
really cool looking device here a nice
blue color you got inside volume rocker
what looks like a power button which
actually on the left side which is
really interesting given what we're used
to slot 1 slot 2 no sim card so again
dual-sim support and there's your google
now integration along with your lock
screen and your camera keep it locked on
TechnoBuffalo for continuing updates of
the United diate all the goodness that
