your top stories Motorola unveiled the
Moto G this week a mid-range device with
a super compelling price tag it's got a
four-and-a-half inch 720p display one
gig of ram a quad-core Snapdragon 400
processor promises Android 4.4 KitKat in
January and starts at just 179 bucks off
contract it's pretty obvious Google
wants to get into the emerging markets
game with this particular moto but it
might even do well as a secondary device
for travel and emergencies we'll be
keeping an eye on its sales as the Moto
G launches around the globe snapchat the
news this week after reports of a
crazy-high buyout offer surfaced sources
are saying facebook offered three
billion dollars cash to purchase
snapchat but snapchat CEO Evan Spiegel
was not having it that's three
instagrams for those of you playing at
home oh and did we mention snapchat
doesn't even have a revenue stream right
now turning me on Facebook is a bold
move we'll see if it ends up paying off
for them
over in gaming its PlayStation 4 de Sony
fans around the globe lined up last
night to buy the newest playstation or I
guess pick them up if you're talking
about pre-orders and we're roughing up
our gaming coverage to match the
next-gen console fever going around
we're reviewing everything the console
the games the controllers but don't
worry Xbox one fans your day is fast
approaching and then the next gen
console wars will truly begin did you
decide on a ps4 and xbox one or maybe
even a Wii U or maybe you're getting all
three consoles you baller you speaking
of the wii u this week the president of
Sony worldwide Shu Yoshida said in an
interview that while Nintendo is
competition in a way they're training
the police station buyers of tomorrow
and because of that Yoshida wants them
to succeed he went on to say he thought
in 10 days we you launch message was too
focused on core gamers and not
family-friendly like the original Wii
but then Nintendo seems to be coming
back around to where they should be
focused some very smart and honest words
from mr. Yoshida lastly our wildcard
story for the week is a startup
promising to consolidate all your
debit/credit gift membership and other
cards into one single device the startup
is called coin and it's touting a
connected card and an app for you to add
your cards to the idea is pretty
interesting and worth checking out but
we're curious to see if it catches on
outside the US where the chip card is
already the norm that's the Buffalo
