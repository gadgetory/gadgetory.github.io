technobuffalo here the Galaxy Nexus is
official after months of spy shots
rumors and videos we finally know
everything there is to know about the
first Ice Cream Sandwich powered phone
and the next Google flagship so let's go
ahead and run through the specs and what
you can expect when you go out to get
your new phone so first let's answer the
big question carriers at least in the
u.s. we don't know what they're going to
be but we do know that there is going to
be LTE and HSPA+ support so LTE perhaps
verizon hspa+ AT&amp;amp;T and t-mobile I'll
definitely tends to be the speculation
so if you see me look down it's because
I got some notes in front of me that
just ended it's going to be powered by a
relatively capable 1.2 gig gerdes
dual-core processor months and many
moons ago is speculated that this device
was going to be the first quad-core
phone on the planet but alas it was not
is a 1.2 gig earth dual-core chip one
thing to mention though Ice Cream
Sandwich is the first version of Android
that's truly been optimized for dual
core so even if it's not a 1.5 bigger
chip you should notice a tremendous
speed improvements the code has been
written specifically for multi-core
processors so I know that sounds kind of
geeky but it's a really big deal so
don't get caught up in the you know
point something gigahertz and what that
matters the code is really important
this software has been optimized for the
hardware which is a giant deal being
powered by android 4.0 ice cream
sandwich which we'll talk about another
video and there's a lot to talk about
their cameras it's got a 5 megapixel
autofocus camera with LED flash and zero
shutter lag and fast shot two shoots
what that means is when you push that
virtual button on your phone if you're
gunning your baby's doing something
funny you're going to catch that shot
immediately it is not going to be you
know out of frame or take a couple
seconds Gus take those pictures with a
new panorama mode which is kinda neat on
the front camera you have a 1.3
megapixel cam
for video chat or taking your facebook
pictures when you hold it up there like
that it's got a ton of audio options as
well they're saying the Codex it
supports stuff that androids always
supported mp3 AAC aac+ and eaac+ 3.5
millimeter headset jack duh all the rest
of the you know android stuff did expect
you got bluetooth 3.0 not four-point-oh
USB to Wi-Fi 802 11 BG and n it's got an
accelerometer compass a light sensor
proximity sensor and proximity sensor
and a barometer that's true it's got a
barometer so now you and your weatherman
can be the first to know when it's going
to rain I'm really curious to what
developers are going to do with that
barometer functionality the API is then
the SDK and on that rest that business
are available today by the way so get
your development on it's got a gig of
ram 16 or 32 gigs of internal memory
from a size standpoint it's really thin
a 130 5.5 x 60 7.94 x 8.9 forward
millimeters so i don't know that's been
135 grams is being powered by a 1750
milliamp hour battery and it's got a
giant 4.65 inch 1280 x 720 yes that is a
720p display screen which is HD and
super amoled i'm doing this like a
politician vote for me so this is a
giant phone four point six five inches
dual-core ice cream sandwich and a ton
of other goodness are you guys excited
for the Galaxy Nexus I can pretty much
say this is going to be my next phone
depending on you know how it looks so I
finally get in my hands but I am very
much excited for it again we'll talk
about ice cream sandwich at next video
but it looks to be a beautiful operating
system they made a lot of attention to
detail including down to that font which
is brand new and redesigned for ice
cream sandwich I really look to be a
beautiful well polished operating system
and what I'm really excited to get my
tech your love and hands on so what you
guys think Galaxy Nexus thumbs up thumbs
down thumbs in the middle leave your
comments down below jon rettinger from
