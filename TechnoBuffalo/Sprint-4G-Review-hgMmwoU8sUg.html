TechnoBuffalo and this is a review of
spritz 4g network using their new 3g 4g
card now they're WiMAX 4G network is
only available in select markets I am
near Philadelphia and the Wi-Fi signal
comes out of out of the city and into
most of the surrounding suburbs which is
where I'm filming this from right now
although I've tested this directly in
the city and in many adjacent counties
and we'll talk about the speed soon
right now it's also in Texas in
Washington and some other cities around
the country obviously sprint plans to
deploy their 4g network on a bigger
scale in 2010 the wimax technology goes
right up against LTE in terms of the 4g
standards that we're going to start
seeing in the future so let's go through
actually connecting to the 4g network
going to start by just plugging in the
wireless card pretty simple stuff to
start and use any USB port and now i'm
going to open the sprint 4G application
they call it smart view this is actually
the same application that they use for
the 3g cards and it says initializing
and it'll take a few seconds to get
going all right and so we're connected
to Sprint's 4G network that took about
45 seconds probably closer to 55 seconds
which isn't the fastest but connecting
to these 3g networks with wireless cards
often take that long another way that
you can tell that we are on wimax and
it's not happening right now but usually
you'll get a blue blinking light on the
3g 4g card but it turns green when
you're in an area where there is only 3g
so right now we have two bars so let's
do a speed test and see how fast we are
running right now so i'm going to go
into chrome and let's go to
speedtest.net all right and click begin
test see what happens so I should
mention that the theoretical maximum
speed of wimax according to sprint is
about 10 megabits per second down with
the average being around
and just for comparison a 3g card will
get you about 1.2 to 1.3 down on average
so they're really claiming to have four
to five times the speed that 3g does of
course there are wide variations for
example right now you see that I've got
3.39 megabits per second noun which is
pretty darn fast but definitely not even
close to the six I've tested this in
Philadelphia and in many other places
around the region and I've gotten
between two and four point two megabits
per second down I haven't gotten to a
place where I had a full signal that's
probably why I've never achieved this
six megabits per second down that said
3.39 even in this case is still quite
fast if I were to turn off the 3g 4g
card use y Wi-Fi network right here in
my house I would get about 10 megabits
per second down of course that varies by
your internet service provider but this
is a reasonable speed and using this out
in the field out in the middle of the
city is a great experience that it feels
like I'm on a fast Wi-Fi network but as
you can tell you're not going to want to
upload YouTube videos from a 4G card
because the the upload speeds are still
not that fast this is actually extremely
slow it should have been about point 5
in fact if we do another test I think it
should be higher okay so a little better
this time point 3 up but still nothing
great in terms of the reliability of the
connection it's quite fantastic I've
used this for well over an hour straight
and there was no downtime it didn't
disconnect it stayed connected the whole
time the only thing I noticed is that
that the card got extremely more to the
point where i was a little bit concerned
that it may be too warm inside and you
actually hear some stories of some 3g or
4g card sort of melting inside
fortunately the 3g 4g card does have a
warranty with it speaking of which the
price for the 3g 4g card is free after
ravings and you have to pay seventy
dollars per month to use this although
if you're using the 4g access its
unlimited which is really fantastic if
you're on the 3g network you can only
use five gigabytes of data which is
actually plenty because that will allow
you to download a ton of emails and
look at lots of pictures you're just not
going to want to stream a lot of HD
video if you're on the 3g network and
just so you can get another indication
of how fast this is let me go to a few
different websites let's go to John for
lakers YouTube channels try to stream
aid an HD video and see how that works
let's scroll down a little bit click on
the HD button on this video and I'm
going to go right to play I'm not going
to let it buffer although it may need to
so let's go fullscreen and see hd-video
/ Sprint's 4G network let's see looks
like it already stopped to buffer so I'm
going to give it actually I think it
paused yep it did pause here it goes so
it actually didn't need to buffer you
I'm going to fast forward a little bit
to see a little bit of motion so we can
see how smooth things are jump ahead a
lot so it's definitely going at the
buffer now for a moment very smooth I
jump to a certain spot and it's playing
back quite smoothly so HD video comes
across nicely on sprint's 4g network
let's go to say any edge calm and see
how quickly that comes on the screen and
there goes
style is about four or five seconds and
we have pretty much the whole page
loaded here and ready to go click on a
link and sort of see how fast it jumps
to the next page very fast from that
transition will go to engadget mobile to
see how fast that page loads very smooth
i feel like i'm on Wi-Fi right now so so
quite fast indeed especially for basic
web browsing jumping around from site to
site all in all if you're going to be
getting a 3g card or a 4G card it makes
a lot of sense to check to see if sprint
has the 4g signal in your city again
we'll post on TechnoBuffalo so you can
see if that's there because the price
difference to get the 4g is only ten
dollars a month if you compare this to
the 3g cards from verizon and from AT&amp;amp;T
and t-mobile one more thing of note
sprint also sent us a wide pipe for
review and the idea what this is that
you plug in the sprint 3g 4g card and
then you get an instant wireless hotspot
that has 4g allowing for people to
connect at one time it's kind of like a
mifi but it does 4g the battery lasts
between two and four hours and the
performance is quite good even when two
or three of your friends are connected
the idea behind this is of course you
can go into a car and you can have your
friends all surfing the web using a 4G
connection at the same time and it works
quite well this is about one hundred and
seventy dollars so it may not be
necessary for most people but it's nice
to have if you collaborate and you don't
find yourself near a Wi-Fi signal on a
regular basis so overall the sprint 4G
3G card is a pretty neat device we're
really looking forward to better
coverage in more cities and again
Sprint's 4G network is in its infancy so
there's not that much coverage and out
here in the suburbs away from the city
the signal is kind of weak so it's not
it's not perfect yet but we're looking
forward to them deploying it on a bigger
basis overall i recommend the sprint 4g
3g card that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
