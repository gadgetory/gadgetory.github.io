technobuffalo here and I want to share
my first impressions of the latest
Samsung device this is the curvy Galaxy
Note edge let's get started whenever we
do our reviews I like to use a device
for at least five plus days to get a
chance to really music cypher stim
pressions sometimes don't always carry
through what ends up being the final
result on the device but can you to get
a good sense of how I feel about a phone
within the first 24 or 48 hours so you
might have just seen the unboxing this
guy just go up we've actually had it for
two days and I want to see I have no
idea what I think about it I'm all over
the board on it so we'll get into a ton
more depth than review but I do want to
share my first impressions if you guys
decided well not to run to the store to
pick one of these guys up so first the
design and this is sort of a very new
thing for samsung I think starting with
the galaxy I'll phone the Galaxy Note 4
I really like the design Samsung has
taken the way their phones feel from
service not much a cheap plastic so
really premium feel that definitely
carries through here with the note line
I love the way the edge feels at least
the left side in the hand I like the way
the server metal looks dark it just
looks really cool the left-hand side
feels like any other phone the
right-hand side though where that edge
screen is feels very strange in the hand
that almost feel sharp hitting your side
and I sort of the very way of how your
handsets your palm is inevitably going
to touch that screen all the times you
have to sort of be very careful with how
you hold it or even hold it in the
opposite hand that you're used to you
can accidentally touch that screen that
said though I really liked the way the
phone look is very unique most phones
out there now look the same some version
of a rectangle this one's something
totally different whether you like it or
don't like it I do love and appreciate
that Samsung's trying something new and
I give them credit order for us or moved
something new in the smartphone world
someone has to be the first to try
something new and take a risk whether it
works doesn't work and I give Samsung
credit I'll be willing to wager we're
going to see versions of this curve
screaming be on one side two sides of
different difference or alliterations of
it over the next few years and the rest
of Samsung's flagships so how does the
curve work it doesn't add anything
that's really my big question was what
is it
add vs the note 4 it's almost the same
spec for spec save for that lecture a
tiny screen there I'm not sure what it
adds yet other than just a really a cool
factor a few things first auto really
responsive so to interactive that you
considers keep swiping from the right to
the left serve access the new kind of
ribbons they've called it and it's fine
it's same thing as having icons down
below with having them on the side
nothing really new there I like thing
else have social media show up their
sports scores are nice I was going to
sell a phone for me having that at least
that's my first impression of perhaps
that will change sort of oddly enough
though they don't always behave like two
separate screens if I went ahead and
let's say I wanted to open a website for
examples go to technobuffalo calm and
you can see the screen there search
shows up on the side if I swipe in it
overlapped and comes on the top of the
screen they're not totally separate you
can see some of the words there are
being covered by that side rim you can
swipe it away and it goes away but just
know that it's not totally its own sort
of piece of real estate they do overlap
a little bit so kind of bear that in
mind it does add some cool kind of new
features to when you go to the camera
for example the whole screen is now a
viewfinder kind of similar to a tablet
and you get all your camera controls on
that side screen it's neat it's a nice
addition I don't know how much it adds
or not but it is there and you go into
settings and everything and they can
serve start to see how the side screen
can interact with the main screen so you
know sort of how I feel about his device
I'm not sure if it's a nice addition or
bad addition but I'm really really glad
that it exists and I like what Samsung
is doing here the quad HD screen here is
absolutely gorgeous I think Samsung has
always made some of the best screens
going and that's true here too the note
4 screen is absolutely gorgeous this one
is no exception the black so clearly
black its AMOLED colors are bright
things pop it looks really nice but like
I've sort of found all quad HD screen it
doesn't look leaps and bounds better
than a 1080p screen it looks like a
really good at 1080p screen unless
you're looking at him you know I quad HD
image and it has a lot of pixels and
you'll sort of see it all fit on one
screen the big difference when you went
from think of your TV's from standard
definition to HD was jiving
I mean you could really see it it is a
fraction of that difference from 1080 P
to Q HD and that's true for TVs from
1080p 24 k it looks nicer not a giant
amount nicer does it really matter
because you're not sacrificing much here
you sure get the benefit of that you're
also getting really good battery life I
like that quick charge included here
TouchWiz I'm not gonna talk too much
about if you don't like it you can
always try and change it if you like
soon as this review is done though you
know Google now launcher might find its
way onto this device first impressions
on that screen I'd like it would I buy
it over the note for I don't know yet
and that's why I'm really glad we're
waiting to a review because I'm really
not sure what to think of this to be a
conversation starter everywhere I've
gone I've had this phone how people are
like what the heck is that so that's
kind of fun usually envision people
stopped me to ask by my films when I had
just a gigantic huge phone like Lumia
1520 over six inches which somehow now
is starting to seem like a normal sized
phone so that's been kind of fun to talk
to feel bad and show them what is in
showing what they can do I think the big
difference though is gonna be over the
next few months I've developers try to
take advantage of that extra screen real
estate try to do some cool things with
it then it might be a huge banner of the
note 4 but I think you're banking on
developers at this point right now as is
it's probably not much additional I
other than kind of a WOW factor upload a
few blue developers are really going to
try to make use of this then you might
want to consider the Galaxy Note edge
but one thing I can say go to store and
try it before you buy it see if you like
you might not like the way it feels in
your hand you might really really like
it and that cool factor might just do it
for you i'm looking forward to keep
testing this and seeing what I think are
my opinions change anything you guys
want me to see see or show on this
device for the review please let me know
it's one of those things that I really
don't know yet what I think about it
which is kind of rare for me so it's
also kind of fun and refreshing anything
