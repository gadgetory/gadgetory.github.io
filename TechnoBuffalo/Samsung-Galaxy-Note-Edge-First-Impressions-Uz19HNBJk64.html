TechnoBuffalo here and I want to share
my first impressions of the latest
Samsung device this is the curvy Galaxy
Note edge let's get started whenever we
do our reviews I like to use a device
for at least five plus days to get a
chance to really music so I first
impressions sometimes don't always carry
through what ends up being the final
result on the device but you should get
a good sense of how I feel about a phone
within the first 24 to 48 hours so you
might have just seen the unboxing this
guy just go up we've actually had it for
two days and I want to see I have no
idea what I think about it I'm all over
the board on it so we'll get into a ton
more depth and review but I do want to
share my first impressions if you guys
decided well not to run to the store to
pick one of these guys up so first the
design and this is sort of a very new
thing for Samsung I think starting with
the Galaxy Aleph on the Galaxy Note 4 I
really like the design samsung has taken
the way their phones feel from service
so much a cheap plastic it's a really
premium feel and that definitely carries
through here with the note line I love
the way the edge feels at least the left
side in the hand I like the way the
server metal looks dark it just looks
really cool the left hand side feels
like any other phone the right hand side
though where that edge screen is feels
very strange in a hand it almost feels
sharp hitting your side and but sort of
the very way of how your hand sits your
palm is inevitably going to touch that
screen all the times you have to sort of
be very careful with how you hold it or
even hold it in the opposite hand that
you're used to you can accidentally
touch that screen that said though I
really liked the way the phone looked is
very unique most phones out there now
look the same some version of a
rectangle this one's something totally
different whether you like it or don't
like it I do love and appreciate that
Samsung's trying something new can I
give them credit in order for us to move
to something new in the smartphone world
someone has to be the first to try
something new and take a risk whether it
works doesn't work and I give Samsung
credit I'll be willing to wager we're
gonna see versions of this curve
screaming me on one side two sides of
different difference or alliterations of
it over the next few years and the rest
of Samsung's flagship s-- so how does
the curve work it doesn't add anything
that's really my big question was what
does it add versus the note 4 it's
almost the same spec for spec
save for that little extra tiny screen
there I'm not sure what it adds yet
other than just a really a cool factor a
few things first on a really responsive
so to interactive that you consider is
keep swiping from the right to the left
sort of access the new kind of ribbons
if called it and it's fine it's same
thing as having icons down below with
having them on the side nothing really
new there I like being able to have
social media show up there sports scores
room nice I love it's gonna sell a phone
for me having that I think that's my
first impression of perhaps that will
change sort of oddly enough though they
don't always behave like two separate
screens if I went ahead and let's say I
wanted to open a website for examples go
to TechnoBuffalo comm and you can see
the screen there sort of shows up on the
side if I swipe in it overlaps and comes
on the top of the screen they're not
totally separate so you can see some of
the words there are being covered by
that side ribbon you can swipe it away
and it goes away but just know that it's
not totally its own sort of piece of
real estate they do overlap a little bit
so kind of bear that in mind it does add
some cool kind of new features too when
you go to the camera for example the
whole screen is now a viewfinder kind of
similar to a tablet and you get all your
camera controls on that side screen it's
neat it's a nice addition I don't know
how much it adds or not but it is there
and you go into settings and everything
and they can sort of start to see how
the side screen can interact with the
main screen so you know it's sort of how
I feel about his device I'm not sure if
it's a nice addition or a bad addition
but I'm really really glad that it
exists and I like what Samsung is doing
here the quad HD screen here is
absolutely gorgeous
I think Samsung has always made some of
the best screens going and that's true
here to the note 4 screen is absolutely
gorgeous this one is no exception in the
black so clearly black it's AMOLED
colors are bright things pop it looks
really nice but like I've sort of found
all quad HD screen it doesn't look leaps
and bounds better than a 1080p screen it
looks like a really good at 1080p screen
unless you're looking at him you know a
quad HD image so it has a lot of pixels
and you'll sort of see it all fit on one
screen the big difference when you went
from think of your TVs from standard
definition to HD was gigantic I mean you
could really see it it is a fraction of
that difference from
1080p to qHD and that's true for TVs
from 1080p to 4k it looks nicer not a
giant amount nicer but doesn't really
matter because you're not sacrificing
much here you should get the benefit of
that you're also getting really good
battery life I like that quick charge
included here
TouchWiz I'm not gonna talk too much
about if you don't like it you can
always try and change it if you like
soon as this review is done though you
know Google now launcher might find its
way onto this device my first
impressions on that screen I like it
would I buy it over the note for I don't
know yet
and that's why I'm really glad we're
waiting to do a review because I'm
really not sure what to think of this to
be a conversation starter everywhere
I've gone I've had this phone how people
are like what the heck is that so that's
kind of fun usually the only reason
people stopped me to ask but my phone
was when I had just a gigantic huge
phone like the Lumia 1520 it was six
inches which somehow now is starting to
seem like a normal sized phone so that's
been kind of fun to talk to you about it
and show them what is in show what it
can what they can do I think the big
difference though is gonna be over the
next few months I've developers try to
take advantage of that extra screen real
estate try to do some cool things with
it then it might be a huge banner of the
note 4 but I think you're banking on
developers at this point right now as is
it's probably not much additional value
other than kind of a WOW factor a but if
you believe developers are really gonna
try to make use of this then you might
want to consider the Galaxy Note edge
but one thing I can say go to store and
try it before you buy it
see if you like you might not like the
way it feels in your hand or you might
really really like it and that cool
factor might just do it for you I'm
looking forward to keep testing this and
seeing what I think are my opinions
change anything you guys want me to see
see or show on this device for the
review please let me know it's one of
those things that I really don't know
yet what I think about it which is kind
of rare for me so it's also kind of fun
