to you by State Farm helping you get to
a better State what's up everyone jon
rettinger TechnoBuffalo here and I'm
surrounded by my peeps in the gaming
world from e3 2013 behind me as
Microsoft and one of the other keys of
the show the xbox one let's get as close
to it as Microsoft allowance without
kicking me out here take a look at the
console itself walk you through it and
take a look at some of the games and a
controller so let's get started so here
is the console itself looking like an
old-school cable box moving right along
we've got the controller and the Kinect
looking like a squatter version the
Kinect we've got right now more on that
a little bit later if we go back you can
see all the events surrounding this guy
and a slot-loading blu-ray drive right
there on the front on the back you've
got power hdmi out you've got audio hdmi
and two USB port your connect port we've
got an IR port and your Gigabit Ethernet
port lots of ports I so we took a first
look at the xbox one console let's take
a look at what's going to control it the
appropriately-named of controller so a
lot of things are different here the
first thing you'll notice that you pick
it up is a material feels very different
and almost has a third-party controller
feel to it the battery pack isn't
totally removed there are batteries
inside but they now sit flush you've got
a new font and your buttons for your
classic a x y ND you can really feel the
rumble on both side the trigger buttons
now have a little bit of a stickier
action to them kind of got the xbox of
share buttons and the new Xbox button
right down there is going to launch xbox
live and of course the connection and
charging option there as well I've been
a really big fan of how the xbox
controllers feel on this one sort of
continues that feel feels really solid
at the hands trigger buttons are really
well placed the a XY &amp;amp; B buttons feel
really good as you're using it analog
sticks the four-way navigation
everything feels really really solid I
will say it as a compliment I guess to
Sony now the Sony controller feels as
the xbox controller so that was
determining factor free which one to get
twice as I'm concerned now both
controllers are a parody but this one
feels absolutely awesome it's got a very
natural feel my hand and it doesn't
weigh very much either six bucks wanna
be able to pick this up and of course to
the console itself sometime before any
holidays of this year I'm John rendering
