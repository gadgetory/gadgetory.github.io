to you by carbonite welcome back to
another episode of rumor roundup I'm
your host Jon wrenches the show we round
up all the rumors from the week of this
week we got a ton of good stuff we got
rumors of verizon's five-inch droid DNA
make an appearance that apple fire Scott
Forstall because he wouldn't sign the
Google Maps apology forget quad-core
that's so yesterday 48 core phones and
tablets are coming and the Nexus Q this
is a thing of the past jon rettinger
it's rumor roundup go ahead and get
started so let's start with the big bone
room or both literally and figuratively
we've been hearing rumors of an HTC may
droid DNA sometimes being referred to as
the droid DLX for a few months now it
looks like it is finally going to be
coming to fruition if you've been
looking at that galaxy note and thinking
either it looks awesome 5.5 inches is
too big or it looks awesome but i wish i
had HTC Sense and HTC's build quality
you are going to be in luck droid-life
earlier in the week found the droid DNA
name on verizon support pages and
they're not gonna support advice that
they're not gonna carry well it's not
always a sure thing it'll make it to
verizon's airwaves it is a pretty good
indicator that we can see it let me
refresh your memory from what this thing
is going to be packing it's going to
have a 1080p HD display an 8 megapixel
camera or possibly even 12 2 gigs of ram
quad core Qualcomm Snapdragon s4 pro
beats audio and Android 4.1 jelly bean
on board this guy is going to be packed
to the gills with awesomeness think of
this as the j butterfly but for the US
market earlier in the week Apple
announced that Scott Forstall was going
to be leaving out but what technically
is going to be an adviser to Tim Cook
but that's just code for we don't want
you to go anywhere else so we're gonna
pee gobs of money and stop doing your
job rumor has it that forestall the
brain behind iOS whose main software
engineer behind the operating system was
forced out because refused to sign the
maps apology that Tim Cook ultimately
signs refresh your memory with iOS 6
gone was Google Maps an apple unleashed
Apple
maps offering pretty awesome
turn-by-turn navigation was also met
with a great deal of warranty criticisms
because points of interest weren't there
landmarks were all wonky I think just
weren't working Apple products usually
do a few weeks later Tim Cook issued
public apology and Scott Forstall did
not issue an apology now rumor has it
that he told the folks at Apple this
Maps applications not ready to go quite
yet but Apple forced ahead with it
anyway if those rumors are true then
maybe he shouldn't have been forced to
apologise if those are not true then you
know the operating system is under his
watch he probably should have put his
name on it this might not be the worst
thing for iOS users they've been to
bring in a new engineer we're gonna have
Johnny I have sort of taking over some
of the software stuff so we should see
some new updates to iOS and my opinion
Scott Forstall suffers from what's
called the innovators dilemma the folks
at innovate first and really bring a
huge innovation to the world that really
change its way things are done I think
iOS certainly is sometimes fail to
innovate again or keep the innovation up
but eventually get passed by competitors
and I'm not saying iOS has been passed
by Android but in a lot of ways they're
on par and sometimes they go back and
forth depending on the feature you're
talking about so hopefully we will see a
fresh revamped iOS if anything it'll be
a new set of eyes looking at Iowa which
can only being good things for the
consumer so you know that shiny new quad
core dual core phone and got in your
pocket that you're super excited about
that thing is slow how about forty eight
cores coming sometime in the next ten
years computer world is claimed that
Intel is working on a 48 core chip
coming out in the next decade which is
absolutely insane you think about it the
reason quad core is faster than dual
core is all those processes can be split
up over more course imagine what 48
freaking cores can do it probably just
be smarter than us take over the world
it's our company called Skynet kill us
and it all would be started from like a
nexus phone play a super Nexus phone is
just to see if they can is a proof of
concept how many cores do we need and
today it's still just a phone it can
only play games so good graphic only
look so good going make phone calls so
well you know you can only do so much
with a smartphone but maybe in ten years
technology will change maybe I've
holographic displays and it can be you
know like we saw in Star Wars
delay a pop out of your phone asking
obi-wan for help you know who knows what
10 years gonna hold for technology but
it's awesome to see that trend already
starting and sort of see the work that's
going into it I hope computer world is
right and I hoped we could see a
forty-eight chords if nothing just to
say boom 48 cores my pocket what up now

jokes doc the Nexus Q was unveiled at
Google i/o and folks on attendance had a
chance to take one of those shiny little
round objects home and we were one of
the lucky few we plugged it into our TV
all excited and then realize yeah it
doesn't really do much apparently google
also realized it didn't really do all
that much and they postponed it and now
it's completely gone from the Google
landing page so what does that mean is
it gone what resurrect itself another
format I'm inclined to believe the
design that really cool global design
with the glowing LED light around it I
will make a comeback in some form but
the Nexus Q as we know it essentially a
way to get all the content from a google
play store in a television is gone it
wasn't much of a need for it with DLNA
gives you almost exactly the same thing
there was Google TV this is very much a
redundant product it looked awesome
crazy expensive made in the US but it
was absolutely a redundant product so
much as I hate to admit it probably good
riddance but hopefully that design will
somehow come back thank you for watching
