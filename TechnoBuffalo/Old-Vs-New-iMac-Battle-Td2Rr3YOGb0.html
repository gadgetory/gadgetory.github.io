technobuffalo here have a lot of
questions about the new imacs
particularly about the core i7 processor
the solid-state drive and whether or not
those upgrades are worth the price so
what I'm going to do is I'm going to put
it head-to-head with my older about
three and a half year old imac it's got
a 2.94 intel core 2 duo chip it's got
four gigs around was pretty loaded back
in the day the new one here's got a
intel core i7 it's got eight gigs of ram
and it's got a relatively new ati radeon
graphics card so sort of to keep things
fair the imac on the left has a fresh
install of OS 10 on it and the new imac
on the ride is still only about two
weeks old so pretty fresh first let's go
ahead and do a boot up and see if
there's any sort of speed difference
here I'm gonna go ahead and try and turn
both these on at the same time and see
if we can tell the difference alright so
they're both turned on
let's see if one boots quicker the imac
boots off its solid state drive not the
two terabyte spinning drive that has in
there as well all the operating system
and applications come from the hard
drive itself you can see differencing
the screens the screen on the imac on
the right the new one is much brighter
there it is already booted up ready to
go the imac on the left is still loading
this is one of the areas where i really
noticed difference is speed bin boot up
time the other area which i'll show you
is video import time is significantly
improved on the new imac on the older
outgoing model here if you want to
import a video that was say five minutes
into imovie and there it goes just
loaded that was about five minutes in
imovie the import time would take about
eight and nine minutes on the new imac
import a five-minute clip takes
generally about 45 seconds to a minute
so when you do as much video as i do
that time really adds up so those two
things i have definitely been worthwhile
video export time the difference is not
that much so exporting a five minute
edited in rendered clip in 720p would
take maybe about 14 to 15 minutes on the
outgoing model on the newer model that's
cut down by about four or five minutes
and generally would probably take about
seven or eight minutes to render so it
is definitely quicker art so you've got
both of them up here and loaded let's go
ahead and see how they do loading some
applications all rights we're going to
go ahead and launch some like
applications here and see if there's any
sort of difference one kind of funny
thing i'm giving this old imac to my
parents and you can notice they are
probably one of the few people in the
world that still use AOL like the actual
AOL software is what they're used to so
i did a fresh install i'll put this on
here for I just thought it's funny that
they're probably the four people on the
planet still using AOL so let's go ahead
and open up some popular applications
let's start with Firefox and do that on
each get it set right here in both the
same time we'll go ahead and see the
difference loading up the browser so
load it up certainly much quicker on the
newer imac still going here and now it's
done go ahead and quit
up quit it here too let's go ahead and
open one of the ilab applications let's
go ahead and launch something like
iMovie actually i did not install my
life on this computer for my parents
let's go ahead and launch any different
let's launch microsoft word which relies
on bit of older the Rosetta type
architecture let's go ahead and open
both of these see the tangy syrup
noticeable difference so immediately the
splash screen shows up much quicker and
now it's loaded here on a new iMac and
it's still loading on the older one
there goes and now it's loaded on both
go ahead and quit that let's go ahead
and try let's say one more application
let's try something simple like about
the calculator so actually not let's try
dashboard and see how quickly or slowly
something like dashboards get a load so
go ahead and grab it here are already
right here and we'll see if this is any
difference so about the same pretty
quick baggage this is a very
unscientific test early shows any
different students to computers I can't
tell you need to see it right here that
everything that happens on the new imac
is just faster the video rendering times
are really what was important to me
importing and exporting we came out a
video that idea being able to stay five
six seven eight sometimes upwards of ten
minutes per video putting up you know
two videos per day is you know 20
minutes per day really does add up
serving over the course of weeks and
months so actually having the space as
well you guys may have heard I've lost a
few external hard drives we mailed it
back up redundantly and I be able to
back up on the two terabyte drive here
and have a stored on external drive as
absolutely fantastic also a lot of
people have been asking to about the new
my Mac how it works and how it looks
with I'll go ahead move is right here
and how it looks with the solid state
drive and the built-in spinning drive I
think it shows up as two hard drives
there's one SSD and if you go to see
that right there that's where all the
applications are stored and there was
another one that I named internal what
really came completely blank had to
terabytes of storage on it and I just
been using it for for backup purposes I
don't open joy this comparison between
the two imax to see the difference for
my folks I think that the outgoing I'm a
can be fantastic it's going to be a
really fast computer for them for my
needs and certainly trying to get into
the Final Cut type things i think the
new imac is really going to serve me
well and i'm very excited to keep using
it and i guess i'm jon rettinger from
technobuffalo and i'll see you in the
next video bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
