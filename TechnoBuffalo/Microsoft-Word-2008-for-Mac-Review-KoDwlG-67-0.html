about Microsoft Word people are looking
for some more detail than I went into a
my review of office so I'm gonna go
ahead and do that for you guys and again
this is Microsoft Word 2008 I'm going to
go ahead and open it up for you
so what it does it pulls up a blank
document and uh notice this looks very
different than office 2007 you guys may
be using it looks more similar to office
2003 it doesn't have the ribbons at 2007
has so at the top you've got your
typical file information print print
preview all your edit stuff pastes copy
copy to scrapbook different views with
use for your toolbox so I'll show you
guys in a minute
things you can't insert youth really
insert anything it's very cool pictures
HTML that you've embedded so if you have
an embed code from YouTube actually
paste it right in there in a video will
show up it's very neat watermarks kind
of anything you want all your formatting
stuff is there choose all your fonts it
actually shows you what the font looks
like and text you know just have to
guess or select one and then type to see
some more tools thesaurus dictionary
track changes on your table information
window work help and over here is what's
called your toolbox I'll minimize these
for you guys here and what this has is
all your main controls kind of put in a
real easy place for you this is my font
box here so I've got bold italicized
strikethrough font color highlight all
that stuff styles I can choose different
styles alignment and spacing horizontal
all that kind of stuff
bullets and numbering
obviously that's pretty self-explanatory
choose your bullets whether you want to
indent left or right borders and
shadings very self-explanatory as well
margins control your margins document
themes you can choose different themes
now one really nice feature that war
2008 for Mac has is this little bar
right across the top here and what it
does if you click it opens a strip here
that gives you just really easy to use
templates so I see
her pages is the first one here I have a
ton of different cover page is selected
and I can just pick one and it'll open
up for me
same thing with table of contents
headers as well and footers everything
that you guys would need to write a
paper and bibliographies quick tables
same thing a list of more tables and
different designs you might like and
using them it's just as easy as clicking
it and I'll show you guys in a minute
they have just a ton of charts look at
that it's unbelievable I mean even get
this kind of chart filled radar it's
called and masked radar graphics you
guys even do org charts or hierarchies
meaning they got it all here hierarchy
list target list pyramid list and
WordArt what sets you actually do some
art with the actual text itself it's
very handy so let's go back to all and
the document elements go to cover pages
y'all pick one for you let's see I want
to use this one as my cover page if I
just select it shows up right here and I
can just click it and type whatever I
want nice and easy
quick tables insert quick tables charts
and again a lot stuff so it really makes
it nice and handy so me I'm do my table
I put in here you know is it just a
general overview guys word is just like
word on a Mac anything you type on your
Mac and you send it to a PC will open up
I've had any trouble and vice versa if
you save something on a Mac in Word and
try to open it up in Windows it look
exactly the same
it's totally cross-platform which make
things just much easier you know I can't
speak the same thing for neo office new
office that's the conversion issues but
again guys any anything that you kind of
do on a PC in Word will work well with
word 2008 no trouble and in the back the
other way so you stay up overview in
word hope was helpful to you guys and I
hope you're doing well wherever you are
at and I will talk to you guys soon and
