TechnoBuffalo I'm here in Mobile World
Congress in Barcelona Spain and I just
wanted to show you a quick comparison
video between this the g2 mini and this
the g2 which has my fingerprints on it
so quickly you can see obviously this is
much larger than the g2 mini as the
names imply - just a quick comparison
you can see the the screen sizes here
you also have 1080 on the right
obviously and then I believe 960 by 540
on the g2 mini different layouts - up
top here as I showed you in the
walkthrough video but you've got the IR
port in the 3.5 millimeter headphone
jack and of course on the g2 the 3.5
millimeter headphone jacks down there on
the bottom
next to the micro USB port but the
button layouts remain very similar
there's a different feel though you can
see this is the gloss you want it's got
my fingerprints on it but this is sort
of a plastic scratchy back to it also
the cameras going to vary this is going
to have either 13 or a 8 megapixel I
believe depending on the markets it
launches in and then over here you have
obviously a 13 megapixel with the OIS
this also has either an nvidia tegra 4i
or a Snapdragon 600 processor
I believe it's 600 there's there's
variations of it depending on LTE 3G and
obviously the four Tegra 4i but over
here we've got the Snapdragon 800 so
very different phones in terms of the
form factor but also the underlying
hardware but in terms of software LG
tells us that this is going to be
they're not limiting the experience so
you get quick memo and qslide you've got
Android 4.4 KitKat you've got the NOC
code feature a ton of other features
that you would have on a flagship device
and LG said that really this is going to
be a mid-market device that'll sell in
various parts of the world where maybe
it the LG g2 wouldn't sell particularly
as well or maybe that's just not the
game plan so the specs are gonna be a
little different a little lower and
mid-range as opposed to high-end but the
software is very much the same in case
just wanted to show
you the difference between the two
because the g2 is going to be sort of
the one of the bigger phones of the show
form LG in addition to the G Pro to any
case quick look here this is Todd
Hazleton from TechnoBuffalo stay tuned
for a lot of coverage we're going to be
running around from tons of events
during the show this week so just an
early look this is Todd Hazleton with
TechnoBuffalo</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
