from technobuffalo and today we'll be
taking a look at the izzy gadgets is you
slim for in one case for the iphone 5
and 5s if you love shooting with your
iPhone this is definitely an accessory
you don't want to miss out on so let's
take a look and see what it's all about
the Izzy slim case from izzy gadgets is
one of their newest all-in-one camera
solutions for the iphone which includes
three physical lenses that revolves
around the back of the case if you want
to elevate your iphone shots this is a
great accessory designed to make your
device even more powerful from the
get-go I was surprised on how great
these optics were the case itself with
these three revolving lenses may look
cheap but they don't disappoint at all
with the fisheye lens you get this
beautiful 180 degree field of view and
it's so wide that when you take a photo
your arms might show up in a shot that's
how wide it is in video mode that's no
problem what so ever since it zooms in
quite a bit you'll still have that fish
eyed look but not as drastic is with a
photo the next lens is the two times
telephoto lens which I don't really use
it all that often but it basically
magnifies your shop by two times and the
results I got were pretty good I did
notice that the specific lens is very
prone to lens flares and there's still a
little bit of distortion around the
edges of the photos but other than that
the optics are great and having that
extra reach for photos is always good to
have the last physical lens is actually
a two-in-one lens that sports a wide
angle that gives you an extra point 67
times field of view compared to the
regular lens on your iPhone and if you
unscrew the wide angle this is where
you'll get the macro lens so you can get
up close and personal with your subject
now talking about the wide-angle first
it's not as crazy as the fisheye but it
gives you just the right amount of field
of view in a photo for a beautiful
landscape photos it's not too wide and
the image quality superb with little to
no loss in quality and I could say the
same for the video when it comes to the
macro lens I'm really impressed with all
the shots have taken I'm a huge fan of
achieving that shallow depth of field
look and with the macro lens it does a
pretty respectable job it's obviously
not up to par would stand alone
enthusiast camera but the results I got
were pretty good for what it is you can
achieve macro shots like this and this
but the only downside with this is you
will have to be super close to your
subject about a millimeter or so a way
to get that sharp
and Chris photo now talking about the
case itself it's not the best it's made
out of plastic but it is twice as small
as the older is ii lens case the orbit
pro which is great but it's not the
easiest to use the openings for the
buttons and ports are too deep and
recess which makes it super hard to
access your ring vibrate switch volume
buttons and the sleep awake button the
LED flash is also covered up so if
you're thinking of shooting at night
don't even bother to shoot so to wrap
things up for you guys i'm giving it is
e slim case a TechnoBuffalo score of 8.5
out of 10 why because it offers four
amazing lenses at a pretty reasonable
price it's just a hundred dollars and
even though I'm not a big fan of the
case itself the optics alone makes the
izze slim case worth it anyways that's
it for this video guys if you guys have
any questions just let us know in the
comments down below and as always a
m√§rklin second from TechnoBuffalo i'll
