TechnoBuffalo here with the first look
for you at the Apple iPad 2 Smart Covers
let's see if this stands up one of the
most interesting things about the iPad 2
announcement wasn't the tablet itself it
was what's going to protect the screen
and that is of course these smart covers
let's go ahead and take a first look
they're going to come in a ton of
different colors in two different
fabrics we've got a red leather one
right here for the astronomical asking
price of $70 they also come in
polyurethane for the still astronomical
but slightly less so of price of $39
let's go ahead and open it up and see if
it is worth the money these things are a
little bit tricky to get out of here so
if you've ever used any modern
Blackberry you'll know that the magnets
that sort of going to the BlackBerry
case help unlock it so this is sort of
the same practice here of course is a
tab that I probably should have used go
ahead and keep pulling that there we go
and it just rips the plastic and it
opens right up and here we've got the
smart cover and what the magnet does is
actually wakes up or puts the device
sleep depending on how you're arranging
it so this has those two magnets that we
just talked about on the left and right
side and supposedly this is just going
to auto align when I put it right in the
left side of the iPad let's see if it
does indeed do that so here is the iPad
here are the magnets let's see if it
auto ends itself and it does it snapped
right in place covers it up quite nicely
the leather feels I'm not going to say
feels high-quality it feels like leather
it doesn't feel like anything terribly
fancy
it does just protect the screen it
doesn't add that much bulk let's see if
it wakes it up when we slide it off and
it did wake it and see if it closes it
or at least puts to sleep sort of hard
to tell if I put through this leap
around since you're covering it so you
can peek
under there and see so the screen is off
if you can see lift it up and then it
lights up kind of a kind of a neat trick
I suppose if you're worried about
security issues of someone waking up
your iPad there is a setting in there to
go ahead and turn off that functionality
there is also in every Smart Cover go
ahead and kick that background go ahead
and cancel
there is a microfiber lining to it so
actually it will sort of clean the
screen as you use it in terms slide it
what it does do in addition to
protecting the screen is also serve as a
stand so if we take this and we sort of
roll it up in a triangle we can go ahead
and prop it up now we've got a typing
service you can see it's a pretty decent
angle right there it's nothing that
giant probably about a 20 or so degree
angle I'll go ahead and bring the camera
down so you can see it a little bit
better so the Smart Cover can also be
used as a stand when you're watching
movies or looking at pictures or another
way to interact you do the same thing
that you're doing as if you're going to
type you sort of cold back into that
triangle format you could go ahead and
leave it there if you wanted to type but
if you want to watch movies you can
actually just sort of turn it and you
get that same sort of triangle prop that
we had when we were typing but now up in
landscape mode so you could watch a
movie or interact with the iPod fan what
you wanted to do how stable is it mmm
stable enough you could touch it but if
you put a lot of pressure on you are
definitely going to knock this sucker
over and see it from the side there as I
go ahead and push it'll come right back
down but if you give it a good knock
definitely going to fall over this might
be a good way to use FaceTime as well
you can sort of hold it up and you could
talk and do whatever it is you were
going to do if you didn't want to use
your hands while you are doing FaceTime
let's go ahead and close this back up
there's nothing revolutionary here with
the Smart Cover but it does have a very
high neat factor it's kind of fun that
it uses the magnets and it auto aligns
itself comes off very easily if you just
give it a little bit of a pull and if
you want to go ahead and put it back on
it just goes ahead and snaps right back
on very easily it is not
to protect the back of your iPad so if
you are the kind that likes to make sure
that everything is going to be well
protected this is not going to be the
best option for you however if you just
want to protect the screen and maybe
clean it a little bit when you open
close it you may want to look at the
Smart Cover certainly you're paying a
significant premium for the price of
these things especially the leather one
like we have right here the polyurethane
ones are a little bit cheaper but still
represent a significant premium over
traditional Apple cases and especially
cases that are going to protect the
entire device so how useful this is
going to be we'll see I'll give you guys
a full overview of it I've had a chance
to use it a little bit more anything
that you want to see about the iPad 2
