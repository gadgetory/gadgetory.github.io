welcome to my office
today's review is the Canon PowerShot
ELPH 520 HS let's find out if this
lustrous little elf has what it takes to
satisfy your point-and-shoot needs from
a design standpoint canon has done an
admirable job with this little elf I
really love the boxy design and it's
added this lustrous iridescent coating
that reacts to the sunlight the
PowerShot ELPH 520 HS is very compact
here it is next to an iPhone but aside
from it's beautifully glossy aesthetics
the Canon PowerShot ELPH 520 HS is
plagued by a few design flaws first off
the camera records two micro SD cards
now while that might be ideal for
smartphones and tablets etc it's really
not that ideal for digital cameras
especially users who already have built
up a library of the larger standard
sized SD cards they're now going to have
to buy an adapter and you're also gonna
have to buy new micro SD cards and
that's kind of a pain in the Kiester
secondly the battery on this camera is
very small it's about the size of a
single double-a battery with an 870
milliamp hour rating which is smaller
than most cell phones needless to say
and all of my testing battery life took
a tumble within about 30 to 40 minutes
depending on your usage this camera was
giving me the stage hook and lastly
Canon shuffled around the rear controls
and it's a lot less intuitive so it's
really not easy to make adjustments if
you're used to a standard 4-way
directional pad with set button in the
middle although the design suffered some
crucial ailments the interior of this
camera was spot-on
the menu system was fantastic the camera
features were great too and the most
important thing on this camera auto mode
was fantastic on the elf 520 HS Canon
actually expanded to predefined scenes
258 on this camera so that is a big
boost for the manual shooter there's
really not a lot you just have program
auto exposure and a bunch of different
scene modes and digital effects however
you can adjust the white balance the
ISO goes to 3200 and there's a long
shutter mode that allows you to go down
to 15 seconds for long exposure shooting
the 5 20 HS has a 12 X optical zoom lens
and that's pretty impressive given the
cameras diminutive stature now for image
quality this lustrous little elf has a
standard one over 2.3 inch 10 megapixel
CMOS sensor that employs canons HS
system high sensitivity which is
supposed to be better in low light
unfortunately in almost all shooting
environments this camera wanted to Jack
the ISO up and I noticed that the ISO
performance was not on par with canons
of yesteryear similarly priced power
shots that I've seen in the past granted
at the lowest ISO settings in bright
light macro shots this camera the the
images are beautiful but it's really not
that versatile you're gonna have to rely
on the flash it's gonna want to whip
that flash out in public like it's its
birthday every chance it gets the elf
520 HS also captures 1080p HD videos at
24 frames per second it could do 720p at
30 frames per second it has standard
definition and it also has super slow
motion but it's at super small
resolutions I experienced a similar
result in HD videorecording
low-light really took a hit and I just
expected a little bit more out of this
thing when it came to image quality for
the average user who's gonna post to
Facebook this is gonna be fine for you
but if you're really serious about
photography wait for the ELF 320 HS and
look to canons higher models like the S
100 overall I was a bit disappointed
with the Canon PowerShot ELPH 520 HS and
that's a rarity when it comes to Canon
cameras I don't like the micro SD cards
I don't like the short battery life and
I'm not a fan of the cluttered interface
on the back here the camera was a little
bit sluggish and I thought the image
quality could have been a bit better
especially when I compared it to the
canons of last year for the entire
review be sure to go to TechnoBuffalo
