from TechnoBuffalo and today we're gonna
be checking out the Withings activity
it's a Swiss made watch designed to
track your steps your calories burned
sleep and more it's basically a fitness
tracker in a form of a really beautiful
watch if you're not quite buying into
the SmartWatch market this might be the
next best thing so taking a quick look
inside the box now pulling this tab
reveals the Withings activity in this
brown calf leather putting the activity
to the side real quick we have two more
boxes which are the QuickStart guides
and certificate of authentication and we
have a plastic wristband if you want to
take this swatch swimming and track your
laps but you have to wait for a firmware
update this March in order for you to
track that we also have an extra battery
from what it looks like and what I
believe is the installation tool which
looks like a sim ejection tool now as we
said before the activity is a really
beautiful watch paired with a
high-quality calf leather strap that I'm
sure will look even better when it
starts to age it's protected by a
sapphire glass so even if you bang it
against the wall or table by accident it
should hold up that is of course if your
table isn't made out of diamonds the
watch is also water resistant up to 50
meters which means you can take it for a
quick swim or even into the shower
without worrying about getting it ruined
so let me set up the watch with my
iphone real quick and get back to the
video and tell you more about this
runner the winnings activity is not a
SmartWatch it's a watch that's just a
bit smarter it won't feed you
notifications but it'll feed you health
data like steps running calories burned
duration of sleep and so on you'll be
able to see all of your data through the
health mate app which is available for
iOS and is set to hit Android soon in
February everything connects via a low
powered Bluetooth connection and
everything happens inside the app the
setup process adjusting the time setting
an alarm and so on the exhibit a is an
on par with devices running Android wear
or even pebble but it's a nice
alternative if you're concerned with
tracking your activity it does however
have a dial that shows you how many
steps you have taken that day and will
fill up depending on what your goal you
set for yourself I probably said this
too many times already but it's not a
SmartWatch but a really good looking
timepiece that will feed you health
information on your phone so the upside
to this is that the battery life is
amazing whiffing says that the
will last about eight months before you
need to change it which is great the
downside to that is you'll have to keep
checking your phone for all of your
information so it's a bit of a trade off
now aside from tracking your health the
app also ensures you always have the
correct time no matter which time zone
you're in because the watch is connected
to your iOS device or Android device
it'll change the time automatically so
you don't have to so how much is the
wedding's activity it's definitely on
the pricier side coming in at $450 which
is available in two different colors
brown leather with white background and
a blue trim which we have right here and
the other which I'm a really big fan of
is the black and orange trim we're gonna
be putting the activity through its
paces over the next few weeks to see if
the smarter watch is worth the high
price tag I'm mark Alyn sangun from
