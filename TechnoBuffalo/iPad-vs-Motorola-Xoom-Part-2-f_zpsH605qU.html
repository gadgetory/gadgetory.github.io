know it from technobuffalo died upon a
motorola xoom the new google android 30
powered tablet from motorola and verizon
and i'm on an Apple iPad the first iOS
powered tablet from apple at this and
this is tablet wars
you
alright let's get these back up beside
we started on sorry about that ought not
to be confusing but anyway so the zoom
you're looking at 799 off-contract 599
with a two-year contract on verizon ipad
for the similar 32 gigs with 3g
connectivity and Wi-Fi you're looking at
729 off contract no contract at all
there's no contract with it you get the
data as you go and I may have misspoke
earlier or just to clarify it is
available through verizon but there's
not a verizon version yet that's verizon
3g compatible you can buy it through
verizon you get a my five with it you
get the Wi-Fi version with a mifi that
kind of thing but so through a TNC the
3g version 7 29 no contract verizon the
off contract price is 799 for the zoom
or 5 99 with a two-year contract now
verizon you know with the zoom a couple
things been mentioned about it's going
to be upgradeable to 4g within the next
couple of months and so you won't have
to pay extra for that although talk
about having to send the device in to
get upgraded that kind of thing we're
not going to it now we'll see what
happens with that but basically you know
folks from motorola have said that part
of the the price being a little bit
higher than ipad is because of the
upgrade ability to 4g so you know we'll
see also um you can use the zoom as a
personal hotspot as a Wi-Fi hotspot you
cannot do that with ipad unless you get
into jailbreaking which you know
basically we're not going to go into
that right now but you can jailbreak the
ipad you can root zoom to get and all
that kind of stuff but to kind of go
back you know those are kind of the
basic specs you know to me again at the
risk of repeating whistling the big
difference you know is the cameras and
the form factor and the cameras you know
we should see the new ipad should have
at least a front-facing camera the back
case facing camera Eiling is big deal
the front facing you know for video chat
i think is very compelling but otherwise
you know the form factor to me i just i
prefer the 69 widescreen on the zoom but
then you know just like with iphone vs
all the android devices most of it comes
down to the operating system the
ecosystem and it's a matter of personal
preference and so basically you know
with with the ipad you've got you know a
device that's been out
for a long time or it's a device that's
been out for a while now at a platform
that's been out for a long time and
you've got tons and tons of developer
support you know the the whole Apple
ecosystem with the App Store with itunes
with ibooks now you know and the nia
android which is really started to come
on strong and there's there's a big
argument to be made that you don't
necessarily need you know a hundred 200
hundreds of thousands of apps you just
need some you know a smaller amount of
quality apps but you know as these
things tend to go the more apps you have
the more quality apps you'll have that
percentage of quality apps is lower on
both platforms so in iOS you have more
choices more to sift through but
potentially more quality apps but
definitely the android market you know
we've seen some updates the android
market recently the web version of the
android market now is available which i
think is a big plus you know and on the
on the honeycomb tablet here on the zoom
you've got your books and your app
android apps inside of one interface the
interface you know looks pretty nice to
me it's kind of you got that similar
kind of vibe you know it's not like
Apple invented this but a similar vibe
with your featured apps kind of rotating
and then you know your grid below of
your choices I like though what Google's
done here you know make it a little bit
easier to read with the categories
they've got a separate category just for
for tablet apps and a couple of neat
tablet app CNN is a pretty nice app
pulse the algo down here to pulse I
already got rid of my notifications the
pulse RSS reader is pretty nice I think
pretty cool i customized it I've got my
um you know my tech feed my techno
Buffalo and gadget scatter tech kind of
a cool site some kids up and kids some
people have been Davis cool site nice
folks become friends with them so give
them a little plug then I've got my
sports my true hoop and my car blog and
stuff anyway and then you can actually
put in your facebook links down there as
well which is kind of fun but you know
similar apps obviously for for iOS
you've got more choices but just to say
that the android market definitely
coming on stronger so the whole app
thing isn't as big of a difference it
used to be still if you're into apps you
can have more choices with the ipad and
you know kind of the big-name app
generally are coming out sooner or you
kind of breakthrough out see what is
developing for the eye of the apple
ecosystem first in a lot of cases
because frankly there's more money to be
made that being said though android
market coming on strong and this you
know there's a flood of android 30
tablets coming out just announced and
trying to hit the market so we should
see a lot more with granado in the
future which kind of leads me to the big
thing about you know the platforms which
is basically just the approach to doing
things and it's very prototypical Apple
Google Apple very controlled the whole
thing through Apple you know you sink
the device through itunes you got your
Apple stores App Store itunes store for
all your media I books everything and
there's not a whole lot you can do
customization wise you know you can move
your apps around you can add web
shortcuts you can make folders now you
know but that's kind of it you can set
your wallpaper and your lock screen but
you're not going to do a whole lot
beyond then it's a very simple device
that's kind of a modal approach where
there is multitasking but it's really
kind of more like fast app switching
with some background processes but it's
it's simple to use and Apple kind of
pics the things that kind of curate for
you the thing depending on your
viewpoint they curate or they dictate
you know the things that they think most
people are going to want to do with the
device most of the time will trump the
brightness there and as you've got your
media controls and you've got you know
your your built-in apps that have
notifications and now they're opening up
background processes you can stream
pandora in the background that kind of
thing but you know it's kind of limited
to keep things simple and to keep things
kind of going you know from one to the
next with with a lot of control over
stuff with Google it's more like a
computer you know it's more like you can
do a lot more to customize it I mean
even if you get into the whole
jailbreaking and routing thing you know
there's a lot you can do the jailbroken
ipad there's more you can do with a
rooted android device if you really want
to get into you know cooking up custom
roms and all that kind of stuff but I
with Android you've also got the choice
of widgets and so I've got you know a
YouTube widget that's you know I'll kind
of a live active widget that I can scan
through i can add you know another
widget here so let's add the
let the books widget you know so these
kind of tiled things that are you know
to me the animations aren't as slick
they're not quite as polished as apples
but they offer more functionality and
then you've got down here you know your
notification system so i can see that
I've got a Twitter notification I've got
new mentions you know that kind of stuff
that's just a little more functional and
there's sort of more potential in terms
of using this thing like a computer with
the sort of computing you know multiple
things going on at once multiple apps
running multiple notifications multiple
windows all that kind of stuff little
more potential shown in honeycomb then
in iOS with iOS you know on the iPhone
on the ipod touch on the ipad it's apple
kind of pushing a new way of doing
things they're sort of new vision for
personal computing almost personal
versus you know kind of professional
getting work done computing on OS 10
except that Apple enthusiasts will argue
can get a lot done on ipad with all the
different apps that are out there now
which which is true on the I'll just
mention here on the zoom there's
actually no physical button on the on
the front android users might be a
little you know like where are the
weapons what's going on it's all down
here you've got three icons that are
usually available in any given time
sometimes you'll see a fourth you've got
back home and then you've got this one
that lets you flip through your your
recent apps and then up here you've got
your search your voice search you can go
straight to your app drawer that way and
then you've got your your plus button
that will take you to that customization
menu and i'll show you real quick voice
search because google voice search just
continues to impress me search for the
oldest marathoner ever search for the
oldest marathon or ever you know close
enough there is the oldest marathon
runner yeah there was a guy 98 marathon
her these marathon runners over 90 years
old men and women amazing anyway so you
know way too much to it was in one video
or even was turned into kind of a
part video in terms of really comparing
everything about these devices but
basically its shape enough to be very
similar to what's happened with android
phones the one thing I will mention is
that I'm very curious to see if
companies are going to start really
customizing Android 30 there's a lot of
potential here and frankly using the
zoom has been better than I thought it
was a little wary going into it oh I
forgot I'm starting to wrap up I forgot
i wanted to show you the virtual
keyboards here because I think that's
interesting all right so we'll call up
the keyboards here and you know pretty
similar in terms of you know basic
functionality basic qwerty boards with
Google you've got a couple extra sort of
settings buttons you got an emoticon
button you got that button to take your
and your input options and you've got
the voice search button and then they
added things like you know the virtual
the virtual shift lights and that kind
of stuff with the Apple keyboard you
know they kind of went simpler like
Apple tends to do and instead of return
they've gotta go button you know a
little again a little less geeky a
little more can mainstream consumer
friendly you're not saying one is better
the other but I found with the with the
zoom with the 10 inch widescreen display
it's still for me not the ideal touch
typing solution and kind of hard to do
here with the camera in the way i'll
move this back a little bit but i'm at
least able the quit while you know all
right so I it missed the sea I hit the
space bar instead and then you know
jumbo would instead of jumped but at
least able to do a facsimile an
approximation of a touch typing and then
if we go into into portrait mode much
easier for me to type with two thumbs
and you can see Google Instant work in
there
so a lot easier for me to type with two
thumbs because the wide screen screen
layout makes for a narrower device when
you hold it the long way in portrait
mode with the iPad I've found that I've
had the ipad you know basically since it
came out and I found I can't type touch
type style at all I can't even fake it
with the iPad it's just it's not big
enough for my hands and so I wind up
typing I wind up typing that well I'm
not in there's no space bar because I'm
underscore mode because URL anyway I
wind up typing you know with with two
fingers instead and then when i go into
portrait mode i can do the two thumb but
it's a little bit wider than the zoom is
you can see you know it's actually a
fair amount wider and so it's harder for
me and i have relatively big hands it's
harder for me to type with two thumbs
they have to stretch a little bit more
so you know that's that's where again i
think that the widescreen mode is
actually i think apple kind of messed up
here i think the widescreen mode is
actually better and you're going to see
you already have with the the t-mobile g
slate the optimist optimus pad from LG
you're going to see more widescreen form
factor Andrea 380 devices and different
sizes coming out and possibly you know
non widescreen as well whereas with iPad
you know you're pretty much limited to
what you know what you see is what you
get with one device unless the rumors
come true an apple introduces kind of a
a second sighs that sort of in-between
ipod touch and ipad like us 5 or 7 inch
screen i actually i haven't a barnes &amp;amp;
noble nook color which is android-based
it doesn't really runs a custom
operating system that's a smaller form
factor and i think that's actually a
really nice size for a tablet HTC's
flyer which is an android 22 device or
two dot 4 device rather not 30 that's a
7 inch screen i think that's that's also
a really nice size for a tablet but you
know different strokes for different
folks and that's one of the things that
android has going for it for sure should
also mention what i was starting to say
before is that i'll be very very curious
to see what companies
do as far as customizing the Android
experience so obviously Motorola just
chose to come out with stock and Renault
motoblur nothing like that on here with
LG it's similar except they added their
3d functionality with HTC you know
they've always done a lot of
customization with HTC sense I'm just
kind of show you some of different
things here while I'm talking and you
know they've got their new flyer their
first tablet which is an Android 2
tablet not Android three but a lot of
customization went into that thing and
you know that are really set it apart in
the marketplace when it comes to kind of
yeah the person who doesn't care what
the specs are they just kind of care
what it does so really looking to see
what companies will do with Android 3 I
think you can do a lot there's a lot of
power there especially with the dual
core optimization and again getting some
this is just rumor I'm just making
making stuff up on educated guesses but
I think you might see some interesting
stuff from Sony rumors come in that Sony
going to push out sony or sony ericsson
i'm going to push out am an Android
tablet probably three out of a tablet in
the near term and they've got a lot
going on with other entertainment
holdings as well as the whole
PlayStation Certified thing so we might
see something interesting from them then
you've got you know companies like asus
and acer at viewsonic and all these
different companies doing android stuff
so very interesting to see what what
happens in the coming months with that
you know android 30 and how that
progresses and how its customized by
different companies doing their own
thing and then of course to see what
Apple's got going on with ipad 2 and
possibly you know another device so um
you know as far as picking a winner I
mean it's hard to pick a winner you know
right now I would say if we were living
in a vacuum not worried about what's
coming you know down the pike if you're
into apps iPads got many more I would
probably go with iPad because the screen
is more sensitive more accurate brighter
a little bit brighter pops a little bit
more and then you've got all these apps
available and all the media through
itunes store anything like that on the
other hand a ton of potential going on
in honeycomb i find it a little bit
easier to type on myself and i love
front camera for video chat
functionality so you know but we're not
in a vacuum so you know catching up for
sure with apps and stuff coming out for
the dual core is a plus for the zoom
ipad 2 is you know literally less than
two days away it's a plus for Apple so
you know there you go it's hard to pick
a winner if I had to buy one of these
right now not worried about the future I
would go iPad but I was worried about
the future I would go zoom because this
iPads going to be outdated in like two
days and this thing is just getting
started and it's got more horsepower
underneath but you know we're not in a
vacuum so these are tough decisions
anyway we'll have lots lots lots more on
the zoom because John's got one and then
the ipad 2 coming out will full coverage
of that and everything over on
TechnoBuffalo calm and of course on the
on the youtube channel you know John's
got his thoughts i'll have my thoughts
will keep working on it there you go
till next time my name is Noah thank you
for watching this long long two part
tablet wars between the motorola xoom
and the apple ipad we'll see you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
