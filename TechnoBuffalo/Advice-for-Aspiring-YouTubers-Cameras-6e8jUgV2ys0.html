technobuffalo and today we're gonna be
talking about cameras example if you
missed out on my last two videos
covering basic audio and basic lighting
make sure you check out the links in the
description box there it's important
stuff like a lot of things with cameras
you kind of get what you pay for if you
spend a hundred bucks on a camera you're
gonna get a hundred dollars worth of
video capture quality now there are a
lot of things to cover about cameras not
to mention there are a lot of different
kinds of cameras and I'm gonna be
tackling this by making the two-part
video this is part one which you were
watching right now so for part 1 i'm
gonna go over some beginner cameras as
well as budget cameras and from part 2
i'm gonna go over some prosumer cameras
high-end consumer cameras and of course
DSLRs which i'm filming with right now
if you don't know what any of those guys
are then don't worry about it so let's
start off with the basic shall we
webcams webcams are pretty much as basic
as you can get and it's actually how a
lot of youtubers you guys know and love
today got started there's a very raw and
personal quality about webcams that just
can't be replicated with a higher-end
camera I guess you can say the
crappiness somehow makes it good or
unique at least these guys are usually
free if you have an Apple computer or a
laptop and the quality kind of ranges
depending on the manufacturer nowadays
you can even pick up 720p or 1080p
webcams which is what you're seeing
right now actually if you're planning on
saving for a camera there might be
selling for around one thousand dollars
are over and you still want HD video
until that time I highly recommend you
pick up an HD webcam remember content is
king the quality of the video is nothing
compared to the quality of the content
and having good audio helps which you
can record with a separate microphone
right here a massive downside to webcam
besides equality would be that you need
a computer to use it so you wouldn't be
able to film in certain locations unless
you have laptop handy with you next two
webcams would be cell phone cameras I
wouldn't have mentioned this before but
a lot of newer devices like the iPhone 4
supports 720p HD video recording not to
mention direct video editing and direct
upload to YouTube which is very nifty
personally I'd recommend to use a webcam
over a cell phone camera for recording
video simply because might be tricky to
stabilize a phone
filming unless of course you have a
special stand of some kind if you don't
the only option is to kind of hold the
phone in this kind of fashion while you
film which would usually result in shaky
video and I'm pretty sure a lot of
people would prefer to see no video
versus shaky video because shaky video
kind of makes you feel a little nauseous
while watching it's just nasty and oh
yes cell phone cameras are free that is
of course if your cell phone supports
some sort of adequate video recording
resolution preferably 720p HD that's a
good stuff next up digital cameras yes
these guys not a lot of people would
even consider making HD youtube videos
with these guys as the traditional
camcorder would come to mind first but I
would advise people to take another look
these guys are meant for point and shoot
photography you know like capturing
embarrassing pics of your friends then
sharing it on Facebook and whatnot the
cool thing about digital cameras would
be a lot of them have 720p HD video
recording these days and as you can see
I'm stressing 720p quite a bit because
people on YouTube they like HD what can
I say depending on how much you spend on
your digicam the quality can be quite
amazing with the proper lighting I mean
I'm shooting with one right now they
also have a lot of manual camera
settings that you might not find in
dedicated video camcorders such as ISO
aperture and shutter speed fancy
photography terms on top that these
sensors and lenses are sometimes larger
than that of their video captured
dedicated counterparts which definitely
helps with the video quality a major
downside of course would be that you
can't see yourself filming because the
screen is on the other side of the
camera sort of like what's going on with
the oh so popular flip ultra HD which is
a video camera sort of it's extremely
important to be able to see what you're
filming so that you don't accidentally
film with your head being chopped off
how are you supposed to know what's
being cut off this is tricky but I found
a neat little solution go to your dollar
store and pick up one of these mirrors
on a stand I use a tripod to film and i
highly recommend you do as well remember
the shaky video quality insulting an
almost all tripods you'd find this bent
used to lock in the camera what I do is
I pull it out mount the camera onto the
tripod then use a guitar capo which is a
fancy guitar term for a guitar string
clamp to clamp the mirror behind the
camera now through the power of magic
not really I can see what I'm filming I
mean you don't have to have a guitar
string clamp I just happen to have one
plus I didn't feel like buying any other
clamps you save money that way depending
of course on the brand of the digital
camera you can spend around a hundred to
five hundred dollars for one this guy is
the panasonic lumix head c7 goodness i
hate serial numbers and it cost me
around four hundred and twenty dollars
after taxes if you're planning on
picking up a digi camera as your main
camera i highly recommend you check out
something from the panasonic lumix line
or the canon powershot line well that's
it for today's video hopefully you found
this information helpful and if you plan
on picking up anything based on my
recommendations I highly suggest you do
as much research as possible before you
go out and you know five stuff if you
can buy your camera at a Best Buy or
something similar with a really really
good return policy you know just in case
you don't like the camera stay tuned for
the next video where cover camcorders
prosumer camcorders and of course DSLRs
this was john q from TechnoBuffalo and
