John Rhett enger' from TechnoBuffalo
here with an unboxing for you of the new
ps3 slim that is set to be officially
released September 1st so let's go ahead
and get started and see what we got got
a picture of the console on the front
with the sixaxis Dual Shock controller
down below letting you know this is the
120 gigabyte model right now it's the
only version that is available blu-ray
of course and PlayStation Network icons
coming out along the top got just the
ps3 logo on the back you've got some
game information some spec highlights
most of all stuff that people generally
know about the PlayStation play DVDs
little upscaling blu-rays it's got Dolby
Digital DTS Wi-Fi bluetooth HDMI USB
Java powered and DivX right out of the
box but that's not why you're here let's
go ahead and open this thing up and see
what we got I have not seen one of these
yet person so I'm kind of excited
we'll use the obligatory big knife here
to break the seal there we go
alright and let's open her up
I mean typical Sony fashion things are
packed in there nice and tightly booked
information how to guides probably
nothing that exciting I'll probably ever
read there is your dual shock sixaxis
love it or hate it that's the
PlayStation controller that you're used
to there's a blu-ray of some sort in
here
welcome to the PlayStation 3 and
PlayStation Network awesome I doubt
anybody ever looks at that Quick Start
Guide keep going down here in the box
probably power cords yep power cord if
they give you a mini USB cord for
probably charging the controller that's
nice of them got your standard set of
cabling with that sort of sony
proprietary port at the end and the
thing that we all want to see cables
side is the PlayStation slim itself I'm
really excited to see it so let's go
ahead and dig in and see what we got
take out of the box I'll tell you that
definitely feels much lighter than the
original PlayStation 3 the fat one if
you will the one that came out on a
launch day so go ahead and pull back the
wrapping and there it is the ps3 slim or
set off to the side we'll do a
walk-through for it and stick around for
future videos I'll do a full comparison
versus the ps3 fat I guess you can call
it now so here we got the ps3 console
zoom in just a bit so help you sing so
gone are the touch-sensitive button
these are actual buttons which is nice
for eject and power on you've got the
slot loading right on the top you've got
some ports down below this is actually
where the hard drive can be a user
replaced you can swap that out
relatively easily it will not void your
warranty you've got two USB ports pretty
standard for PlayStation 3s
on the back got where your power cable
goes in where that proprietary Sony
video cable goes you've got your ones a
optical audio HDMI port and your
Ethernet port notice that there's no
power switch on here like was found on
the ps3 fat it's all vents and you've
got sort of a matte finish on top with
the ps3 not the spider-man font that
said PlayStation 3 across the top I
guess they did it because you couldn't
see the PlayStation 3 lettering once the
console was sold so just a quick
unboxing hope you enjoyed stick around
I'm gonna have a few more PlayStation 3
