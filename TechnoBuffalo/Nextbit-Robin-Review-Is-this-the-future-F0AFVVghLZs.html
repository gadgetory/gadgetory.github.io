since I started here TechnoBuffalo it's
the first device that I've been really
really excited to get in to review and
that's not just because they have a cool
novel way of storing your information in
the cloud it's also because it's the
first device that really has a chance to
make it add a Kickstarter alive and not
fall flat on its face
so with that in mind I've got some good
news for you they did it I think it's
not perfect there are some issues with
it but because of the price and the
execution on a number of the things
about it it really does make it the
phone to beat in the price range if you
want to know why let's go find out
alright rope the differentiating factors
here why is the Robin even difference
why should you care about it the OS is
supposedly intelligent which means it's
going to want your behavior it's going
to intelligently mark the photos and
apps that you use the least so that they
can be archived into the cloud when your
phone runs out of space those are going
to be the first ones to go if you don't
want something to get archived you can
just pin it to your device by swiping
down on the home screen if you ever need
one of those apps again you just tap on
it and it goes from black and white to
color while it downloads and re set up
from the cloud but you don't even have
to worry about anything else other than
that everything's still intact
all your data is still there you're
still logged in to all your services the
only thing the next bit is doing is
archiving the apk from the device now
there's been a lot of chatter about
whether or not this is ultimately a
useful feature lots of people are saying
data consumption accessibility while
you're offline device performance these
could all be problems but you know what
in practice it totally works it's not
something that you're gonna use every
day but it totally works if we're being
perfectly honest alone another I'm not
sure that this is the right solution to
the problem of limited space in our
pockets look it's clever
it's demonstrative of what next bit is
capable of but I'm confused as to why
anybody needs more than 32 gigs on a
mobile device to stay anyways that said
I get it I see what they're going for
it's just I'm not sure that this is the
best way to solve that problem
either way they needed something to
differentiate themselves and that is
exactly what they did the Robin is
completely different from every other
device that you can find on the market
that's not just because of how it's been
made it looks different it feels
different the OS feels that it feels
like a device that was made for the
consumer not for the manufacturer I have
not fallen so so hard for a device and
really what feels like years the 5x did
a pretty decent job of imitating the
Nexus 5 but that special feeling that I
had when I felt the original Nexus 5 in
my hand this is the first time I felt it
replicated since the Robin just feels
great in the hand
keep reaching out to pick it up just to
hold it again that the case is
polycarbonate super soft touch the
colors are super striking and each and
every single little individual tiny
element on the exterior the device feels
like it was put there to be looked at I
gotta be honest this is the best device
that I have felt in my hand to date
since starting a TechnoBuffalo the build
is just phenomenal the performance was
actually really really good too I didn't
expect to too much it's only a
Snapdragon 808 onto the hood but it is
on par with with this past years but OS
and it even performs better than the
Nexus 5x believe it or not you are gonna
get occasional stutters if there's
something crazy going on playing a game
something like that but it never really
harsha's the experience so much that I
was upset by it never locked up never
rebooted and it has been handling my
gaming habits with absolute ease the
screen on the next bit Robin is fine
it's not amazing but it definitely gets
the job done the colors are a little bit
washed out black seemed a little bit
more like purples but it's a 5.2 inch
display at 1080 so the pixel density is
nice and high in that 5.0 inch size
means it's in my Goldilocks zone in
terms of form factor for the hand then
there's the major problem of outdoor
visibility which is pretty darn poor on
the Robin as I mentioned at the top of
the video look this thing isn't without
its faults and this is definitely one of
the places that it falls a little bit
short this is one of the few times that
I can justify making an exception for
some below average components in favor
of putting a lot more stake in what the
device actually stands for and
represents well I am super super
impressed that next bit was able to get
marshmallow on the Robin for launch I'm
kind of confused about some of the
software choices they made the the
implementation of the features that they
need in the homescreen seems really
really kludgy and I'm not sure why
there's a floating action button there
just taking up space seems to me that
they could have just as easily kept the
app drawer and used a long press or a
swipe on the effort to get the
functionality that they needed for the
custom features that they built into
Android the battery life on the next bit
Robin was just barely above average I am
totally able to make it through a full
day no problem I said more than enough
juice in the tank by the end
and yeah I'm using this for gaming and
using it for email music connectivity
you name it so the battery is totally
able to stand up to a full day if you
want to stretch it to two days you could
probably get away with one and a half
the camera is also one of the things
that I think Falls a little bit short
the front-facing ones really bad it
doesn't do very well in low light at all
super super grainy if you're gonna use
your front-facing camera for things like
snapchat you're probably fine but don't
expect to be taking anything
groundbreaking on the front facing
camera the rear facing camera is sort of
a similar situation does not perform
very well in low light and the software
just kind of can't keep up that send
expert has said that there are fixes
already on their way so here's hoping
that this gets fixed in the very very
near future at the very least just like
with the home screen nothing that
they've added to Android here gets in
the way of anything else working you
absolutely still can't use Dropbox or
cool photos to backup your images no
problem
I'm holding out hope here that X against
their camera up to snuff because I
really want to love this device but
without an above average camera I can
only really like it the Robins
grassroots heritage really makes this a
truly historical debut for the industry
next fit has shown us that yes a ragtag
group of folks can get together decide
they want to take a device to market and
just ship a device that meets then in
some cases exceeds expectations for
those that they set during their
Kickstarter campaign we've seen a number
of failed devices in the same vein but
this is the first one to really really
knock my socks off it's not perfect
absolutely not and yes the space that
it's entering is really rather crowded
these days lots of big companies with
very affordable devices that have great
pedigrees on the market right now but
the Robin does do enough I think to
separate itself in that sea of options
if this is what next bit has to offer on
the Robin end of the spectrum I cannot
wait to see the Batman 2 next bits Robin
beefy specked out monster of a device
that they could put together with the
same kind of design language and
philosophy I can not wait let me know
what you guys think about next fit and
the Robin in the comments below I know
that some folks especially some of you
specifically in the comments have been a
little bit down on the idea it doesn't
do enough to differentiate itself the
colors are weird why is this fun even
cool or important well hopefully now
that you've seen this review some of
those questions are answered for you so
again let me know what you think down in
the comments below thank you guys so
much for watching and I'll catch you in
the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
