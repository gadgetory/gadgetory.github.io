and there's no real reason for it other
than just to say thank you from really
just the bottom of my heart I've said
this in my video announcing the contest

channel layout next week so in order to
preempt it and I was saying what my
channel looked like before YouTube just
did it I transitioned over
today so I'm still getting used to it

of it but hopefully with time I'll get
used to it like you guys will anyway I
