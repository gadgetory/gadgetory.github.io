technobuffalo here with a my gear
store.com unboxing it's been a while
since we had one of these my gear store
calm is one of the leading mobile
accessory sites out there so for iphone
blackberries and all that stuff and they
are always overly generous with sending
stuff to review unbox and check out so
without further ado let's go ahead and
bust into this package I have no idea
what's in here what they send is always
kind of a mystery which makes these sort
of funds unboxing generally I know what
to expect so we'll use the obligatory
big ol knife to cut into this I know one
of these videos I'm going to slice my
finger huh but at least we'll have a
captured for posterity open it up there
we go all right let's see what we have
some packing a lot of tech well looks
like they really hooked it up this time
we've got an eye skin case for the
blackberry storm its the vibes model so
that looks really nice definitely has a
can see the colors on the back it
protects the back of it and has a little
bit of a lip that comes out so if you
drop it it's not going to land right on
the screen so that's great for the
blackberry storm the branching out into
caring really not just iphone stuff
anymore so here is the incipio feather
case people are real big fans of these
they're lightweight they're very durable
and they just seem to be very popular so
I'm looking forward to giving this one a
whirl look at that they were nice enough
to send it incipio feather for the
blackberry storm as well sort of does
the same thing as the one obviously for
the iphone let's keep digging in and see
what we got chill pill mobile speakers
that's kind of cool compact expandable
rechargeable in any of the stuff here
you can definitely see on my gear store
calm and if you use the code John for
lakers you will get a discount built-in
magnetic
lock secures speakers together
retractable USB cable when not in use
twist to expand each speaker for bigger
bass and overall sound kind of neat this
looks like it could be a fun review and
separate unboxing and a lot of this
stuff is going to make for great
giveaways coming up so we've got the
trex the case I believe this is for the
iphone 3g it's the maya and it is a
thick as a flip-up case and a lot of
people tend to really like these another
one by Trek stuff this looks like it is
a slide in case click your iphone 3g or
3gs two slides right in there open here
to view the product take a look at that
let's keep going man there's more stuff
here they've really really hooked it up
so another color of the tracks the case
slide your phone right in you can see a
little diagram right there how that
works we've got more the tricks to see
though this is a typical slide in with
belt clip and this is for the iphone 3g
as well i like how you can open all
these up and see what the product looks
like you can slide on and off the belt
clip this might be a possibly a nice
case to give my dad he loved having the
iphone on his belt keep moving along
here we've got the sonics 3 headphones
for looks like for the iphone because
they've got a built-in mic this will
probably work with any phone but
certainly the day mentum to be used with
the iphone it's like a really nice pair
of headsets be great you're the ones
that come bundled with a lot of the
phones but the mics aren't that good but
the guys at my tears where i said these
work quite nice i'm looking forward to
giving them a whirl and if we keep
exploring we've got to the trek steh
leather sleeve for the macbook 13 inches
actually feels really nice i'm always
looking for new sleeves for the macbook
and i know that these come in different
colors well if red is not your thing
again definitely check out my gear store

rested any of the stuff or some of the
other products that they have anyway
