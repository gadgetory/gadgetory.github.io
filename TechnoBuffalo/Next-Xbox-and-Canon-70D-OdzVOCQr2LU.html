to you by audible welcome back to their
pursuit of a rumor roundup I'm your host
Jon wrenchers to show retic all the tech
rumors from the entire internets and
combine them smash them so up this week
the next Xbox allege iPad 5 pictures are
showing up Nokia's getting ready to
unleash a Lumia 928 on verizon and
cannon is getting ready to unleash the
70d the successor to the widely popular
60d so let's go ahead and get started
this is rumor roundup may 21st to
Tuesday where Microsoft is going to
reveal and I quote the very first
details on the next Xbox along with what
lies ahead for 2013 as of now the event
will supposedly take place in a smaller
venue to focus on a more intimate
experience with more information set for
e3 in June Bloomberg on Monday connects
xbox gonna use AMD system on a chip that
combines the Jaguar central processing
units with graphic chips so if this will
follow sony's lead and make developing
for both consoles and the pc super easy
so once the next xbox does drop it
software we based on wait for it windows
8 I like Microsoft to essentially unify
its menu products and services around
the board perhaps could be the merger of
PC and console gaming or at least
perhaps bridge that gap a little bit
more but we'll know what's going to
happen and hopefully just a few short
weeks the ipad 5 has gotten all pictured
and naked showing itself to have a
thinner side bezel it something I'm
trying to get by going to the gym my
side bezels got a little chubby there's
not really much that you can tell from
it but if you look just close enough you
can see the side bezel looks inner then
on the fourth generation model or expect
it to be thinner overall more powerful
industrial design that resembles the
ipad mini a little bit more on the
current generation ipad so to round out
cannons new lineup of DSLRs the company
is supposedly has an upcoming event
lined up where it's also gonna show
these 70d so according to canon rumors
the long-awaited 60d successor will make
its official debut on april twenty third
which is only a few short weeks away so
we really don't know that much about the
six tds big brother
early leaks though suggests the cam
would be a big step up to the previous
generation so as I get closer to the
april twenty third event hopefully we'll
hear more about what canon has planned
so we are hearing rumors that the
upcoming supposed 928 new lumia devices
going to be coming in white to verizon
so from a spec standpoint we're
expecting a 4.5 inch screen a Carl Zeiss
camera probably in the 8 megapixel ish
reason also note though that the nokia
is going with the Xenon flash on a Lumia
928 instead of the dual LED flash on
i-20 so there's still no word on when
the phones gonna launch or even be
announced or the leak suggests it'll
happen in the very near future so a new
Lumia phone have you been waiting on
verizon to get some Lumia 920's action
