rettinger Wolf Eyes episode of ask the
Buffaloes to show where I sit my butt on
this comfy couch we talk about tech I
try to answer your questions about
phones tablets anything in between and
sometimes even oddly medical questions
let's go ahead and jump right into the
first one comes from twitter at dizzy
vulture asks at john for laker so the
upcoming Samsung Note 5 be based on the
same edge concept thoughts I think that
the galaxy note5 they're going to take
design cues from the galaxy s6 I mean
it's going to look probably like a
bigger version of that with an S Pen
suppose it'll auto ejects oh to be a
cool feature those you holding out for
the next note edge I don't think we're
going to see an actual note at group
we're going to see is a galaxy s6 edge+
sort of just a different name for what
ordinarily would be called Note edge
very confusing so the moral is we're
going to have one note not an edge
version but we're going to have multiple
s 6 edges so I think rid of the s6 edge+
maybe that's called the s6 plus it's
going to have both curved edges and
probably only 5.5 inch screen so well
out the samsung phone still yet to come
this year next question comes from at
gold d ijk who asks at john for lakers
how do you think apple will implement
force touch the next iphone will it be
thicker non physical home button i do
think the own button is going bye-bye
but I do not think it's going to happen
this Jenny think it's going to be a big
change for the iphone 7 I don't think
force touch you can make the phone any
thicker at all either link for stretches
give another way to interact with the
device and I think when we saw iOS 9 so
the multitasking inside that show the
way it's going to be work so four sites
are gonna be another button essentially
be able to hold down to move things
around you can saw you can move the
cursor and on the iPad and that's how
you built interact with the OS also I
don't think we've seen all that iOS 9
can do it out wager for sex are going to
be a big issue i'm i'm thinking maybe
something similar to the android menu
button we get serve another contextual
options to click through but you know
we'll see in a few months next question
comes from extra buist 2s at john for
liquor is using the oneplus one with the
oneplus to create a lot more interest in
1 plus as your even casual consumers
non-techie a lot of a lot of 1 plus i
yes if they keep the price point low
that was really the big appeal behind
the original one plus one that you're
getting slapped chillax yep specs
at an entry-level press release or entry
level for a phone that was spect the
same way they can get the same thing
with the 1+2 I think it's going to
appeal to absolutely everybody now
you're not going to see a 1 plus 2 in
care your store think it's still going
to be sold the same way probably anybody
system sorry for that no it's annoying
but its way for the company to save
money and they are a start-up but i
think that the interest in the company
grew over the first device thing it's
going to only grow exponentially over
the second device we already know some
cool things about it it's going to use
USB see it's going to have a larger
screen I would wait it's going to be a
2k screen but now we're just
interpreting down now until we get to
know everything then 1 plus 2's offer
I'm excited I loved original my plus and
last but not least sweet almond joy asks
some more of a man's man myself but at
jump for lakers how his project 5 been
working you think that'll be a deal once
it's public so product Phi has actually
been awesome pricing aside I still think
the data ten dollars per gig is
expensive but it's working absolutely
incredibly I'll give you two a case
study we took the train up to a leg to
go to e3 we're in the train station I've
got verizon a ralph who's with us had
AT&amp;amp;T and inside a trans-asia neither of
us had service livin though had his
project five device which again jumps in
between Wi-Fi and Sprint and t-mobile
and he had three bars of 3g service
people make phone calls and such that we
couldn't do if Matt standpoint I just
working really well one of the concerns
I had was how I was going to handle the
Wi-Fi handoff to go to cellular no issue
with that at all either that's been
seamless call quality has been great
it's work as well as expected in fact
didn't even notice anything going on
with it you don't notice how the handoff
happening it just works well so I think
once it becomes more mainstream you
thinking about jumping into it you might
want to really really consider it before
in the video i wanted to talk about this
guy in stir limited edition
