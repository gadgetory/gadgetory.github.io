TechnoBuffalo and this is a look at the
hardware on the issues UL 30 BTW this is
the laptop that claims to get up to 12
hours of battery life by using two
different GPUs one to save on battery
and one to give you kind of power for
gaming and that sort of thing we're
going to talk about battery life in the
next video but right now we're going to
go through the hardware talk about build
quality wait and that sort of thing so
the laptop is about 3.7 pounds it's a
very lightweight and it's extremely thin
especially right at the front it's less
than an inch thin and it feels actually
about the same heaviness of most
netbooks that I've lifted up and felt in
the past now the lid is made to look
like brushed metal although it isn't
brush metal as you can see that in the
lights a very nice texture but
unfortunately picks up fingerprints very
easily if I kind of tilt the laptop you
can kind of see some fingerprints up
here and I've tried to wipe these off
before filming but they wouldn't come
off I think because of the texture may
require some more agitation so that's
unfortunate that the lid picks up
fingerprints so easily let's take a look
around the device and see sort of the
ports that the UL 30 BTW has so here on
the side we have a vent for cooling we
have a vga display connector also an
hdmi connector which is nice and here's
a USB connector one of three on the
front we've nothing except for four
status lights one of them is for hard
drive ones for power ones for battery
and i think the other one is for
wireless they're all not illuminated
right now and again the front is very
very thin and this is a good opportunity
to show how thin the screen is using the
LED backlight they're able to make the
screen extremely thin it's just a few
millimeters thick as you can see there
which is quite nice and I think helps to
save a lot on weight going over to the
other side we have a multi card reader
here so you can pop that out and put in
your memory card from your camera we
have a headphone jack microphone jack
two USB ports a jack for networking and
this one is for charging all the way on
the right
so let's open up the laptop and see sort
of what's inside and talk about the
keyboard in the touchpad okay so here we
are inside and as you can tell by the
reflection over here the screen is
extremely glossy and I haven't taken
this outdoors yet but I'm assuming it
doesn't have good outdoor visibility
because of that the screen is 13 inches
diagonal actually 13.3 to be exact the
resolution is 768 down and 1366 across
so not the most high resolution but
certainly good enough we've got a point
three megapixel webcam at the top with
an integrated microphone so you can do
skype calls and that sort of thing
moving down to the bottom we're going to
see that this really shiny material kind
of continues all the way down into this
area and that's sort of unfortunate i
found this device to not only be a
fingerprint magnet but also a dirt and
debris magnet so I've got little hairs
and dust bunnies and things on this
already from one day of use that I
didn't even know I had in my environment
when I was using it fortunately it's
pretty easy to clean off but you're
going to be cleaning it off a lot if you
get this laptop so down here on the
palmrest we see this reflective material
then we see the touchpad in the center
which has an interesting sort of dotted
texture to it and some people were
saying that they didn't like how that
felt but frankly I like it the reason
that they made it this dotted pattern is
so that if you're trying to feel quickly
for the touchpad you don't get confused
of where it starts and where it ends
since it's totally flushed down here
which is actually quite nice it's a
multi-touch trackpad so you can do the
two finger scroll you can also do some
other gestures we'll talk about that in
a future video now let's get a little
bit closer to the keyboard so the
keyboard is a chiclet style it's a
little bit louder than the standard
chiclet so i'll type for a second which
some people may find gratifying some
people may find annoying I frankly like
the cliq enos of the keyboard really
makes me feel like I'm actually typing
something in the upper left corner we
have a button that will switch between
the two GPUs one for power and the one
for power savings all the way over to
the right is the power button that
illuminates blue then we've got some
standard function keys within the
keyboard that you would expect on a
laptop like brightness and volume and
quick
access to switch on a projector or an
external display and overall the build
quality on the asus UL 30 VT is quite
good it feels sturdy it doesn't have any
weird creaking that's going on it
doesn't feel like it's going to break if
I pick it up the wrong way and of course
this is going to possibly change this
opinion as I get to use it more and
we'll do a follow up video after the
next video to talk about build quality
and how it's actually holding up so
we'll be back soon to talk about
software and the speed in the
performance and battery life on the asus
UL 30 VT that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
