from TechnoBuffalo and today I'm very
excited to be coming to you guys from
the iPhone 7 plus we're going to be
doing a camera test to see whether or
not the iphone 7 camera lives up to all
the hype and if the iPhone 7 plus is
worth your extra money and if that extra
camera really is all that Apple is
saying it is so the first and probably
most important thing to cover in this
video is the dual lens camera setup and
how it works now this may seem very
straightforward and you might think you
know it but trust me it's more confusing
than I first thought
it's not just two lenses that you can
switch in between it's actually a third
virtual lens if you will that's taking
the picture what I mean by that is very
few photos maybe one or two photos you
take will be taken solely with the white
England or the telephoto lens the
majority of them will be a combination
of both Apple software is pulling from
the telephoto lens and from the
wide-angle lens
whether it be exposure highlight data
detail all sorts of stuff to give you
what it thinks is the best combination
of both world the term used
computational photography now Apple did
not dive into any of this during their
keynote all the information we're
covering is based on as much information
we've been able to gather through other
people's tests and our own tests in our
own usage so one of the few times you
will be using only one lens with the
iPhone 7 plus is when you're using one
time zoom standard wide-angle shot
you're using the 28 millimeter lens that
is both shared on the iPhone 7 and the
iPhone 7 plus 9 times out of 10 you'll
be getting exactly the same image when
taking a photo at a 1.5 times zoom or
1.7 times zoom basically anything
between one in two times zoom the iPhone
7 plus is going to be actually using its
wider angle lens digitally zooming in
and then adding in more digital
information that's pulling from the
telephoto lens so it's not actually
zooming it's moreso creating the effect
of zooming and through some trickery is
yielding a slightly more detailed image
than the iPhone 7 in practice it did
yield some better results however I
wouldn't say their head and shoulders
above what the iPhone 7 is putting out
with digital zooming and I don't think
it was very consistent either there were
some circumstances
photos looked identical but this
mountain shot for example makes a good
case for the seven-plus and this makes
sense given that the wider angle lens is
faster in terms of its aperture and also
has a is built-in so in a lot of
situations the iPhone is going to be
leaning on that camera
more so than it would lean on the
telephoto lens which is a 2.8 aperture
and will take in less light and also
does not have oh is and speaking of OIS
there is no OIS on that telephoto lens
this is a huge problem and something to
be aware of when going to a two time
zoom for example and running around if
you're doing video or photo you are way
more likely to get blurry shots and I
found that happening to me a lot this
becomes even more pronounced when
shooting in low-light because the F 2.8
aperture is slower on the telephoto lens
compared to the wide-angle lens the
iPhone is going to be doing a decent
amount of work with that wide-angle lens
and then digitally zooming in trying to
add some more detail back in the end
result is usually you'll have a mixed
bag in some photos you'll have the
iPhone 7 and the iPhone 7 plus putting
out the exact same low-light images with
the same amount of noise and same amount
of detail in other situations you'll
have the 7 + resolving a little more
detail but you'll also have it resolving
more noise which is clearly coming from
the telephoto lens of course I don't
mean to sound as though I don't
appreciate the telephoto lens in all
honesty in my regular usage if I wasn't
pixel peeping it was really nice to have
a two time zoom and I got some really
unique shot but I wouldn't have gotten
with that standard wide-angle lens when
you dive a little bit deeper it's a
little bit surprising how often the
iPhones actually leaning on that
wide-angle lens rather than using the
telephoto when you think you might be
all this means is that with a standard
iPhone 7 you're going to be getting in
my opinion about 60 to 80 percent of the
results and the value in the photo
quality that you get with the 7 plus
it's not leaps and bounds above the
iPhone 7 the 7 plus is not 2 times
better because it has two cameras but
this was purely in my usage if you take
a lot of daytime photos that are
perfectly lit and you want that to time
zoom option you're going to be using the
heck out of that telephoto lens but if
you're not in those ideal circumstances
for example if you're in low-light and
you're trying to use the 2 time zoom
don't bother with the iPhone 7 plus
because you're going to be using digital
zoom
anyways since the wider lens has a
better wider aperture to take in more
light so the iPhone is going to
prioritize with that one because it
prioritizes exposure over sharpness so
it won't be using the telephoto lens at
all in that scenario at the event Apple
announced that they have a portrait mode
something we've seen to huawei p9 so
this isn't some new revolutionary
technology it uses a depth sensor by
using both lenses to then create an
artificially blurry background
resembling a depth of field effect that
you get from a lot of DSLRs we got to
try it out in the beta version so
there's going to be some issues but the
results were pretty good the camera does
guide you step-by-step telling you to go
closer further away from your subject if
there's issues so it's not going to be
some quick way to snap a picture and get
amazing results just bear that in mind
but the results are pretty solid when
they do come through the blurs are
gradual they look very realistic I did
notice when taking a bunch of photos in
a row very quickly the portrait mode
wouldn't always work and sometimes you'd
be left with a normal background however
in one or two photos it would fix that
and then blur the background for the
next photo so just be sure to take your
time when using this mode so far this
could just be for the beta and when it
goes to full release we may not see
these issues
additionally the portrait mode only
works by using the telephoto lens you're
not going to be getting any wide-angle
shots it also really struggles with
low-light you actually need a lot more
light realistically you're only going to
be able to use this outside when it's
really bright out or if you're in a
really well-lit room and so that's
really the camera situation on the
iPhone 7 and 7 plus let me know what you
guys think in the comments down below do
you feel the 7 pluses leaps and bounds
ahead of the 7 if you were in the market
which one would you get I'm very curious
to hear if any or neither give us a
thumbs-up if you liked this video hit
