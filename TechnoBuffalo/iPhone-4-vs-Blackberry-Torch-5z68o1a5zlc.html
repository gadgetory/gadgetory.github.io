TechnoBuffalo here back with another
smartphone smackdown this time it's 218
T exclusives the Apple iPhone 4 and rims
blackberry torch we're going to put
these two head-to-head in a brutal 10
round series and see who comes out on
top
the most difficult part of these
smartphone smackdowns are picking the
categories that are best going to
encapsulate the phones with the interest
of brevity these videos can get quite
long so picking really the categories
that are both going to show the positive
and negatives of each phone is the most
difficult so in this edition we have ten
categories we're going to cover cult
quality reception browser email UI
navigation text input speed screens apps
and battery life if we're going to
extend this a little bit farther we
would have covered multimedia and
notifications with who will touch on a
bit in the UI aspects of the review so
let's go ahead and get started probably
most important aspect of a phone call
quality if the phone doesn't sound good
it's not going to be much use to you
antenna gate aside when you're making
calls on the iPhone zooming up case
you're not having antenna issues the
call quality has been very very very
good I've got a clear coat on my iPhone
4 so I've never really had any antenna
issues since I've put that on call
quality had actually been outstanding
it's crisp it's clear I have no white
noise crackling on my end
colors on the other end port note white
noise or crackling on there and either
and volume is quite loud on the
blackberry torch call quality was not as
good as I would expect it you guys know
I test a lot of phones assess a lot of
AT&amp;amp;T phones and it was not as good as
some of the other 18 t phones I've
looked at including the iPhone 4 which
are comparing it to send some captivate
and a few others it was a little bit
tinny I had some popping noises on my
hands and colored reporter hearing the
same thing often times I was asked if I
was on speakerphone
I even though I wasn't that was
infrequent but it did happen about 10 to
50 percent of the calls that I make
using the blackberry torch I generally
don't include call quality part of these
smartphones smackdowns cuz usually
they're all very good but this time I
thought it was really important to bring
that up when talking about the
blackberry torch so around 1:00
predictably is going to go to the iPhone
the next most important feature of a
phone is reception
call quality aside you're not getting
reception it's not going to be that much
used to you the iPhone 4 reception is
tiddly strong generally wherever I go in
my area I get about three bars to four
bars of 3G service on the blackberry
torch or wherever I went I had full bars
of 3G service if I take my iPhone
forward and go into my pantry and I shut
the door I generally drop down to edge I
ran the same test on a blackberry torch
and I kept for four bars of 3G reception
and the radios that RIM put into the
torch are outstanding if you're in a
fringe 3G area or maybe you get one or
two bars the torch is going to be a
great device for you because it seems to
hold on to 3G bars and 3G service much
better than the devices I've tests so
this round is going to go to the
blackberry torch bringing our total to
one around a piece so next let's talk
about browser browsing something that's
very important to me it's something that
I use a lot on my phone's rims while
they've certainly had a ton of market
share
obviously declining one of the big
reasons for this decline
I've been Rindge browser I remember
court refers to research in motion a
company that makes blackberries the
browser was quite simply atrocious on
previous BlackBerry devices so OS 5.0
devices and older was a clumsy awkward
experience rim bought a comfy it makes a
webkit-based browser and what kid is the
same technology that's used for the
browser in the iPhone in Android and
webOS so we're talking multi-touch full
rich content is now finally on a black
brakes let's go ahead and see how both
of them compare let's go ahead and jump
right in so we've got TechnoBuffalo
loaded up on each you will compare the
speed test we get to the speed round go
ahead and jump it to browser on both and
you can see that they look relatively
similar scrolling on the iPhone very
smooth I don't have any sort of just hit
a video I don't have any sort of
checkerboard pattern I worked very well
certainly there's no Flash content on
the side but it works quickly and that
responds very well to the touch
multi-touch zooming certainly works very
well on certainly apples bread and
butter you can zoom out of course the
browser will rotate with you if you want
to zoom into tech
you can double tap to zoom go ahead and
zoom right in and zoom right out
now the blackberry torch boasts the same
sort of feature set you can go ahead and
zoom right in zoom right out you can see
that is pretty smooth I do get that
checkerboard pattern on the side that's
going to come into play and we talked
about the speed ahead of things but it
does work very well actually rendering
tests have shown that the actual speed
of the browser itself as faster on the
torch than it is on the iPhone
however the torch is limited by its
processor which again will mention the
speed clocked in little over 600
megahertz @ly around 620 the iPhone
we're looking at at 1 gigahertz so I
think that's really where we see some of
that checkerboard pattern look at the
browser you scroll around fast you'll
often times will come in to play the
browser here as far as blackbirds go is
above and beyond anything else of black
grits hat using the torch from a daily
driver now for four days and I've been
relatively happy with the browser you
get the same double tap to zoom so it
takes a little bit longer to move out
and get that checkerboard pattern again
so the iPhone certainly doesn't have
flash nor does a Blackbird torch the
iPhone realizes very heavily on html5
for embedded media that will play
YouTube videos in the browser a lot of
other content the torch doesn't have
support for flash or html5 so YouTube
videos generally relying on the YouTube
player and you're not going to get a lot
of sort of manic content ESPN for
example can be able to play videos on
the iPhone you can't on the black bread
torx or a representative example of a
lot of other sites so the lack of html5
and sort of the hindrance of the
processor are going to give the browsing
edge to the iPhone but I do want to say
that I think that the blackberry and rim
R in particular are really on the right
track with the browser it does work well
it's pretty full-featured and browsing
has been very smooth so get over all I
think rim is on the right track and
certainly worlds of improvement over
what they have offered prior this round
is most definitely going to go to the
iPhone 4 all right now let's jump out of
the browser and let's talk about
email uh certainly email is as important
to me as mobile browsing probably to you
as well oftentimes on front of my
computer I rely on email sort of get
business done as I'm sure most of you
guys do as well an email on the iPhone
something that I've lamented for quite a
while you don't have folder management I
can't really star things or mark in his
favorites or flag them to do things it's
really pretty standard just email you
get a mess if you look at it you can
reply to it and there's that much
management in the email application rim
and black would be in particular is
really their bread and butter has been
email they're just known for outstanding
email client and that translates very
clearly over to the torch sort of the
touchscreen manna that we've seen prior
so I got ton of tons of emails right
here and go ahead and do through scroll
it's very smooth and just works well
email this is a no-brainer spar anything
over manage your email reply and sort of
market favorites and view of folder
hierarchies blackberries and get this in
just a complete blow out goes to a torch
if you ever used black grandpap's you
know how good the email is I don't think
that there's much point rehashing all
the great features that go into
blackberry email just say emails
important to you blackberry is going to
be very very very hard to beat alright
so let's talk about now UI and
navigation both user experiences are
very very very different the iPhone the
UI is very heavy on icons that's very
icon base as you can see you can have
some folders or you can jump in and view
or if you have in this case games and
you can jump out and sort of go through
folder after folder an icon after icon
how is really one of the the major
things that the iPhone does as far as
working with it very finger friendly you
know you have to rely only on your
finger for navigation settings and such
are obviously a very finger friendly as
well and go ahead and view our
application settings and you go through
menu after menu to get to what you like
the user experience on the blackberry
torch is really unlike unlike any other
operating system usually these
touchscreen operators have very
similar interfaces the torch is
relatively different so you do have
icons you can status favorites you can
scroll through and view different
categories you have your all favorites
media and I went through and gave a
whole tour of blackberry OS 6 and go
ahead and take a look at that later if
you'd like downloads and you have the
capability to select what you want to
show on your home screen how much or how
little so if I want to have two rows of
icons here I can have two rows if I want
to have more I can go ahead and change
it to more and they jump back to all I
can make it show three I can make it
show the whole screen for I can make it
just show one I can take it show none if
I want or that clean look I give you the
capability to really customize it a bit
more it's got a great notification
system as well one of the things that I
really don't like about the iPhone
operating system or iOS is notifications
they pop up interfere with what you're
doing that's a hit ok or cancel and it
freezes whatever you were working on
BlackBerry handles things very well here
you get a whole bunch of notifications
on the top it's sort of integrated with
Twitter Facebook whatever you like and
you go ahead and tap them you can view
all your messages calendar Facebook
things interview god
I'm sort of a very seamless experience
so both sort of offer unique ways to
navigate through here you don't have to
just use your finger you can actually
navigate things with the touchpad here
as well so you can do if you never want
to use your finger you only have to go
ahead and navigate through pick what you
like and just select it so you can do
the same thing as you would with your
finger and go ahead and hit back both
are very finger friendly if you use a
block right in the past recording
totally lost when you look at look at
this but it is going to be sort of a
nice LM sorry a very very nice
evolutionary process of the BlackBerry
operating system and because you can use
your finger you can use the optical
trackpad a lot of ways to use the device
that's best for you this round is going
to go to the blackberry torch you can
customize the phones really you it any
way you like and notification system is
really
big deal for me so when it comes to UI
and navigation that one is going to go
to the torch alright next let's soccer
out text input
phones only good if you can input text
into if you want to go to a website you
want compose an email text message you
know how is that going to work for you
let's go ahead and look at text and
create on each first we'll go ahead and
jump to the iPhone open up the nodes
application and I'll go ahead and open
up a new note and go and see what this
is going to look like so text entry is a
pretty standard affair you've got a
portrait or a keyboard keyboard go ahead
and type you know fairly well it's got
predictive correcting taxes or it's what
you're going to type worked very well
I've got used to it on but generally of
an iPhone user I'm using a torch boa
it's my daily phone it works pretty well
go ahead and show you a quick
demonstration here this is a test you
can see it works very well
he throws a test and made a mistake it's
pretty straightforward becomes sort of
industry standard now to have an
on-screen keyboard let's jump over to
the keyboard on the torch because there
are a few ways input text here go ahead
and open up a new message so you can see
sort of what this is going to look like
alright so I've got a message here set
up for me you notice of God so the same
looking thing I've got an on-screen
keyboard here I saw a portrait also saw
rotating to landscape so there you go
you can really have it either way you
like now screen size 3.2 on the tortures
of three point five you're gonna have a
bit of a cramped space while typing but
it does work pretty well it's got a very
nice auto correction predictive text and
the spellcheck much like the iPhone you
move your finger on you can pick the
letters this is not a sure press type
device like we've seen with the storms
of the past the screen does not click so
he just types like it would on any other
capacitive screen phone it works pretty
well you can go ahead and type what
you'd like take out a quick message here
on the screen otherwise type it the
other way and it works pretty well I'll
do the same for a quick test here
so this is a text in the little error
but it did work now the big deal to
blackberry in Turin particulars this is
not the only way to get text into the
phone go ahead and slide that up when
you're going to get a full sort of bold
9700 looking keyboard which is one of
the best keywords around and this one
really is pretty true to rim design a
keyboard works very well if you pick up
a bowl and picked up a curve in the past
you'll know immediately how to type on
this and it works just well of the
devices there's not as much key throw
because that should be a bit thinner to
be a slider but it really does work very
well and I've gotten actually used to
typing again on a full physical keyboard
I hadn't in the past I'll show you again
so just about as fast and now the bit
more accuracy so text input is really
good on the torch as it expect it to be
on a BlackBerry device so this round as
far as text input as most definitely
have to go to torch you have an
on-screen option if you don't want to
slide it out and you want to type out a
quick message or go to a quick website
but you also have the option to use a
full QWERTY keyboard in a package that's
not very thick I see that it's still a
pretty thin device so this round is
going to go to the blackberry torch
alright now let's go ahead and talk
about speed how fast are both of these
guys
well the iPhone 4 is running a 1
gigahertz processor which is relatively
fast the torch is running a bit slower
600 and up 24 megahertz processor and
sometimes if you notice a difference our
rim does a great job at memory
management so multitasking and such
oftentimes the phone is very very very
quick out one of the big ways where I
notice the speed difference is actually
when it comes to browsing but we'll talk
about that in a minute let's talk about
sort of speed a few things go and open
up similar applications oh this is not a
comparative test for speed at all this
is two different application different
memory management's but just for a sort
of an unscientific test to go to a clip
calendar on you can see how they work
so a little bit quicker there on the
Blackburn go and open up settings are
options on the Blackburn about the same
so you'll see that the torch isn't a
slow device we really see the slowness
you saw it when I was looking at
websites when it comes to scrolling very
quickly sometimes you get that
checkerboard pattern all the contact
doesn't load it's really where the big
difference is talk about speed of the
browser
both of these are connected to the same
Wi-Fi network so let's go ahead and do a
quick refresh and see how each of them
work we'll go ahead and go to blackberry
get it on a refresh I'll do the same
thing here on the iPhone for honey both
at the same time and we are off on both
it again on the same Wi-Fi network so
looks like the iPhone 4 is already
showing content the torch is now just
starting to haven't seen any text yet
there we go on a torch iPhone 4 is done
and the torch is still loading this is
pre representative of what we see with
speed on the browser OS speed relatively
even again Blackbird is such a nice job
memory management that it makes up for
the slower processor but really when it
comes to Brad's and you're going
definitely going to see its big
difference and because of that this
round is going to go to the iPhone for a
neck let's talk about screens but you're
going to look at at the phone all the
time on this round maybe a bit
predictable for you I was I'm something
that's really important to notice so the
iPhone 4 has what's called the Retina
display with a resolution of 640 by 960
on a 3.5 inch display other torch has a
much lower 360 bike for 80 on a 3.2 inch
display and pictures and such generally
do look a bit washed out I'll go ahead
and jump into media for example I'll
show you what I what I mean go and open
up a picture here I've got one of my
wife's family dog you can see this was
taken with the just a regular camera
pictures are very very
very washed how because the resolution
is so low again if I could do more
rounds if I would have covered camera
although both of these are five
megapixel sensors autofocus LED flash
take great similar pictures things just
look very washed out on the torch on the
iPhone four things are very sharp and
crisp looking at techsan websites is
another way we really see its go ahead
and jump back to the browser here on the
iPhone 4 I can already read that text
even though it's very small and
difficult we can make out the through
letters on the torch here just looks
like blurred shape can't really see
anything you start to zoom in you notice
that the text looks very crisp and clear
almost like it's kind of newspapers and
zoom it as far as it'll go
I do the same thing here on the torch
can there's a little speed errors and
some glitches happen and go ahead and
close out of that and keep zooming in go
back to the text you can definitely see
a difference there into the crispness of
the screen of the iPhone 4 or nearly I'm
not that big into screen resolution as
long as it looks nice I'm fine with it
but I really noticed difference coming
from the iPhone 4 to the torch so this
round moose definitely has to go to the
iPhone 4 next let's talk about apps apps
for some things that really make the
phone break the phone I depending on
what you like certainly is not much you
need to go ahead and rehash all the
details about Apple's App Store it
worked very well it really are apps for
almost everything and is a very seamless
experience if you're willing to live
within Apple's walled garden meeting
after the enter the iTunes ecosystem Rim
with OS 6 and the torch launch a new
blackberry apple world which does work
very well
you now have carrier billing support you
can view sort of things as you like ton
of different applications and it worked
very well on the phone now one of the
nice things about Rimmer was in the past
that they had a pretty nice and growing
catalog of applications that we use for
their OS 5 devices however a lot of
those
apps do not work on OS 6 the things that
you might be used to picking about the
google apps like Google Maps are going
to work very very buggy if they work at
all so the apps that maybe you relied on
very most for instance in Google Maps I
have to be able to use on the torch and
certainly that will be fixed as time
goes on but right now things that I
needed to use are just broken on the
torch so the apps round is going to go
to the iPhone so let's talk about the
last thing that's important to me on the
phone that's how long is it going to
last me on a full day's charge I use my
phone quite a bit heavy talking heavy
email heavy web browsing and often times
with the iPhone I can generally get
through a full day on hoping for the
same thing with the torch so on the
iPhone after a full day of charge and I
plug-in it at night and this is
real-world usage share not going to talk
about milliamp hours or when Apple or
rim say the phones are going to work how
it actually works for me as a general
user
generally I'm around 30% of battery life
maybe the 20 to 30 range I suppose on
the iPhone 4 on the blackberry torch
which does technically have a lower
capacity battery I'm at the 40 to 50%
battery left and that's certainly with
BlackBerry's push system in place and
such
battery life on the torch is fantastic
and again that probably harkens back to
a Renaissance man does a really really
really good job of managing memory and
suppler going managing the power levels
into the phone so battery life
definitely definitely definitely goes to
the torch all right since this is a
competition we got to go ahead and tally
out the rounds case you weren't keeping
track at home call quality went to the
iPhone reception swung to the blackberry
the iPhone struck back in browser the
BlackBerry swung again in email and UI
navigation we went to torch text input
also went with the blackberry the iPhone
took speed the iPhone stuck around for
screen and also took the apps category
and the BlackBerry got the last shot in
with battery life which means we have a
score of 5 to 5
this smartphone Smackdown ends in a tie
oh it truly goes to the strengths of the
torch if the torch had a faster
processor and browsing was improved a
little bit with html5 abilities we have
a runaway winner here and I think that
as time progresses we see maybe a torch
to or other BlackBerry devices a torch
browser they might call it we're going
to see a very very very capable entry
into the smartphone market from rim
they've really done a very nice job for
keeping up or trying to play catch-up
rather I'll put some other manufacturers
have done
so you agree disagree or the iPhone fans
gonna be upset our rim faithful going to
be upset occurs to what you guys have to
say I think I was fair unfair I like to
hear how my looking to sort of improve
my testing anyway guys I am John red
your context no Buffalo be sure to check
out their website for all your tech
content and news create your own sub
blog you can monetize it and make some
money talk to each other and built-in
social network I'd also check me out of
