lakers come here just a few days ago
Apple released new firmware version 2.2
for the iphone there are a lot of really
cool features in there and some things
that may have gone unnoticed so I want
to walk you through it and show you
somebody must have stuff in firmware 2.2
also this new version of firmware should
only be tried and upgraded to if you
have not jailbroken your iPhone like me
my phone is not been jailbroken it's
still in pristine condition so guys
enjoy and I'll see you the next one bye
alright guys let me show you that this
is running the new 2.2 software will go
ahead to settings and we'll hit general
go to about and there it is right there
two points to so there are a lot of cool
features that went into 2.2 18 these
claiming network stability you have
increased signal reception and myriad of
other technical things which really are
going to vary on your handset I can't
tell you the of experience no better
call quality no better reception then I
had with 2.1 which did help tremendously
so that's going to vary per user but
they did include some very cool feature
so I go ahead and jump right in the most
notable thing that they added is now
support for google street view let's go
ahead and open that up and I've got
Angel Stadium of Anaheim here where the
angels play I'm gonna go ahead and show
you so as soon as you look at an address
you'll see a new icon right there looks
like a little person so you go ahead and
click that phone goes into landscape and
now you have a cool google street view
you can pan around you can keep going
down follow the arrows and look keep
readjusting itself it really is pretty a
pretty impressive you could pinch in
pinch out to zoom really is a very a
nice added feature although street view
is a little stalkerish it is a kind of
fun to play around with so Google Street
View definitely a welcome addition to
the iphone now the next less cool but
equally needed feature that they added
is in the app store before we want an
update application yet actually go
through an update each one individually
which is quite annoying they have now
added a new update all icon which is
fantastic and is going to be quite a
huge time-saver run back out of there
they also added the ability to download
podcast wirelessly which is quite handy
I'm not such a podcast guy but if I was
this would be quite a cool feature so I
just opened up iTunes the podcast I do
listen to such that as a macbreak weekly
and the other Apple set required podcast
you can now download nice nasal here you
can download them all wirelessly so
let's a very cool feature if you just
hit download and you'll be able to hit
download right there go to pick up
podcasts always a nice and welcome
addition you know if you'd each software
that Apple comes up with they really
make the device more complete and more
complete there are a few glaring
features that it's still missing
noticeably landscape keyboards for
example mms and a few other basic
features like cut and paste that most
phones have but they are improving the
phone is an evolving platform and is
continuing to grow so in addition to all
those other cool features they did add
some things that you may not see for
instance if you live in Japan you now
have access to emoji icons and for those
you that might not know what emoji are
they are just ton of emoticons that the
Japanese populace uses when they text
emoticons or smiley faces and such but
apples now added support for little
panda bears stuffed bears boats
everything I mean just myriad of icons
that you can now use and only during the
Japanese market evidently Apple not
having these emoji was a real barrier to
entry in the Japanese market so
hopefully this will help them out and
increase market share overseas so right
