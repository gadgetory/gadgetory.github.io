the iPhones camera in years
the last major upgrade came all the way
back in 2011 when the iPhone 4s was
released ever since then the iPhone is
stuck to that magic 8 megapixel
threshold that is until the iPhone 6s
and 6s plus came along hey what's going
on guys a Marklin sangun from
TechnoBuffalo
and in today's video we're going to find
out whether or not the new iphone 6s
camera is really worth the upgrade
equipped with a 12 megapixel iSight
camera and a 5 megapixel FaceTime camera
is it really that much better than what
we saw from last year's iPhones upgrade
to a 12 megapixel sensor is a big deal
for Apple not only will you be able to
crop in on a photo a bit more but the
iPhone 6s and 6s plus can finally film
in 4k uhd since the sensor has enough
resolution iPhone 6s also features live
photos which essentially captures a
second before and after you take a photo
it's a really cool feature though I
personally don't think it's something
I'll be using on a daily basis today
we'll be comparing last year's iPhone 6
plus against the new iPhone 6s plus and
see how the new flagship device performs
in real world tests will be checking out
low-light performance autofocus
performance how it performs outdoors and
indoor situations and decide if the
iPhone 6s plus is really that much
better but start off with autofocus
performance Apple said it added a
state-of-the-art sensor a new image
signal processor more advanced pixel
technology and focus pixels in iPhone 6s
plus
which means you should get better
focusing and image quality after testing
it out apples not lying
autofocus on the iPhone 6s plus is
pretty darn fast the difference between
last year's and this year's iPhone is an
entirely night-and-day button nails
focusing just a tad bit quicker and more
accurately especially when you're
getting up close and personal with your
subjects in low-light situations however
both phones still struggle to focus on
subjects they focus but just not very
quickly in terms of software both
iPhones are identical with the exception
of the live photos button and flash for
the front-facing camera on the 6s plus
but in terms of performance iPhone 6s
plus is just a tad bit faster when it
comes to taking an actual photo thanks
to that new a9 processor Apple didn't
really change the overall UI for the 6s
plus it's still the same camera app
we're used to using from previous
iPhones image quality though this is
where you'll notice the difference
between the iPhone 6s is 12 megapixel
camera over last year's eight mega
pixel sensor cropping in on a photo
you'll see more details from the iPhone
6s plus
whereas with last year's iPhone six-plus
it starts to get really pixelated when
zooming in whether you're shooting
indoors and good lighting conditions or
outdoors the overall uncropped zoomed
out photos from the 6s plus just looks
way sharper iPhone 6s plus also handles
exposure a bit better and appear to
underexpose as images which helps with
more even highlights in terms of color
accuracy the iPhone 6s plus looks almost
identical to the iPhone 6 plus colors
are still saturated though some of the
images from the 6s plus seemed just a
tad bit more vibrant compared to the
iPhone 6 plus you probably won't notice
much of a difference and they
essentially look the same unless you
really look closely on a computer
however I notice that white balance is
more accurate on the 6s plus skin tones
are more true to life and just very
balanced low-light performance from the
6s Plus hasn't really changed much from
last year though the new deep trench
isolation technology used two separate
colors in the 6s plus does help by
hiding noise in the shadow areas and
under exposing the image like I said
earlier you probably won't really notice
a big difference by looking at the
images on your phone and if you're
uploading Facebook or Instagram they'll
pretty much look identical since social
media sites tend to compress images when
it comes to video recording the iPhone
6s plus can now record in 4k which means
you now have four times a resolution of
a 1080p video also the iPhone 6s plus
now stabilizes the video optically by
using the built-in optical image
stabilization whereas last year o is
only work when taking photos while
having 4k videos is great it'll also
take up twice the storage space on your
iPhone so just be aware of that when
shooting 4k videos however shooting 4k
on iphone 6s plus is pretty impressive
there aren't a whole lot of artifacts
popping up in the shadows and the
mid-tones and colors are very neutral
which should help grade the footage
better
unfortunately Apple didn't change
anything for those who like shooting in
slow-mo with a 6s plus and 6 plus you'll
only be able to shoot in 1080p at 120
frames per second or 720p at 240 frames
per second the iPhone 6s plus
front-facing camera has also been
updated to a 5 megapixel sensor and
Apple also added the ability to use the
whole screen as a flash now what's cool
is that it changed the color of the
flash depending on the current lighting
conditions and what's in a frame to give
you the best possible selfies the
quality is definitely much better than
the 1.2 megapixel sensor through last
year's iPhone
you guys want to see a full gallery make
sure to check out our post which you can
find over here to see more photo samples
in conclusion is it worth upgrading to
the iPhone 6s plus for the camera alone
if you're coming from last year's 6 plus
I personally don't think so I just hold
off to the iPhone 7 comes out anyways
thank you guys so much for watching and
if you guys enjoyed this video make sure
to give it a thumbs up and we will see
you guys in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
