to you by carbonite welcome back to
their pursuit of rumor roundup this the
show we kick a little rumor from here
and a dab a rumor from their mix them up
and serve you up a cake of rumor
awesomeness up this week we're gonna
talk about the rumor do your the full
samsung galaxy s4 specs have allegedly
been revealed more ipad 5 case leaks are
backing up redesigned rumors google's
looking to get into the subscription
music business and windows blue the
successor to windows 8 could be out by
summer this is rumor roundup let's go
and get started so unconfirmed specs of
samsung's upcoming Galaxy s4 have
appeared courtesy of the folks at Sam
mobile these guys have been pretty
dead-on in the past and they revealed
practically everything they're gonna
know about the device so if you want to
be surprised on the 14th wooden
technobuffalo they're covering the event
cover your ears cover your eyes had your
children all right so enough of my jibba
jabba onto the goods we're looking at a
four point nine nine inch full HD so
luxe display snapdragon 600 1.9 gear
it's clock speed 2 gigs of ram three
sizes 16 32 and 64 a very unlucky 13
megapixel camera 140 point 1 x 71.8 by
seven point seven millimeters and even
the weight we know 138 grams something
to note here though that seems like is
allegedly ditching its own XE nose chip
and mo led tech because of overheating
and production issues Sam mobile sources
also shared more information about the
design itself there's going to be a
removable plastic bag which we've seen
before but they threw in something fancy
Saints gonna be flanked by aluminium a
home button with touch buttons on either
side so that's pretty standard and come
in both black and white and then
inevitably slew of other colors as a
lifestyle continues more alleged iPad 5
cases are leaking out from where else
but China further establishing that
Apple's could introduce an iPad Mini
like redesign which for my money is a
pretty good thing I loved way
ipad may look especially the black one
when might this guy becoming look for it
to hit in the second half of the year
and probably coming the same size we
have right now some going all the way up
to 128 gigs I would love to see the ipad
5 take the same design as the ipad mini
it'd be really the first big redesign
that we see in a full redesign in quite
some years even from the original like
that's what we have now it certainly has
been evolutionary changes so change it
up Apple change is good so reportedly
Google's and talks with major industry
labels offer its own sort of Spotify
clone cuz they're Google and they can do
whatever the hell they want according to
the Financial Times which definitely has
a spotty background the search giant has
initiated talks with the major music
labels about possibly offering a
streaming service it's unclear when will
be available with the report is
confident nuff and saying who was gonna
offer the subscription-based model along
with ad supported free unlimited access
to songs this also is sort of following
up rumors you've been hearing for a
while that Apple's also been talking off
for the same thing it's really gonna be
fun to see which companies gonna be the
first one to offer it with google i/o
coming up in May perhaps find out a
little bit more Windows 8 is still shiny
and new but supposedly its successor
codename windows blue will be here by
summer a public preview of windows blue
will reportedly be ready within the next
few months not gonna be giant changes to
what we've seen with windows 8 more
incremental fine tuning so they're
allegedly focusing on improving windows
search charm functionality with being
obviously playing a major part in how
it's handled and to quote a number of
scenarios are being targeted including
the ability for users to search for a
movie and have apps surfaced that
content and provide a quick way to play
it and that is according to the verge
windows blue launches will be available
to existing Windows 8 users adding
support for 78 inch devices along with I
11Â° built-in and of course an update
for windows phone is being planned as
well as Microsoft searches to sort of
better merge both platforms so a blue
for desktop and blue for phones let me
