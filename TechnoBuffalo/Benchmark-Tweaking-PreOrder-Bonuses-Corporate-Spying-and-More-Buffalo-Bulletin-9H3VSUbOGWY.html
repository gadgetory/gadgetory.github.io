Samsung spying the warcraft movie a
ridiculous pre-order bonus and Amazon
CEO takes control of wopo it's buffalo
bulls in time
hello internet and welcome to the
Buffalo bulletin where we recapped five
major stories from our site
technobuffalo calm every tuesday and
friday if you're interested in reading
more about any story i mentioned on the
show check the description for links or
click on the graphics for each story if
you have annotations available and
toggle on I'm Ashley sceva Harry top
stories some crazy subterfuge happening
in tech this week starting with an Intex
discovery of multiple OEMs gaming
benchmarking software to produce higher
numbers the samsung galaxy s4 note 3 in
note 10.1 2014 the HTC one and one mini
the sous padfone infinity and the LG g2
all had scores that were off in at least
one benchmark test now the Nexus 4 and
Nexus 7 and the Nvidia shield were found
innocent but overall it's a really good
reminder that benchmarks are pretty
silly just buy the phone you like we all
know each device OEM out there would
love to sneak a peek at others play
books but Samsung might have taken it
too far Samsung's legal counsel recently
admitted he knew the details of Nokia's
patent terms with Apple meaning samsung
may have spied on confidential dealings
and used them to their own benefit it
would help Samsung make their own patent
deals but it's also illegal to do that
so Samsung might be in a lot of legal
trouble over this one who knows how this
will play out in gaming legendary
pictures finally announced a release
date for the highly anticipated warcraft
film you'll be able to see it in
theaters on December eighteenth 2015 a
little over two years from now a filming
is expected to start next month and it
will combine live action and CG I
appreciate all of these things and i
love the warcraft franchise but wow will
be practically ancient at that point so
I'm really curious as to how much
enthusiasm this movie will bring in when
it's finally released normally a game
pre-order bonus wouldn't be newsworthy
but in this case we had to make an
exception as this has been making the
rounds online this week apparently if
you preorder sonic lost world via amazon
you will get the incredible magical
amazing bonus of twenty-five extra lives
is this one we've come to as an old
school gamer who
murs wanting to stab somebody with my
nes controller after repeatedly dying to
red devils and ghosts and goblins games
are even that hard now noobs and finally
our grab bag story of the week it's
official Jeff Bezos has closed the deal
that makes him the owner of the
Washington Post he purchased the news
outlet for 250 million bucks cash back
in August and now the deal is final no
word yet on whether or not we'll start
seeing some exclusives or other digital
content for the kindle but it'll be
interesting to keep an eye on WaPo to
see what Bezos does with the company
that's it for the Buffalo bulletin for
today if you enjoyed the show a thumbs
up would be super awesome view and if
you want more great TechnoBuffalo video
