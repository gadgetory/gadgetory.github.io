want to thank you from the absolute
bottom of my heart I yesterday I get
50,000 subscribers which to me is a huge
milestone I am still boggled and
confused as to why people really are
interested in to hearing what I have to
say about technology it's always been a
passion has always been a love of mine
in fact that I get to talk about
technology for a career is unbelievable
to me and I wake up every day with a
smile on my face and it's because of you
guys that I get a have that so I just
want to thank you I remember it must
have been about six to eight months ago
when Chris Parrillo hit 50,000
subscribers a number watching his video
thanking his audience and I couldn't
believe that someone could have that
many subscribers doing technology
reviews it just seemed like the work
that making club or interested and now
that I hit 50,000 it is just something
that I'm very proud of and then I just
want to thank you I'm not the kinda guy
that really follow subscriber numbers
very closely but hitting 50 is a real
big milestone for me so just use her for
me to you from the absolute bottom of my
heart thank you for your support thank
you for for watching the videos thank
you for your ideas thank you for
interacting with me and talking with me
whether it's on skype or Twitter or over
comments or YouTube emails just thank
you and I can't tell you that I've got
some other things lined up to help thank
you guys as well that I think you're
going to enjoy and probably next week is
going to be a great time to announce
those I'm still working on the final
details but guys again just a short
video just from the bottom of my heart I
want to thank you nothing nothing
scripted here just sort of me talking
you guys directly so if you've ever had
a dream that you've been able to sort of
see fulfilled you know I you know what I
want I'm saying where I'm coming from
just thank you i could say it a million
times that I just appreciate the
opportunity that you all have given me
and I promise to continue to get better
to continue to be more impartial and
unbiased and to try and increase the
quality of my videos increase
content and you know make the technology
videos and reviews for the best that I
can be I'm still growing as a review or
haven't been doing it that often just
about or that long just about two years
so I'm so growing I'm still learning but
I promise to continue to grow and learn
with your continued support finner guys
