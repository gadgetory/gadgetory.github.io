TechnoBuffalo here there are a lot of
fantastic Android devices on the market
but the two best at least that are
available right now the motorola built
droid running on verizon's 3g network
and the Google built nexus one running
on t-mobile's 3g network so once or a
run through the specs and show you a
sort of a head-to-head comparisons work
generally when I do my head to head
they're two different operating system
so you can see how each one would do
tasks differently here we're running the
sort of the same basic operating system
so it's going to be a little bit
different how we run things here so the
difference is this droid is running
Android 2.0 or 2.1 to be more accurate
whereas the nexus one is running an
updated version dubbed 2.1 and this is
the first update to 2.1 a little
confusing there are some key differences
and i'll show you syrup as we progress
now google and motorola have said that
the droid will be getting a 2.1 update
but won't be having all of the same
features will cover all those sort of as
we continue let's go over some of the
specs so for the US carrier for each of
these this is verizon exclusive and this
way you can actually get unlocked but if
you want 3g you can only use it on
tmobile you can use a tease edge service
if you'd like now Google has also said
that there will be a verizon version of
the nexus one further complicating your
decision coming out sometime in the next
few months so from a price standpoint
which is really everybody in with their
wallets nowadays the droid is going to
run you 199 earth of course the two-year
contract the nexus one is going to be a
hundred and seventy nine dollars with
that same to your contract and that's
again with tmobile versus verizon size
and weight here you're looking at about
five point nine six ounces on the droid
as opposed to the 4.59 on the nexus one
or speaking of sort of side let's do a
real quick size comparisons you can see
the difference the nexus one is notably
thinner it's probably one of the thinner
smartphones that i've seen but the droid
is by no means chubby but it does have
that extra girth because of the
slide-out keyboard will talk about that
in jest
a minute let's continue with some
differences here included in the Box
you're going to get a 16 gigabyte
microSD card with the droid and you're
only going to get a four gig with the
nexus one screen size they're both 3.7
inches and they have the same resolution
of 854 x 480 cpu speed and ram are sort
of wearing some of the bigger
differences are as well the nexus one
has a 1 gigahertz Snapdragon processor
whereas the Droid has a 550 megahertz
processor in it miranda standpoint the
Droid has 256 whereas the nexus one has
a significantly different 512 they can
both multitasks they both run the same
operating system certainly they both
have Wi-Fi and gps 3.5 millimeter
headset jacks and all the rest let's
talk a bit about Tamra the Droid has a
5-megapixel four-time digital zoom with
a dual LED flash and the next is one has
the same 5 megapixel sensor with only
two times digital zoom and a single LED
flash so there you go the they both have
sort of a rudimentary autofocus as well
so enough about all the specs let's show
you how they both work now from a purely
statistical standpoint you think that
the nexus one has a big advantage
because of processor and ram let's see
how that actually translates out so
first let me show you that these are
both going to be have all their tasks
out applications sort of killed so I've
got a third-party application here
called task killer i'm going to go ahead
and cut down everything you can see that
we're starting from all of our free
available ramp now some programs are
going to load up on their own to make
things running like we'll see on the
nexus one it's got a load of live live
wallpapers and things like that but i
wanted to start from a baseline 0 so you
guys can see that everything has been
shut down so with everything closed
we're looking at an available one
hundred and forty megabytes in 109 here
on the droid so a bit of a difference
let's go ahead and close these some of
the differences there you'll notice as
well i think is going to be the
navigation you can see right here having
a hard time you've been pushing the
buttons i am not a fan of the capacitive
buttons on the Nexus
on their oftentimes unfair response with
you have to can really use me use your
forefinger that much it's actually use
your thumb and really hit it they're
pretty responsive here on the droid on
the nexus one you can navigate with the
scroll ball here with the nexus one
you're sort of limited to your finger so
some of the 2.1 updates well you can see
the sort of zooming line in the
background those are called live
wallpapers and then they don't really
add any sort of functionality just sort
of fun to look at in addition to 2.1 you
get a few more home screens I only have
three home screens here unfortunately
and I've got actually five i believe on
2.1 now you will be getting the same
home screens on to 12.1 comes to the
joys things will get your same five
you're also going to get this new design
sort of scrolling applications doc here
it looks a little more simple here on
the on the droid nothing terribly fancy
just some graphics cues you're also
going to get access to multi-touch the
browser will be a full multi-touch
browser which is not currently the case
on the droid on the unlocked version
called a milestone it is but there are
third-party browsers right now called
dolphin for example that will give you
multi touch when 2.1 does come to the
droid it will be endowed with
multi-touch so I'm not going to hold
that against it right now so let's do
some speed tests for browsing they're
both running right now on the same Wi-Fi
network and then we'll sort of shut down
the networks are the shutdown the Wi-Fi
we'll see how they compare on their own
3g merits let's go ahead and open with
the browsers on each of these and should
default rights to google so i'm going to
go ahead and launch technobuffalo calm
and each of these and technobuffalo has
been loaded on both these before so
it'll be a test of a site that you visit
on a more regular basis all right so i
would try and hit these both at the same
time which is more difficult than you
think it would be all right and we're
off on both of them and again running on
the same Wi-Fi network like the nexus
one is displaying the concept first the
droid was pretty close behind the nexus
one is done and
droid is still loading and it's done so
finished just a little bit behind not
much but there was definitely a
noticeable difference let's see how the
processor in the RAM handle scrolling
here if you scroll very quickly to keep
up it does appear to keep up you don't
get any sort of that checkerboard
pattern at the bottom which I find very
annoying the sort of a sign of a slower
processor none here of course on the
nexus one as well if you don't see it on
the joy to and expect to see it on the
nexus one either okay so next we're
going to load website that I've never
visited on either of these devices so
it'll be sort of a raw test with nothing
stored in memory nothing cashed at all
will go to comedy com which i assume is
a site so we've got a cute up ready to
go go at the same time and this will be
again a test on the same Wi-Fi network
of the speed see if you get the same
result that we had last time all right
and they are both offloading comedy calm
which has never been put on either of
these again looks like the nexus ones
got a slight edge but the droid appears
to be pretty close behind nexus one is
done and the droid is still loading if
you probably start counting so maybe two
or three seconds behind so we did see
the same results now here with 2.1 we do
have native multi-touch we do not have
native multi-touch here though on the
motorola droid so let's turn off Wi-Fi
and try one more test and you can
compare a network to network so if you
want to pick these phones up as they are
right now T Mobile versus verizon let's
see if there's a difference okay so
we're going to load technobuffalo calm
again again using verizon's 3g evdo
network and t-mobile's 3g hsdpa network
let's go ahead and hit em both the same
time and see if we can get a winner so
they are both off I look to be pretty
close to sams like the droid is actually
a little bit quicker now is actually
showing content much earlier than the
nexus one is
piers is the nexus one made a quick
comeback it's a head-to-head epic battle
here they both appeared to be an almost
exactly the same place you can see that
yellow bar across the top on each and
the droid actually finished first and
the nexus one is still loading and there
was a reason I wanted to show you this
and all the websites that i loaded
verizon's network was faster than
t-mobile's and that's despite the
significant processor advantage of the
nexus one so if you're using Wi-Fi like
you saw you're going to get faster load
speeds on the next one if you're using
just your 3g network you are going to be
a little bit quicker on the verizons and
i do have pretty much full bars of 3g
service on each so something kid to keep
in mind let's see now how these load
programs and they've had both these same
applications are loaded on each let's
see how they load the same things and
see if there's any sort of speed
difference so we will load let's say we
launched Android Marketplace the same
time we'll see if there is any
difference with either these so a little
bit quicker on the droid actually the
nexus one is still loading it again we
are not on Wi-Fi we're still using the
3g connection so there you have it once
again another sort of shocked at how
much faster of risings network is than
t-mobile's let's go ahead and launch
another program let's go ahead and try
at calendar for example so actually a
little bit quicker on the droid not much
let's launch a few more we're using the
same program the same time so the same
amount of RAM is being consumed on each
let's go ahead and pick something
different let's go ahead and launch
let's say the gallery none each and
you'll see the difference in the gallery
to between two point O in the 2.1 so
pretty close they show things
differently but you know relatively even
as far as how they am how quickly they
launch so let's talk about a few more
they even try not to make this an hour
long video there's so much we can cover
here camera quality I found to be almost
identical on each and
includes camcorder quality so that's
sort of a wash I'd say I really do like
the buttons much same having that
trouble again the buttons much more on
the droid now if you prefer a qwerty
keyboard the droid is going to be your
best option because of course it has 1
i'm admittedly not a fan of the qwerty
keyboard on here the physical keyboard
the keys feel a little bit mushy and I
think this d-pad is taking up a lot of
unnecessary space I actually prefer to
type on the full qwerty keyboard that
you can use here and you can type either
in landscape or portrait using the
on-screen keyboards on each so the both
pretty much the same experience so if
you have to pick a device you know it's
really again going to be your choice if
I had to choose one today I would
probably pick the droid running on
verizon's network I found it to be a
little bit more reliable than t-mobile's
and a little bit more widespread
depending on where you are now it's not
to say I haven't been happy with the
nexus one it's a fantastic phone if you
get great t-mobile service where you are
it's certainly worth considering your
best bet in the long run maybe to even
wait for the nexus one to come virat to
verizon you can get the best of both
worlds so that's one thing give you sort
of a abbreviated hits ahead of the two
big shot android devices on the market
right now hope you guys enjoyed i'm jon
rettinger and i will see you in the next
video bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
