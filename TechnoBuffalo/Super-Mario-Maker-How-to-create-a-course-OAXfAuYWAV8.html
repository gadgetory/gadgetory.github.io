gaming editor here at TechnoBuffalo calm
and I'm doing something a little bit
different today I'm actually going to
live make an entire level of Mario maker
for you guys normally I tend to record
these videos like I record gameplay and
then I record audio that's not what I'm
gonna do here because I just want to
kind of like narrate this as I go along
so this is completely off the cuff
we'll start by deleting the level so I
still have stuff to unlock as you'll see
here I think I have like a day or so
left after nine days you unlock
everything you have to play in the
course editor for at least 5 minutes
every single day for 9 in order to get
all this stuff and then there's also
other things that you can unlock through
play but I did just unlock one of my
favorite features from Mario Brothers 3
and that's the track creation tool let's
do Mario makers my heart more you make
it let's do Mario Brothers 3 we're gonna
do an outside level ok so I'm going to
use the sound effects for this and
everything and we are going to just
start by moving the goal line a little
bit already yep that's right I have my
hands set as a cat paw you can actually
change that yeah let's do that cat paw
for now ok so let's go to the start and
I want to build a level that features
some tracks but I want to give Mario a
little bit of a starting runway here and
a place to get all powered up when you
shake some tools they change so you just
saw that mushroom change colors think
there's only three colors available on
this one so I want to give Mario the
raccoon tail right away well let's get
some enemies here pretty sure the green
turtle just walks right off the clip
right he's just gonna keep rolling I
don't want that red turtle
he's a shake away cool and if you're a
standard standardly decent Mario player
you know that sometimes you'll see
whoops not those this lets see a block
kind of standing on its own on the
ground you'll like woman how do we get
that well you can use the turtle show or
you can use your raccoon tail what
you'll get here let's go ahead and give
the players one up right out of the box
so the way 1ups work in this game if
you're playing 10 Mario challenge or 100
Mario challenge you can earn 3 1ups per
stage no more than that like you may
earn more than that but they only carry
over there's only going to be three of
them and they'll add to your total lives
so if you're doing the 10 Mario
challenge and you have eight Mario's
left and you get three 1ups in the stage
you'll be brought back up to ten you
won't get 11 you won't get any more than
the cap so you won't get any more than
100 or any more than 10 so it's it's you
know you see people like flooding stages
with 1ups like it's kind of useful it's
kind of pointless do that asked I keep
doing that
and there we go okay so one up right
there to get our player there
our cocoon so let's toss some coins in
here just for good measure
okay so then they'll jump over here
they'll get their one up and then it's
off to the races right so I'm going to
start with some track okay cool let's
put some hazards on that track too and
undo the platform type that only moves
if you jump on it if I were to do brown
it would be constantly moving like this
blue one it'll it'll stay so let's do
this to kind of encourage some jumping I
don't know if he's gonna be able to
reach some so let's see what that feels
like
and it's gonna catch up to me huh okay
that's fine
okay obviously it can't be that simple
so let's toss a Goomba right here I mean
what is this border those guys love
flies flies oh man I just don't want the
fly swatting minigame all right so this
is random this wasn't supposed to happen
you guys get them here I am just build a
Mario course what did I get for that
silliness a little - I'll be settling oh
man what's going on
I gotta keep on rolling here oh all
right final look at them get them
he's kidding
hey what happened they lose
might have lost however maybe I was
supposed to flick those bombs into the
big bug anyway I scan how glad that
happen here for you guys
escapes so random let's try and keep
that goof in there I'll see what this
plays like NBA I can't get over it
I think I'm supposed to flick those
bombs into that dude so don't don't play
like I played there spazzing out okay
that's no problem cool so you got this
raccoon seal maybe we should introduce
kind of like a flying bonus area put
that right there
so you'll bounce down off those and then
when you get down to the bottom here
let's scoot a little little flying space
here but clearly not uninterrupted okay
so you'll kill him yeah some space to
fly right it is move that down okay
so that's high enough right let's toss
some free stuff up here just to be a
jerk let's put a lot key to up here or
Lackey to is I've heard other people say
I drives me nuts all right so if but if
you don't have the raccoon tail we need
a way to get over there and let's make
it like a not very nice way there let's
do this so you'll scoot over there I'm
kind of like show players like hey
conveyer belts you guys know how these
work but then let's just be jerks
I hope this works if you want to see how
something plays out you can just hit
play and Mario will float in the air I
love it all right leave it it alright
how's that is bigger let me get can I
make that jump probably that's easy okay
right there so all the goombahs will
come flying in boy boy boy I've gone I'm
such a jerk
okay okay see how that plays I don't
want it to be like soul-crushing hard
oops
I don't want it to be like soul-crushing
hard or anything but I do kind of want
players to get to the end in which that
they had
haha okay they all kind of look there
that's not that Oh
rocky - okay forgot about him uh I don't
like that it just sort of gaps there so
I'm going to introduce another hopper
please see what happens here so yeah if
you were just to wait if you were just
to wait right there like the goombahs
will just fall to their death
oh no they won't the fall down in there
oh that's perfect there you go so it's
not going to crush you either way
all right then I'll just create a couple
floating platforms here just for fun
so I have changed jobs yet no I don't
it's probably big enough jump in get
that guy this is one one of the only
annoying things about Mario maker if you
want to make blocks that connect to the
start and finish it of course you get
those lines right there you see that
line now let me let me see if I can
anyway you see what I'm saying here I
used to love it when they did this to
just drop like a flying broom in there
at the last second to mess with you okay
let's see how this plays so we've got
two one ups over the course possibility
for three if you get all the coins I
think I don't know if I cashed domitor
coins or not that'd be nice a coin
counter I probably didn't do 100 but if
your coins actually carry over from all
playthroughs if you're playing Mario No
huh
idiot the Mario challenge let me as well
give some more points out here
and let's just save it and upload it I
can be I know I can beat this so what
are we gonna call it uh hmm let's just
call kuba stack its rip uploading and
playing is really easy too so like you
just save it like that go back to the
course bot
click upload it's going to be like bro
you need to beat this before you can
share with others and you'll say yeah
okay I can do that let's see what
happens
it's not gonna be stupid challenging I
mean I have made a few levels just to
kind of be a jerk to my friends just one
like if you get someone who's pretty
good at Mario in here and then they
start playing and they see like oh god
this is so hard that can be kind of fun
lucky doesn't really mess with you there
at all there you go that's how you make
a course Mario maker now I can be a jerk
here if I want to um and I might
actually try it just see what it's like
but I do like sometimes I'm gonna upload
it as is and it's really easy to upload
- like does this little workout thing it
gives you the course identifier and then
that's it really right now it's going to
give me an error okay there we go it's
really faster than that so you could if
I wanted to I can mess up the times
because I didn't really use too much
time there so let's bump that down at
300 and then I can even put in like an
auto scroll see what that chicks
I used to hate though like all the
schooling levels as a kid man nothing to
commend drove me more ducks than that
get out of here although the autoscroll
isn't too bad here oh now what now what
am I gonna do okay
yeah it's easily let's go the bottom
route happens
stupid goombahs ah okay there you go so
I'm actually gonna upload it as is
it's gonna make me plate again isn't it
okay oh yes clear it again see if I can
just get that raccoon tail and zip right
through the end although now that does
this auto scroll I really don't I can't
zip too far haha okay there's a design
flaw right there
No awesome
maybe don't be an idiot maybe how about
that that was really close I almost
didn't make that jump there I don't know
I think I liked it better without the
auto' school actually but I'm gonna
leave it here his firm
can you fly with is it gonna mess it up
you know it's a shame all the levels
that you're seeing built here during
this like review period so if someone's
one of your favorite streamers is may be
streaming it or another reviewer that
you like is uploading content like this
you're not gonna be able to play this
level these levels when Nintendo
releases the game this is all on a
review server with review code there's
it's not the retail build I think it's
like identical to the retail build but
it's not the the retail copy so all
these levels are going to be gone
stupid mountain gumbaz what were you
thinking Joey okay there we go
cool so thank you guys for watching
again I'm Joey Davidson and I would
share this level with you Goomba stack
or whatever it's called but you guys
only read it play it I'm sorry thank you
guys for watching though if you want to
see anything else from Mario maker let
us know and we are actually actively
streaming the game - on Twitch in the
afternoons during the week so you can
