LA right now about to go to e3 bring you
guys with me have another experience
video has fun looking some gaming stuff
and just enjoy enjoy the trip let's do
this so first off if you guys are
looking for some specific product covers
check out the link above where John
covered the xbox one s and the new
controllers when you first walk in the
e3 you realize there's nothing quite
like it it is videogame heaven as they
put it on one of their snap codes just
tons and tons of people everywhere and
while there's new games being announced
all sorts of stuff we're really
interested me was the big sort of set
pieces that companies like Forza Gran
Turismo playstation vr had it created
and the first thing I got to try out was
actually forza motorsports 6 but not
just on a regular controller on this
insane seated moving rig thing and this
is kind of III on steroids they take the
video games that you know and love or at
least that style of video game and they
take you to a whole nother level with
characters with set pieces with sound it
turns a simple game into a spectacle
next I swung by the new gears of war
booth nothing too crazy happening there
was more just like press stuff lots of
trailers but there were some cool action
figures and models that I think you'll
find interesting if you re gears war fan
much like I am it was a bit more
fascinating and maybe a little strange
was what gran turismo had done it seemed
like it was almost a direct shot at
Forza and Microsoft while they had that
big single moving chair thing for you to
steer and feel like you're rarely racing
a car the Sony gran turismo area had
like 10 20 of these pods they weren't
moving and they receded but they did
have a steering wheel and pedals and
people were racing against each other
next moving on to the race of booths
they had some pretty cool stuff mainly
they were trying to showcase the best of
what they've got from the blade with the
core to the blade stealth to their
Mouse's keyboards all sorts of awesome
stuff and what the ultimate razor setup
would really look like and at the front
of the booth they featured their
overwatch series of products next I
swung back around to the other side of
the PlayStation booth and checked out
PlayStation VR there's a super long line
and I had to go film so I didn't get to
try it out there however I did see
Batman Arkham on
our and that was super exciting because
that is one of my favorite games and
deceit in virtual reality I think it'll
do really well so I can't wait to try
out a press demo of that because we
didn't really see it play on screen
unfortunately and those are the really
big noteworthy things that I got to
check out at e3 for those of you who
haven't been III in my opinion isn't
really about checking out specific new
updates and releases like that's cool
for sure it's more about going and
hanging out with full gaming community
to meet people much like yourself we're
going to nerd out over the things that
you love for example it wasn't just rock
band it was rock band with people
actually going up and performing in
front of a crowd like you guys saw with
forza it was more than just holding a
control and pretending you're racing in
your living room III takes everything up
another notch in the world of gaming and
I think that's the fun of it literally
as I was walking out to go back to my
car this was the last thing I saw
and that's pretty much it guys I'm
walking right now in my car I hope you
guys enjoy it let me know it's think in
