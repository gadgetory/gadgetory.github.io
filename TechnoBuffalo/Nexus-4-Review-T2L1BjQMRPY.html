technobuffalo here's a full review of
the latest google nexus phone this is
the LG built nexus for tracking a quad
core glass back all kinds of other
goodness and it's teeny tiny package
let's put it through its paces and let's
see which should be the phone you pick
up and hold with you the next couple
years so let's start the Nexus 4 review
with hardware so I was pretty
underwhelmed when I first picked up the
nexus 4 not because its design isn't
solid because it already sort of been
treated to a look at it with the Optimus
G which is pretty similar design the
front is dominated by an incredible 4.7
inch display that went off appears to
switch from edge to edge I love the
bevel top which slopes down to the sleek
and sparkly backside it feels super
solid it's easy to hold isn't too heavy
I really do like sparkles back reminds
me a bit of the texture Samsung used to
put on insomnia line way back in the day
I don't really like the plastic border
running around the phone think it takes
away from the otherwise pretty premium
look there's a volume rocker that's easy
to reach the left hand I 3.5 millimeter
headphone jack up top and a very easy to
reach power button on the right hand
side and of course a micro USB charging
port on the bottom alright so let's go
ahead and jump right into the specs the
Nexus 4 packs a Qualcomm Snapdragon s4
pro processor which is arguably one of
the more powerful chips in the market
right now multiple reports have
confirmed lt's and port is actually on
board but the phone itself don't use it
instead you are stuck with HSPA on AT&amp;amp;T
hspa+ on tmobile which isn't necessarily
the worst thing in the world other
hardware specs include 2 gigs of ram
slim port hdmi it uses a micro USB port
and 2100 milliamp hour battery to keep
that gap power it on and working my
biggest gripe with their hardware is
that are you're locked into either 8 or
16 gigs of storage it's not enough for
all my music videos photos and the rest
of the goodness out to put on my phone
but clearly it's a bit from google to
get your lime or on cloud and streaming
based services so i'd be pretty remiss
if i didn't talk about the Qi wireless
charging support both with the nexus 4
that's Qi Qi not queer quite pronounced
chee we had a look it up to make sure
it's actually the same system that used
in the Lumia 920's if you've got one of
those Lumia 920 charging ports lying
around you can actually pop the next
four right on it or he's gonna energize
your pads throw it on and get your
charge on so next let's talk about
software the
stand out feature the Nexus 4 is its OS
it's the first phone on the market to
lunch with Android 4.2 jelly bean that's
right point2 is also Jay Buhl's and it's
the best version of Android I've really
ever used despite having a really odd
bug won't let use December as a month
for an event inside the People app but
that'll get fixed everything is super
smooth in feels natural and there aren't
any weird software hang-ups I've
experienced on any other devices
although I bet the quad core processor
two gigs ram certainly help make up for
any sort of bugs that might be in this
code so there's a few enhancements over
android 4.1 jelly bean but nothing super
major its pod why Google stuck with the
jelly bean name notable enhancements
include better camera controls a pretty
cool 360 degree panorama option better
notification management and they'll
decent amount more although out of all
the new features my favorite option is a
new keyboard which allows you to sweat
from letter letter and create a word
just like swype third-party app my find
it's actually much smoother deep down
though I'm still a tap tap tap tappity
tap it tap it a writer I'm just gets out
of the way I totally loved a new lock
screen it can now be customized with
widgets yeah I can't afford my gmail
inbox to my calendar appointments about
unlocking the phone this is so useful
and actually curious why hasn't been
included on earlier releases of Android
Google now on google search have also
got and refined it I couldn't notice a
huge difference who it was offered
Android 4.1 Google now quickly tells me
the weather in the trailer before I head
out for the day and their support for
identifying flight times other
notifications in your email Google
search that you use your voice look up
anything and actually prefer at the Siri
I found it to be extremely accurate and
really good understanding voice inputs
to I also love that google added a small
icon notification schaefer quickly bring
it up commonly used settings I can tap
it anytime I want to view my own Google
profile change the brightness access
more settings turn Wi-Fi on or off check
battery level percentage and turn
airplane mode and control the bluetooth
all right so next let's talk about
performance of that beastly quad-core
Nexus 4 as I mentioned as a Snapdragon
s4 pro chip similar to one used in the
HTC droid DNA I ran our standard
quadrant benchmark received a pretty
whomping score 4775 which is actually
below the square of the droid DNA
received of 7460 one but overall user
perspective though don't get too caught
up in the scores if the phone is
extremely fast and feels really snappy
but fills you folks that want to know
the numbers there
I let's talk about the camera this guy's
packing some pretty cool camera tricks
Nexus 4 is equipped with an 8 megapixel
camera on the back side a 1.3 megapixel
front-facing camera on the front for
taking all your duck lip photos that I
know you're taken photos aren't amazing
and I saw better shots from a iphone 5
Lumia 920 they're just okay the new 360
degree panorama feature is pretty neat
brothers can only view their shots with
the Android 4.2 device or from google
plus it's kind of frustrating to use it
snap five different panorama so get the
picture most accurate represented and
one time it said I was moving too fast
even when I followed the guidelines they
make a bristle camera can record 1080p
video but turned out to be loaded with
artifacts line play the clip back on my
computer also from what I could
distinguish alive continuous autofocus
which is a pretty big staple on most
smartphones now all rights next to talk
about data call quality and battery life
call conan nexus 4 was on par with
pretty much every other high-end
smartphone up test recently there aren't
any relief standout features here I was
easily able to kill the other color
didn't have any drop calls no white
noise on either ends I thought the
speakerphone is loud enough to use
during a conference call again for GL to
use an active on Nexus 4 even if it's
been laying dormant so when we ran our
test i received a pretty average
download speed and about 1 megabit on
AT&amp;amp;T 3g network which is pretty terrible
grades LTE speeds I test with the
tmobile sim and reseal download speed
Department of 1.3 about an average
upload speed of 1.18 against t-mobile's
hspa+ 42 megabits per second network
however those just my speeds anywhere
you go you might be able to get much
faster one somebody to keep in mind
though you want to pick up a nexus 4
it's best to test an unlock device to
see if you're gonna get decent speeds 20
100 million power battery was able to
get me through a full day of usage but i
found it drained really fast now
shooting pictures went outside of eight
percent left and after about 15 minutes
a phone turned completely off i
generally ilde pretty well too so i
wasn't able to pick that up in the
morning with a bit of charge left
overall though even though it doesn't
run on a 4g LTE network it does have a
power-hungry quad-core processors you're
gonna want to keep your charger by on
long trips so what's final verts on the
nexus 4 it's a great phone missing some
things we'd love it to have if you're
looking for a device that's going to get
the latest android update for the next
few years and look no further than the
nexus 4 but if you want LTE you want
more storage you might want to look at
the droid DNA the 1x the 1x plus or a
bevy of other
right options out there galaxy s trigger
even the little bit older galaxy nexus 4
right now I'm John render from

and greatest tech news I'll say the next
video bye bye
