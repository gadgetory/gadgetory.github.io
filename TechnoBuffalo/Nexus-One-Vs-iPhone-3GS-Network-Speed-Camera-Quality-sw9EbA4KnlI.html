and welcome to round two of the Nexus
One versus the iPhone 3GS two of the
arguably hottest smartphones on the
market right now in the last edition we
covered a ton of categories in this one
we're going to cover network speed on
t-mobile 3G service and AT&amp;amp;T 3G service
as well as camera quality both still and
video let's go ahead and get started let
me preface this with saying that network
speed is going to vary depending on
where you are I'm currently in Southern
California this is representative of
just a Southern California market actual
speeds and they vary depending on where
you're located so I've got five bars of
t-mobile 3G on the Nexus One and five
bars of 18 G 3G on the iPhone 3GS let's
load up some web pages and these are
sites that have been loaded on the
devices before so be representative of
the load speed that you'll get from
websites that you visit on a regular
basis so go ahead and keep both of these
up and we'll load TechnoBuffalo comm and
in the last test we ran Wi-Fi speeds you
saw the Nexus One was a bit fast from
curious how it's gonna translate over
cellular networks give low fees ready to
go alright guy TechnoBuffalo queued up
on each let's go ahead and get started
should I hit him at the same time and
we're off you can follow the progress
via the yellow bar top on the Nexus One
or the blue bar in the address box of
the iPhone 3GS you look both to be
pretty similar the iPhones explain
content first both are almost exactly
the same now
and the iphone 3gs is done and the Nexus
One finished just a second or two after
that so they were both pretty close but
the iPhone definitely won although not
by much
okay so now we're going to travel it up
another webpage we're gonna load up my
youtube channel youtube.com slash John
for Lakers a lot of images on there so
may take a little bit longer to load
let's go ahead and check it out get him
started at the same time and they're
both off and again this is on
t-mobile's 3G for the Nexus One and 18
T's 3G for the iPhone 3GS it's like the
Nexus One it's already done and the
iPhone 3GS is still taking its time to
load the site and now it's done so there
the Nexus One had a very clear advantage
loading TechnoBuffalo the iPhone barely
won by loading the YouTube channel the
Nexus One won handily in about seven of
the ten pages I tested the Nexus One
loaded them up significantly faster so I
wanted to see if that was due to a
faster t-mobile network or perhaps that
could be attributed to the faster
processor let's go ahead and check it
out so I ran these tests a little bit
earlier over the t-mobile 3G network I
averaged just about 304 kilobits per
second and on AT&amp;amp;T 3G network I was
getting over 600 kilobits per second so
almost twice as fast but that increased
network speed wasn't translating to
faster load times so I have to attribute
it to the Brody upgraded hardware that's
ramming the Nexus One it's got a 400
megahertz faster processor and the ramen
ramen it is quite fast and a pretty
ample so I think that's really the
difference between it behind the Nexus
ones increased load times next
generation iPhone perhaps a faster
processor the parody might not be there
but certainly right now the Nexus One
due to its better Hardware loads webpage
is much quicker now let's go ahead and
take a look at camera quality both still
and video of the two devices the Nexus
One shoots 720 by 480 with 20 frames per
second whereas the iPhone shoots at VGA
resolution up to 30 frames per second
these were shot at exactly the same time
at a on exactly the same subjects you
get a very fair comparison
which quality you prefer I wanted to
show you some highlights situations as
well so you can get a sense of what it
looked like in that particular
environment we're gonna take a look now
at some still images using the Nexus
ones five megapixel sensor versus the
iPhone 3GS is 3.2 and you guys can be
the judge which one you prefer</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
