intro so what's up everyone jon
rettinger from technobuffalo here today
Google held a chrome announcement where
they covered everything from Chrome OS
to Chrome browser to web stores and
really everything in between so I want
to recap all the chrome enos that went
down today let's go ahead and get
started if you see me look down so they
got some notes in front of me the press
conference just ended so let's start
with the browser let's go ahead take
with chrome so they announced chrome 9
they can give a date for when it's going
to come but they did show some the cool
features chrome 9 is going to have
including instant search now in Chrome's
omnibox very similar to what you see on
google's instant search can go to
google.com but it's now going to be in
Chrome's omnibox gonna learn a little
bit better the websites that you visit
which could be good and bad depending on
how many people use your computer they
also announced something called
crankshaft which sounds surprisingly
dirty it's going to give you two times
improvement in JavaScript speed which is
awesome chrome is really known for its
feed and now it's going to get even
faster they claim that chrome 9 will be
100 times faster then internet explorer
was in 2008 2008 was a long time ago I
didn't really see that as being a valid
claim but 100 times faster than anything
is great chrome 9 is going to be
lightening quick it's also going to have
some new built-in PDF reading
functionality so if you review documents
quite a bit no longer have to open them
or open with or save as you can view
them right in the web browser kind of
cool or no need to go to Google Docs
preview or any of that kind of business
ah they also going to be updating the
Chrome Web Store I think of this as web
apps like you can have on your android
phone your iPad or your iPhone now right
in your browser's you're going to be
saying or aren't there web apps you just
go to a website and plan uh it's going
to have sort of icons that are going to
launch the app right inside of the
browsers think of the browser as the
platform for these appliqu√©
to run or the operating system and
applications are going to run in a web
apps that are going to be available it's
actually gonna be rolling out today
include offerings from NPR New York
Times amazon and a few other they don't
look like they'll focus on gaming but
there could potentially be some more web
based games coming out soon amazon also
showed a new kindle applications are
going to be launching in the Chrome Web
Store it's not going to be coming out
for a little while ice and sometimes in
2011 give and I are going to be able to
view all of your kindle books it's going
to work inside of the whispersync and
kindle ecosystem so you'd be able to get
all your books reading from your bread
browser with a little bit more relative
ease and what we had before it ought to
have the limitations that you had also
without the previous versions of the
kindle webster be able to get full books
and access to all of your content so
let's talk about the new operating
system burying the chrome a name
appropriately called chrome OS we
finally have some details on this guy
was announced quite a while ago we've
seen previews of it essentially what it
is it's a cloud based operating system
in cloud just means information stored
on a server so while there is a local
operating system loaded on a machine
it's going to rely really almost heavily
and close to exclusively on being online
and connecting all of your information
let me go ahead and tell you what I mean
so first again it is going to be
cloud-based to set up a new Chrome OS
machines couldn't take four steps and
less than one minute to do so think of
it when you get a new android phone you
type in your Google information it pulls
in your contacts your email your
calendar it's going to be that same sort
of thing but now for an operating system
so all your contact information whatever
you have sunk to the Google cloud so to
speak is going to be put right on to
your desktop so some of the things that
we learn new about Chrome OS it's going
to support multiple accounts so if you
want to use it in your wife or
girlfriend mom or dad one easier account
they'll be able to log into their own a
google account and get access to all of
their information not yours in the
home OS experience so because everything
stored online really there isn't that
much store locally you're gonna be able
to segment what people can get on the
desktop so the hardware that they demoed
I was just demo hardware but it did
return from sweet almost instantaneously
ghostrider limited only by the speed of
your hand to turn this thing on it was
really really lightning quick so kind of
cool and taking of those guest accounts
when they log in this can also be an
incognito mode so everything that the
guest is using will be destroyed on
logout will be no record of it so you
can use that for whatever you would like
it's also going to be an offline mode of
course what if you don't have internet
access which we'll talk about in just a
minute Google Docs be shown running off
when I don't just kind of neat build us
do all of your word processing right on
Google Docs and not have to worry about
being connected once you do connect
online it'll sink that right up the
offline mode it's going to be really apt
specific and the apps are going to be
coded using html5 with specific
requirements in order to run in the
background kind of interesting google
also showed a new feature called cloud
print which is going to let you print to
your home network computer from anywhere
you are which is a really neat feature
you don't have to be on your home
network to print but you can print from
anywhere you are and pick it up soon as
you get home could be kind of cool for
up for pictures and some documents so
how are you going to get online well
that's where verizon comes in you've
sorted hearing their name popping up
everywhere connected devices google and
verizon they're going to give you a free
hundred megabytes of data per day to use
with your Chrome OS so for the mostly
just for seeking your information and
probably some light web browsing however
of course they know you're probably
going to want to use more than that
hundred megabytes for free and of course
there's Wi-Fi built in so you can use
your Wi-Fi network that any charge but
they're also going to be a 999 plan
available per day for unlimited access
no contracts required you can manage it
right from your computer so you don't
decided to you
use it whenever you choose use it one
day not use the next day since it is a
verizon relying on cdma network it's
going to be available just in aus for
right now certain international launch
plans are imminent but nothing has been
announced quite yet well Google did talk
about a lot of really cool features
coming to Chrome OS the operating system
itself is still very much in the oven
not yet fully cooked in the most recent
build we still don't have the USB
support so don't expect that any time
soon in the most recent developer
versions other also are still a ton of
bugs and kinks to be ironed out and
worked out so why did you know to get
your hands on a Chrome OS laptop or
device the answer is going to be
mid-2011 we will see intel based
machines from samsung and acer google
also showed a developer platform similar
to what you'd say would be the nexus one
equivalent on Android called the cr-48
all the specs of these a strand seems
like machines we don't really know yet I
think of Chrome OS is very very very
much a light operating system I don't
think it's something you can be able to
use on a regular basis for me not gonna
be for power users or gamers but there
is something to be said for the folks
that just want browser based computing
so you want to just to work you want it
to be quick it's almost like the reasons
why you would use a tablet for example I
use an iPad when you want the
information to be there to be fast to
sync and to be very easy navigate use
I'm not sure who the target demographic
for Chrome OS is going to be I think
that is still yet to be carved out but
there is no doubt that it's an appealing
platform it's going to draw a lot of
interest whether or not it's got legs
the same itself in this very crowded sea
of operating systems from windows 7 and
OS 10 and now with all these new tablet
os's is Google competing with themselves
we're going to see a ton of
android-based tablets with the next
edition of Android Honeycomb we already
see it now with froyo as Android can
really are as Google rather going to be
consuming themselves and competing with
themselves for market share I think
that's going to be one of the most
interesting developments so what do you
guys think about Chrome OS are you
did not excited you cannot wait to get
your hands on a viable web based
operating system ord rather stick with
your desktop platform I really want to
hear from you anyway guys I am jon
rettinger from TechnoBuffalo and I'll
see in the next video bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
