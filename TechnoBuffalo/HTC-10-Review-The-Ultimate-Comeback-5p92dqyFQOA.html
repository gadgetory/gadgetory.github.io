rented from TechnoBuffalo here with the
latest from HTC the same they've had a
rough few years would probably be an
understatement
I'm in our previous HTC 10 video we did
a 5 things you should know and the
feedback need to be really positive
people liked the phone and wanted to
know more about it so know more about it
you shall this is our full review of the
HTC 10 HTC has come a long way in their
design and the HTC 10 is a culmination
of those years and years of experience
the phone feels incredible in the hand
you've got that aluminium building you
get the feeling you're holding a premium
device that carries along to the side of
the device I really like the textured
power button for example but not all is
roses chocolate and unicorns in design
standpoint well I really like the 12
megapixel shooter on the back of the
camera I don't like dim humps so I read
the comments on our fighting soon about
the HTC 10 a lot of you were talking
about the sham Ford Edge is on the
design and there were suffice to say a
bit polarizing I'm not the biggest fan
but they look exaggerated in pictures
and video check out the device for
yourself and then make your judgment
hooray for HTC for finally adding a
fingerprint sensor on a flagship device
and this one works incredibly well but
what it's not is a depressed bull body
it does work as a home button but it
doesn't move internal storage these are
32 or 64 gigs before you get all mad
that's gonna be it external storage is
here HTC spent 4 pages in the press kit
talking about audio quality and they've
always brought the boom so to speak
instead of me talking to you about
24-bit high res audio and telling you
how incredible their headphone
supposedly sound let me just tell you my
experience has been with it first those
headphones plugging on the top but they
sound really incredible when you do
listen to them also the new boom sound
speakers are incredibly solid they've a
separated tweeter and woofer design
which is weird thing to say about a
phone and that's gonna lead to just
really good audio I'm not gonna spend
too much time on performance it's got a
Snapdragon 820 and 4 gigs of rams
so do the math it's fast but because I
know benchmarks are didn't happen
quadrant was 42,000 492 and then 2 to
150 2747 where performance was
surprising up Stan
was on the screen and nothing I've
really noticed on other phones it worked
and I touch the screen things moved this
almost seemed like it was moving before
I touch the screen really fast so if you
just glanced the camera specs on the HTC
10 you might think it was kind of
pedestrian but on the higher end of
advert HTC past 12,000,000 ultrapixels
into that and what that fancy marketing
talk is gonna mean you're gonna get a
hundred and thirty five percent more
light than the outgoing HTC phone all
that coupled with an F one pointed
aperture and you're going to get
absolutely gorgeous shots the laser
autofocus focused incredibly fast the
pictures look beautiful and normal
outside light they look great inside
office light surprisingly good in
low-light definitely was some
artifacting but it didn't look too bad I
would say this camera ranks absolutely
up there with the iPhone 6s and on par
if not maybe slightly below I consider
the king of the smartphone camera world
the galaxy s7 I was also really
surprised how quickly I was able to take
pictures the shutter speed was really
fast the camera though is about more
than just taking nice pictures it's also
can shoot video and it can do it in 4k
with 24-bit high res audio the 4k video
looks absolutely outstanding and the OIS
worked really well but that's not the
only camera with oh is the front facing
five megapixel sensor also has it built
in if you'd like to tweak your pictures
the auto modes just not for you know
that the ten is gonna shoot in raw and
it's pro mode gives you really granular
control over a lot of settings you get
in a DSLR on the software front it's
running Android case in case you didn't
know that it's based off sixth on Oh dot
one and like me sense has lost a lot of
weight HTC took a ton of bloatware out
of here so save for the app drawer and
settings they really let Android be
Android something I very much appreciate
it a few things here that are nice
you've got steaming built in they have a
secondary home screen called freestyle
which lets you replace apps with
stickers it's kind of neat I didn't
really use it very much but I tried it
and also this is the first Android phone
that supports airplay although we were
not able to get that to work in our test
one of the most important features for a
phone for me is battery life it's really
make-or-break feature the HTC 10 has a
3000 milliamp hour value later before
you get caught up on the milliamp hours
what matters is how it's gonna perform
with the phone itself battery life was
absolutely outstanding for me I was
easily able to get through a full day
and the things you'd expect from a
modern phone are here including quick
charge 3.0 but what's not here just to
know is wireless charging the big
accessory HTC is having with their 10 is
the ice view case and if you like flip
up cases this is probably the best one
out there I love you can access the
camera to having to flip the case open
answer phone calls to other information
it works well for me though I don't like
flip open cases but that's your jam then
let your freak flag fly you're gonna
love the ice view case I've been tough
on HTC or the past few years to think
they deserve it but I will say when
things are good if you couldn't tell I
really liked the 10 HTC built an
incredible phone with the latest specs
that come together in a really awesome
package this phone absolutely gets a buy
for me if you want a phone that's gonna
feel great in the hands have a killer
camera a great screen will ask you for a
year two years
I really think look no farther than the
HTC 10 pick it up I don't think away
disappointed what do you guys think are
you buying one you're not buying one
you're buying something else let us know
why in the comments down below and be
nice to each other down there be civil
if the video thumbs up we always
appreciate it until next time I'm John
Ranger from Jack no Buffalo it's not the
guy's neck video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
