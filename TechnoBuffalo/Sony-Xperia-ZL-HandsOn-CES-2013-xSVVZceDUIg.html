weird here that here at the Sony Xperia
ZL this is another smartphone from Sony
that was announced today and is packing
some pretty cool specifications all
around it's got a 1.5 gigahertz
quad-core Snapdragon s4 cpu with 2
gigabytes of ram 5 inch full HD 1080 x
1920 display with an ohmic Ravi engine 2
also has a 13 megapixel camera with
1080p HD recording 4G LTE battery
stamina mode a lot of different cool
features so this is kind of the CL is
opposed to the Z you can see the designs
a little bit different here power button
still on the side cameras or gut button
and volume rocker still on the right
type of design wise a little bit
different than what we've seen for
previous bills of Sony even with the
Xperia Z and your kind of seeing a
revised version of Sony's Timescape user
interface as well with some new features
like own order up top where you can
customize stuff alphabetical happens to
be my favorite so we'll roll with that
on-screen buttons on this device with a
5-inch display you should be more than
fine operating it another great thing
about this the NFC capabilities great
functionality between sony products and
services keep that in mind got something
sony's really pushing in 2013 they kind
of pushed in 2012 really pushing it this
time around it's all about connectivity
synchronization amongst the park
company's products and services so we'll
see if it fits the bill hopefully it'll
come to this
even locked a techno bubble
here at sea maker companies hang up oh
boy
thanks to Ford for powering our CES
coverage
