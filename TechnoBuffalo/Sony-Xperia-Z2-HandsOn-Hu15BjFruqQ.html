from old world congress I'm here in
Barcelona Spain checking out the Xperia
z2 it just announced today if you've
used Xperia devices in the past and
saying like the z1 even then see get a
real familiar look to the device and you
get a lot of the same sort of features
so it's like water-resistant you got the
covered ports on the left up top you've
got the 3.5 millimeter headphone jack on
the right you've got the covered micro
SD card slot and the power button in
addition to the volume controls which
are just kind of oddly placed to be
honest on the phone itself I've got
KitKat running on it
that's a 5.2 inch display it's 1080p so
slightly larger than before but you can
also get triluminos technology x-reality
Sony's others so the camera on the back
is pretty sweet it's capable of 40 2k
and 4k video but it's a twenty point
seven megapixel Exmor RS capture her
sensor rather and then up front you've
got a two megapixel camera that we've
seen before otherwise you've got NFC
onboard Wi-Fi miracast under the hood
it's a Snapdragon 801 processor it's
quad core and it's clocked at 2.3
gigahertz also three gigs of ram 16 gigs
of expandable storage obviously with
that micro sd card on the side and a
3200 milliamp hour battery it also has
the charging pin on the bottom that
we've that we've seen before so mostly
it reminds us a lot of the z1 actually
it's just sort of an upgrade in some of
the internals some camera features and
stuff like that but otherwise pretty
pretty much what you'd expect from a
Sony Xperia device these days it's a
nice flagship though and the screen
doesn't appear to have that sort of
I guess kind of like murky look at some
of the other waterproof devices too but
you can see that this thing is just
grabbing fingerprints I mean we're at a
show but everything is covered and I
wiped it before I even started so any
case quick look here at the Xperia z2 is
