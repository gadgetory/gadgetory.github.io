to you by the Jackalopes of jack threads
welcome back to another episode of ask
the Buffalo this is a tech show where
you can ask any question that you have
from the wide wide world of technology
you do for an upgrade on your cell phone
contract not sure where to go or if you
should switch carriers this is where you
can ask it not sure what tablets grace
your backpack this is where you can ask
on this week's ask the Buffalo we're
going to talk about iphone 5 rumors
we're going to talk about the next
generation ipod touch windows fans don't
worry we're going to discuss windows 8
and everything in between from the world
of technology this is asked to Buffalo
let's good start alright so let's go
ahead and jump right in our first
question come from user the sequin kid
he wants to know hey John I can upgrade
in three months should I wait for the
next iPhone I should i get an android
device from verizon you think the next
iphone will have 4G LTE connectivity to
you i say yes the next iphone will have
4g LTE connectivity but we're probably
not going to see it till april we are on
the precipice of new phones we see
android phones release all the time but
generally the specs for the same dual
core dual cool dual core now we're
starting to see dual core HD screen dual
core HD screen but we are finally
getting ready to see a jump to quad-core
us this is a great time to wait just a
little bit for quad core phones to come
to verizon and we're hearing that they
will be coming in the coming months they
will be here in the coming months it's a
more eloquent way to say it however if
you feel like you've got to jump in and
get a new phone because you need
something shiny to play with definitely
if you're gonna stick with verizon go
for the galaxy nexus or if battery super
important to you obviously the droid
razr maxx a lot of fuss has been made
about carriers and manufacturers not
pushing updates to folks devices I what
I want to say to those and them speaking
particularly about Android users when
you buy a phone assume that you're not
getting any updates make sure you
happy with the phone the day you buy it
because it really is no guarantee that
you're going to get the next version of
android or get in any sort of timely
fashion incremental updates to Android
certainly wonderful but they're not
going to come to every single phone
every single screen size every single
resolution on every single carrier make
sure you are happy from day one with
your phone assume that you could live
with that phone as is for two years and
if your answer is yes sure can be very
happy with your purchase alright so our
next question comes from costes
villalopolis I'm sorry that I'm as a
courage name he simply asked hey John
what's your opinion on Windows 8 for
tablets I am a huge proponent of Windows
8 for tablets I've tried windows 8 for
tablets and it works really well it's
essentially a metro UI skin sitting on
top of it looks like a window so an
interface if you're careful and you do
it just right you never have to see that
windows seven interface and you get what
amounts to a giant windows phone 7 with
desktop quality apps that's really the
big thing here desktop quality apps
people have been talking a lot about
post-pc era this brings all the
capabilities of a regular pc so what you
get on you know your home desktop or
laptop to a tablet without really any
limitations so I'm very very excited
about Windows 8 coming hopefully
sometime in octoberish going from one
hard name to pronounce to the next and
user Henry saga naseeb wants to talk
iPod Touch do you think the next
generation ipod touch will have Siri the
very least voice dictation yes I think
most definitely it will have voice
dictation surprisingly we didn't see
full-blown Siri make its way on the new
iPad I just avoid this voice dictation
ordinarily I'd say series a no brainer
but seeing what Apple did with the new
iPad I don't know it's a very least
you'll absolutely see voice dictation on
it hopefully that helped answer your
questions and now is the time to show
when I get a chance to say thank you and
tell you about some awesome stuff I
don't want to tell you about the folks
at Jackthreads only paying full price is

techno and you'll get instant access go
ahead sign up and get all your gear the
next question comes from a name I can
pronounce the dude Sarah wants to know
which phony should get on AT&amp;amp;T he's
asking i'm starting a new contract with
AT&amp;amp;T and i'm torn between the galaxies
notes and the iphone 4s in your opinion
which is a better choice for a two-year
contract and why this is a battle right
here we got android we got iOS battling
head-to-head if I to pick one phone to
use for two years I would pick the
Galaxy Note primarily due to LTE
connectivity I love that giant screen on
the galaxy note I like having the option
for the s-pen I just really enjoyed
using the whole phone as a hold it's a
great package the iphone 4s is a
wonderful phone as well it's got a great
operating system I'm not the biggest fan
of that now seemingly small screen size
but you have iOS or you live in the
apple ecosystem is a great phone the
lack of 4G LTE connectivity is
definitely a big deal for me so flee
that helped answer your question so our
last question comes from user Josh who
wants to know hey John I was wondering
when we're going to see a technobuffalo
iphone or android app i'll tell you a
secret as long as you guys promise to
keep it between us we're working on
applications but first before we launch
your applications working on a total
site redesign what you're hoping is
going to look not only awesome but also
badass so it's got to match those two
things we're working we're targeting
sometime before the end of the year to
launch that and applications shortly
actress hopefully that helped answer
your question Josh I hope you guys
