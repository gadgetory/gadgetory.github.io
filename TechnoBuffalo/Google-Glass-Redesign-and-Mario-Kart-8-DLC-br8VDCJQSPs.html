to you by godaddy what's up everyone
welcome back there pisode of rumor
roundup i'ma ghost John renters to show
we round up all the rumors from the week
quit obviously and I serve them to you
in one video so you know everything that
could be coming might be coming I might
someday be coming up this week 128 gig
iphone 6 mario kart 8 getting some
much-needed dlc google glass get a
little less nerdy and sonia's the latest
flagship is on its way and sooner than
you might think turn me round up let's
start rounding them up so before i get
to the rumors we're trying something new
here in the office if you guys don't
know we are moving into a new office
sometime the end of next month i will
have a full studio we're sort of trying
one of our early studio sets here in the
new studio you're not gonna have a white
wall behind me there will be stuff going
on back there we just want to see how it
looks get some early feedback on it
weird experiment with some new things
before our moves case you're wondering
why it's all super white and sterile
it's because we're just trying something
new so the first thing i want to talk
about is the iphone 6 I've left it alone
in a run up for a little while but it's
time to bring that sucker back so Apple
was slowly increased storage capacity of
its iPhones but is yet to surpass
anything more than 64 gigabytes of
storage it looks like though that might
change very very soon if you believe a
set of iphone 6 schematics leaked on the
ever-reliable chinese social network
Weibo in that Apple is going to offer a
big daddy very at 128 gigabytes which is
a lot of cat videos lick schematics
apparently show Apple of sourcing
storage units for the iphone 6 and it
looked like toshiba taking care of 128
gigabyte modules on its own while small
handful of companies are pitching in to
provide at 16 gigabyte and 64 gigabyte
units there's no mention of a 32
gigabyte flash module suggesting Apple
might still offer the three options
rumours 128 gig phone have been around
for a really really long time with one
recent report claiming a flow might
Apple might offer the extra storage
option only on the Big Daddy 5.5 inches
we're just calling the 6 l pretty sure
though Apple won't let you addict or
gender Oh any time soon so it's pretty
important the apple offers as much
stored as possible right out of the box
hoping
for much much more storage on the cheap
side but it's Apple so probably not
going to happen anytime soon as a fun
side note when Apple first launched the
iphone in 2007 they bought the entire
supply chain of solid-state storage from
Samsung oddly enough essentially they
monopolize solid-state storage the
better part of two years which is why I
took competitor so long to get to the
phones with larger storage out case you
were wondering I'd also kept a price
down for apple on the solid state drives
we kept the price is up for anybody else
who want the solid state track during
the course of that year to 18 months fun
bit of economic history so from Apple
let's go to Nintendo which the
transition I don't think that I've ever
made it looks like some files found
within the mario kart data suggest that
gamers are in store for dlc the near
future and I'm not just talking about
the cilia Mercedes carts that are coming
so it all started with a thread on the
appropriately named mario kart wii
composted by a user named morton which
is also my favorite character and mario
cry like a nigga bad that included this
image you were seeing right here and hey
those cups don't look familiar they just
play soldiers mistreating information I
don't know but looking like we're gonna
get those ghosts cup weird shaped cups
and other cups coming very very very
soon she'll be awesome we do you know
that Nintendo has been pretty open about
what they're in meebo line is going to
bring two games they'll support it when
you buy one of their little figurines
it's gonna unlock content each of a
compatible game if that content and
mario kart 8 is actually tracks and cups
i would jump so fast to buy that you
would not even say be like just like a
flash you just like smoke behind me for
now that would 40 take this with the
obligatory grain of salt we played Mario
Cart all the time on our twitch channel
which I said well you should check out
twitch.tv / i canna buffett link down
below we twitch every day slows in
google glass isn't for everybody still
in beta so the Explorer program
everybody's rushing to it's not a
consumer product yet but it looks kinda
geeky to have that big ass camera stick
out on your eye looks like it's going to
get a little less nerdy I'm gonna come
to Google glass there's a lots of love
but design I don't think is one of them
even working with one of the companies
world top fashion designers could
not shed the device is geeky geeky image
but a new patent from google reveals one
way the company couldn't prove the way
glass flicks in the very near future the
patent which was submitted back in the
yonder years of 2012 and words at Google
just last week doesn't actually mention
glass by name instead describing a
theoretical wearable display device that
sits on your face like a regular set of
glasses what could it be the difference
here those technologies clearly on a
display the current version of Google
glass gets tucked away out of sight
though it's unclear at the model
described here would include a built-in
camera and some of the other features
offered by google glass currently if
Google ever wants to bring glass to
mainstream market which we know if they
ever do give me to switch from the
current design which is hideous to
something a little more subtle the
images you're staying right here
definitely do that without saying the
company needs ditched gambar speaker the
earphone all the rest of stuff it's got
the google glass cool a controversial at
the same but it might be worth
considering a less invasive design at
the very very least i don't know am i
alone on that I think glass looks super
silly and you mean coined the name in
glass whole software is for quick sec
think the peeps at GoDaddy fall ways had
an idea to build a website now is when
you should probably do it you can go to
godaddy.com and get a domain for just a
dollar in 99 cents just enter promo code
199 techno a check out super cheap get
your site on some limitations might
apply those to check out the website for
full details last but definitely not
least Sony's phones have been pretty hot
recently and you get to I can throw them
in water cuz they're waterproof we've
already seen the Xperia z3 leaked out a
few times the summer but with Sony
expected to unveil its brand new
flagship phone these two flagship phone
of the quarter early next month fresh
link appears reveal everything there is
to know about the device upcoming
smartphone recently passed through tena
te nna which is basically China's FCC
really most of the z3 is hardware along
with a few sexy photos of the guy
working out various oddly enough the
Xperia z3 actually looks off for the
same specs of zitu including pretty nice
looking 5.3 inch 1080p display 20.7
megapixel camera 3 gigs or and 16 gigs
of storage and slightly faster version
the Snapdragon 801 design also seems
pretty similar out of today's 10
confirmed it should be slightly thinner
and lighter these smartphones also
expected to feature slightly rounded
edges compared to the z2 looks like the
device will come in black and white
color variants pretty common right now
so waiting on fishel announcement from
sony confirming the z3 although that
probably won't happen until next month
at IFA which of course we will be there
covering everything about so check out
the site we're full coverage on that
sucker I love personal it's gonna be
hard for me to ever go back the android
device not running cyanogen at least one
