we have four rounds ago and the ps3 is
in the lead with the single point round
nine is up next and in this round I'll
be making an in-depth comparison between
multi-platform games I'll be analyzing
the games in terms of graphics and
performance so get ready for yet another
very exciting round of the console forms
I know what you're thinking
it's common knowledge that xbox360
titles have been superior compared to
their ps3 counterparts in the past but
has that changed after three years
surely game dopers have figured out the
kinks of the ps3 by now because
exclusive games on the ps3 are starting
to look fantastic
I know a lot of you are going to pull
the Uncharted 2 and God of War 3 cards
in the comments but the fact of the
matter is that the majority of games
released and sold on both consoles are
multi-platform games so no matter how
good exclusive games may look don't
expect any compensation points from
exclusive games in this particular round
but let's cut the chatter and get to it
the first game we're looking at is one
of my favorite games of last fall
Rocksteady Studios surprise it Batman
Arkham Asylum if you've played Arkham
Asylum you know that it looks great on
all platforms but some are their
graphical and performance difference
between xbox 360 and ps3 versions let's
find out at a quick glance you won't
notice much difference but when taking a
closer look we notice that the Xbox 360
burner has slightly better anti-aliasing
sorry I mean anti-aliasing I got some
flack for my pronunciation in the GP
around potato patato
I think you got what I meant so the
slight anti-aliasing on the Xbox 360
soft and some of the rougher edges but
apart from that the games look almost
identical there is some subtle screen
tearing in both versions of the game but
nothing that will take away from the
gameplay experience but a major
difference that repeats itself in pretty
much every game in favor of the Xbox 360
are black levels previous to owning both
consoles I watched some comparison
videos of the two consoles and I always
notice that the ps3 versions of the
games look a bit lighter in terms of
contrast I assume that this was the
settings or connection issue but the
fact of the matter is no matter what the
connections be at HDMI or component
super white and RGB expand switch on or
off on the ps3 the Xbox 360 video signal
always seem to have better black levels
and this translates into deeper looking
shadows and better overall color depth
on the Xbox 360 if you have a higher-end
TV you may be able to compensate with
your TV settings but I for one was not
able to match the levels of black I see
on the Xbox 360 with the ps3 so
keen-eyed video files like myself will
enjoy slightly better black levels on
xbox 360
of games but the difference isn't
anything to write home about because
it's also a matter of taste Batman
Arkham Asylum looks great on both
consoles in fact it's hard to spot any
significant differences but I would say
that the framerate feels slightly
smoother during intense fight scenes on
the Xbox 360
overall Xbox 360 takes Arkham Asylum but
the differences are so subtle that I
cannot recommend both console versions
of the finest Batman game made to date
modern warfare 2 is undoubtedly the
biggest multi-platform game of recent
times the game is sold over 15 million
copies since last November and is on the
track to being the best-selling game of
all time so how do the ps3 and xbox 360
versions stack up for the most part
Infinity Ward has done a fantastic job
technically on the game
it's almost flawless on both platforms a
minor complaint against both versions is
that the game runs at a sub AC
resolution but thankfully the
anti-aliasing cleans up most of the
rough edges both versions of the game
seem to have identical textures but the
Xbox 360 is better black levels bring
out more contrast and detail out of the
textures it also seems that the ps3
version of the game is a bit more subtle
in the lighting effects Department the
Xbox 360 version has gloom lighting
throughout the game where the ps3 is
missing the effect completely the
differences aren't massive but again
it's a clear victory for the Xbox 360
next up is Dante's Inferno visceral
games received some praise for the last
game the excellent dead space their new
game Dante's Inferno is I think a pretty
solid game is an action-packed hack and
slash with some religious undertones the
game only has two major flaws firstly
the game at its core keenly resembled
the first two god of war games and
secondly launching a game that pretty
much looks and plays like God of War a
mere month before God of War 3 is
released is in my opinion an utter waste
but in any case I have to say the
visceral games had done a fantastic job
on the cross-platform release of Dante's
Inferno
it's one of the very few games that look
practically identical on both platforms
the textures the shader effects the
framerate the amount of aliasing is
pretty much the same on both consoles
and I really can't make a distinction
here so graphics and performance wise
Dante's Inferno is a tie I can recommend
the game for Xbox 360 owners but for ps3
gamers
recommend getting God of War three
before you consider Dante's Inferno
because it's just around the corner
Darksiders is a game that has some of
the same flaws as Dante's Inferno it's
always tough releasing a new IP when a
looming giant of the same genre is
launched in the same quarter but in any
case Darksiders is a multi-platform game
released by THQ and they also did a very
good job on the cross-platform release
because the games look almost identical
the texture the shader effects and
anti-aliasing are all equal but to my
surprise the ps3 version actually runs a
bit smoother than the Xbox 360 version
which also suffers event from noticeable
screen tearing this is quite a rare
result because I have not seen many ps3
versions of multi-platform games run
smoother and their Xbox 360 counterparts
so the ps3 takes Darksiders for overall
better performance
the next game is a title that has caused
some controversy because of claims
relating to a bad port or the ps3 and
unfortunately this is exactly the case
Bayonetta has to be one of the worst PS
reports in recent memory the ps3 version
suffers from bland textures a choppy
framerate and some serious aliasing some
of you may consider the comparing of
Bayonetta as unfair as it's known to be
a bad port but the fact is the Banat is
not the only game that is significantly
worse on the ps3 and it's definitely a
viable example of what you can expect
from some multi-platform games lazy
programmers are not ps3 owners will
suffer for bad ports more often than
Xbox 360 owners Bayonetta is a game that
demands a high and constant framerate
and the ps3 version does not provide use
the sequel to Bad Company was just
released in the beginning of March and
it looks pretty decent on both consoles
there's an astounding sense of realism
in the game destructible environments
and the colors are nicely desaturated
for the rough and gritty visual style of
war you see in more epics like Saving
Private Ryan the first game was rushed
to the market and both console versions
suffered a bit from screen tearing and
the ps3 version suffered a bit more but
I'm happy to say that the sequel has
received some graphical and performance
improvements on both platforms the game
still runs on the same cross bite game
engine but everything has been tweaked a
bit and the game seemingly runs better
and definitely looks better and I'm also
quite glad to say that the textures the
dynamic lighting effects particle
effects and explosion look equally good
on both platforms but still I definitely
do notice some more screen tearing on
the ps3 version of the game I also
noticed the better black levels on the
Xbox 360 version really added the
graphical and visual style of bad
company 2 but yet again the differences
are so subtle that it's nothing for the
Xbox 360 fanboys to boast over but a
result is a result in the Xbox 360
version of bad company 2 runs and looks
better next up is Need for Speed Shift
racing games have always been amongst
the best and worst looking games on all
platforms you find your console defining
racing games and some god-awful piece of
crap
luckily Need for Speed Shift is one of
the best-looking racing games out there
and when I saw the TV commercial for
Need for Speed Shift I thought wow
there's the Mona Lisa of racing games
well the actual game turned out to be
more of a cheap knockoff but still the
game does look good I especially enjoyed
the depth of field and motion blur
effects that really add to the illusion
in speed but which console version of
the game looks and performs better and
right after that I see the Xbox 360
Burton has better anti-aliasing and the
game runs at a higher framerate
anti-aliasing on the ps3 is a bit more
of a blur effect it really takes away
from the sharp curve to cool cars the
effect also seems to blur out most of
the textures as well which gives a huge
graphical benefit to the Xbox 360 bring
the lower frame rate of the ps3 burn
literally takes away at higher space and
it seemed to affect response time of the
controls overall the better graphics and
stable framerate make the Xbox 360
version of Need for Speed shift hands
down the version of choice some of you
may remember a couple years back there
was some controversy about EA sports
games Xbox 360 versions ran at 60 frames
per second as ps3 versions ran only at
30 frames per second ps3 fanboys were
not happy that were bodies left and
right on the eSports got scorched pretty
badly
luckily fanboys are short in their anger
and all was forgotten after ps3 versions
started to run at 60 frames per second
and oh nine versions of EA sports games
so where are we now for three years I'm
happy to say that Peter Moores EA team
has done a good job making both console
versions graphically equal so while it
may have been that the Xbox 360 versions
of EA sports game were superior in the
past the ps3 has now caught up and in
terms of performance and graphics the
games are now pretty much equal so it's
a tie for NHL 2010
Resident Evil 5 may have been released
over a year ago but I still consider it
to be one of the best looking games on
both consoles and the game does indeed
look great on both the Xbox 360 and ps3
the ps3 version of the game looks
slightly less saturated and some
textures look a bit softer framerate
also seems to take a small hit on the
ps3 when action gets hectic I notice
very little drop in frame rate on the
Xbox 360 version so once again I'm going
to have to give this round to the Xbox
360 get ready to get to the chop up
because the eternal fight between aliens
predators and colonial Orient's
continuing this latest installment of
AVP licensed games have the tendency to
to basically suck there are some
exceptions and for the most part AVP
games have written it along those lines
the game runs on the Unreal Engine 3
which I have to admit is starting to
look a bit outdated I'm not entirely
sure that the Benjen is the best choice
for the dark and brooding environments
of the game because everything just
looks a bit vague and blurry no matter
what the platform we have to decide the
winner here and I'm estimated the Xbox
360 looks a bit sharper in most aspects
the textures the lighting effects in
bump macking on a xenomorph infested
walls
bollocks sharper on the Xbox 360 both
versions of the game run and the stable
30 frames per second but I really can't
say that the graphics blow me away on
either console so it's a small victory
but it's pretty clear if the Xbox 360
take this one as well as you guys have
definitely not least is a game that once
was the ps3 exclusive
that was until Microsoft flash m-series
do--it Square Enix and persuaded the
franchise over to the Xbox 360 I think
Microsoft took out the old checkbook
just to prevent the ps3 from having
exclusivity of a game that may result in
Xbox 360 gamers jumping ship and joining
the ps3 bandwagon I think the core
audience of Final Fantasy has always
been on the PlayStation so I'm pretty
sure it's going to sell more on the ps3
but can the Xbox 360 version compete
with the once massive PSP exclusive and
the short answer is no Final Fantasy 13
is a massive game the game will last you
over 50 hours and 50 hours of
high-definition graphics
including textures we'll take a massive
toll on the disk space to be precise the
game takes up 40 gigabytes of a ps3
blu-ray disc and you can probably
calculate that it's not going to fit
over three DVDs which you find on the
Xbox 360 version of the game so what
they did to fit the game over three DVDs
is that the cutscenes are actually
running at 576p and upscale to high-def
so that's right the cutscenes on the
Xbox 360 version of the game are
actually running at a sub HD resolution
while on the ps3 the running at 1080p
and I can tell you that when playing the
game off a big 14 screen the differences
in detail are significant while the
major differences to the games can be
found in the cutscenes the transparency
and dithering effects on the hair of the
characters look much cleaner on the ps3
and it also seemed that there are less
shadow effects on the Xbox 360 version
of the game so for once it seemed that
the Xbox 360 has a mediocre port on its
hands Final Fantasy has a history of
being a PlayStation title and ps3 fans
will be happy to know that they will be
getting the best version of Final
Fantasy 13 as you guys have no doubt
noticed the trend of multi-platform Xbox
360 games running and looking better is
still ongoing the ps3 has played
catch-up but I can't say that I've come
across a multi-platform game that looks
significantly better on the ps3 and I
don't expect it the Xbox 360 has been
widely accepted as the main development
platform because of the reason I
explained in the GPU and CPU rounds for
one the Xbox 360 has the anti aliasing
benefit in some games for the embedded
dram secondly the Xbox 360 is easy to
code for because of the traditional
multi-core architecture and third the
Xbox 360 was first out of the gate and
it has larger market share even though
the ps3 could offer benefits like higher
detailed textures thanks to storage
space of blu-ray developers are not
going to be investing money and time
into making ps3 counterparts look any
better because ps3 game sales aren't
matching the game sales of their Xbox
360 counterparts so this may not come as
a surprise the Xbox 360 takes around
nine and the victory is well-deserved as
well the differences are subtle and the
gap between the different console
versions of games has become smaller the
differences are still very real and on
the average multi-platform games still
look better and run smoother on the Xbox
360 there are some exceptions but those
are few and far between the score is now
tied up at four in the next round we'll
be taking it
in-depth look and what the future has to
offer for both consoles so stay tuned
for the next round and just to clear up
