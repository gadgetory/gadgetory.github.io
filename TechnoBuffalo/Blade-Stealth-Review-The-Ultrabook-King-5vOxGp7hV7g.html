TechnoBuffalo and if you guys saw my
last video comparing the s7 edge and
iPhone 6 as cameras you saw I tease in
the beginning the razor blades stealth
and I said we were going to be reviewing
it so that's what I'm here with today
this last weekend I went up to Lake
Arrowhead with three devices one of
which was the razor blade stealth sadly
razor has not started chipping their
core which was released alongside the
blade stealth at CES it's basically an
external GPU that connects via
thunderbolt that will turn your
Ultrabook into a beast of a gaming and
editing machine pricing was announced on
the core earlier this week and it's
going to come in at $4.99 standalone and
399 if you buy it alongside the blade
stealth as soon as we get our hands on
one we will have a follow-up video
featuring that for you guys
first thing I want to address is the
build the Razer Blade stealth is made of
cnc aluminum which means it's extremely
solid and very very durable it comes in
at about 2.7 5 pounds so it's not the
lightest laptop and it feels kind of
heavy but it has a very nice weight to
it I'm a huge fan of the build and the
build really changes your experience
using this laptop bear with me and I
will explain moving on to the screen we
have a 12.5 inch either q HD or 4k
display now we tested out the Q HD
version which was more than good enough
what makes this display interesting
however and relates it back to the build
quality is that it is a touchscreen now
touch screens seem like a great idea
especially with Windows 10 being
supposedly designed for half tablet half
desktop use however one of the big
problems I've run into using lenovo
laptops or even the surface book is that
the hinge just bounces around when you
touch it as john put it it's a flaccid
hinge however the razor because it's
built so well does not have a flaccid
hinge and so the touchscreen is very
usable I found myself lying in bed
pinching zooming scrolling doing all the
things I would normally do on a tablet
or a smartphone and then using the full
size keyboard using it as a regular
laptop as well one of my gripes with the
display is just those bezels I mean look
for yourself it's hard to avoid them
continuing with hardware we have Razer
signature chroma keyboard with sixteen
point eight million colors per
key now honestly this is not really a
feature or something that I use it's
more just an aesthetic thing that kind
of sets them apart from other PC
manufacturers but well I don't care I do
know that a lot of razer fans will care
and yes I'm talking to you Andrew
typing on the keyboard is an absolute
pleasure there is a little less travel
than there would be on a traditional
keyboard because the laptop is obviously
so thin that being said it's something
that used to very quickly it's a very
good experience my only gripe is that
the trackpad and the keyboard are kind
of crammed and so I found myself often
typing in my hand would sort of bump
into the trackpad and mess up everything
going on screen speaking of the trackpad
it's fantastic very good size feels
great I just wish would have been
clickable all across rather than just at
the bottom in terms of processing power
looking an Intel Core i7 dual-core
processor with hyper-threading which
clocks in at 2.5 gigahertz or can turbo
boost up to 3.1 Giga heard it's more
than fast enough for everything that I
wanted to do I think the very good
processor given how small and light this
laptop is especially when you compared
to something like the Mac but which only
has an Intel Core M as per the GPU were
rocking intel HD graphics 520 I'm not
even going to comment on this since it
gets the job done for everybody's
regular needs but for those who want
something more intense you're going to
have the razor core which we don't have
to review yet so hang tight for that in
terms of memory we have 8 gigs of ddr3
dual channel onboard memory i/o we have
Thunderbolt 3 which is now the same port
as USB see it also charges via USB see
so for those of you who care and want to
charge off a battery pack or something
it'll charge slowly but that is an
option we also have two USB 3 ports and
an HDMI output for those who have tested
the 4k display version we've heard the
battery life has not been great even
saying that it comes in only three hours
which is nor near what the competition
can offer that being said with Q HD
version we got much much closer to the
projected eight hours coming in at about
6 to 7 hours on solid usage couple
noteworthy things that don't really fit
into any category for this laptop our
number one fingerprints this matte black
type finish looks great but it attracts
fingerprints like crazy because of the
material you really have to take a cloth
and really clean it for a while before
you get those fingerprints
out more of my personal gripe was the
logo now I don't have a problem with
raisers actual logo but the way it looks
on this laptop when it's not backlit it
looks like a sticker and it just looks
cheap for some reason whereas the rest
of the laptop looks super super premium
high quality a huge plus for me the very
small design but I love the grips
underneath now normally on laptops we
see four-foot grips but here we saw two
long rubber bars and it does such a good
job of keeping the laptop in place when
you have it on a desk so those are
really my overall thoughts on the blade
stealth it's hard to give some finalized
opinions because we haven't used the
Quarrier and that's going to be a huge
part of how powerful this Ultrabook can
become that's the most interesting
aspect to me that it's this transformer
of a device that can go from being as
ultra portable laptop and then become a
pretty much desktop replacement with a
dedicated GPU and fulfill all your
gaming video editing and GPU intensive
needs as a straight-up ultrabook I can
say that I would definitely recommend
this to someone who is on Windows it's
effectively a MacBook Air competitor and
I think it checks all the boxes that one
would look for in this price range
beginning at $1000 then going up from
there but let me know what you guys
think are you guys looking forward to
this does this really blow your mind in
any way shape or form are you waiting
for the core like me leave us a comment
below I'm very curious to hear your guys
thoughts give us a thumbs up if you
liked this video hit subscribe for more
coverage and content we have that Chevy
Volt review coming as well and I can't
wait to share with you guys thanks for
