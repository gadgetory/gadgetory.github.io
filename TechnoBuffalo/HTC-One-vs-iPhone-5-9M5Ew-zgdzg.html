technobuffalo and I wanted to compare
the HTC One to the iphone 5 log people
were saying they look really similar and
I think the reason is is the edges here
they're chamfered and so they're really
you know the shiny edges that you see on
the iphone there's better example HTC
implemented that same idea and of course
the aluminum unibody design so you have
through the back of this one I think it
looks in order but it's in no way a
copycat product I don't know it's hard
for me to even read those reports that
it is but of course you can see it's got
a much bigger screen compared to the
iphone and it almost looks like the
bezels or thinner but there's not really
because you see there it's just a black
border running around the screen we're
on the iphone it's like fun facing
cameras on HTC it is a wide angle lens
so you can fit more into the shop no
hardware home button and HTC also has
they call those beam sound speakers
those have better Mike's after taking
noise in so say you're at a concert you
really want clear audio those are going
to be great for that and outputting it
later then on the back of course it's
got an 8 megapixel camera on the iPhone
but the one has a 4 ultrapixel camera
now that's been a confusing for a lot of
people but the real idea of it is that
HTC wants to focus less on the number of
pickles and more on the quality of what
you're getting so it has bigger pixels
it hopes that that allows more light in
employees so that you have less
graininess especially in Lona low-light
shots rather that's just a quick
comparison between the two phones the
iphone 5 and the HTC One this is
reasonable</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
