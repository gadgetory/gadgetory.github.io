to you by the all new G flex 2 from LG
life's good hey what's going on guys the
markings hanging from technobuffalo and
today we'll be taking a look at the
latest technical build for Windows 10
now we saw a lot of cool stuff at
Microsoft's event in January like the
hollow lens Windows 10 on mobile and new
features come to the Xbox one that will
allow users to stream to Windows 10
devices now that we got the latest build
of windows 10 up and running let's go
ahead and see what it looks like in
action now there are a lot of new
features that were add to the latest
build of windows 10 and probably one of
the more exciting one is Cortana
Microsoft's own personal assistant now
crotona on Windows 10 works surprisingly
well especially for an early build you
can activate Cortana by clicking on a
microphone icon or by saying hey Cortana
and you can ask her what the weather is
for today or who won the Super Bowl all
that good stuff and she'll reply to you
just like how she would on a Windows
Phone the interface the voice and how
crotona interacts with you is a really
nice touch and I think Microsoft did the
right thing putting Cortana on Windows
unfortunately Cortana is only available
for the US and in English right now but
hopefully in the coming months other
countries and languages will have
curtana and one of the other things that
I noticed with Windows 10 is Action
Center it's basically like the
Notification Center for Mac OS 10 you'll
be able to see your notifications here
whether it's from a nap or Windows
directly and right below that you have
your quick action buttons like tablet
mode if you have a windows laptop that
has a touchscreen and you also have your
basic settings like Wi-Fi display and
airplane mode now another new thing that
Microsoft added into this build was the
ability to run store apps in window mode
which is super convenient nobody to keep
swiping to a new screen to access the
full screen store app it's in window
mode which means you can drag anywhere
on the screen minimize it or maximize it
and taking a look at the new Xbox app
for the Windows 10 it's running in a
window mode I can maximize the app put
it in full screen and digging even
deeper in the app you can check what
your friends are up to check your
achievements and more and there's also
the new settings app which combines the
good old control panel in Windows XP and
Windows 8 Settings app in one now you'll
be able to access various settings from
this app like your Wi-Fi settings your
screen resolution and even check how
much storage your hard drive has left
there's also the search field at the
upper right corner to search for certain
keywords if for example you don't know
where the Bluetooth settings are you can
search for it and access the settings
through the search field which makes
everything
so much easier now file explorer also
got a little redesigned interface the
icons look much flatter than before and
overall you I feels and looks much
better than previous builds we tried
there's also a quick access menu on the
left hand side which shows you which
folders or files you've accessed
recently and talking a bit about the new
start menu first it's back but with a
little twist we have the familiar start
menu we all know and love but on the
right hand side we have the usual
windows 8 live tiles that we can access
right away you can move the towels
around remove them resize them however
you'd like but what they added into this
build of windows 10 was the ability to
go fullscreen if you're used to using
Windows 8 and the Start screen you'll be
able to use the Start menu in full
screen just like how you did in Windows
8 now of course we're still using an
early build of windows 10 so not
everything is working one hundred
percent but for the most part everything
seems to be pretty solid microsoft also
announced project Spartan a new browser
that will be an alternative to Internet
Explorer and there are a bunch of new
features like the ability to jot down
notes on any web page and there's also a
new reading mode and integration with
Cortana so you can quickly pull up the
weather upcoming flights and more from
inside the browser search bar now
unfortunately project Spartan didn't
come with this build of windows 10 but
when it does come out we'll be sure to
make a video about it microsoft also
mentioned that windows 10 on pc
smartphones and tablets will sync across
devices making it much easier to bounce
between devices and windows 10 will be a
free upgrade whether you're using
windows 7 8 or 8.1 computer or Windows
Phone 8.1 device as long as you upgrade
within the first year you should be good
there's still no word when Windows 10
will actually become available but we'll
let you know as soon as that news is
announced anyways a suit for this quick
