cinema TechnoBuffalo checking out the
droid ultra from Verizon Wireless this
will retail for a hundred ninety-nine
dollars on August twentieth and you can
pre-order it today quick look at this
device here you've got a 5 inch display
with a 720p resolution it's a lot
thinner I believe it's seven millimeter
seven millimeters thin you've got this
nice keV lower back here I believe it's
a unibody design actually to you got 10
megapixel camera the single LED flash so
the specs are actually the same as the
droid maxx but it just doesn't have the
48-hour usage time so the batteries a
little smaller on this right side you've
got the volume buttons and the power
button soft touch buttons on the bottom
here with the micro USB charging port
show you get that in display displayed
nothing on the left hand side on the
phone said anything there and your 3.5
millimeter headphone jack up top
underhood you've got 2 gigs of ram and a
1.7 gigahertz dual-core processor role
of motorola's marketing this x8 sort of
eight core technology that it says it's
more important than speaking about the
course although that's up for debate
until we actually review the phone
running android 4.2 point2 jelly bean
not too many apps on here you've got the
ingress pre-loaded from google which is
a fun game to play based on your
location and like on the other phones
you can use google now by saying okay
Google now and it's programmed to work
with your voice oh it's not going to
work with me here otherwise you can just
tap it didn't get right in but I think
this is my favorite of the three devices
announced today it's super thin I really
like the color design it's a nice
follow-up to the droid family of devices
on verizon wireless again it will launch
on August twentieth for 199 dollars you
can pre-order today and the nice thing
is it comes with six months free of
google play music if you order it before
i believe sep tember 30th this is todd
