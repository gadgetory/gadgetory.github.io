TechnoBuffalo here there are some insane
deals going on right now but one of the
best ones that I've seen is for the new
polycarbonate plastic macbook the
educational discount brings this thing
down 27 28 it's originally a 999
students originally save a hundred
dollars which brought it down to 8 99
but now there's an additional discount
dropping the sink to 730 bucks which is
a fantastic deal for a really full spec
computer look at this thing almost spec
for spec it's pretty identical to the
macbook pro with the exception of the
casing it's an awesome deal right now
it's only with the educational discount
so you need to be a college student or
graduate student in order to get it if
you are a college student or education
students will be a link in the sidebar
to where you can go to get this but it's
a fantastic deal if you've been thinking
about a macbook or looking to get into a
Mac you're getting this for what is
almost a high-end netbook price you look
at like the HP mini 311 and you spec it
out all the way you're looking at close
to 600 bucks for a full-powered netbook
for next 130 you're going to get a
ridiculously good macbook whether or not
you like the plastic or not is going to
be a personal taste issue but this is
definitely full feature and very capable
machine with the 2.26 a core 2 duo
processor only you can't change any of
the specs and get the discount so you
are just going to get that processor 2
gigs of ddr3 memory a 250 gig hard drive
the 8-speed superdrive with the nvidia
geforce 9400 graphics and of course the
built-in 7-hour battery for those
developer that might not be Mac fans but
are sort of thinking about it this may
be a great machine to use bootcamp with
and three get the best of both worlds
250 gigabyte hard drive carve off 100
gigs for Windows still got a nice hard
drive for your max that as well you
really can get the best of both anyway
this is too good not to share with you
guys hope you enjoyed and I will see you
in the next video bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
