TechnoBuffalo here's an unboxing of the
latest from Sony this is the Xperia z3
t-mobile's had a really impressive
lineup over the past really two years
and they're bolstering that with the 4k
waterproof rocking 20 megapixel
powerhouse from Sony let's go ahead and
see if all those specs tho line up to
make a killer phone so here's the box
for the Xperia z3 Sony and t-mobile have
partners for a few years now this is the
latest sort of fruit of that partnership
the z3 a pretty typical box sent to us
from their friends at t-mobile it's got
a lot of stuff under the hood that's all
specs on the back but why bother reading
when you can just listen so I'm going to
take you through all of that goodness
well go ahead and open this sucker up
and there is the Xperia z3 all sealed
and plastic feeling very thin pushed off
the side for a quick sec so what else
we're going to have inside of the box
we've got a very large wall worth it
only has a USB port on it got a micro
USB cable and a t-mobile SIM that is
probably in the phone so push all that
off to the side I want to dig it and
take a look at this phone enough about
the accessories here is the Xperia z3 it
looks and feels really nice I'll go
ahead and peel this off ah whooshing
noise if I can get that satisfied
whooshing noise on the back double my
whooshing noise boom there we go
I'm gonna go ahead and power it on and
I'll run through all the specs we took a
look at the z3v for Verizon that was
sort of the same specs as this but put
into last generation body this brings
new body and the new hardware this is a
5.2 inch screen it's 1920 so that's 1920
by 1080 which mean it's got a 424 PPI as
they tried luminous display and Sony's
displays I've usually looked very nice
but I've been a bit hard on them in the
recent years they've always had that
sort of waterproof ish coating over the
screen and sort of made it look a little
bit washed out to me with the z3v I
didn't see that's I'm hoping that with
the z3 that's gonna be gone as well go
ahead and finish the setup process so
it's got a triluminos display on here
it's Android 4.4
for at launch being powered by 2.5
gigahertz quad-core Snapdragon 801 3
gigs of ram are in here 30 gigs internal
storage but of course you could expand
that with microSD up to 28 the big story
is in a little tiny package right there
is a twenty point seven megapixel camera
that can also shoot 4k video that's not
the only camera on here you've got a
front-facing two point two megapixel
shooter other specs 802 11 ABG and and a
CA 3100 milliamp power not a movable
battery it's not a very fat phone or a
very heavy phone weighs 152 grams it's
extremely thin as well at seven point
three millimeters or point to nine
inches if whatever scale you tend to go
with let's do a real quick tour of the
device and walk through kind of
everything on it so of course you've got
on-screen buttons so you're not gonna
have any capacitive buttons living down
here you've got so many skin sitting on
top of Android 4.4 gone are the time to
keep a media scape so I need is a really
nice job I think sort of adding a little
bit while still letting Android be
Android on the left hand side of the
Vice you've got a connector for
presumably some docks and such since
this is a waterproof device everything's
gonna be sort of living under these
little trays that have a rubber gasket
around it let's see were charged in sink
port on the left hand side buttons on
the right though a bit different than
what we've seen in the past so if you go
ahead and pull this one out that is
where you are a sim and micro sd card
going to live so you don't have to take
anything out to access that a very large
and pronounced power and lock button
below that is your volume toggle and
then you've got a dedicated camera
button I really like to have go ahead
and push that you see what the camera UI
looks like a real fast give me camera a
little bit of vibration feedback here we
are in the camera again this capable of
shooting full 4k video which is pretty
impressive let's see it's gonna come up
bundled on here so a really cool thing
that t-mobile is doing device unlock and
you can go ahead and you can lock it or
unlock it depending on where you are all
via an app it's really cool thing the
t-mobile is doing is part of the sort of
uncarrier initiative and I really give
them credit for that go ahead and look
here mostly its stock Android not many
t-mobile editions here at all mostly
what you're seeing is sort of some Sony
stuff but mobile hotspot is there and
here's your of your t-mobile things
visual voicemail
meit's mobile account
and t-mobile TV but the rest of that is
a pretty stock Android and Sony go ahead
slip over to left you can get a quick
sort of different view of your apps if
you want to a few other kind of neat
things Sony does if you go and hit the
multitasking button you can go ahead and
pick sort of little widgets that can run
sort of inside of other things so your
calculated and stuff and go ahead and
close that and then the rest of it sort
of as is if we go ahead and do a little
bit a long press we'll take a look at
some of the widgets that are here see
what the UI looks like it's sort of very
clear I can also theme this as well I'll
go ahead and pick the widgets you can
see what Sony offers here the device
sort of has a sort of a black plastic
feel to the back what it feels really
nice and it's curved so as you go ahead
and swipe your finger over it it's sort
of got a round feel similar to what we
see on the iPhone 6 and the iPhone 6
plus course it's got NFC on it as well
and some very subtle t-mobile branding
there real quick size comparison here to
see what it looks like against sort of
some other phones here is the 5.5 inch
LG g3 for comparison and here's what I
think a very similar looking phone this
is the iPhone 6 with a 4.7 inch screen
you see a difference there on both and
then on the thickness of each device I
should also mention too that it's got
the ability to use this device as a
screen for your ps4 which is kind of
cool you can get a little bit of a mount
and you can put it on top of the
controller and use as a second screen
which is a really neat tool in case
maybe you want to play some NBA 2k and
your wife is watching a cooking show you
know you can go ahead and use this and
still get your game on
I thank you guys for watching hope you

everything that it can do until next
