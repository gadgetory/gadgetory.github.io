techni Buffalo show online you're two
hoes for today Sean ani editor-in-chief
of the site i'm joined by deputy
managing editor Todd Hazleton everybody
if everyone thinks Todd looks a little
fancy today it's because he's gotta go
to fox but that's right yeah soon as
we're done with the show he he has to
leave for uh is it fox or fox business
to the fox business today yeah I figured
those fox business but you never know
for sure so yes a car comes to get um
yep it's nice it's all fancified way so
we make up the show a few minutes short
today simply because Todd does need to
leave and get ready to go over there
because he may have a shirt tie on but
no pants yeah that's right my pants on
so a couple things we wanted to go over
today first up being do we want Apple
driving us around yeah and actually I
guess that's sort of you know fits with
what I'm supposed to talk about today a
little bit on fox business which is I
guess some cyber security and cars and
so when you have all these tech
companies and it sounds like you know
okay so Tesla's already there is like no
making this electric car right and then
Apple is apparently going to give Tesla
run for his money right so then you it's
now this computer company going after
Tesla and that's what becomes
interesting with cyber security right so
obviously it seems like it'll have some
kind of you know probably connected car
in a way powered by iOS maybe or
something like that which would be
really interesting but then Senator Mark
II which is what I'm going to talk about
fox business today is concerned that
most automakers have no plan in place
for what happens with security so like
if a hacker hacks your car like what do
you do and the car maker doesn't even
know apparently which is kind of
interesting um well we have a question
here from Sasha Mahal is the Apple car
real if so would it be called the iCard
just the app car also why would Apple be
interested in going into the car
business and I think that's the thing we
all need to figure out
the car business is notoriously thin
margins is incredibly hard to break into
yeah test two lost 108 million dollars
last quarter and I don't know how many
cars it's sold but we find out it was
the thing Apple has enough money in its
war chest if it loses 108 million
dollars and a quarter it's going well
whatever but I don't I keep feeling like
this is going to be a partnership with
an existing car company and not the
tesla model of making their own cars you
don't think so yeah I think that's what
sort of dangers to because i was just
looking so Tesla's built 35,000 cars
last year but was unable to sell them
all only 35,000 car tests not very many
no it's not so where's the demand for
this kind of stuff I don't know actually
I apple won't you the tesla model built
itself but you know that we've been
hearing about this apple in the apple
car for a long time right is rumors it
keeps coming up and up and up and then
all of a sudden it was like you know iOS
in the car right and then it's kind of
like okay you know apple for cars but
it's not an apple car so i don't know
that there's evidence is going to
actually you know build cars yeah i
think that's you know and speaking to
tesla not being able to sell all those
cars i I've ridden in a Tesla it was a
I've not driven one by Britain in one
and it was a lovely experience and while
it would have a lot of usability in
certain situations you know take someone
like me for instance i live in a rural
community i live on a dirt road you know
I can't count the number of times I've
had to pull a neighbor out of a ditch
because they've slid off in the ice or
whatever right you know a Tesla is not
going to be able to do that maybe the
Tesla SUV when it comes out but the
current Tesla's know you know yes he's
putting into hyper chargers and around
the country I cannot tell you where the
closest hypercharger is to kirksville
missouri there is no place for me to
charge in kirksville outside of whatever
i would install my own hand
so there's a lot of markets in the
United States where he can't even begin
to try to sell these cards yet right
exactly so you understand why by the
demesne I mean why they're only making
what 35,000 cars and I think they sold
120 in China which is supposed to be a
huge market for Tesla exactly exactly
and we have no idea if this apple cart
is real it we don't know if it's
electric we don't know if it's yo
hydrogen we don't know if it's regular
gas or some sort of hybrid although i
can guarantee with apple it's going to
be a minimum of hybrid right right if
it's a real car uh I don't have the
hardest thing to swallow here is that
we've heard this story so many times
apple's building a car and then it just
never nothing ever really comes out of
it and I monitoring the flight the
people are hearing sources that are
saying Apple's working on stuff for cars
and you know the telephone game
transfers that into apple's building a
car but it seems like a lot this week
came out with the you know first Apple
giving Tesla run for its money and now
this but you know I think Apple could
you spy Tesla right like I don't think I
don't understand why I started from
scratch yeah well we have a question
from saha Raj what cars do you both
drive I was geordie Explorer what's that
what what your is I think it's 2006
that's all I I'm rocking a 99 Tahoe yeah
yeah I which is you know something John
makes fun of me on a regular basis of
cos i love my Tahoe I that's why I won't
give it up I don't be here nice re straw
the 99 jeep cherokee which i also love
yes i still have a tape deck in a I
don't have bluetooth I don't have onstar
I don't have a 0 but it drives it gives
me from point A to point B and I'm Abby
right right so I don't know onna the
Apple car is going to be an interesting
story to follow like like you said Todd
we've been hearing this story for so
long now that it's hard to believe that
all of a sudden there's so much
information at once yeah what came first
Apple the
television set Apple TV or the apple
cart no but those rumors of them that's
a good question i'm not sure which one
popped up first I mean and we've we've
been to the point where we've talked to
people that have claimed to have seen
the apple TV in person and that's quite
possible that there are prototypes but
will it ever be released to nose yeah
you know and same with the apple cart I
mean these this is a company that has so
much money they can just go hey you know
it'd be fun to play around with yeah
exactly like act like you know let's
have a team of five people's just you
know see what they can come up with yeah
exactly nits yeah well it's just like
Google in the twenty percent time you
know that their employees are allowed to
spend twenty percent of their time on
passion projects that may never turn
into anything right or or you know the
project x guys here and women yeah the
moonshot guys i means yeah so is the
apple car real I have no idea I I would
say this I would imagine Apple has
explored this concept but that does not
necessarily mean they're actually
working on it yeah I don't know everyone
knows as much as we do at this point
it's I'd rather see Apple get into like
redesigning public transportation like
mosques vision of the Hyperloop you know
like give us faster trains that are
awesome instead of car I don't know
no I've talked about that before I mean
I've traveled to Japan and England where
trains are a mainstay of public
transportation and I love it I I and
it's a great way to get around and it
saddens me how this country the United
States is torn up so much of our train
tracks and we pretty much do use it just
for free mes are still passenger trains
yeah I took one from irvine to San Diego
for the comic-con the summer but in
general it's just for freight nail and
you know I don't want but i think the
especially outside the East Coast I mean
then we have the whole corridor here Bob
yeah you see and all the way done
but still yeah well at the apartment in
the u.s. is such a car culture though I
mean we we live yo what what do you
start dreaming about when you're a small
child when can I get my driver's license
yeah that's true yeah so I don't know
should be interesting so the other thing
we wanted to discuss was both you and
John yesterday received your gear vr s
yeah my desk things crazy it is my
family I put it on my wife's head last
night and she was like what the heck is
going on you know it's incredible that
death is that it's two hundred dollars
you know retail price and what it can do
with just your your note for if you
already own it note for and you want to
check this out i mean i feel like it's
worth 200 bucks um it's a I think the
craziest thing is like you put it on and
you can like view 360 videos it that
Samsung and oculus have provided but the
graphics it's not super sharp it's not
as amazing is what we've seen on why are
you making funny face I'm sorry I
apologize Twitter one of the things I
follow our Twitter just ran past with a
picture of Sigmund and the sea monsters
which was a 1970s Marty Krofft show
amazon video is developing a sigma in
the sea monsters pilot nice back I'm
like I wish everybody who's listening
later kids I'm sorry I apologize i was
listening to you by was like segment of
the sea monsters we're bringing that
back yeah i'm sorry please continue
right and it looks really cool it's just
amazing that at it that can work on a
two-hundred-dollar gadget but it's not
nearly as good as on the oculus we've
used at I forget the Crescent Bay maybe
it's a recent one that we saw a CES
which is like I figured it was crossing
or not in any case so like the real
oculus is insane this is really insane
too in fact i was watching the movie
hackers yesterday in it like so i'm
sitting in the movie theater which you
can do it's like this huge movie theater
you can have your own
house your home cinema so anyway i'm
watching hackers on the big screen i'm
just like skipping through it's just one
of those you know files i have and i get
to the point where the bad guy in
hackers is playing with his VOR game
he's like punching the air he's wearing
a headset and i remember watching that
years ago thinking like well you can't
really do that because there's not like
anything like good games you know like
way back in 99 or 98 but now here i am
watching that scene wearing a headset
it's like legitimate obviously this is
wild it was a roof meta moment yeah you
have a Superman how far we've come
here's the thing that I mean we see you
know these great advancements going on
with the hololens and the gear VR and
oculus and everything else but i really
wonder you know i i'm a huge media
consumer i I've been a video gamer since
back in the colecovision days and all
that and I just really don't have any
interest in doing VR and you would think
I would be the target audience for this
product hmm yeah cuz I just want to like
yesterday I'm like looking for games I
wanted to buy content like immediately
just like walk around the world or
something but I couldn't but I don't
know I kind of I can't wait for that
kind of stuff but they're right you know
here's the thing it's kind of big it's
not something like even though I can
watch movies and stuff like that I
didn't feel like super comfortable it's
like I I just eaten and I put it on and
then afterwards I was kind of feeling
like Josh's but also it's not portable
like I would I don't think I'd ever
bring in with me on a trip like even for
a weekend I mean yeah you gets like this
big the case you put it in your room
here you know duffel bag or whatever but
for me it's something like you just use
at home and I think maybe that's
partially kind of limiting yeah I mean
something like hololens which is more of
an augmented reality situation where
it's you know assisting me with reality
that's that's more interesting because i
have can't do it
can't deal with reality Todd I need good
dealing with reality yeah but yes as
soon as that came out of my mouth I was
like that about me hey that's far more
interesting to me than a virtual reality
yo I I don't like the idea of shutting
myself off to what's happening around me
in such a complete manner right you know
I it's almost a little too much like
sensory deprivation to me yeah it's kind
of freaky yeah exactly and Mimi little
anxious exactly you know so I I can see
the uses of augmented reality but
virtual reality i'm still I'm not a
hundred percent sold on yeah it's like
when I was in the movie here I keep like
because I felt like you feel like you're
really there like you're in a movie
theater you look down you don't have
legs or hands and you're like oh boy it
kinda miss jumper and then and then like
maybe in real life like your knee it's
the coffee table oh like I couldn't even
see that even though right right keep ya
head between this fake world and really
this it's cool everybody should give it
a try I think there's a lot of best buys
now we're gonna start make it 150 around
the United States to start are gonna
have like demo stations you can check it
out you know that's cool and all that
but I'm also germaphobe Oh idea of
slapping a gear VR on my head that who
knows how many other people have had on
that day yeah you know the other thing
too is it you really got to make sure
the lens is clean because you can see
like a little hair I mean you're
steering basically a here phone screen
you know this far from your face so you
can see like everything and I wonder how
they're going to keep it all clean in
the stores like otherwise you know it
probably won't even look nearly as good
as what you'd get in the box because
you're gonna have to clean it español
dad exactly exactly I don't know it's
it's going to be interesting eh I I
think virtual reality does have some
definite uses do especially in teaching
situations such as a consumer product
I just don't know if it's ever gonna
catch on I really don't yeah yeah I'm
not call me a naysayer but uh going over
to the questions here and this is
somewhat related from Benjamin McDonald
do you think Google glass will turn into
more of a Holograms and a smaller form
factor and I'm assuming he means more
like a hollow lens I that's something we
haven't addressed you know Google's
pulled back the current version of glass
you know from the Explorer edition and
said that they are going to redesign it
what do you think they're going to do
with it yeah I don't know I think it
really can't be so awkward this time
around like everybody I'm sorry i never
even want to try it because right away I
was like that looks so stupid like come
on I think it can't look like that like
people nobody's gonna want to wear it um
it's sort of like geeky bluetooth
headset seeing like the big ones that
are poking around I don't know nobody
wants to worthless so I think that's
going to be a problem but they have Tony
Fadell from you know the father of the
ipod guy who created nest now he's
working on this I mean I feel like they
have the right guy in place I mean ipod
was awesome ness is amazing you know
let's see what he can do with Google
glass you know a second try but I think
they learned a lot I think you couldn't
have gone straight to whatever second
you know like see Google blast gentoo
you couldn't have gone to that without
having Google glass and learning from
you know all the experiences like people
were afraid of their privacy and like
they didn't like people with cameras on
their heads in private places and movie
theaters like all these kinds of places
where Google probably didn't even
understood I understand like ahead of
time that these are going to be
roadblocks and now it does so well and
use a great learning lesson that segues
perfectly into a question we have from
Christian for miles do you think the
next version of glass will ask you the
camera or at least make it optional in
order to avoid much of the controversy
of the Explorer model that's a really
good question i don't know has been
really be a module or something like
that but but it's almost like it has to
have a camera right to like understand
where you are
like mmm your environment so but maybe
it's just not a camera that records
things that I'd be like an optional
module there exactly I think that glass
actually does need the camera but I
think you're right if they could make it
so it doesn't automatically record if
they make it an on recording camera
that's just taking in your environment
then I think a lot of people will have a
lot less trouble with it but then comes
the question you know when you do walk
into a movie theater they're going to go
well do you have the recording module
right you know i don't know it's that's
sometimes that they definitely need to
work on i think a lot of people
overreacted to the camera yeah I
understand that too I mean like when I
saw somebody with Google glass I wasn't
like all this person's gonna take
pictures of me I was just like this
person looks like geek mornings with
what was it the galaxy gear event where
somebody was taking pictures with the
the watch and said this guy doesn't even
know I'm taking his picture and it was
you oh yeah yeah who did that I don't
know it was one of the other blogs i
can't remember who was buddy this guy
doesn't even know it taking this picture
there's Todd yo filming his butt out of
that so funny oh good grief too yeah
that kind of stuff doesn't bother me
we're gonna go off kilter here for just
a second I had a feeling somebody was
going to ask this during the show from
Sasha Mahal off-topic Sean what does the
spider Bay a deal between sony and
Marvel Studios made for the franchise IE
spider-man and for comic book fans
moviegoers also how would you like
marble to go about spider-man in the MCU
ultimate spider-man Miles Morales okay
so real quick for those that don't know
in the ultimate in the ultimate universe
which is a separate marvel universe
which actually they're getting rid of
this summer spider-man is a teenager
named Miles Morales who is black so a
lot of people have been going well they
this could be there a way to bring
Miles Morales into the film's I have no
problem with the concept of Miles
Morales but when you think spire man you
still think Peter Parker and I don't
think they're going to deviate from that
at all as for how they're going to bring
spider-man into the marvel cinematic
universe which is what MCU stands for my
big question is going to be there has to
be at least some sort of references to
where were you during the Avengers movie
why weren't you helping out with the
alien vacation well they can easily say
he didn't have his powers yet or
something but yeah I just slightly but
to me that's gonna that somebody has to
throw that into the film sub we're
asking why was it your ass helping us
with the giant alien invasion yeah let's
grill you see I was still currently only
owned by Sony and I couldn't play with
you guys I I do fight hilarious that the
press release that I nounced this was
from Sony it was so nice tarted off the
press release by saying Saudi welcomes
the Marvel Universe Marvel Cinematic
Universe into the spider-man Cinematic
Universe have like oh no no that's not
how this is going I think that part of
the problem is that Sony still has
creative control and final saying a lot
of things so Marvel's going to have to
really really push to make these better
films than the last couple have been I'm
hopeful so that that's my long answer to
a very short question from Christopher
miles do you think Samsung's rumored
redesigns are the result of last year's
misfortunes or was it always planned
since phones usually take two to three
years to design that's a good question i
would say it's probably been in the
works for a little while because you're
right it does take me like at least year
these phone companies are starting
designs at a time and they've been
getting criticism for you know two to
three years for their plastic handsets
so i think it was in
the works but I think maybe you know
Samsung really listened up and that's
why we her projects euro and and really
focused on releasing a handset that's
slightly hopefully a little more
different than you know sort of it's not
that they were repetitive but they sort
of work and I think for good reason they
were selling millions and millions of
them so you kind of want to keep doing
that they were you know pushing the
cameras and processors and stuff like
that book but the at the same time I
always find that's interesting that
Apple really has not changed the design
of that I felt that much over the years
right you don't and yes they get it a
little bit of criticism but they don't
get nearly the criticism samsung was
getting I think it's because Samsung
phones or just you know like I love that
money and then here's a note for right
here and i think the note 4 is a great
example of where Samsung should continue
to head with you know the nice metal
edges but the note 4 so we sort of did
the high-end the family and so is the
galaxy line but they were it was just
plastic right and I'm not complaining
about the plastic it's just that six
months later you start to have like wear
and tear around the edges it had like a
fake metal border but that would chip
off and the back would get all chipped
around the camera and stuff and so I
understand the complaints that you know
you're paying a lot of money for a phone
that you have for two years I mean you
go apples were you know metal so they
scratched yeah but they didn't like get
worn down the way the Samsung devices
neither did HTC's and so I think that's
why there's a proper place to say like
hey samsung ones you know use some more
premium materials get it right I think
that's what they're doing before yeah I
don't know I i I've like Samsung phones
in the past you know i i've used samsung
phones especially in the galaxy s2
original note time period i was using a
lot of Samsung's but i don't know i i'm
hoping that they do go for a more
premium material i think that was a lot
of the problem was that samsung phones
are considered so plasticky yeah so i
don't know we'll see what happens by i
agree with you i do think that this was
in the works for a while i don't think
it's just an immediate reaction to last
year why do you think is it immediate
reaction last year's we're going to see
probably some phones just get cancelled
that we never even heard about oh yeah I
think Samsung sort of slimming out its
family a little bit which is probably a
good idea in the company it seemed like
every month there is another one her
tablet you know just sleep okay there
are so many devices there was just
ridiculous a personal question from
Sasha Mahal a little personal and it's
about something he owns have any of you
guys had any problems with your pebble
mine has been experiencing screen
tearing I've only had since October 2014
besides the tooth mark from one of my
puppies getting away my pebble I've had
no issues of you Todd no I have it on
mine I don't wear mine anymore but when
I was wearing I all I would suggest
sashan is a reach out to pebble on
Twitter and that they seem very
responsive I follow them and they do
seem very responsive so I would reach
out to them and as talk to him about it
yes you can replace it yeah you never
know from moshi sokol uh well the apple
stylist be called the magic wand i I'm
still debating if this thing even exists
uh with you I don't I just don't see it
but maybe you know yeah I don't know as
for magic wand I mean we have the magic
trackpad in the magic mouse so why not
not it just doesn't sound very apple I
still I don't know well I mean you know
I I will say this totally off topic I
you know when I first saw the magic
trackpad I was like oh that's so silly
you know when you're running three
monitors I cannot imagine trying to live
life without this thing alright so maybe
we'll see a magic wand well just it for
fast travel between my three monitors
there's nothing better that Trek oh good
gravy um from
saw Raja what are your daily drivers
currently Todd yeah I know yours changes
like weekly yeah so Galaxy Note 4 i've
actually stuck with this these two for
you know for I don't know since cdss
before see us maybe or i was using the
edge back then but the note 4 and the
iphone 6 plus my iphone 6 plus is not
responding and like the screen doesn't
work half the time so I gotta go into an
apple store ahead button I know the
thing is I treat it well it's not like I
dropped it it hasn't there's no water
damage that I know of so yeah i'm
currently iphone 6 plus + 1 + 1 I I very
rarely change up my phones I love the
oneplus one but um I gave it to my
brother because you need a new phone and
I was like here's a great for it's funny
because he gets he like you know gadget
heads like us we're always looking
around you see somebody with a one plus
one you know that you know they're in
the industry um up on their knowledge
and he'd so he'll like walk around
people be like oh one plus one man he's
like yeah is he not like really a new
him I just gave a mine i will say i
think one of my favorite things about 1
plus y do this so silly is the simple
things on my treat you yeah ladies this
is so incredibly handy oh it's great i
love it yeah I kind of want to buy
another one is he has mine and I really
liked it I don't know folks let me tell
you working with Todd is a panel about
what he is possibly going to buy and
sometimes to you and sometimes don't and
sometimes to you and then return I so
how many times did that ipad mini go in
and out of your head oh i think i think
i'm on my third and that's it yeah i
still have but i would say the other day
to my wife I was like I gotta sell this
things I don't you sit but I can't isn't
I'll buy it again I'm sure oh good gravy
uh from Benjamin McDonald do you think
moto will make a cheaper version of 360
maybe a square one then I don't think it
would be called the Moto 360 what
right I don't I'll see it because I
think if they do anything they'll make a
new one and then drop the price of the
current one yeah yeah I I don't know
we'll just have to see uh let's see here
from any potatoes uh Sam's like any new
information on the rumored ran
SmartWatch will be another Tyson watch
or an Android wear model I think
everything's gonna be Tizen now from
samsung hwajae going to bed ties in I
don't think there's a new information
aside from hopefully we see it at Mobile
World Congress I think you will see ya
it seems like they've put a lot of I
know they did Android wear is like a
partner with google but they've only
done one and I think that you know all
all of their other smartwatches you have
since been updated to Tizen so I think
you're gonna focus on that moving
forward I just don't think it more apps
like there's on what we can do with
those things a interesting question from
Christopher miles do you think that most
manufacturers have given up on premium
tablets besides maybe the dell venue 8
7,000 it's been a while since anything
exciting has really come out coming like
the last week's topic again yeah i think
the tablet market is kind of in a
settling position right now it's trying
to figure out exactly what it is and i
think we're going to see a lot of shake
out this year from the tablet market i
think a lot of the out layers are going
to outliers are going to disappear and
we're just going to focus on the core
tablets as for super premium I don't
know especially with the rumors of the
ipad pro so yeah and one you know once
that comes out then everything's gonna
there's going to be more but Samsung had
a great one the 12 22 note 12.2 I think
it was him I mean that was a great large
screen premium tablet from 19 jaunty 99
is a closed loop water cooling a good
idea for gaming computer depends on how
much stuff you're running a oh and
and how hot it is I've never run one but
for me I understand it's amazing I've
run a couple water coin I think it's
great especially if like you're working
on overclocking and you like to have you
know a lot of fun paying attention to
the temperature of your processors and
if you can your water putting your
graphics cards to it's a fun hobby to
have and it's really not too complicated
to do so it's a good idea it's really
just like there were times when I had it
though especially actually had it in
high school when I was in a boarding
high school so I'd like to move it every
single time like home and back there so
it can be a pain so you just want to
kind of leave in one place yes I had a
fun water cooled and I would do it again
so sure that sounds like a weird hobby
it is it's like extreme TC hardware
hobby extreme pieces yeah from
Christopher miles if google made Android
wear cross-platform do you think it
would put significant downward pressure
on the price of the Apple watch no yeah
no I don't think so but they should make
it cross but a platform considering was
in seven hundred and sixty thousand
units sold so far mm-hmm it'd be great
if other people could use an Apple watch
too i mean it's just ok Google I mean uh
Android wear watch too yeah I Apple does
what Apple does you know with all the
android phones out there we haven't seen
any downward pressure on the price of
the iphone so i don't think that it the
android we're being cross-platform would
have any downward pressure on the Apple
watch right from moshi sokol is the
qualcomm toq dead probably but i feel
like that was just like a kind of like a
proof of concept for the Mirasol display
so the bigger question is Mirasol
display dead and i don't think so i
think hopefully people start using it
pebble can start using it in their next
SmartWatch maybe I don't know yeah you
could I dat get colors me from
Christopher miles what do you think--
Android where's actual smart watch
market share is considering the recent
report included fitness bands as well
yeah a good question i really don't know
as I don't know how many samsung is sold
and pebble I mean we know pebble just
crossed what a million yeah so so
Android wear sold fewer than pebble has
its 760,000 or whatever it was so I
don't know I don't interesting question
but hard to say uh and we will make this
the last question since it's the last
one currently and Todd needs to get
ready to head to fox business from
Benjamin McDonald do you think the LG G
watch will look good with a pebble steel
band yeah well I think so i actually
just ordered one for the g wash or so oh
cool yeah I didn't get the pebble steel
band there were two black like I think
it was even cheaper like twenty bucks um
so I hope so because I'm alright folks
