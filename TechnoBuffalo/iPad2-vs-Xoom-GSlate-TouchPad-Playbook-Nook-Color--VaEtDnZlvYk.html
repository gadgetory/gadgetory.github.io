from technobuffalo calm and you know you
don't need me to tell you today was
ipad2 announcement day today was also uh
netflix come to nintendo 3ds day
although that didn't get quite as much
coverage um but today was ipad 2
announcement day Apple made the
announcement in San Francisco and you
know John's already done a bunch of
coverage here in the video channel and
then also over in TechnoBuffalo com
we've got a whole whole bunch of
coverage for you written words and
images and all kinds of stuff a little
round up article with a just a short
little take from each of the editors and
what we think of what went down today in
San Francisco but I Johnson a message
saying hey I want you to do a video you
know get on camera tell us what you
think of the the tablet world now that
ipad 2 has been announced so here you go
and you know for everybody who's like
dude this is the John for lakers channel
what's this guy Noah doing on it um fair
warning it's going to be me for the rest
of the video so you know what to do what
you know what to do if you want to and I
certainly will not hold it against you
if you do I get it trust me I get it I'm
just don't happy to be here anyway
original iPad been out for about a year
ipad 2 announced today basically what
you get is a thinner lighter faster and
cameras on the front and the back
motorola xoom the first android 30
tablet the first honeycomb tablet to
actually start shipping and what you get
here is a screen that is bigger and
higher resolution than ipad you get dual
cameras that are higher res than ipad 2
you get a android 30 obviously a very
different platform you get dual-core
chip that i don't know if it's faster or
not but it's a dual-core chip Tegra 2
inside here and you get 4g upgradability
which is something you will not get on
ipad 2 i'm going to throw this one out
here even though i know i might be
playing to the wrong audience with this
one but i truly believe it's worth
mentioning barnes &amp;amp; noble nook color
what you get here is a smaller device a
7-inch display its android-based it's
easily hackable you can very easily put
a custom rom on
micro SD card / in the slot and you can
boot up to Froyo or a honeycomb I've
done it and I did it with honeycomb sure
it's not there but the most recent built
there actually worked pretty well
there's to mess around on uh but without
that what you get is you get a very very
cool ereader that's great for books
great for magazines and then has a
pretty decent web browser built in and
not the best touch screen in the world
but not too bad and you can get this
right now for two hundred bucks Wi-Fi
only no contract no cellular data why do
I mention this because the tablet oral
basically right now you know it's just
it's exploding like smartphones did last
year a lot of it has to do with Android
but also we're going to see the HP
TouchPad with webos 2 first first webos
tablet coming as sometime hopefully not
too long HP and then the blackberry
playbook our rumors kicking around that
that'll be out as soon as mid-april so
uh you know hopefully that will be the
case and then you know I like we said
there's the t-mobile g slate the optimus
pad as it's known in Europe which is um
an LG honeycomb tab that's a honeycomb
tablet rather that's smaller than the
zoom has a 3d camera speaking to tab the
samsung galaxy tab 10.1 which is a
similar size shape and specs as the zoom
also android three I know you've got a
sous with a couple of different
variations on Android 30 tablets with
keyboards you've got I mean you've got
you Sonic you've got a ton of companies
coming out with Android tablets you got
the HTC Flyer which i think is very
interesting it's two dot for it's not
three but a lot of customization I was
looking for the right word anyone say a
ton again a lot of customization went to
that one with HTC sense now with a
tablet version of sense with an active
stylus and a lot of interesting all
right interesting user experience stuff
not just the stock android you've got
rumors about Sony working on an Android
tablet based on 30 that would have a lot
of custom Sony content on it related to
entertainment possibly PlayStation
Certified I go along with the Xperia
Play smartphone that's android-based but
PlayStation Certified for gaming rumors
saru murs about that Italian descent is
curiosity platform rumors about that
coming
line so to get back to ipad 2 for a
second and this is all sort of in
relation to what's going on with all the
tablets I think what today is I think
you know not that many people were
surprised although people were
underwhelmed perhaps disappointed that
it wasn't a bigger change people were
looking for iOS 5 people were looking
for a higher res display you know people
were looking for 4G connectivity that
kind of thing um not really surprising
that wouldn't do it people think of you
know people who aren't even calling me
crazy for this one and I may have a
better to with some of the some of my
colleagues a TechnoBuffalo about this
happening because they all think I'm
nuts I think we're going to see an ipad
3 might not be called that but another
iPad released before the end of 2011 ah
two reasons why one I talked about this
earlier on CNBC so if you're still
watching but you saw that clip you know
you can tune out now if you want to say
the same thing but two reasons basically
one I think Apple wants to shift this
isn't my theory but i think it's a good
theory something to run with it I think
what Apple wants to shift the focus of
their fall event which has always been
an ipod event I think they want to shift
that two iPads with ipod still thrown in
there ipod is not you know it's not the
flagship thing that it was a few years
ago iPad an iPhone have become apples
you know big selling high-profile
products because they have ipod
functionality and you know and then some
ipod touch is still a big product but
yeah i don't know i just i get the
feeling that for the Christmas season
the big shopping season all that kind of
stuff you know Apple would love to have
the ipad as their kind of anchor product
or brand new product going into the
holidays second reason is 4G with all
the competition going on again you know
the zoom even though it apparently is
gonna be some crazy process where you
have to mail it in and you get it back
six days later and it's upgraded the
zune will be 4g upgradable in the next
couple of months and then they'll start
selling zooms with a 4g built in right
now it's 3g and Wi-Fi verizon's LTE
network and at least out here in the San
Francisco Bay Area verizon LG LTE
network just kicks but it's incredibly
fast it's it's fast when I'm you know
moving around i was actually down in
Southern California in San Diego last
week and I was using it in a car
I go in from the airport to the meetings
I was going to and I was getting
ridiculous like I got I think 21 down on
it wall in the back of a moving car so
LG the network's great we'll see how it
holds up once more people are using it
but so far it's really good and you know
I don't think Apple wants to get Bob too
far behind when you've got you know
tablets like this one on 4G you've got
you know the G slate coming out on
tmobile their version of 4G you're going
to see a lot of you know 4G tablets
coming out in the US this year so I
don't think Apple wants to wait a full
year to do that Apple likes to wait
until technologies are a little more
mature you know obviously the iphone
they'd have a 3g iphone at first what
other smartphones were 3g and who knows
what the backroom dealings are with the
carriers know an AT&amp;amp;T probably doesn't
want to get left behind with a non 4G
I've had a verizon has one but right now
their network probably can't handle it
in hspa+ really you know it's really not
pushed out that far just yet so um
that's what I think I think we're going
to see another iPad in the fall I kind
of think it's going to be a little more
of a maybe not a radical physical
redesign because they made the ipad to
read it really thin and light but I
think we'll see your higher res display
I definitely think we'll see 4G I could
be crazy I've been wrong most of time to
make these predictions and wrong so it's
fine but I think we'll see that in the
meantime ipad 2 I think you know video
chat is FaceTime as a killer feature
that a lot of people you know thought
was missing from the first one and
certainly video chat via via gtalk on
the zoom it's not perfect but you know
it's great to have it and i really think
that video calling and the tablet form
factor were made for each other big
enough easier to see you know the video
chat going on that on a smartphone so
you know for some people especially
older people you know grandparents who
want to communicate with their grandkids
across the country you know business
people stuff like that the larger form
factor the tablet is just perfect for
video chatting so I you know that was
the big thing that Apple needed to do
with ipad 2 is get the cameras on there
for face time otherwise the dual core
processor from what i have read hands on
you know people saying it's incredibly
fast which is great I'm really psyched
personally for iMovie on
ipad just cuz I think it would be fun to
play around with and then garage band is
well they introduced but you know
understand what why people are
underwhelmed I really think it speaks
more to what Apple is trying to do with
their long-term future for computing I
think iOS 5 and mac OS x lion are going
to be huge they're not they're not the
kinds of things that get a lot of play
you know like a new piece of hardware
and specs and that kind of stuff but I
think that's when you're going to really
see this kind of merging of you know
apples sort of old way of desktop
computing and the new way of touch based
computing really coming together and I
think we'll start to see that at WWDC in
a couple of months here that the
Developer Preview beta of lions are
already out but I think we'll see at wwc
a lot more on lion and possibly iOS 5
iPhone 5 and iOS 5 I would imagine we'll
come together and then I really think
we'll see a new iPad in the fall but in
the meantime we've got the original iPad
now marked down to 3 99 so that's a
great deal if you want an ipad don't
have one don't care about the cameras
otherwise starting at 499 you get the
new iPad with the cameras the dual core
processor the thinner design and I can
get those crazy magnetic smart cover if
you're into it or you know if you're on
Android you're an Android fan the zoom
I've really been enjoying it i think the
1610 form factor i think i said nine and
in a video before with 1610 the form
factor is great the wide screen for
watching the video I think it's a better
form factor for a tablet than the ipad
kind of hard to fit this in camera here
just because you get the native
widescreen mode for watching video and
then for typing I find it easier to hold
this way in type with two thumbs then
trying to touch type on this and it's
certainly easier to hold the narrower
zoom than it is the wider iPad when
you're talking about portrait mode but
then the best deal on the market if
you're not a hardcore power user it
might be this two-hundred-dollar nut
color it's just I mean I'm gonna do a
full review on it but you know it's for
ereading it's great at lunch today i
went i started reading this book Born to
Run which I've been psyched to read and
you have to you know in reading it is my
first time really reading a book on an
ereader and I very quickly forgot I was
on her knee reader and I was just
reading and then you know it's thin and
light so everybody loves Kindles and
nooks
because they're so thin and light and
easy to carry you know a whole bunch of
books around but then being a color
device you know you also get you can
have magazines on here which you know
it's just uh it's just great and you've
got you know you can go full color it's
easy to scan through and flip through
you can do your magazine subscriptions
and everything but you see I'm holding
it one-handed right now which i think is
a really nice size for people who don't
necessarily want to do a ton of video or
gaming stuff and just want something a
little bit smaller I don't know I'm a
big fan of the new color very quickly
it's also got a pretty good web browser
built in I kind of wish it at an email
client but the App Store is supposedly
coming because it is android based and
then like i said if you want to tinker
around with it you know for 200 bucks
you've got a device that you can very
easily load custom roms on to froyo
honeycomb who knows what else so I don't
know I'm a fan of it of color although
it can't do as much as the the other
tablets and then beyond that you know
like i said at the top the playbook
coming soon it looks great but I'm
worried about the whole tethering thing
but I'm also not a hardcore blackberry
user and I know that there are reasons
for that the idea of Android apps
running on the play book is very
intriguing that could be a little bit of
a monkey wrench to kind of change game
up a little bit I still think the webos
touchpad looks fantastic i think was
kind of like I have to say that I was
having you know some debates with some
android fans on on Twitter today and it
all asked you to be totally fair
honeycomb on zoom is a lot better so far
than I thought it would be and zoom in
general I'm really I'm really enjoying
it at a lot of ways and and the changes
to the app market the android market
have been great i just downloaded a
couple of tegra to optimize games i'm
psyched to check out HD gaming on this
thing so that should be very cool
obviously Tegra the next version
integral quad-core already demo'd
already announced tablets will be
shipping in august and i saw a demo that
a moment real congress and it was it was
amazing i mean a lot of a lot of
horsepower a lot of graphic horsepower
in that new quad-core tegra chip set so
that should be very cool builds very
well for Android 30 in the future of the
honeycomb platform but touchpad and why
boys I think makes webos look great but
I just I don't know if there's
developer support there and then you
know windows we're hand things about
some previews coming maybe of Windows OS
for tablets and the whole microsoft
nokia relationship very interesting but
that's down the line and then of course
Netflix on 3ds maybe that's it maybe
it's all over I don't think so all right
anyway there you go that's enough out of
me but fun to get in front of the camera
just kind of let fly with my thoughts on
the day's events in the world of tablets
for a little while and again you know
we'll try to do our best to make it
clear because I'm not trying to intrude
on all the long time John for lakers
fans believe me I get it that's why I'm
psyched to be part of technobuffalo
because I've been a fan of John's for a
while and it's great to work with him
that said though you know we're opening
things up new voices in the mix the nice
thing about a nice thing about the
Internet is you can choose what you want
to watch you don't want to watch right
so there you go till next time my name
is Noah thanks for watching much much
for on ipad to all the tablets
everything else over on technobuffalo
com we'll see you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
