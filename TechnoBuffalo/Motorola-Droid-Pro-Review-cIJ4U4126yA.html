technobuffalo here at the full review
the android phone a lot of you have been
waiting for this is a motorola droid pro
let's go ahead and dig in and see if
your weights gonna be rewarded so before
i start my phone reviews i always start
with call quality no matter what the
phone can do for a future standpoint
it's not going to make good phone calls
for you it's just not going to be worth
your money so when i do my phone test i
do a 20 call test in various areas of
southern california test for signal
strength called degradation and dropped
calls so my 20 called test I had no
dropped calls able to maintain a very
strong signal strength compared to other
verizon phones and certainly using the
bar method so by pending at how many
bars of service you have is certainly
arbitrary and relies on sort of
proprietary algorithms but the reception
here was very strong again no dropped
calls I had no white noise on my end the
other end the call him no white noise
there was no popping the Bluetooth
illness was actually outstanding
connected to the Bluetooth speaker in my
car I was able to take the phone very
far away and still maintain a static
free connection it sounds probably one
of the strongest bluetooth radios of any
phone that I've tested speaker phone
volume was average if you speaker phone
while in a loud place you're going to be
able to hear it it's not going to be
booming loud but you will probably be
able to hear the caller on the other end
the microphone seems to be very
sensitive so if there is a lot of
background noise going on the caller is
most definitely going to hear it so from
a call standpoint this phone has
actually been one of the best that I've
tested it was loud crisp and clear so
now let's go ahead and talk about the
specs let me run through them real
quickly it's not a 3.1 inch TFT
experience the resolution of 320 x 480
which will most definitely talk about
it's got a 1412 20 milliamp hour battery
good for and advertised supposedly seven
hours of battery life on the back of the
phone
it has a 5 megapixel camera with
autofocus and actually dual LED flash
from a design standpoint serve as that
Motorola hump we've seen on a few other
devices most notably the droid x it is
running android 2.2 with motoblur
sitting on top of it it's the less
obtrusive version of motoblur it's
actually the version that i prefer most
that doesn't have the sort of color
arrays at the bottom and then some
versions of motoblur you don't have the
for capacitive android buttons you're
missing the search but that is of course
a present here as well it's being
powered by a TI omap processor clucking
in at one gigahertz and it's got 512
megabytes of ram camera quality was
average about what you'd expect from a 5
megapixel phone it does take HD video at
720p it was again just about average and
comparable with other cameras of some of
their quality but that's not the reason
that most you are considering the droid
pro the reason probably you're looking
at this phone is because of what sits
below that 3.1 inch screen and that is
this fantastic full qwerty keyboard a
very reminiscent of blackberry bold
devices that's sort of that dual angle
key so it's almost slanted on each side
so while there isn't actually physical
space between each to you can feel each
button very nicely it's got a really
nice big space bar which I really enjoy
using I like the voice search function
right on here on the phone on the
keyboard is absolutely fantastic you can
use on-screen keyboards if you choose to
but I don't know why you would with the
keyboard this good this is where the
form factor a lot of people have been
waiting for and I found that to be just
quite nice easy to use and as you're
typing you get the autocorrect at the
bottom as opposed to maybe showing up
the top where you may have seen it
before it's a lot easier for your eyes
as you're looking down the keyboard to
type and you've got the correction
showing right up at top so a keyboard
wise is definitely one of the better
phones out there if you need a full
qwerty physical keyboard I know a lot of
you do this is really one of your best
choices it's got that familiar
blackberry form factor a lot of these
slide out android phones that we've seen
have a slide mechanism that comes out
from the side
revealing the screen so one of the
sacrifices that you do make for that
full qwerty keyboard is in screen real
estate 3.1 inch screen is very very very
small but unfortunately there's not much
that motorola and verizon can do about
the screen size because you have over
three inch screen and a full keyboard
below it the phone is going to be a bit
on the larger side if i bring in a 4.3
inch phone here like the evo 4g you'll
notice that there's really not that much
difference lengthwise so you can't have
a phone any bigger and you can't really
ask for a bigger screen because the
phones not going to fit in your pocket
the resolution on the screen 320 x 480
really was disappointing looking at
websites looking at pictures the text
wasn't as clear as I would have liked it
to have been and the screen did appear a
bit washed out now that may be to the
fact that this phone probably shows
brightness and gets brighter than any
other phones I've tested I've got the
brightness here right now I turned down
almost all the way down actually i'll
show you how far down is the phone is
still extremely bright kicking the
brightness up all the way it's almost
going to be blinding see how far down it
is right there alright let's go ahead
and take a look at a website as i was
mentioning here when launched it we've
got we should have TechnoBuffalo you're
queuing and loading and you will see
flash content actually loading here as
well which is quite nice this does it
have android 2.2 on it so you will have
full flash 10.1 support and it works
very well it's smooth the TI omap
processor really does a nice job keeping
up the 512 megabytes of ram certainly
help aid in that so a low TechnoBuffalo
here and we are on verizon's evdo
network which i guess with the
announcement of LTE you can almost call
legacy network so here it is loading the
flash pot that takes a bit longer to
load you can turn the flash content off
if you like you cannot want to view and
save your battery life we can see it
here working on a lot of underpowered
phones that do show flash content
pinch-to-zoom is very slow a little bit
laggy a not so on the droid pro really
does work very well despite flash
content there it almost does the pinch
to zoom multi-touch gesture
as if flash content wasn't even there so
a big I guess thumbs up to Motorola for
really maximizing the hardware and the
software put together in a really
outstanding package battery life on the
phone has not been outstanding they
claim seven hours ish of battery life
I'm a pretty heavy phone user so I'm
using email on watching an occasional
YouTube video a lot of web browsing and
texting and I had a hard time getting
through today generally by the time the
day ended I'd have about 10 ish percent
I know other people who have used this
phone I've got a few friends who use the
droid pro have to charge the phone
almost twice a day in fact motorola and
verizon offer larger capacity batteries
because that may be a known problem so
if you are a heavy user you may want to
that explore a bigger battery option or
you're going to have to very diligently
manage your battery life overall in sort
of put this package together really is
the phone that a lot of business
professionals we're looking for people
love the blackberry esque form factor of
the qwerty keyboard below touchscreen
and or blow a screen rather and the
droid pro is really the only phone that
offers that and it doesn't a very nice
package even though the phone and the
screen is a little bit smaller than I
would have liked it's really the biggest
again that Motorola can do I would have
liked a higher resolution screen on I
think it would make the text pop a
little bit more but it definitely is
forgivable so on a one-to-five scale
this to form fax you're looking for this
phone is going to get a very solid four
and a half losing out on that half
because of the low resolution screen and
the knock-on battery life if this is the
form factor for you you can pick up this
phone and be very confident that you're
getting a very modern really capable
android phone there's a lot of phones
out there to choose from and this one
really does a nice job of rising to the
surface above the rest of the Android
phones so I love to hear what you guys
think about the jewelry pros at the
phone for you not for you you like the
form factor you want a bigger screen you
can give up the qwerty keyboard you know
a lot of options here anyway guys i'm
