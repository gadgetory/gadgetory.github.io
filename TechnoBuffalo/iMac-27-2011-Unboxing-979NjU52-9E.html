delivered this thing but you weren't
home and I caught him doing that and
append is there oh I didn't know you
were home so he ran to the truck got my
package and brought it here he didn't
even bring this thing to the door so

filmed by my lovely sister who's helping
me out today say hi boo okay she's just
just said hi um and oh yeah I also
ordered Ram come with the thing I
ordered 16 gigabytes of RAM and we
