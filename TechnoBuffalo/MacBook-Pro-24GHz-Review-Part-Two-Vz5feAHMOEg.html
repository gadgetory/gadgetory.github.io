show you guys as much as I could of my
first couple days enjoy part 2 buzzer

messaging clients got support for AOL
all the other IM clients it's also what
you use if you want to use the built-in
isight here for video chat address book
it's an address book itunes you all know
itunes and if you don't which probably
some I how to use a computer I photo for
importing all your photos very cool you
have any questions by the way about the
programs you want me get into more
detail let me know and I can not get
some more detail about the program's
themselves imovie HD which actually what
I'm using to make all these and trying
to learn it's really easy actually you
import the movie and you can just
convert it to other file you want to
upload it I DVD for making DVDs
GarageBand for making making your own
music and editing some music tracks and
again all this stuff comes with the
computer soon as you turned on its there
I didn't pay extra for any of this I web
for making websites callum ical calendar
dictionary mocking explain that
quicktime photo booth is actually really
cool there I am and there you are with
some of the effects you can do it's kind
of neat black white sepia normal and
whatever you want you take pictures take
the videos you know whatever kind of a
kind of neat hi guys there you are
alright we can close that up I mail or
mail it's obviously mail um and now some
of the stuff that i downloaded i did not
buy the microsoft office 2004 because
it's not optimized for the intel
processor run
a little laggy I'm going to wait until
Microsoft release releases the actual
new version of microsoft office 07
they're saying out in November so you're
probably saying well what am I getting
use your word processing people send me
word documents all the time what am I
going to use it just really cool program
called a neo office it's a version of
openoffice totally free too and it
really is a lifesaver so let me open it
up for you guys and show you just real
quickly what it is click a program
bounces opens up here's neooffice let it
load itself up here and there now I'm in
a word processing program a full word
processing just like you'd find in Word
or anything else you can actually save
in word format you can open Word
documents it's really handy then you're
going to say well I use Excel what am I
going to do without Excel well there's a
spreadsheet and just like the text
editing lets you import and write and
word formats this lets you write in
Excel formats and it gets what dot xlm
or some fully functional spreadsheet
program very handy as well so you can
say well I use PowerPoint a lot well
there's a presentation here that does
the same thing you get the gist
openoffice very cool works like it would
work on any pc or anything great program
highly recommended I do not want to save
changes oops quit out of here for you
card okay so that's open office i also
downloaded a IM program just to give it
a shot it recommended it called ATM open
up my Applications folder actually I
dragged to the doc if you right click it
it opens it up like a start menu in
Windows with just more intuitive for me
buildin I am client just like you'd find
on a I and you can you actually want
actually can use for any anything so
anyway here oh my my buddies and all
that stuff
so that's am very cool now I'm extremely
extremely impressed with how fast this
computer is two gigabytes of RAM seems
to be plenty i'm going to upgrade anyway
just to have it at some point but two
gigs this thing is blistering fast check
the other videos it loads up in less
than 25 seconds even with all the
programs up and running on the open
everything for you I came it's already
open iphoto imovie I DVD GarageBand I
web I don't know let's open neooffice to
all the stuff that I did so as a pro
much everything open here all the
programs that i have on the computer are
now open and it's just blistering fast i
mean check it out everything is loading
up here it means to see how fast things
are loading it's amazing there's still
plenty of ram i show you that handy
widget before with all that stuff open i
still have almost a gig free of ram
which is really unbelievable and unheard
of so far i'm extremely happy with with
the computer it really hasn't been that
much of an adaptation to getting used to
using OS 10 i highly recommend switching
like i'm sure a lot of you out there i
was deciding between the macbook and the
macbook pro and i went with approach
because i keep computers for five years
i wanted to have something that I knew
was going to be a future-proof macbook
is still a great computer and integrate
option that's what you decide to go for
so you know with everything open here X
a lot of all these programs up and
running I'm gonna install parallels and
get windows on here and I'll show you
guys that little later but just highly
highly highly recommend switching over
to OS 10 I haven't looked back at all so
as always you guys have any questions
let me know any comments let me know
anything you guys want to see had a lot
of requests to showing some games I
don't really play games on here i have
an xbox and a wii for that but i will
try and get some gaming some games on
here so you guys can see them and see
how fast they look with
the processors so that's some of the
things i learned about oh it's tad and
have been using OS 10 4 i will keep this
short because YouTube is going to cut me
off i'll be posting some more more
videos in the future so anyway guys hope
you enjoyed and talk to you guys soon
