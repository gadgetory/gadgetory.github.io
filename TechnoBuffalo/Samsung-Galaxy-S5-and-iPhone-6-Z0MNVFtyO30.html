to you by carbonite what's going on
everyone welcome back to the episode of
rumor roundup I'm your host John range
and this is being filmed on Halloween
and I know it's gonna be a day after or
later when you watch this but I am all
dressed up
let's uncarrier rumor roundup this does
show right take all the rumors from the
weekend I put them together and smash
them and bash them into one rumor show
up this week we're gonna uncarrier
galaxy s5 rumors the iPhone 6 is
obviously coming and coming sometime
soon Google's we're gonna get into the
SmartWatch game and Blackberry might
finally be meeting its maker and their
disposal discussing a sale with Facebook
of all companies this rumor roundup go
ahead and uncarrier
the Korean site digital x is claiming
the galaxy s5 was going to pack ages
ridiculous four gigs of ram and 64-bit
Exynos chip and that same fake a
leatherback found on the note 3 although
there's been rumors that maybe they're
gonna totally ditch the plastic and go
for metal I put much more stock and it
looking like a smaller just redonkulous
ly powerful version of the galaxy note 3
4 gigs of ram is crazy and powerful at
this point it just like a big I probably
can't make that joke but it's just a
contest to see you can put the most
effect to the phone I can't imagine
Samsung putting anything they can use 4
gigs of ram but i imagine it'll be super
fast without the iPhone 5s is on the
market it's obviously time for iPhone 6
boomers to go flying so according to a
recent issue of Mac fan magazine which
judging by the title there might be a
little biased
Apple is aiming to launch the iPhone 6
in September not much of a story there
but the big story is is Mac's fan is
saying that it's going to have a 5-inch
screen which is kind of awesome and have
a full HD display which means 1920 by
1080 and a pretty baller PPI of 440 so
I'm open bigger screen but I'm hoping a
bigger spring doesn't mean apples like
hey look get extra row of icons give me
something iOS 6 the revamped iOS 8 which
I think I'm a broken record here that
maybe has some sort of widgets please
give me a way to quickly view my
information Apple Google is not one to
sit by and get out Samsung buy Samsung
both of the air get ready to launch
their own SmartWatch is going to super
integrate Google now is their killer
feature so it's going to be used for
localized alerts according to The Wall
Street Journal they also claimed they
learned Google's going to enter mass
production of the watch they're coming
months which means it's gearing up for a
public launch SuperDuper soon Google was
supposedly building some crazy weird
building barge off the coast of San
Francisco so maybe it's something to do
with that
since KitKat and the Nexus 5 are already
here no one knows what that weird
multi-million dollar floating thing was
the government said you can't do because
it seems shady but perhaps something to
do with the SmartWatch supposedly like
the pebble in the galaxy gear it's gonna
provide the obvious stuff like alert the
sink directly with your smart phone
unlike the Galaxy gear though Google
cares about battery life so hoping you
want to plug it in quite as frequently
at least that's all according to The
Wall Street Journal
I used the Galaxy gear I know the Galaxy
gear gives my friend the Galaxy gear
does not last very long so hopefully
Google's gonna do the sucker up right I
love Google now and hopefully on a watch
it will be super awesome
supposedly Facebook is looking to
purchase blackberry or at least they add
a how you do meeting it's obviously
blackberry might be on the way I like
December smartphone market I'm sorry if
your blog great Vantage just it's gonna
happen but there's been no surge of
interest when folks looking to get all
cozy or acquire all the company or at
least part of it the latest company is
Facebook who's executive recently met
with blackberry according to The Wall
Street Journal yet again
Facebook's has dipped its toe in
smartphone market before make you
remember they have partnerships with HTC
but it might be a much deeper interest
here so Fairfax financials have the most
public bid for blackberry the Lenovo is
also eyeing parts of the company at this
BlackBerry co-founder this name I can
finally pronounce Mike Lazar Reedy's
right now though several those
interested parties besides super tight
NDA's Politico or blackberries
financials so that necessarily mean that
a bids been made just there's a little
bit interest they've asked them out on a
first date does me they're gonna get
anywhere but they're getting to know
each other if Facebook does in the
forward the BlackBerry purchase though
it is possible the company will consider
developing its own smartphone judging by
the success of HTC first didn't say
they've got a lot of work to do for them
so what do you guys think of Facebook
buying blackberry seems kind of weird
supposedly there might be some interest
on Amazon as well
I don't think Facebook makes sense and
the Amazon makes sense I think
blackberries fling out their patents
probably makes the most sense I'm not
sure who wants to pick up blackberry ten
but I hear HP likes to buy pretty opry
systems didn't put them on the shelves
and do nothing with them so I don't know
