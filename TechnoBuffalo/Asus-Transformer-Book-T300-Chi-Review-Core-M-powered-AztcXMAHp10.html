TechnoBuffalo here at the latest
convertible from Asus this is the
transformer book t---three hundred Chi
it's rocking Intel's Core and processor
and a lot of powerful specs under the
hood it does a lot combined for a good
experience or is it way to compromise
its going to get started so this guy's
going to start out at just around 700
bucks ours as options came in at just
about 900 so that price you can get an
upgraded twelve point five inch 2560 by
1440 pixel IPS display the core and
processor eight gigs of ram 128 gig SSD
and it's totally thin and famis design
this thing is really thin at seven point
six millimeters thick and just were thin
it's still a tablet through and through
looking around you won't find things you
see on most laptops like a full-size USB
port HDMI port or full-size SD card slot
in place of those through little more
standard port you're going to get micro
USB port one micro HDMI port and a
ridiculously unnecessary hard to find
micro SD card slot that so you know is
lurking under the bottom edge so
definitely get all of your adapters
ready so look at this thing it probably
looks like a regular laptop to you but
this is a complete tablet it just pulls
right off and it does have a detachable
magnetic Bluetooth keyboard that does
need its own power when this thing is
docked in keyboard mode work just like
any other laptop would as you'd expect
the MOCA touch trackpad worked very well
the keys had relatively nice throw and
one not being full-size and really felt
my fingers feeling cramped at all one
odd thing though is if the loo tablet
itself just comes right out there's no
sort of connection actually made between
the computer and the keyboard just
little bit of magnets are going to help
hold it in place so I can get any extra
battery life when you have this dock
into the keyboard in fact the keyboard
is going to need its own charger and its
own battery that's gonna charge via
micro USB once it's in it does work very
well I would have liked if had a few
more viewing angles with it the hinge
doesn't go back all that far but it is
very easy just to put it right on and
pick it up and go
battery life was pretty decent as well
coming in just around 7 hours both out a
fan it did run a little bit on the warm
side the big thing that I want to test
about this thing was the core temp
processor we're hearing a lot about that
nowadays same processors can be in the
new Mac
ours clocks in at 1.2 gigahertz I don't
have any experience at all with the core
M borer again we're hearing way more
about it so I wanted to test see how
capable it was and do things that I do
on regular basis and probably you do too
first could have play 4k YouTube videos
absolutely without any stuttering and on
fullscreen I'll about playing for ki
BDO's well another app was snapped same
thing yep no stuttering things look
great what about playing 4k why had four
other apps open still worked as well as
it did with no apps open and on
fullscreen
so that question was what about gaming
this is obviously not meant for gaming
and it's not a gaming powerhouse but how
could handle casual games so I went
downloaded Steam fired up portal 2 and
Batman Arkham City Arkham at 720p and
default settings played really well no
stuttering no issue at all screen looks
great performance was fine the settings
got ratcheted up though that's where
things started to see some definite
slowness portal 2 was the same story no
issue at all in 720p but when I went up
to 13 30 by 768 it got a little bit
degraded and it wasn't the best
experience more although if you're ok
with 720 it actually can handle a pretty
good casual gaming so it's actually left
more impressive t 300 more in particular
the core and processor that I originally
thought it's incredibly thin light
surprisingly capable I would have liked
longer battery life or two very least
have the keyword be able provide some
extra juice the power button is a little
bit on the annoying side located in the
upper left hand corner I kept hitting it
when I trying to adjust the angle of the
screen but that's just a minor quibble
this is a solid option for the Microsoft
Office crowd who just wants to consume
media more than they want to create it
but definitely bring some that is with
you if you want to look to pick one of
these guys up so do you guys think are
you excited about the T 302 you excited
about the core M could it replace your
regular laptop or the computer I would
love to hear your thoughts I don't leave
