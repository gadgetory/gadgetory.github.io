TechnoBuffalo here and we were at the
2014 Geneva Motor Show when you think of
entry-level you might not equate that
with Lamborghini what we are looking at
right now would be the entry level
Lamborghini debut here at Geneva this is
the brand-new Heric on coming in at a
very affordable 170 thousand dollars it
is a kid brother to the Aventador and it
does not lose anything in the styling
Department this is an absolutely
gorgeous car to look at and as 100
Lamborghini through and through there
were some days geneva auto show that i
wanted to squeal with excitement if
appropriate i probably would have throw
my underwear up on the lamborghini stage
i'm such a fan of that yarder
replacement the Huracan to make the
mistake though calling it a hurricane
although it is a total storm of
awesomeness powering this angry looking
speed demon is a naturally aspirated 5.2
liter v10 putting out 610 horsepower and
413 foot-pounds of torque heard a
7-speed dual-clutch automatic gearbox no
manual shifting here which does free up
your right hand to put around the super
model which is probably in your
passenger seat just looking at this car
and the emblem on its hybrid aluminum
carbon fiber body you know it's going to
be a fast ride it will get you from zero
to 62 or 100 km/h in three seconds or 0
2 124 miles per hour 200 km/h and nine
point nine seconds making this 3135
pound car pretty much look like a yellow
blur to the cars you're passing the
Huracan essentially replaces the guy our
dough and gorgeous garden its own rights
but the haricot invest it in pretty much
every category more powerful than guy
artem more efficient than the guy ardo
lighter quicker you probably get the
picture this car is the perfect
combination of beauty Braun and I guess
affordability considering the brand name
so what do you guys think of the baby
Aventador the Huracan it is stunning
it's like part of my favorite cars here
at the show to actually see a
Lamborghini come down to a more
affordable least relatively price point
it's going to open up a tremendous new
market for the bull don't think your
guys thoughts on it leaving a comment
