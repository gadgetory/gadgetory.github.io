alive not just because beta geek is cool
but because there are so many good
phones out now it used to be if you
wanted something decent that was gonna
last you a year more you had to spend
like a thousand bucks to get the latest
thing but now there are pretty baller
phones for under 200 bucks and we cover
a lot of the expensive flagships but I
figure it's important for us to cover
the other end of the market as well so
meet honor 7x this thing is under $200 I
want them to be dramatic like pulling it
up I wanted to pull a sheet off it but
mark wouldn't let me so I think that
would have been cool and dramatic to
pull a sheet off from the comments down
below and tell mark that he was wrong
all right throw the box so this is 7 X
and there's a lot to like about the 7 X
again starting with the under $200 price
point which which is crazy so we're
gonna do an old-school unboxing it's the
blue box
alright so taking that off the top we've
got B + 7 X Oh sitting here looking
pretty it's two lenses staring at me
we've got a sim removal tool also in the
box we've got wall wart we've got a
pretty standard cable got a pretty
standard cable micro USB happening
happening here alright so this is the 7
X I'm gonna power it on and we'll talk
about some specs and what this thing can
do so first the build it is an aluminum
feels unibody type build when it turns
on you are greeted by a screen as one
would expect but it's pretty
decent-sized here it's 5.9 three inches
and the resolution is 1080 by 2160 so
how about some specs so you're getting a
Kirin octa-core processor built into
this thing 3 gigs of ram 32 gigabytes of
storage but that is expandable with
micro SD card slots
also I feel like it's important to
mention you have a headphone jack here
so you want to plug in headphones you
can actually just do that the power port
is micro USB though so bear that in mind
so the
back you've got two cameras staring at
you one's a 16-megapixel one is a
2-megapixel and on the front you have an
8 megapixel sensor for four taken for
taking those selfies first impression
some can be pretty positive and again
it's shocking nowadays the value you can
get for an under 200 price but if you
think about what you could get under
$200 going back even like two years ago
it used to be way way way pared down
slow operating system didn't work all
that well you're getting a full fledge
octa-core processor with a higher than
HD resolution three gigs of ram you know
out of the box there's some concerns
people have is that Google Play services
won't be support you got to do like a
weird roundabout way of getting on there
this phone is meant to be released in
the US market this is a US marketed
phone so you do get the Google Play
Store and Play services right out of the
box so during the set up I went and set
up the finger per unit which is located
pretty nicely on the back and see how
fast it unlocks here that's pretty quick
another reason I really like this phone
is actually the battery so it's a 33 40
million power battery honor claims
you're gonna get a pretty exact 1.47
days so just under a day and a half with
a resolution of the screen and a really
large battery you can probably push that
so longer but as I use the phone I'll
test it but if you want a phone is going
to last for a while but to be a pretty
solid option and with three gigs of RAM
things that order they wouldn't be
possible on these lower priced phones
like gaming becomes something that you
could definitely do and do pretty well
with the 7x so because of that longer
aspect ratio things that you would
narrowly do with the phone media
consumption like watching movies gonna
get less of those black bars but
probably the best use case for me is
reading a website so if you're like
browsing TechnoBuffalo you'll see way
more content than you would on a phone
that has kind of a squatter display so
it also has a screen split mode that
probably guess lets you run to ass but
you can resize the windows depending on
how big you want stuff to be so for me
it's usually like Twitter and chrome
keeping up-to-date on TechnoBuffalo but
also you guys are doing on Twitter so on
the camera side there's some gestures
you can do as well you can just hold up
your palm and take pictures instead of
trying to to find the button on screen
you can do time lapse or slow motion
you got phase detection autofocus here a
lot of stuff usually reserved for the
higher-end phones is really in here so
you're some camera samples if you want
to see if they look like they look
pretty good coming out of the sixteen
plus two megapixel sensors on the back
again I keep saying this but for two
hundred bucks you're getting a pretty
solid set if those pictures look good
they look like almost last year's
flagship quality for a phone again the
price point here here is insane you're
getting a really good value for the
dollar do you want to see a full review
on the 7x or you want to see more phones
covered in this price point
give the video a thumbs up to let us
know so thanks to honor for sending over
the 7x if you want to learn more about
or you want to pick one up for yourself

guys enjoyed be sure to subscribe but of
course hit the bell to get notified when
