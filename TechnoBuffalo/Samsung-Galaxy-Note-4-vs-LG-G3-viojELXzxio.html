Hazleton from technobuffalo i'm here at
Aoife in berlin checking out the brand
new Galaxy Note 4 and it's brilliant 5.7
inch 2560 x 1440 pixel Super AMOLED
display it's a really beautiful looking
phone you've got the nice metal
chamfered edges there you've got the
home button with the fingerprint reader
improves camera with OIS at 16
megapixels you can see just how those
edges sort of shine and light got the IR
blaster in 3.5 millimeter headphone jack
up top power button on the right and
then TouchWiz and all that fun we ran
through it a little bit in the hands-on
video but i just want to show you real
quick how it compares to the g3 here
that i have next to it to the g3 also a
flagship and an awesome device that we
really like it's similar in size
when you put them together but the
galaxy know for just a bit taller g3
sort of has that edge to edge way while
you have the the bezels here on the
galaxy note 4 pardon the ringing it just
won't stop here today and then obviously
here you have a fingerprint reader which
you don't get on the g3 and some other
changes but generally to really awesome
flagships that are certainly going to go
do battle against each other especially
United States since the Galaxy Note 4 is
going to launch on Verizon t-mobile AT&amp;amp;T
Sprint and US cellular we just wanted to
give you a quick look at the two phones
