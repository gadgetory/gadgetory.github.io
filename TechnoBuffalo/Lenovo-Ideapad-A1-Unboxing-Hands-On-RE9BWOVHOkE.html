technobuffalo with my unboxing and first
look at the lenovo ideapad tablet a one
so here we go this is the unboxing of
the lenovo a1 absolutely plain packaging
all we've got is just a picture of the
product on the front there's nothing
else not even any hints at the
specification on the back so let's get
this unboxed for you yes remove the film
actually it's just rip this off and get
into the packaging now this is one of
the sort of budget end android-based
tablets that has recently been released
and i'll tell you the price straight off
this is going to cost you a hundred and
ninety-nine dollars if you're in the US
and if you're in the UK it's going to
cost you around about 169 pounds off and
what you get for that sort of money is a
7-inch tablet with a 1 gigahertz arm
cortex a8 processor single core
processor and a tablet running android
2.3 and here we go this is what we are
presented with when we first open the
packaging so we've got the tablet itself
in a little bag and you'll notice here
I've got white version is available in
all different colors and get this with a
pink black blue or the white bag let's
pop this to one side and we'll show you
what else you get inside the box so
we've got two little compartments here
it's just open this one at first now
this is going to contain the power
adapter and being in the UK we get a UK
power adapter if you're in Europe you'll
get a different 2 prong adapter and if
you're in the u.s. you'll get a
country-specific adapter for the US but
this is a 3-pin UK one with a USB socket
on this end to charge the device then
we've got another little package here
and in here you're going to have
very little I would expect but we have
got a USB cable full-size USB on mine
micro USB on the other end use for
charging the device or getting content
on and off of the device and then we've
got some notes on the GPS feature a
quick start guide printed in full color
now to get up and running with your
device and all the various buttons and
controls and we have got some safety
information and warranty information
let's take a look at the tablet so here
we go that looks very nice indeed so as
we've got seven inch screen and that
screens got a resolution of 1024 x 600
we've got a front facing camera just
here that's a 0.3 megapixel camera we've
also got some touch sensitive buttons
down the bottom here and then on this
side completely clear round on the
bottom here we have got a micro SD card
slot for expanding the memory now just
to note you've got 16 gigabytes of
storage built into the a1 and 512
megabytes of memory and then you can put
up to a 32 gigabyte card in this slot
then we've got the micro USB charging
socket this looks like either microphone
or an LED I think that's probably gonna
be an LED status light we've got a
speaker here as well and then round on
this side we've got a switch here I'm
imagining that this is some sort of lock
rotation switch we've got a volume
rocker round on the top edge microphone
pick up three-and-a-half millimeter
audio jack and a power on/off button I'm
going to push that what I'm talking
about the tablet to get this up and
running let's go round on to the back
and we have got a 3 megapixel rear
facing camera inside here under this
cover we have got a one cell lithium
polymer battery and we've also got
bluetooth version 2.1
and BG and in wireless as well let's
give you a first look at this starting
up and see what we've got let's put it
around like this for you now 14.1 ounces
so is fairly lightweight quick to start
up it's telling me to touch the android
to begin and would I like to connect to
Wi-Fi network let's say yes let's say
let's connect it's going to scan my
various networks and I'm going to
connect to this one and pop in my
password so there we go we're all
connected to the Wi-Fi network let's tap
next so asking me if already got a
google account or if I want to set one
up later or create one well I've already
got a google account so let's go ahead
and sign in to my google account and now
that's all signed in it's asking me some
questions about allowing google's
location service we're going to say next
to that we're going to keep this backed
up to my account as well and tap next
and that should take us to the very last
one which is saying it's now linked and
we can finish the setup set the date and
time let's say automatic just to speed
things up a little bit and we will say
next and there we go we are straight in
to android 2.3 with lenovo's sort of
skin over the top where they've put this
large widget in the middle for us to
gain access to reading email was
watching listening and the web and
settings as well we decide so we can
sort of a think tap here and it should
take us straight into settings let's
scroll all the way to the bottom say
about tablet and you can indeed see that
it's running Google Android version 2.3
point 4 and then we can go back out to
the home screen and let's show you the
standard sort of apps that come
pre-installed on the Lenovo and they
install i think is an extra 10
applications to get you up and running
with more available from both the
android market and also that a no vote
app shop they've got their own sort of
app store on here so let's have a look
through so we've got calendar amazon
kindle ebuddy ES file explorer this is
one of the Lenovo apps go keyboard for
lenovo
look at in a minute we've got the lenovo
app shop news and weather nav droid will
scroll up and we've got music youtube
voice search user guide talk googletalks
pre-installed let's have a look at this
some go keyboard for lenovo see what
this is so these this is just a setting
screen so I'm imagine him when we go
into typing sighing it's going to come
up with some different options so it's
have a very quick look at that now is
tap on home and or go into my
notification button into my emails this
is how the emails are presented let's
just go into one of my comments here and
see what happens when we go to reply is
it going to give me a different keyboard
let's tap the COG wheel here and mmm
this is a little bit different
responding line let's tap on that again
it's tap and hold see what happens go
keyboard setting or input method so
we're on go keyboard for lenovo so this
is actually displaying the lenovo go
keyboard so this is a maybe a little bit
different from standard android let's
pop it round into landscape format and
see what it looks like here so look we
have a delay is it going to move round
is this what this switches for yep there
we go so that is a lock rotation switch
and we round into landscape format now
and it's a looks like a nice clean
keyboard actually so let's just have a
look sounds like a typewriter and funny
is that
so not bad that's pretty accurate and
pretty her pretty impressed with how
that's performing actually and let's go
back we're not going to save that let's
go back and we will discard the message
and let's go all the way back to my home
screen so that's pretty nice a nice
typing experience on this let's go back
to just concentrating on this UI so
we've obviously got this large widget in
the middle which we can gain access to
things very quickly we've got a couple
of other home screens if we swipe we've
got some pre-installed shortcuts here
but we can put waiver shortcuts we want
and let's swipe again we've got another
home screen here so five in total back
to the center and then two on this side
and the screen looks quite nice and
quite impressed with that let's have a
look at the viewing angles not brilliant
viewing angles but more than acceptable
on the viewing angle front and let's
just see if there are any pre-installed
photos on here no items which is a shame
so I can't show you any photos at this
stage we could show you let's go let's
go back into that we go back into
gallery you notice when you're in
gallery you've got a shortcut here to
the camera at the top so that will
actually set the camera going let's just
see how this camera behaves let me pop
my cannon s 108 camera and let's see how
this performs so we can can we tap to
focus or is it fixed focus so it looks
like it's fixed focus let's see what
happens here so is not tap into focus so
sort of a fixed focus affair let's see
what settings we've got so we've got
exposure scene modes picture size so up
to 3 megapixels white balance settings
different zoom levels location on and
off and selecting the camera front or
back and we conflict between photo and
video settings as well a little bit
disappointed that it doesn't seem to
want to focus i think it's going to be a
fixed phone
because camera correct me if I am wrong
but it doesn't seem to accept attack to
focus maybe that is just me but not that
good with the camera at the moment but
this is only first impressions it's just
a very quick look at it for you and I
will of course be taking a much more
in-depth look at this in a future video
but for now this was my unboxing and
product tour of the lenovo ideapad a10
under two hundred dollars 169 pound
google android powered tablet and it's
got a little bit of lag little bit of
lag first impressions is that is not too
snappy but for the money maybe this is a
good choice thank you very much for
watching please do come back soon and
check out more videos for me on the
channel and for now I will leave you
with a look at the lenovo ideapad a one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
