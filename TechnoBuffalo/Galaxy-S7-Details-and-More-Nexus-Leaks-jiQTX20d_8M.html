sangan from technobuffalo and on today's
episode of rumor roundup will be talking
about motorola's droid turbo to google's
to nexus smartphones Samsung's Galaxy s7
this is rumor roundup let's go ahead and
get started Samsung's Galaxy s6 still
feels new and the galaxy s6 edge+ and
galaxy note5 were only just released but
even still Samsung is pushing ahead on
the development of the galaxy s7 which
is expected to make it save you some
time early next year according to Sam
mobile samsung is taking the same
approach that it did with the galaxy s6
with a galaxy s7 it's planning two
models one with curved edges that may
eventually launch as the galaxy s7 edge
and one with a flat surface the phones
are allegedly called hero and hero to
internally and are part of project lucky
sammobile suggested that same thing is
trying to work on a few different
features that still aren't final one
it's possible we can see micro SD card
support and another is juggling between
either a dual lens camera system or a 20
megapixel shooter the good news it looks
like all US carriers are already listed
to carry the device we'll see how much
of this changes before samsung announces
of devices which if history repeats
itself should occur during Mobile World
Congress in leap februari even with the
Moto X pure edition and second
generation moto 360 on the market
Motorola apparently hasn't revealed all
of its tricks several new details about
the Droid turbo to have leaked via
phandroid confirming some key specs and
yep you guess that moto maker is joining
the party this year we've already seen a
bunch of turbo 2 specs leaked before but
this new report apparently confirms a
few of the devices biggest features for
one the turbo will indeed sport a
shatterproof 5.4 inch qhd display along
with a snapdragon 810 processor we're
also expecting 32 gigabytes and 64
gigabyte storage options 3 gigabytes of
ram a 21 megapixel camera and a massive
3760 milliamp battery now here's where
it gets really interesting in addition
to supporting moto maker Motorola will
reportedly offer buyers a free one time
design swamp within the first two years
of purchase so if you don't love the
combo you got you can redo the moto
maker process for something completely
different the droid turbo 2 is
apparently going to be announced on
October 15 with a release to follow on
October 29 now I'd say the droid turbo 2
is shape
to be a monster phone when it hits
though with those kind of specs you can
bet it will be much more than the four
hundred dollar Moto X pure edition we're
just a hop skip and jump away from
Google's Nexus event on September 29 but
it looks like the mystery has been
solved android police on tuesday posted
pictures of what is allegedly the boxes
for google's upcoming phones not only
confirming two phones are on the way but
their names to Nexus 5x and Nexus 6p it
is last week a rumor sprung up claiming
the names would be the 5x and 6p so this
isn't all that surprising but it looks
like the names are all but confirmed
they are plainly etched right onto the
box it looks as though both will come
with 32 gigabytes of storage as the
stock option though I'm sure other
options will be available at launch the
Nexus 5x is expected to include a 5.2
inch full HD display 13 megapixel rear
camera with optical image stabilization
a fingerprint sensor USBC and maybe even
wireless charging it will apparently
come in three different colors white
black and ice blue the Nexus 6p
meanwhile will allegedly come equipped
with a more powerful processor either a
Snapdragon 810 or 820 processor it will
also come equipped with a 5.7 inch qhd
display USBC a fingerprint sensor and a
killer camera the Nexus 6p will
apparently come in four different colors
including silver black which is probably
my favorite color right now white and
gold Google will make it all official at
its event next week and we'll be there

things google anyways thank you guys so
