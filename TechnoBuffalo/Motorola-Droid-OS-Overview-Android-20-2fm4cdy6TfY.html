first unleashed Android Mayton let out
one of the first mass adopted
open-source and mobile platforms the
world had really ever seen
it was very highly customisable it had a
great user interface but alas the polish
and refinement I feel of some of its
competition because they have had
generations upon generations to refine
the user experience so what we have now
with the Motorola Droid is Android 2.0
that really catches Android up in terms
of user look and feel and polish and
also brings with it some very welcome
features and upgrades that I think
almost separate Android from the rest of
the pack let's go ahead and get started
and what you're getting see now is an
overview of Android 2.0 demonstrated
here on the Motorola Droid so you can
see what to expect when your current
device gets the upgrade to 2.0 or
whether you pick up a Motorola Droid
yourself so the first thing you're going
to take a look at is what you're going
to see all the time the unlock screen so
if you've used a stock with Google
Android device in the past
you're not the unlock screen was pretty
simple you hit the menu button and you
unlocked it nothing really fancy or
anything to see their devices like the
iPhone or the Palm Pre had seen fancy
slides from lock functionality that the
Droid and Android particular didn't have
but now we do and we also have some
added functionality as well so to unlock
you slide that to unlock however there's
some more functionality built into that
as well if you want to change the phone
from vibrates ring or vice versa and
slide it the other direction now sound
is turned on I do it one more time
sound is now turned off kind of nice
nice and simple to use so slide that the
other direction and there we've got the
familiar home screen that you've seen on
previous Android devices now I should
mention is a difference between Android
devices there are devices that are
technically with Google you can see
right down there and that means devices
that have the stock Android operating
system and then there are those like HTC
Hero that aren't with Google they could
put their own
on top of it this is an overview of just
the stock Android interface so the icons
look a little bit smoother the menus are
behaving a little bit faster and it may
be due just to the hardware on the droid
I'm going to assume that there was a lot
of optimization that went into this
upgrade the previous version that was
the newest version of Android was 1.6
and of course this is 1.2 so let me
share are 2.0 rather so let me show you
some of the cool things that come with
2.0 one of the things I always liked
about Android was the ability to add
widgets to your home screen so if you
don't know what widgets are think of it
like dashboard for your Mac or gadgets
for your PC a little sort of mini
programs that have limited functionality
but can help the user do little things
that they become accustomed to so let me
show you what's new here it go ahead and
tap the home screen I get a new widgets
bar and here I got some things that are
quite new so you're seeing one right
there called corporate calendar and
that's because the with Google phones
now support full exchange connectivity
so for email calendar contacts
everything you now have full exchange
connectivity and that's important for
business users this makes an Android
device really have broader appeal people
that were relied on Exchange had a very
difficult time adopting the platform and
with that exchange connectivity in
Android 2.0 you're also going to get you
to find mailbox where all your mail
messages from different accounts will go
into as something we've seen on a Palm
Pre but previously had not seen on
Android device so back to the widgets
you now got a new Facebook widget with a
new Facebook application found in the
Android Marketplace if I was signed in
here I'd seen my newsfeed what my
friends are up to and I could post
messages right from this widget very big
Facebook user it's very cool thing to
see so some of the other widgets that
are new that are extremely useful one
called power control and this one lets
you control obviously the wireless
functionality of your device see where
your power is at you need to turn off
different radios and probably one of the
last new and I think most useful widgets
is YouTube YouTube is obviously owned by
Google so have
some increased YouTube functionality
clearly makes sense so let me show you
what this widget looks like you now have
one touch access to youtube video search
or YouTube video upload which in the
droids case is very cool it's got a five
megapixel camera that you can now record
video with and upload right to YouTube
just by hitting that little camera
button you sign into your account you
hit upload and boom your videos will
show up you can do that all over 3G
which is quite neat
and speaking of over 3G the Amazon mp3
store which is previously Wi-Fi only can
now be accessed over 3G so losing that
download music via Amazon it's going to
be a very welcome change for you so
speaking of camera if we talked about
just a minute ago let me show you some
the new camera functionality found in
android 2.0 so again this is gonna take
advantage of the five megapixel sensor
found on the droid so you can see that
there's a functionality there but if you
go to the menu and settings you don't
have some advanced settings to
previously not found on Android devices
things like focus mode picture quality
picture size so our location was there
before color effect white balance scene
mode and flash this one has an LED flash
so you've got a lot more ways to tweak
your pictures and a way to make the
device more your own and that's really
what 2.0 is about bringing new features
in to help make the device more
customizable for you and speaking of
customizable for you also an Android 2.0
and the accessibility options you're
gonna get the ability to do some
voiceover tech so if you're hard of
hearing it's gonna be something that's
going to be quite nice to you the phone
is actually will speak the menu options
to you let's go back to the home screen
and let's take a look at the Android
Marketplace the upgrade from 1.5 to 1.6
brought some nice updates to the Android
Marketplace that continues with 2.0 let
me show you what you're gonna get when
you log into the marketplace click go
and click one of the applications and
what I like most about this is most of
them are free so open up WP to go I get
some information about it I get
screenshots
some comments and ratings and I get more
applications about the developer or from
the developer I can view the developers
web page or even send an email to the
developer and some applications even
give you the phone number to contact the
developer which is quite interesting how
you can flag it as inappropriate if you
like so but probably the biggest welcome
addition to 2.0 is this new navigation
feature and it's just in beta and it's
found only right now on a Motorola Droid
it does turn-by-turn navigation similar
to what we find on Tom Tom or Garmin
devices however it is completely free
now I'm going to do a separate video
showing intricacies of how this works
and walk you through it step-by-step I
want to show you very quickly what that
looks like so we'll go ahead and hit car
home and you get sort of a new bar
looking interface where you can use
voice search so I could type it in and
say drive to South Coast Plaza which is
a mall by me it automatically finds
South Coast Plaza via search and would
route me there and give me turn-by-turn
directions with voice over text and
again there'll be a full video on this
but I wanted to show you what the
interface looked like so speaking of
voice over text that is a big thing with
2.0 is voice search so let me show you
how that works so obviously you can
search normally you can type it in if
you like
or if you hit that little microphone up
there it opens up a voice search
TechnoBuffalo
I'm actually surprised with how quickly
that it works so let me go back one more
time in techno buffalo I've been
speaking through the first time and
there you go finds techno Buffalo's
homepage and all kinds of information
about TechnoBuffalo I'm actually really
impressed with how well this works if
you don't always have time to type in
what you're looking for or not that
accurate typing and you want to do a
search you can use the voice search for
really almost anything through the phone
and it works quite well also an Android
2.0 is some improvements to the web
browser like you're seeing me use right
now again I'll be doing a separate video
on the web browser
preparing its other devices but suffice
to say it's a very improved experience
you still don't have multi-touch support
for pinch and zoom but you're getting a
very capable very quick browser and I'm
really impressed with what the Google
has done with the browser that's found
on the Droid and found on Android 2.0 so
guys when the interest of brevity before
this becomes a 20 minute video I just
wanted to talk to you about what you got
with Android 2.0 and what you would
expect if you upgraded the 2.0 and what
some of the differences are with door to
the outgoing 1.6 devices so hope you
enjoy for exclusive content checking out
