goes out and a slew of apple news i am
mark % / TechnoBuffalo and this is the
buffalo breakdown welcome to the
breakdown for the weekend of 9 12 15
that's September 12 for those of you who
have trouble with numbers lots of stuff
to get through so let's get right down
to it first up android pay is finally
launching via google play if you're
wondering why this is different from
wallet it's because pay is actually
using the virtualized hardware that
android now supports where wallet was
using a universal card support cards
won't be universally supported with
android pay since card companies are
going to need to support it but it is
going to be much safer much more secure
and most importantly you're going to get
to keep all of your points and cash back
rewards on your cards which is not
something you could do with Google
Wallet the blue pure XL is the latest
entry in the value phone market and it
looks like a screamer it's rocking the
MediaTek Helio x10 which is the high-end
system on a chip with 10 cores from the
silicon manufacturer yes I did say 10
cores by the way on paper this is like
the first true flagship level device at
our affordable price that i have seen
anyway I mean listen to this ready 6
inch quad HD display 24 megapixel rear
camera 8 megapixel front facing camera
64 gigs of storage and three gigs of RAM
I cannot wait to get my hands on this
thing especially with the rumor Nexus 5x
right around the corner both seem to be
sporting that little fingerprint sensor
in the back lots and lots of choices in
this arena these days so I'm really
stoked to see if the pure XL is my next
phone Amazon's fabled flop the fire
phone is finally extinguished yes that
was a lot of eps and I nailed it stock
has finally run out which means that
people were still buying them I guess
for some reason the device suffered from
a plethora of issues not to mention a
price of 200 bucks on contract I also
wouldn't expect to see a fire phone to
any time soon given that they also just
laid off most of the team that was
responsible for the original device so
rest in peace fire phone
all right now for that sweet apple news
that you've all been waiting for
obviously we have the apple event this
week revealing some sweet sweet stuff
out in San Francisco so let's get some
small ones out of the way first the
newest version of OS 10 is landing
September 30 if it's called El Capitan
and it is a bit of an incremental update
but it is exciting nonetheless watch
os/2 is also on the way with third-party
complications that are going to allow
developers to include small little data
points and widgets into apps and watch
faces Plus that Apple watch now comes in
two new finishes gold and rose gold the
brand new Apple TV was unveiled as well
the new device is a pretty significant
upgrade especially with the specs on the
inside but the real changes come in the
form of TV OS Apple's new OS for the
device that will allow it to run iOS
games and apps with just a little bit of
modification on the dev side to support
the larger screen the new UI is much
easier on the eyes it's really really
pretty it's got this great parallax
effect on the covers of movies and the
brand new remote has some remote like
abilities for games a touch pad for
navigation and most importantly a
microphone when you miss a line you can
ask Siri what did he say and the Apple
TV will automatically rewind 15 seconds
and turn on closed captioning for those
15 seconds just so that you can see what
that person said I will take two of
these for my parents please have them
rush shipped to their house ipad mini 4
was also updated kind of under the radar
to air to specs with all the hubbub
about the ipad pro which we're going to
get to it may have kind of slipped under
that radar like i said so it's now
rocking the same specs at the ipad air
so if you're like me you prefer a
smaller form factor for your tablets
this is a great great option for the
price now of course it wouldn't be an
apple event without a little bit of
disappointment / sticker shock apple's
new ipad pro is a gigantic 12.9 inch
ipad it's still running iOS but Apple
thinks that that's going to be enough
for you to replace a portable computer
while I'm not sure that's quite true it
does make perfect sense for Apple to be
making these kinds of moves to converge
iOS and OS 10 the two major platforms
that they work on that is not although
there's also a smart keyboard cover
which is very very reminiscent of the
surfaces type cover and of course we
would be remiss not to mention the Apple
pencil which can detect pressure angle
all kinds of really cool stuff in terms
of being a stylist on an iPad yes yes
whatever but it's a pretty cool device I
think it does look really silly it's
going to look super funny plugged into
the iPad pro for charging but you can
pick up an iPad pro at the whopping
price of 799 the cover is going to run
you 129 in the US and the pencil is yes
$99 the iphone 6s and 6s plus are
finally on the way they should be
launching before the end of September
and yes they look the same as the last
model on the outside but I mean you can
compare them on the inside right as you
know the S models of iOS devices tend to
be the more incremental changes but this
time around we're seeing something that
I think is going to be really really
huge this is the first iOS device since
the iphone 3g that i've seriously
considered purchasing 3d touch is new
tech in the new iphone that allows the
6s and 6s pluses to detect pressure from
your fingers on the screen it's
essentially replacement for the long
press interaction which was never
terribly elegant this removes the
inherit latency present in the long
press in that gesture and it adds
multiple layers of interaction I cannot
wait to play with it this is such a huge
step for user experience and I cannot
wait of course it's also got some other
cool new stuff it's got a 4k camera now
some much stronger 7000 series aluminum
a much better fingerprint sensor and a
bunch more upgrades under the hood
pricing on the new iPhones is all going
to remain exactly the same as last year
but of course last year models are now
the affordable ones well herders that's
it for this week thank you so much for
watching I hope you enjoyed the show you
guys may have noticed some sweet new
animations in the show this week we got
some new lower thirds and I just want to
point out we got them from our friends
at video blocks they've got a ton of
great post word templates for after
effects and for apple motion we grabbed
one that looks cool and it came with
instructions and all that cool stuff for
a template plus you can use as much or
as little of it as you want so we just
grabbed the part that we wanted to use
for the lower thirds which you'll see
right here which is nice and pretty they
have a subscription model is the way
that works so you can pay 10 bucks a
month to get access their entire library
plus they were nice enough to send along
a link for us for you guys which you can
find in the description to get yourself
a free 7 day trial with video blocks not
to mention of 240 clips that you can
download over that seven-day trial it's
really really cool stuff so if you work
