to you by Dollar Shave Club what's up
everyone jon rettinger from
TechnoBuffalo here in his time for
another smartphone smackdown we've got
the Android heavyweights ready to battle
it out in five rounds on one corner
we've got the brand new HTC One m8 in
the other we've got Samsung's latest a
galaxy s5 let's smash these two
head-to-head see which one comes out on
top don't give a few disclaimers here
unlock against the clock speeds or
benchmark scores these are both really
really fast phones we are going to cover
five categories we're gonna break it
down till I think are the five most
important screen build custom UI camera
and other phone intangibles I think
these are mostly just giant screens
let's start there so the HTC one's got a
5-inch 1920 x 1080 display meeting if
you can do math really quickly as a 441
PPI its frenemy that galaxy s5 is a 5.1
inch screen same resolution 1920 x 1080
means got 432 ppi just so you know the
facts was in both screens here look
absolutely awesome I look at every
single smartphone screen out there so
probably my eyes are a little bit jaded
the display on the s5 is absolutely
incredible on its own just great on the
m8 is pretty tremendous as well but when
you put the two next to each other you
can really see a difference think of it
like this you're shopping for TVs when
you see a whole bunch of sets on the
wall next to each other you'll see a
difference between which one looks
better which one looks worse because
they're compared right there but if you
take one that mood is with the greatest
home put up on your wall feeling
gorgeous and you're ever going to see it
by comparison that's sort of the same
thing here with the MH screen any s5
screen when it comes down to screen it's
absolutely gorgeous here on the galaxy
s5 the galaxy s5 also is going to give
you four percent more screen real estate
than the HTC One m8 and in most apps the
actual difference would be a little bit
bigger than that because the one and
eight uses on-screen navigation buttons
while the gs5 is physical actual buttons
right below the screen you will however
get the ones full 5-inch landscape in
areas like image gallery videos google
play and sort of other things here the
bottom line though all pictures videos
and games are going to look pretty
awesome but this round the winner go
to the galaxy s5 all right now let's
talk about build so last generation the
HTC One totally ran away at this round
versus the galaxy s4 aluminum vs.
plastic I take metal every day of the
week this generation though it gets a
little bit muddier so sure we're so
looking at the same material HTC one is
a feat of engineering it feels like a
premium quality advice I love how it
feels and you first pick it up but the
desk go with the price metal is not
known for being water resistant and a
unibody design doesn't necessarily mean
a removable battery you can see where
I'm going HGC took a form over function
while Samsung went for function over
form the s5 feels like pretty much every
other recent samsung phone out there
it's got a plastic back and it's flimsy
plastic at that the only thing new
design wise is that it now has dimples
on the back you won't look at the s5 and
think it's a beautiful device you're
more likely see its practicality the
plastic though this generation does mean
the device can be water-resistant
meaning you're now getting an active
device in a standard package that can
totally forgive stance on freezing
classic here in fact I can see why and I
think it makes total sense this is a
comparison of personal choice and if I
was picking up one base just on build I
go for the HTC One but then again I
haven't dropped my phone in the toilet
or the pool up what yet when that
happens though I might want to change my
choice but this one goes to the HTC one
lets you jump into custom UI and I can't
really call them skins anymore because
they're totally new operating systems
almost it's a case of sense versus
TouchWiz or modern UI you guys might
have your opinions here but this one to
me is a no-brainer it looks like Samsung
just threw a ton of features at you and
hope that you liked a few them HTC that
seems to be more selective what they
added hope that you'll use our the
entire Sense experience TouchWiz while
still over a functional is too bright
too cartoonish too loud and just feels
really silly to me before you jump down
my throat and felt listing all different
launchers and things that are available
no time evaluating the device just as it
comes out of the box is this even that I
like sense all that much although I do
it's more about me not liking touch was
in fact every modern sampling device
I've used the first thing i have
downloaded is a brand new launcher so
end of the day though they're both
extremely useful but i do like the
experiential HTC One including their LG
like knock mechanism for waking up the
phone and email client on sense the top
notch I like unified inbox so with gmail
it's totally out of question for me
we touch was I usually down with a third
party app something like canine or aqua
male this one definitely goes to the HTC
one let's jump to the back of the phone
when it's all about camera it's
ultrapixels versus de pixel pixels
looking at these two phones on paper it
seems like a runaway victory for the s5
drawl 16 megapixels got to be better
than four ultrapixels right but not so
fast the ones camera has bigger pixels
which calling ultrapixels which means it
helps take brighter shots and more
colorful shots in poorly lit conditions
the first thing I'm impressed me about
both cameras is the shutter speed I'm
mutually taking pictures of a pretty
fast moving infant so that was a huge
thing for me and I was shocked and how
fast both of these are the ones got that
little thing up there the duo camera it
helps you create a background blur
bouquet effect and choose a point of
focus after you snap the shot it works
that it's pretty awesome only problem
though is that the s5 nearly every other
Android phone on thur could accomplish
the same thing with software the one
process the image is a little bit faster
than the s5 but when doing the blurring
a few tenths of a second really doesn't
matter that much to me HTC One though
did shine in low light as was expected
from the bigger pixels everything else
that went to the s5 plus it shoots video
in 4k I choose a winner based on this
criteria if I was leaving my regular
camera at home which phone would I grab
had to take pictures and that one I'd
pick up the galaxy s5 every day of the
week all right now let's jump to
intangibles there's a lot here galaxy s5
is water resistant it's got a
fingerprint scanner then all fairness is
finicky at best does have removable
battery has a heart rate monitor though
there are plenty of apps do the same
thing and is compatible with all of
Samsung's wear devices HTC one though is
killer boomsound speakers now has
expandable storage like the s5 feels
ridiculously awesome in the hands has
dedicated duo camera and a little less
offensive on the eyes with the sense UI
and it's got the pretty awesome HTC
advantage that will replace or fix your
device if you break it this one though
comes down to a tie what's more
important to you buying razors kind of
sucks you got to go to the store get the
key that plastic razor fortress thing
you got to shell out crazy money for
some insane shave tech you probably
don't need but shaven for a few years
here my razor worked fine before the
vibrating leisure pointy handles you
could tell I need something to help me
shave and fortunately there's a company
that's doing away with all of that
ridicu
silliness and it is Dollar Shave Club
and it couldn't be simpler for just a
few bucks a month Dollar Shave Club
ships pretty amazing razors and other
bathroom selenia sundries to your door

shape company is it just like a fraction
of the price you got more money to buy
tech they also got all kinds of other
stuff like dr. Carver is easy shea
butter to make your shave even more
buttery smooth a ton of other shave
stuff and other things for the bathroom
so definitely go check them out save
time save money join now at Dollar Shave
Club calm / TechnoBuffalo probably
should use my Dollar Shave Club razors
this morning again that is Dollar Shave
Club calm / TechnoBuffalo you're
probably saying to yourself there are
five categories to went to each one owes
its high John's going to make this thing
a freakin tie I am NOT going to do that
to you i am going to pick a winner
before I do let me tell your reasons why
I think you should pick up the galaxy s5
first if you have to have removable
battery if you plan on doing a ton of
photo cropping it's got the 16
megapixels verse 24 so you can crop a
lot more or if you need or want water
resistant screw the beach a lot maybe
I've young kids great reasons to get the
galaxy s5 but but if I put both of these
phones on the table I'm siding which one
I'm going to pick up I'm going to take
the HTC One with me so I am picking the
HTC One despite this being a tie this is
a personal choice I would pick the HTC
One both are really good phone zone
there are ton of reasons to get the
galaxy s5 but for me and my money
follows upgrading it would go to HTC so
you guys are watching what do you think
do you agree to my choice do not agree
with my choice I want to hear your
thoughts was even the comments right

decision and why you think you might go
