technobuffalo here yesterday I was
sitting on the couch relaxing checking
my Twitter feed when I got a message to
today congratulations on 400,000
subscribers so I went and checked and
sure enough we had passed that milestone
so I want to just to send a huge thank
you to the audience thank you for
sticking with us for however long you've
been here I wouldn't even with us from
day one with my awful nervous macbook
pro unboxing to the videos that we do
now we've been able to let a lot of
people live their dreams because of your
support so thank you for watching thank
you for commenting on the videos thank
you for the trolls that comment thank
you for the people that correct the
trolls thank you for those leave
constructive criticism thank you for
those that leave compliments thank you
for those that are too embarrassed or
too shy to leave comments at all just
thank you for watching guys I say this
over and over again I can't tell you how
much I mean it you give me the entire
TechnoBuffalo staff a chance to live our
dreams even on a bad day i can't believe
that i get a wake up and play technology
for a living phones gets into the office
because if you give us the opportunity
to do it and that is a responsibility
that will never take for granted the
entire TechnoBuffalo staff will never
take for granted foreign italian
subscribers is a huge milestone but it's
just a milestone it doesn't define who
we are what we want to do I'm excited to
get to half a million to a million and
beyond certainly as a way to justify and
sort of quantify the work that we've
done but the real grade and the real
score is how you guys like the content
how you view the content whether or not
you come back and watch another video
whether or not you see 17 iPad unboxing
but not you click the one from
technobuffalo that's the real grade that
matters it's wonderful that we hit this
many subscribers I still can't fathom
that many people watch what we have to
say but the real grade is whether or not
you come back what about you tell your
friends and I just want to thank you
from the bottom of my heart for your
support thank you for letting all of us
live our dreams thank you for letting
all of us do what we love and it's
something I will never ever take for
granted so from all the TechnoBuffalo
staff to you thank you for helping us
reach this milestone here's to next
400,000 and beyond most importantly
thank you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
