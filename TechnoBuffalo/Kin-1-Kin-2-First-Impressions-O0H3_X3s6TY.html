technobuffalo here you get a headed
version of me today because I have crazy
hair so for those of you sick of apple
news the past week today is the name
very good day it was Microsoft's turns
take the media stage with their time to
share event you see me look tense
because I got some notes in front of me
as keynote just ended there are a lot of
rumors swirling about when Microsoft was
going to announce perhaps it was going
to be its dual tablet courier but in the
past days we sort of had rumors leaked
out that was going to be new phones
dubbed Project pink which is an internal
code name that they've been using at the
Redmond campus and that was exactly what
we got a little while ago microsoft
acquired danger the company that was
behind a sidekick a psychic was made by
sharp danger sort of design software
this is sort of the first fruit of that
labor so the two handsets that were
previously called the turtle and the
pure you may have seen them on post on
TechnoBuffalo other sites have now been
officially announced and i've been
dubbed kin one and kin to which
immediately made me think of dr. Seuss's
thing one and thing two but these are
not mysterious little creatures these
are actually pretty handy social
networking phones let's go ahead and get
started and talk about what they do
let's start with the smaller kin one
previously call the turtle and
essentially is a square slider phone
with the rounded edges the keyboard
slides out from the bottom it's got AQ
vga screen it's got four gigabytes of
internal storage and a five megapixel
camera with LED flash I'm going to talk
about the U is of both of these phones
in just a minute the next phone Kim Koo
sort of the big daddy of them all with
the more traditional qwerty form factor
a side slider so it goes into landscape
and the keyboards down below it this one
has AQ or sorry an h vga resolution it's
got 8 megapixel camera and double the
storage at eight gigabytes both have
Wi-Fi Bluetooth both have a multi-touch
including in the browser which does at
first blush appear to be based on the
zune browser which is fantastic the zune
browser is quite good so you'll be able
to get your pinch in
sumon on a Microsoft devices people are
very happy about it does have all of
your content stored online we'll talk
about that in just a minute does not
have flesh and does use a capacitive
touchscreen so let's talk about sort of
the big things about these Ken hands
that's because right off the bat SPECT
was sort of average impressive they
announce something called kin studio
first essentially why they're saying the
eight gigabytes and the four gigabytes
of storage in the handsets aren't a big
deal because kin studio essentially
takes your entire phone and puts it
online so in this kin studio which they
believe is probably based on Microsoft
solar lights technology you now get
access to all of your content online all
your pictures all your videos all your
contacts email pretty much any can get
on your phone you get access to in this
nuke in studio which is actually really
cool we started seeing these features a
little bit in bits and pieces Apple's
done it with mobileme Microsoft sort of
data in the past nokia has a little bit
of ways of doing it this is where the
first time we've seen all of your
content brought online you know not just
limit it to contacts or pictures but
really everything you have on your
device which is really cool that is
called kin studio the operating system
as a whole is called kin loop and
appears to be based on Windows Phone 7
which is quite nice and it's not based
on the older legacy 6.5 whatever series
of phones which is a bit of a
unimpressive user interface so what this
sort of kin loop does it's got a home
screen similar to windows 7 I almost
have static tiles but the titles are
actually dynamic we're def static tiles
are dynamic but essentially instead of
showing you information they show your
friends this phones and both of them are
very based and heavy on the social
networking site potato all your friends
are doing what they're up to I can get
pictures representation it's very
similar I'd say to even Motorola's a
motoblur that we've seen on a ton of
Motorola branded handsets this is a more
integrated and tightly tightly wound
interface looks to be very smooth
scrolling very smooth flick scrolling is
certainly there and this sort of kin
loop is highlighted by what's being
called the kins spot and sort of an
omnipresent green dot that's always at
the bottom your phone it's sort of like
a monster
embossed or monster outbox rather attend
see what you do is you want to send a
mess to someone you take the picture
take your name you dragged to that kid
spot favorite of a content you want to
send them with its pictures video
whatever it drags that kin spot
automatically pulls up the message with
those detachment and people you want to
send it to it's a lot easier way to send
multiple messages to a lot of people you
can think anything you want you can pick
a search that you've done a Twitter post
a facebook post picture you've taken
video taken really anything you do on
the phone you can send using this kin
spot which is really sort of a neat
addition it's going to be coming to
verizon in the u.s. in May and throws
you in Europe on Vodafone in the fall it
does look to be a very nice integrated
experience clearly geared at the social
network in crowd probably the 15 to
probably 20 ish range the ones that are
very tech savvy and really into
technology it's very nice to see
Microsoft continue to innovate however
you have to wonder about their market
cannibalization Microsoft loves to
fragment the product line you look at
you know windows 7 or even windows vista
home premium basic starter ultimate I
mean all different varieties they're
sort of doing that same thing with the
phone platform so you've got windows
phone 7 which has a lot of social media
features built into it we've seen those
tiles are taking pictures and now which
is probably geared to you know business
and prosumers now you've got these kin
devices which are geared towards a
younger audience so that may be a bit of
confusion is okay which direction do i
want to go I Microsoft photos and care
as long as you stay within Microsoft but
they're gonna be a lot of other options
there as far as putting the Kin say up
against a motoblur phone looks like the
can is going to do a decent amount more
however I could mention these kin
platforms have no sort of app store so
if you're really big uns applications
and you've been using the android
marketplace or palms app catalog or
Apple's App Store you're going to be a
bit disappointed you're going to be
limited to what Microsoft gives you now
that's not to say they might not open up
an app store the future this is indeed
based on Windows Phone 7 perhaps we get
access eventually 12 of phone 7 apps
that will be coming out but right now
you get nothing so you really limited to
the experience that really Microsoft's
hand use whether that's a downside or
you don't care
for you to have to weigh overall I'm
pretty excited get my hands legs devices
it check them out I'm a big fan of any
device that sort of brings something new
to the table this brings a very new UI
the spot and the loop and even the
studio tour brings everything online are
very cool innovation and certainly I
hope that's going to force a competition
and force the other developers to sort
of integrate similar features into their
phone it's nice and seeing multi-touch
besides see a capacitive screen
hopefully resistive screens are on their
way out just a little bit of a better
technology a little prefer stylist not
going to be so happy so guys what do you
think about these canned handsets are
you excited you're not excited are you
going to you know line up with rising
store you want to sort of wait and see
what comes out between now and May which
you know there could be a few days of
announcements so guys anyway i'm jon
rettinger from TechnoBuffalo with the
time to share events recap I hope you
guys enjoyed and I will see you in the
next video goodbye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
