TechnoBuffalo combo here this random
office building on Second Street in
downtown San Francisco a little bit i
found it's a tmobile mytouch 4g slide
let's open it up
alright it's not really a random office
bill thank god this is where i met the
tmobile folks they were in town wanted
to give me a little hands-on tour of the
phone little philosophy behind it and
I've got my review unit this one hits
the stores hits the streets the story is
often dated before it ever hit the
streets this instance stores on July 27
internet presale before that it'll be
available in black and khaki this is the
khaki it really is khaki on the back I
called it silver before I saw the back
because the chrome accent but khaki on
the back also available in black it'll
be 1 99 99 on contract and this is the
new flagship phone for tmobile right now
their hero device for the near-term
future while it boots up will show you
else will show you what else is in the
box you've got your manuals you've got
your USB cable and your USB based power
adapter the phone is built on the same
same platform as the HTC Sensation so
it's a dual core Qualcomm processor 768
megabytes of RAM but the two big things
to differentiate errs besides the
software which we'll get to a little bit
more in a minute this successor
obviously to the mytouch 4G so you've
got the genius button some of the other
features but you've got the keyboard
hardware wise the big differences
between this and the sensation you've
got the keyboard HTC for row keyboard
and then you've got this new advanced
camera sensor which the folks at emo
will really really excited about it's an
8 megapixel camera dual LED flash
autofocus full 1080p video capture but
it's the software they're really excited
about the sensor itself is a new sensor
it's got to lower a better f-stop better
low-light performance back light
illuminated sensor all kinds of stuff
that honestly is a little bit beyond me
in terms of technical knowledge of
photography and mechanics of cameras but
they assure me best camera phone ever
so we'll put that through its paces
we'll see us on the front is a VGA
camera it's a 3.7 inch display with wvga
resolution 800 x 480 obviously
capacitive touch pinch-to-zoom
multi-touch all that good stuff you've
got the newest version of HTC Sense and
then you've also got some customizations
with the software made by HTC in
conjunction with t-mobile so you've got
the genius button down here on the
bottom these are hard buttons not
capacitive touch levels hard buttons
you've got the genius button as well as
your back button your menu button and
your home button and we'll take a quick
look here let's get started tour
you can see tithing the camera features
sweep shot is a panorama panorama boats
first shot for rapid fire multiple
frames HDR they're branded as clear shot
therefore better photos and high
contrast lighting situations there's
your genius button voice command system
it's an improved voice command system
with an always listening modes you can
speak to it to wake it up instead of
having to press the button and one of
the cool things about the camera that
they showed me real quick
let's go to let's go to home we get out
of here
I use location consent free she's the
theme that's fine just want to show real
quick and do this later
another cool feature on here is group
text so you can set up a group texting
group messaging chat and you can
basically send out a text message to a
list of people and once the group chat
is going you only get charged for one
text message no matter how many
recipients are on that thread which is
kind of nice little thing but when you
hit the hardware camera button here lit
up the camera and there's a demo video
we're going to skip that for now because
this is already getting into a long
unboxing South video but you can see the
modes here if we switch to real dark the
mode will switch to night mode and so
basically we've got these different
program modes on the camera they're
called scenes you've got Auto sweep shot
HDR clear shot HDR burst shot night mode
cetera et cetera and the the software in
the camera auto selects when you have it
in auto mode it will auto select the
appropriate mode for whatever you're
doing as you can see again if I make it
dark it'll switch in the night mode
there automatically pretty cool so I'm
excited to check out the camera see how
it does of course whoops of course also
it's kind of a novelty these days to use
the phone with a hard keyboard that's
not a blackberry so psyched to try that
out as well and there you go kind of an
unboxing first look first hands-on at
the mytouch 4g slide built by HTC with
t-mobile it's t-mobile stores in july
twenty seventh 199 on contract and again
you know the big things here you got the
android platform the latest version of
HTC Sense 8-megapixel camera t-mobile
touting it as the most advanced camera
going Netflix pre-loaded so there's your
Netflix compatibility even though they
just raised their prices no more my
modes feature but they did retain the
genius button and the kids own
application as well Wi-Fi calling Wi-Fi
hotspot quick video chat built-in for
facing camera all that good stuff and
we'll go here to settings just to
confirm
there we go android to type 304 with the
latest HTC Sense version 30 with some
t-mobile customizations your
customizable buttons down there in the
bottom kind of fun there you go that's
it customizable buttons go buy one we'll
have much much more on the mytouch slide
4g in black and in khaki and all the
other new stuff from t-mobile and
everybody else over on technobuffalo com
so next time my name is Noah thanks for
tuning in thanks there goes my camera
thanks to the folks from t-mobile for
meet me here at this random office
building and give me a review unit so I
can bring you all more on the mytouch 4g
slide see you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
