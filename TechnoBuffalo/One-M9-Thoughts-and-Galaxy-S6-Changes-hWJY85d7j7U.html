to you by citrix go to assist what's up
everyone welcome back the episode of ask
the Buffalo marijan Rangers to show you
could ask me any question that you've
got going on in your life more the
technology this week though all about
new smartphones is physically the
smartphone's that got announced at
Mobile World Congress first question
comes from Twitter at e1 slavin desks at
john for lakers galaxy s6 s6 edge or HTC
One m9 dad is a tough question i'll talk
a lot about these phones throughout the
video i think for the most part the HTC
m9 is definitely evolutionary a lot of
people were saying it's more like the
HTC m8 point 5 or HTC m8 s Samsung what
a totally different design direction
they're trying new things again we're
going to talk more about that I rely
quits samsung's done at the edge lines
you still get the same phone as the
knotted version if we get the added
features of the edge and shoes without
to use it or not we're not sacrificing
anything other than probably paying a
premium price for it so how to pick one
of those three I pick up the s6 edge
next question comes from ad jr. Tobias
525 asks at John for lakers how do you
feel about Samsung not allowing micro SD
cards or removable battery in the s6
lineup could that be a deal breaker so I
find it's funny for a few reasons first
remember the wall hugger commercials at
Samsung ran may have making fun of
apples always had to have their phone
plugged in things have changed a little
bit and was in phones changed things
change ideas change with people you
probably don't feel the same way about
such a topic that you might have a few
years ago so Samsung has a right to
change their mind and change the design
director just they did something one way
you know for a few years and doesn't
mean they always have to do it so people
are up in arms about not being having
removable battery which I understand my
question to those people is did you
actually care removable battery you
carry a backup battery for samsung
device if you did you have an absolute
right to be upset or at least not
upgrade if you didn't carry another
battery then it probably shouldn't
matter to you at all the micro SD card
thing I think I get a lot more it's nice
to have it's one of the nice features of
Android that you can do that you know
certain the apple doesn't offer it I
would certainly taking an apple ask
approach here though with the s6 you can
pick it up in size up to 128 gigs you
can still get a lot of storage but you
can't take that SD card with you or swap
out or add a new one with higher size
should you choose
so is it a deal breaker probably not
think people have to sort of get used to
this new paradigm now a samsung that
sort of going to be the way Samsung is
probably going to do it moving forward
but if it is a deal breaker for you
might I suggest you check out the note
for that question comes from atmel Vic
Marco who asks at John for lakers just
want to get my question in and ask John

for as well last question comes from at
way to Jonathan I like your name at John
for lakers what are your impressions on
the HTC One m9 hashtag ask the be so HTC
clearly listened with the complaints
people had about the HTC One m8 gone is
ultrapixel camera on the back they move
it to the front which i think is great
they upped it to a 20 megapixel sensor
on the back I'll report to sign the
camera still not so awesome design-wise
doesn't look that much different to the
HTC One and mate which usually the case
every two years you sort of see a design
change only been a year since we saw the
m8 i love the themes on it i love that
there's now expandable storage built in
i would have really liked to have higher
res screen i know i've said all the time
i don't see that much of difference
between 2k screen and a good 1080p
screen but think as a flagship phone
suspect that it needs to have to be
competitive you know it's competing with
the samsung galaxy s6 right now the LG
g3 which already has 2k when the g4
comes out that'll certainly still have
at the very least a 2k screen if not
somehow higher think puts it a little
far behind i do like that they use a
Snapdragon 810 I like they up to the
three gigs of RAM think they've done a
lot of really good things i also really
like sense i'm looking at the
marketplace if you're looking you know
those super phones out there in the
Android world not much makes the m9
stand out for me but of course I'll hold
my that opinion
I get gents the hub my hands on it to
try it to test it and perhaps it can win
me back to HTC and I think you guys for
watching hope you enjoyed if you like
the new phones it came out the mobile
role conic give the video a thumbs up
ago as appreciate it until next time I'm
