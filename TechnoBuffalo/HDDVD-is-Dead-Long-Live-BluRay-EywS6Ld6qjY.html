the United States happy Presidents Day
and to those of you not in the US happy
Monday I wanted to make a quick video
about the impending demise of toshiba's
backed HD DVD they're getting ready to
make an announcement probably tomorrow
about the ceasing of production of all
HD DVD hardware and software so what
does that mean for you guys to those of
you that were early GD the adopters what
you guys going to do um you know it
definitely sucks are you gonna keep the
player you're gonna try and sell it
early well yes maybe will you still can
you know I have an HD DVD player that I
picked up on a $98 special at walmart a
couple months back I don't know what I'm
gonna do you know I might give it to my
grandparents or parents let him use it
as an upskilling TVD player or maybe
I'll try and pick up all the HD DVDs I
can you know while they're being
discontinued don't know I'm to those of
you that Bob blu-ray players
congratulations you back to winning
horse and to those you that I've been
waiting to jump into the format war is
this all the impetus you need now one
side is one they'll be unified format
all the studios will be behind blu-ray
you guys finally going to be able to
jump on board to the high def discs or
you can even just try and wait for
downloads to catch up don't know having
seen both blu-ray and HD DVD I can't say
that they look beautiful on a hi-def
television absolutely amazing regard to
digital downloads I did download HD
movie from the apple TV and it looked
good didn't look nearly as good though
as blu-ray or HD DVD does if you guys
want a little bit of a comparison gonna
do a video hopefully soon of the ps3 as
a blu-ray player so it keeps you guys
looking to pick that up or some other
sort of stand-alone player so guys
wanted your impressions and see what you
guys are gonna do now to format war is
over you're finally going to have enough
impetus to go and to go and buy one
don't know HD HD HD HD DVD is now gone
the way of Betamax
those of you too young to remember
Betamax it was like VHS box with a
different format there's a form at war
too back in the day anyway guys just
want to make quick video see what your
thoughts are what you're going to do I'm
happy I have a blu-ray player got the
ps3 due to use and a special thanks to
