case I think encapsulates Apple as a
whole it is extremely polarizing either
love or hate ear pods there's been a ton
of air pod reviews on the Internet in
fact I haven't done any coverage on the
air pods at all
mostly because I thought that I had
incredible bias against them I didn't
like the way they looked I didn't like
the price on and I didn't like to appear
to be a limited feature set but also
appeared to be really reduce audio
quality everything about these things I
did not like and I figured that we're
just gonna come through in the video so
usually when I feel that strongly before
I test a product I generally tried to
just not test it because there's no way
my mind could be changed or at least
that's what I thought so I wanted to see
if my biases were based in reality so I
bought a pair of ear pods an extremely
expensive pair of air pod just for
myself not with a company thing just to
try them and my opinion on them actually
changed I think Apple did a lot of
things right and there's still a lot of
room to improve with the air pods first
thing they'd to improve on you can't get
over how bigoted d-bag you look at these
things you're here like there's no way
around it just look like they just cut
the string off regular ear pods but I
get it and in design make sense because
there's batteries that are built into
there and those dead batteries actually
lasted longer than I thought I figured
something that tiny you go ahead and
caption out that you have to make jokes
was gonna last very long instead of
getting about two and a half hours so
that was one of my concerns was kind of
slashed away um have you ever worn these
things out and about you know people
give you like definitely nerd side I
like I also like that myself liking this
case that I've ridiculed many times in
my mind they were announced its small
its compact it fits in that little like
change pocket of my jeans and you've
tried the ear pods in the past they
sound exactly it's not exactly like that
the bases don't sound that good can you
sound a little bit muffle is a ton of
Indian noise coming in so know that
going in you not get the best audio
Fidel
another she lot of people have had us
how it fits in your ears I never really
thought much about my ear holes and let
me probably have it either they spit in
my ears pretty well that my wife try
them on they fell right out of her so
it's gonna depend on without your ears
or the right shape for the headphones
before this video would not talk about
the specs that kind of stuff but they
legitimately changed my mind
but you able to have a pair of bluetooth
headphones that will recharge really
quickly about 20 or 30 minutes but I can
keep in a small pocket of my jeans it's
going to give a reliable connection and
at least average audio fidelity they can
watch a movie with it was good enough
for me
still super expensive though SoDo what
you're getting into if you do want to
take the plunge and spend 160 odd bucks
for a pair of air pods
know what you're getting when I go back
and buy these again maybe maybe I would
just for the sheer convenience back of
do the amount of traveling that I do but
if you don't fall into that use case
maybe wait for next generation or just
buy the QC 35 so we're coming to the day
comes from our Q&amp;amp;A video where I talk
about some Samsung Galaxy s8 rumors are
ton of other questions I'll link to that
video up here coming from flat Stan who
said I like this cool guy approach some
of the comments of the day have not been
overly flattering so I appreciate that
and if you want to get flat Santa
followed you should because he's nice to
me like this channel down below if you
want to be a feature into commented a
pretty obvious you comment down below
