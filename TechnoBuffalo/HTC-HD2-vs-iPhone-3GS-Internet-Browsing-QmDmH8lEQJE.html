technobuffalo and in this video we're
going to compare the internet browsing
experience of the HTC hd2 with that of
the iphone 3gs as a recap the hd2 is
running on windows mobile as the largest
touchscreen of any smartphone available
on the market right now at 4.3 inches
and it has a 1 gigahertz Qualcomm
Snapdragon processor which really makes
us wonder how much faster or even if it
is faster than the iphone 3gs and
rendering web pages and launching the
browser and doing other things like that
of course the iphone 3gs has Safari but
the hd2 has a modified version of opera
mobile version 9.7 to help work with the
capacitive touchscreen so let's take a
look let's start off by launching the
browsers and I'm going to tap opera
browser here and Safari on the iPhone
and see which one opens faster I think
it's no surprise that Safari launches in
less than a second in most cases and
it's about two or three seconds on the
hd2 so definitely in terms of opening
the browser for the first time the 3gs
wins now let's launch a website from a
thumbnail like the iphone 3gs on the hd2
you can place little thumbnails of
websites that you visit on a regular
basis so i have the TechnoBuffalo
thumbnail here and here let's see which
wins i'm assuming the 3gs is going to
win because it has that head start since
the browser loads so fast let it let's
do it on a count of three one two three
okay here they're here they are off okay
the iphones nope not done yep now it's
done and Wow about a half a second later
the hd2 finished very close even though
the 3gs had a head start let's turn them
into landscape see which one kind of
rotates into landscape faster ok so the
3gs one there and let's do it the other
way ok 3gs is a little bit faster now
what you get to notice immediately
how much more of the website you get to
see or at least how much bigger it is on
the hd2 because of this large
high-resolution touchscreen let's sort
of stack them so it's even easier to see
and we'll move around at the same time
and you can get a better sense of how
things look we're going to flick down
the flick scrolling on the hd2 is a
little bit faster which is not
necessarily a good thing because it's
technically less precise when it's
faster but you can see sort of how both
of these render pages differently the
the browser on the hd2 doesn't have
flash support just like the iphone 3gs
although you don't get nice links to the
YouTube videos as you do on the 3gs so
very nice browsing experience on the hd2
it really makes good use of screen real
estate on the 3gs you still have this
top bar here in the bottom bar but on
the hd2 you only have a little button in
the bottom right corner which will
launch all of the buttons associated
with the controls of the browser so
let's go to another website and do a
speed test now that they are open and
ready to go we're going to try
pocketnow.com so we give this nice big
on screen landscape keyboard and we're
going to do likewise here okay that's
ready to go so I'm going to click here
and here at the same time and we'll see
which one loads it faster ready set go
and they're off okay about even right
now okay the hd2 just finished the 3gs
about a second afterward it's quite
amazing that the hd2 can keep up with
the iphone 3gs so we can move around on
the page and can we get a nice massive
view thanks to all of the screen real
estate on the hd2 we can move around we
can pinch to zoom in on the hd2 just
like we can do on the iphone 3gs so we
can pinch like so and let's go to the
same story and pinch and we can flick
down double tap to zoom out move down
double tap to zoom in and then seems out
to show the whole website in its
entirety so very smooth on both devices
let's go to another website and
you which loads faster we're going to go
to webmd.com this time and over here ok
and ready set go and they're off ok 3gs
won by about two seconds there and we
can move around on the page everything
looks bigger on the hd2 when in reality
actually in terms of what is fitting on
the screen you can see that if we start
at the top and start at the top over
here although let's move it down just to
be fair we get down to cholesterol here
and down here we get a little beyond
cholesterol so actually the hd2 starts
zoomed in a little bit more the iphone
is really good at showing you an
overview of the page but the hd2 is
everything quite a bit bigger so it can
flick down of course we can double tap
on the side to zoom in I'd say the zoom
capability of the iphone 3gs a little
bit more smooth so we can move around
double tap again double tap and this is
a little bit more choppy as you can see
but it's quite smooth especially for a
windows mobile device and the
multi-touch works quite well ok let's
talk about multiple tabbed browsing so
that you can have more than website open
flip between them and see how kind of
smooth it is on both of these devices so
on this device I am going to launch a
new tab and I'm going to go to say
gizmodo I'm going to have that load and
I'm going to go over here we already
have a tab open here I'm going to close
that and I'm going to click on new page
and do the same thing over here and of
course we get the mobile version of
gizmodo and there it comes and so to
access the tabs and the iphone 3gs
obviously you tap in the bottom right
corner and you go like that you can go
very fast between them up to about eight
or so pages you can load on the hd2
let's see how how easy it is to get to
other pages pretty fast it's not as
visual which is in my opinion not as
good but you still can bounce between
two websites or three websites or
however many can fit in this list
pretty quickly which is nice to be able
to do if you're trying to be productive
so overall we're quite impressed by the
internet experience on HTC hd2 in most
cases it can keep up with the iphone 3gs
in terms of speed and definitely getting
around on pages i think is a little bit
more enjoyable on hd2 because you have
such a larger screen to work with screen
rotation is best the multi-touch works
quite well the only weakness of the hd2
is that the browser takes about two or
three times longer to launch than it
does on the iphone 3gs will be back soon
with more comparisons of the HTC hd2
with the iphone 3gs that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
