crazy things Android on blackberry
Hardware Nokia making Android phones but
the shangri-la of hybrid technology has
always been Android running on Apple's
hardware and up until now that's been an
impossibility
but thanks to the genius of Nikola CTO
of 10 digi we have Android running on an
iPhone at least mostly so a few caveats
here this isn't Android installed on an
iPhone itself it needs to run from this
case and inside of this case is a
full-fledged computer this is a little
bit more than just using the iPhone
screen for Android - interact with
Android like you could on any Android
power phone be able to run benchmarks
you're able to browse the web to go to
the Play Store install third-party apps
it works just like any other Android
phone except that was on an iPhone which
is very strange and kind of awesome to
see this is obviously very much a proof
of concept prototype but are practical
applications and it told us this could
be turned into a product the case can be
thin down and get things working a
little more smoothly practical
applications though are pretty profound
you could have one phone capable of
running to complete operating systems if
you want to learn more about the
hardware or how Nick did this you've got
a full interview where he runs us
through the entire gamut of how he made
this happen
hit the link down below with the card up
above the kid one of the things circling
you to find out more so what you guys
think about this obviously it's an early
proof of concept and treat it as such
but if it ever got to be a product would
you buy it what would you use it for
love to your thoughts on it even the
comments down below until next time
I am John Ranger from TechnoBuffalo see
you guys the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
