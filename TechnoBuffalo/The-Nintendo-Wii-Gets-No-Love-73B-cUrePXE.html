TechnoBuffalo here ever since this
current generation of consoles launched
there's been a huge debate raging
between the xbox 360 and the ps3 and
that's extremely evident in our console
work series that we've been running with
fans of both camps really coming out in
full force in support of their
respective consoles but the one thing
that sort of surprisingly gone under the
radar amongst gamers is the wii the
current generations best-selling console
with a sort of pervy name is still hope
very prominent and has been really
successful and I reason I just want to
talk about is because I've actually been
playing the wii more than i have the
xbox 360 or the ps3 fortunate enough to
have all three consoles mostly for
comparison purposes but recently i've
been playing the wii and let me tell you
why I think the wii is certain being
very underestimated as a gaming console
before i get into that let me preface
this with clearly the wii does not have
the bevy of gaming titles that the xbox
360 or the ps3 have am I giving titles I
mean say more adult gaming titles so
you're not going to have your call of
duty modern warfare is it's not gonna
look as good not get the high-definition
graphics you know I can have the first
person shooting games that you're gonna
find on the other consoles there aren't
that many out there that's just the way
it goes but you know that when you go
into buying the week you're not gonna
get high def playback you're not getting
a DVD player or a blu-ray player any
real sort of on-demand content you're
getting just a game console now I've
been playing the wii a lot i've actually
been playing it with my fiance which is
why i think the we really has a
interesting market share she's been
never been interesting video games I
don't think his play the video game
since your original mario brothers back
in the 80s but i recently picked up the
new super mario brothers wii she saw me
playing it and immediately wanted to
play with me so we've been playing a
non-stop for for a few weeks and just
having an absolute blast we went through
beat the game together it was a lot of
fun and then we went to the virtual
console and downloaded super mario
brothers for the stupid
Tendo and Super Mario Brothers 3 for the
original nintendo and just in plano
granted these are all sort of similar
titles side-scrolling nostalgia nintendo
perhaps living in their heyday but
there's still while very very fun games
to play and then really fun games to
play with people especially who aren't
into video games like for example uh my
own fiancee she's thinking said never
you've shown any sort of passing
interest but she loves the we were going
on vacation for for a few days and she
asked a week even bring the wii with us
which is really weird to hear her want
to play video games but she's loving it
she wants to go out and get mario kart
and start playing now granted I think
that some of the best wii games are the
nintendo first party so your metroid
zelda mario brothers and things along
those lines but there are some other
third-party games out there that are
really enjoyable and i think that we
definitely has a place as a party
console what I want to get my series
game 1 i'm going to pick up the xbox the
ps3 i'm gonna play modern warfare but i
would want to sort of relax and have fun
you know i might play some wii tennis or
a wii bowling or now pick up the new
super mario brothers it's just a lot of
fun to play it's easy to pick up and
very fun to very fun to play um so I
want to ask you guys you know what do
you think about the we certainly I think
it sort of feels that secondary console
need if you've got an xbox or ps3 i
think the wii is a nice compliment if is
something that you can swing it's really
fun to apply it's a great party console
and your people over you know it's fun
to have everybody line up and sort of
Swing these things around this is the
thing though you know swing these things
around and just have fun it's a very
unique experience and i'm curious to how
it may be that experience gave you
replicated with playstation 3's motion
controller or a project natal for the
xbox 360 but for right now i'm really
enjoying the we going through the
virtual console and downloading some the
old games and i love super smash
brothers for the n64 is out there now
all the old mario brother games i loved
there's just so many great games and
Nintendo's head out and the fact that i
can sort of play them all again without
having to deal with emulators or i know
i can hook up
pc and play on a pc but i've got the wii
hooked up but nicely using for four or
five bucks per game I'm happy to pay for
it so I believe something I've been been
enjoying I want those sherds experience
with you guys and see what you guys
think about the we certainly I think
it's geared more towards kids but
there's a lot of adult games out there
to it for someone who grew up in the 80s
i was born in nineteen eighty so and i
played all those original nintendo games
as a kid it's sort of fun to relive
those days you know I was rocking some
Mike Tyson punch-out earlier in the day
I'm just having fun I think that's
really where the we slipped in okay um
sie hey guys hope II hope you enjoyed I
wanted to know what you guys think about
the we in general leave a text or video
response and I will see you in the next
video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
