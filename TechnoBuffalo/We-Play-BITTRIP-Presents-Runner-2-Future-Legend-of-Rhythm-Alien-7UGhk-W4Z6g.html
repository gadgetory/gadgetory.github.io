for bit.trip presents runner to future
legend of rhythm alien okay so why did I
leave that Charles Martin a intro in
place I can almost guarantee that you've
heard Martinez boys several times over
this man in your life but you might not
know who he actually is Martin a is the
voice of mario luigi waluigi baby mario
baby luigi and even paarthurnax Tragon
from skyrim he's a gaming icon and
legend whether or not you've ever
actually heard his name before he has
been representing Nintendo alone since
the dawn of voice work and aiming for
that company anyways i'm joey davidson
senior gaming editor at TechnoBuffalo
and i'm bringing you a look at the
recently released runner 2 from the
gaijin games or as it's known entirely
bit.trip presents run or two future
legend of rhythm alien before we go
breaking this game down further I'm just
going to step away and let you listen to
the music and pay attention to the
visuals
run or two in case you haven't already
figured this out is an infinite running
game just like its predecessor players
are charged with pushing buttons in
order to jump over duck under smash and
block the obstacles that get in a way
I'm actually playing this game on the PC
I can use a keyboard but the user
interface the menu that gaijin games
created for this one really recommends
using a gamepad or a controller so I am
music at controller and the difference
is remarkable it's a much better game
than play with a controller so maybe you
can use that to inform you and in
regards to which platform you pick this
thing on on but much like everything
else in the bit.trip series from gaijin
games run into is also based heavily on
the music that you hear in the
background so everything you do in the
game builds that song that you here
while you're playing and the result is
this really charming fun ambiance that
accompanies the controller hurling
frustration that comes from memorizing
patterns and reacting quickly so yeah
despite the overall sunny disposition
and exceptionally cheery music run or
two is a tough game you're going to
repeat levels over and over and over
just to make sure you've collected each
and every stack of gold unlocked all the
costumes and nab the extras it's an
insanely addictive formula that works
really well and one of the compliments
that I have to pay gaijin games is that
they made things happen quickly so yeah
you're gonna play levels that are really
frustrating but when you die or when you
hit something you'll either revert back
to a checkpoint or get sent back to the
beginning or the level and it happens
really fast you're not going to wait for
a loading spring every time you run into
a brick wall that would be exceptionally
frustrating and make this thing no fun
so I'm sure you've noticed I've hit a
few of obstacles already this was the
first play that I have with this game
but just like that you're sent back to
the starting block if I had hit a
checkpoint in the middle of the level
and I think checkpoints are new to this
game at least memory serves they weren't
in the original you're sent back to the
beginning the level quickly so there's
no real frustration that comes from oh I
just died I gotta sit through a loading
screen I hate that in games and at least
run or two skips that kind of
incorporates losing into the overall
scheme of eventually winning it's part
of the reason why this formula is so
addictive
you
as a recording this video runner 2 is
available for the PC Mac Linux wii u and
xbox 360 platforms it found for the
PlayStation 3 and PS Vita soon but those
others are released right this very
moment that might change by the time
this video is posted but as a Wednesday
it is the 27th wre one on recording us
those are the platforms that it's
available for it's a fifteen dollar game
i believe on scheme if you pay twenty
bucks you can get the soundtrack as well
so definitely worth it it's a cool cool
little pick up and these support indie
gaming and gaijin games has been doing
this for a while and it's the runner
game is really are probably the third
fret and butter in a bit trip series
anyway it's really a fantastic gorgeous
game and i highly recommend attending
room with some free time and some extra
bucks thank you guys for watching and
