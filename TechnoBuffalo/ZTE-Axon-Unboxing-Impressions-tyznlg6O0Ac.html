TechnoBuffalo here with the best phone
you might have never heard of this is
the axon by ZTE as et is now trying to
cellphone joking to consumers in the US
have been selling all over the world for
quite a while and this is the latest to
come from them this thing is an absolute
beast
and what would consensually be a bargain
price of just 450 bucks they're
positioning this really similar to the
one plus two as that flagship killer for
an odd premium price let's go ahead and
open this top up I liked a little portal
to see the dual cameras they're
available in three colors either blue
gold or silver lychee guesses to sit -
what color we've got here go ahead and
pull this out first thing you'll know
when you pick up the phone cold metal
feels really nice the phone feels very
premium I will reluctantly push it off
to the side for a real quick second else
you're going to have in the box when you
pick up your axon we're going to have
booklets yay which I'm not gonna read
you're not gonna read nobody's gonna
read they're not messing around with the
headphones here JBL headphones with
inline mic and full control really nice
headphones probably the nicest ones I've
seen packed inside of a device you've
got a not exciting microUSB cable and
then we've got just a single USB port
wall work and that's it but that is not
the reason anybody's here here is why
we're all gathered here today this is
the axon go ahead and pull us off a
moderately satisfying whooshing noise
keeping this guy a humming is a
Snapdragon 810 so octa-core there 3000
million power battery is gonna hopefully
ensure it's not gonna run out of juice
it does have quick charge 2.0 and ZTE
says be able to get 12 hours of talktime
we're tuned into 40 hours of standby
time so you can just just chat up all
your friends and tell them that your
eyebrows are on fleek or other things
that might be on top of a fleek
I also is going to have HiFi audio
chipset so suppose you'll get really
high quality audio which you could wait
here from those giant speaker grilles on
the front of the phone 4 gigs of ram
here the second time I've said that
on this band a week the first one being
with the oneplus 2 just how do I do it
four gigs of ram that seems like two
gigs too many butts
and there's just a lot of gigs now the
screen is 5.5 inches and it's a
resolution of 2560 by 1440 so it has two
K's
it's obviously running a customised
version of Android but it is based on
5.1.1 it doesn't look to be a very heavy
skin but certainly it is its own skin
version camera situation is a bit unique
you can tell by by looking at it I've
got two lenses here the main one the 13
megapixel sensor the second one is a 2
megapixel sensor the main one has the 6
element lens that can shoot 4k at 30
frames per second or 720p at 120 frames
per second you do some cool stuff the
cameras which we'll talk about in the
review and I'll show you quickly want to
go over the software I got the only
camera here we've got a front-facing
camera that is 8 megapixel you're
wondering to yourself routing self this
one looks nice a good bargain can I use
it on my carrier well to you friend I
say if you were in North America and
you're on AT&amp;amp;T t-mobile metro pcs
cricket Rogers Belt tell us for our
Canadian friends then yes this will work
for with you and for you no problem at
all
so I actually took the device out of the
box I thought it was gonna have sort of
the Android buttons are gonna light up
there but you've got that one home
button and flicking it to left or right
or to just little dots let you know
where your back button is and we're your
multitasking button it's going to live
swipe all that stuff off you can see
some of the things that they've done
here clear all and task man that circle
is just your capacitive home button now
the only thing is your fingerprint
sensor on here at all but it does have
NFC oh it's something that I guess has
been lacking in some of its competition
take a quick look at the software do a
little pull down here wipe that down I
can see where someone squeaking is you
can see you've got many more options
here for your shortcuts go ahead and see
the software version which I believe
should be 5.1.1 jump into settings let's
go down to the bottom about phone and it
is based on 5.1.1 on the right-hand side
of the phone you've got your power
button and I love having this you've got
an actual camera button which makes
taking photos much much easier on the
right hand side you've got your volume
up and down and that is where your SIM
tray is going to live you're not going
to have any expandable storage on here
yes unfortunately on the bottom you're
going to have your micro USB port 3 port
your headset jack was on top as well as
being flanked by two noise cancelling
microphones let me show you something
cool in the camera let's go ahead and
jump right in turn it to the side to go
ahead and click on modes you can see
some different things different things
here one of the ones I haven't really
seen in many other phones but it's all
software based but so kind of cool is
multi exposure let's go ahead and take a
picture here so let's say I want to take
a picture of glowing blue cube I'll go
ahead and snap a picture but I won't be
blue by the time I snap it and I move
around you can see there's still sort of
a haze of that first picture I can
adjust how bright or not bright that's
gonna show up to get my second exposure
and say the next one I want to take a
picture of that little Ruby cube thing
go ahead and take that it'll Stitch the
two together I can adjust the ratio on
if I like it go ahead and hit select and
now I've got a picture that has multiple
exposures which is kind of cool you
could play around a bit and do some some
neat things there I don't know if that
necessarily needs two lenses but it's
gotta here know like 3d stuff but
usually you see with a dual lens setup
but obviously you can adjust focus in
the back if you want to as well and then
we're looking forward to extracting this
phone out it's a flagship phone it's got
flagship specs it feels premium it looks
nice if I told you this phone is built
by HTC by looking at it you'd say yeah
of course it is but not ZTE but it has
that HTC type build quality and it was
designed in the US so it's got that
going for it as well and you guys want
to seem particular be sure to let me
know until next time Jean rendering
