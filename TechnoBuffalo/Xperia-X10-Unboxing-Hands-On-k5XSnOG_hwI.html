TechnoBuffalo heareth and unboxing for
you that I'm very excited about this is
the Sony Ericsson Xperia x10 this is
Sony's take on Android operating system
we put a new skin on it Timescape
immediate game which opposed they add a
lot of additional functionality so
without further ado let's get started so
the folks at Negri electronics hooked us
up with a white review model of the
Xperia x10 a link down below in case you
want to check out Negri some of you guys
might not be familiar with the x10 as it
hasn't been what carrier release in the
US this does support 18 keys 3G bands
it's running on top of Android 1.6 and
I'll go out there over the rest of the
specs as I get to be the unboxing let's
go ahead and dig in so we got a picture
of the device on the front on the side I
guess there's some IMEI information
nothing on other side up it on the back
and on the top looks like this phone
came from Rogers this was probably a
purchase unlock by the folks at Rogers
and it's gonna set you back about five
hundred dollars so go ahead and break
the seals here or at least attempt to
that's slicing a finger which is always
a difficulty with this ridiculous knife
let me push that off to the side let's
go ahead and dig in and I got a chance
to take a look this for the first time
at CES and now that's finally been
released I'm actually very excited about
it sony has said this will be upgraded
to the most recent version of Android
2.2 although timeframe for that has yet
to be seen
the phone feels very slim and it
probably feels so light because I'm
guessing there's not a battery in it
let's go ahead and see what else you're
gonna get in the box go ahead and pull
the top off looks to be a pretty
standard unboxing experience so we've
got a battery which is of size if we can
find it on here looks to be a 1500
milliamp hour battery so that should
power quite nicely gots for probably
your usual array of accessories stereo
headphones a recycle bag charging and
see if Sony uses a proprietary port as
they are known to do nope this is using
a micro USB for charging so that's quite
nice and the plug to go into the wall
outlet
that's a miscellaneous sort of material
on the x10
but enough of that push it off to the
side and take a look at the phone itself
because there is actually a lot to look
at here so here is the xperia x
and let's talk a bit about the specs
that go into this and serve as we go
through I will power it on and see what
sort of things look like so it does have
us 3G bands a dimension wise it's 119 by
63 by 13 millimeters of course is a
candy bar that 1500 milliamp hour
battery
didn't get you about eight hours of talk
time or about 415 hours of standby time
this glai is sort of the TFT capacitive
touchscreen it can show 65,000 colors
has a pretty nice resolution of 480 by
654 and then is a 4-inch screen in case
you're wondering it's powered by a 1
gigahertz Snapdragon processor so this
thing should be pretty fast and powerful
although from what I understand it does
not support multi-touch yet so we'll see
if that's actually the case this is
running like I mentioned the skinned
version of Android 1.6 so let's go ahead
and dig on in and see what else we have
they went into the phone right then see
if we can get off the back and pop in
this battery and do a sort of a first
boot up and see what it looks like
alright so we got the back of this phone
pulled off and I should mention that
this does have an 8.1 megapixel camera
on the back with LED flash it has a
touch focused image stabilization
geo-tagging face and smile detection I'm
just kind of neat and it does shoot of
course video at WVGA at 30 frames per
second so here is the micro SD card
which is going to come installed and it
is a 16 gigabyte card which is quite
nice sort of have in there let's go
ahead and pop in the battery turn this
thing on and see Mediascape and
Timescape interface looks likes go ahead
hit the power and while I'm powering
this thing on I'll continue serve a tour
of the device so we've got your power
and lock button on the top 3.5 milimeter
headset jack micro USB charging port on
the side on the left don't really have
much on the right you've got a volume
toggle push the back all the way in
place got a volume toggle it looks like
a hard button for the camera on the back
you've got on the bottom about there
speaker and microphone and the back
you've got your 8.1 megapixel sensor and
LED flash and this is the white model
does also come in black
preferred to the to the white model
cliff telling me to connect this to a
charger it's about less than 5% battery
something to go ahead and do that and we
will come right back alright so we're
going to take a look at this phone for
the first time I just plugged it in so
it's not going to die on us here is the
new unlocking for the time skip a
Mediascape you sort of swipe it up now
I'll go through sort of the usual array
of setup will go for English United
States welcome so I'm going to go ahead
and go through usual setup stuff and
I'll come back in a minute and share
with the operating system looks like
okay so we are all set up so let's go
ahead and take a look and see what this
operating system looks like it's very
much Android but you almost can't tell
so you've got your sir your pull down
notification window that's pretty stock
Android buttons across the bottom you've
got a menu button home button and the
back when you don't have sort of a for
Android array you've got a couple home
screens you can navigate through it
looks like we have one two and three
home screens and a couple of things here
for a time to keep a media scape which
is sort of what Sony's calling their new
skins let's go ahead and jump into time
skate and see what this looks like so
this is tile set up to Ted up Simon time
scape I'll go ahead and skip set up
services this is the way they can sort
of go through and view all of your email
notifications and things like that and
you get sort of a tray at the bottom you
can scroll through you can go to
Facebook sort of go through and check
out all of your missed calls check out
your messages there's Facebook this sort
of everything will show up but you can
flick through it and scroll serve as you
like it sir amalgamates
and combines all of your accounts and
Mediascape is something very similar for
the media side of it for pictures it's
up sort of puts them all into one one
screen for you and that is sort of a
very quick overview here of the new time
skipping media scape and the Sony
Ericsson Xperia x10 let's do one last
check and see what sort of extra widgets
are included in here and it looks like
it is very much stock Android the bit
extra so you get web thumbnails quick
settings and time scape and that is
about it
so 4-inch phone us 3G for AT&amp;amp;T bands a
lot to like about this in a very thin
package before I go let's see we're just
a real quick size comparison and see how
this thing stacked up to the competition
I will go ahead and unplug this 4 inch
by Hema so here it is next to the iPhone
4 you can see that the size difference
isn't that much to go ahead and stack on
top of each other a bit different and
from a thinness standpoint the x10 is
very thin if you bring in a bit of a
larger phone here is the Evo 4G cu the
4.3 inch screen compared to the 4 oh you
definitely notice that third of an inch
side to side you can see how thin the
x10 is and lastly here is the x10 with
the Droid X you can see that the Droid X
is definitely the big daddy of them all
and there's clearly a thickness
difference here so hope you guys enjoyed
thank you to the folks at Negri
electronics or hooking us up with this
review unit some more coverage on the
x10 will be coming up including a look
at its little brother
anyway I'm John Rhett enger' from
TechnoBuffalo and I will see you in the
next video
buh-bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
