better is the squash man internet
celebrity chef pancake wall ninja I've
used a knife on my whole life another
may have set some of you guys so I'm
gonna give Android shock for a week
let's see how it goes so you probably
have a team you for and that's because I
typically work behind the scenes here at
TechnoBuffalo directing editing and
shooting content for the channel so why
would I switch is an iPhone user to
Android well the story goes back quite
some time alone the guys in office one
me switch for a while and that's because
every time I've had the shoot funeral
with an Android phone I have no idea
what the hell I'm doing no idea how to
get around the interface use any of the
features I don't even know what any of
the pictures were they eventually got
fed up they took my iPhone they locked
it out John gave me a Nexus 6p
made me use it for a week how'd it go
let's just say I'm kicking back now I
got my Angel City IPA just poured it
inside of my medieval times a mug
classic drinking companion let's go
ahead and talk about what happened so
with computers I'm a lot more flexible
from my own personal work I use a
Windows PC when I'm on the go I use a
MacBook Air at work I'm generally
editing on iMac so I've operated in both
Windows and Mac ecosystems for those
well the phones I've only used iOS I've
never really tried out Android so
switching to a new mobile OS was very
difficult but then again it opened my
eyes to a lot of new things
the first big adjustment was the fact
that there was no physical home button
not having the ability just to pick up
my phone and know immediately where the
home button was is very weird it threw
me off after a little bit I got used to
it and I will say that actually kind of
liked the way that the multitasking
button was its own dedicated feature
there so the first few days we're
definitely the hardest and that's
because I've had my iPhone configure the
same way or at least I've managed
configure it the way it is now over the
course of six or seven years so all of
my passwords all my apps that I
typically use all of them have all the
presets that have been saved in there on
iOS since the beginning of time and
going to Android I had to download
everything again I had to enter all my
passwords in which by the way didn't
know any of end of being this huge
undertaking that really pissed me off
and I think that was the biggest
takeaway that came
from switching to androids that having
my iPhone maybe really stuck in my ways
in one day alone I've nearly lost my
mind trying to get this to work I was
over at Starbucks and I was trying to
open up my account information I
couldn't do that and I ended up holding
up the line for about 15 minutes I'd
ended up going to a football game with
my buddies and of course we had to get
our drink on a lot of refreshments and I
was trying to venmo them and I couldn't
do that because I could remember that
password it is just that going on and on
and on I had no idea how to get access
to my typical apps so that was a huge
frustration I also missed the
convenience of touch ID for some of my
usual apps like Bank and this is the
stuff that really made the transition to
a new OS especially frustrating not
being able to use the functionality of
my phone the same way that I'm
accustomed to on an iPhone my halfway
through the week I started to feel more
comfortable things were getting easier
and as I was using apps I found that
really the app experience is really not
that much different than what I have on
iOS pulling up Yelp for restaurant
reviews essentially the same all my
social media apps work more or less the
same snapchat still sucks on Android
probably one of my favorite features was
all the customization options that are
available to you on Android and that's
something that I've really liked that
you can set default apps I wanted that
on iOS for a very long time I tried to
do it more or less by using I use
outlook from my email and so I've set my
default browser to Chrome for that but
you're very limited and what you can do
whereas Android gave you flexibility to
set anything and everything specific to
your needs which is something new to me
as an iPhone user I play with them a
little but I found that they ended up
making my homescreen feel a little too
cluttered but I like the fact that
customization is there that you have
those options as opposed to the standard
grid layout of iOS it kind of reminds me
of how it is on a PC where you can
arrange your desktop icons in a way that
makes sense to you and it's convenient
so probably my most frequently used
favorite feature on Android was Google
now and I guess I went through my Gmail
and parse all this information it found
out when I had packages arriving at the
office
told me where I parked my car gave me
news recommendations specific the
certain topics and I'm interested in
like tech and naming and these are all
features that I guess I have on iOS I
mean I have Apple news I also use
automatic with my iPhone so that tells
me where I park my car but I like the
fact that just swiping left it was all
available in a convenient easy to read
newsfeed
that seem way more accessible and made a
lot more sense to me that does on App
where I'm having to jump between apps so
it just seemed to work better and also
that was pretty cool they gave me
recommendations for relevant news so
when the Olympics was happening after
opting Anna gave me updates on all the
medal counts for different countries
events and so on so that was really neat
I like that
I did miss iMessage and actually had
friends over getting mad at me because
my text messages were being received as
green instead of blue and I never really
used FaceTime during the week that I was
switching to Android but I've been
hearing like good things about duo as a
potential fix for that so if I were
using Android for a longer period of
time I put I try that out well in all
I'd say like despite the difficulty
adjusting it was really cool to see what
Android had to offer and it wasn't an
easy week by any means I had a really
hard time getting up to speed and it was
extremely frustrating there are many
times where I thought was gonna phone
out my car window but it's cool to see
what features I've wanted on iOS on
another mobile operating system and I
think that's probably the best thing
that come out of this experience is that
it opened my eyes to what the other side
is like in a lot of ways it's it's
better than iOS I think both ecosystems
have their strengths and weaknesses but
like the customization options that you
got with Android and those seem to be
very powerful and that's what's got me
intrigued so it's really not out of the
realm of possibly that I might be
revisiting Android for an extended
period of time to actually try out those
features see what it's like to use the
phone and long-term situation and who
knows maybe I'll end up switching
permanently any other iOS to Android
converts out there what was your
experience like leave a comment down

my first video I hope you guys liked it
give it thumbs up and I'll see you next
