technobuffalo here the blackberry z10 is
starting to hit US carriers and we've
got it all dolled up in Verizon's 4G LTE
colors let's go ahead dig in take a look
and see what your verizon z10 is going
to have when you pick it up in stores
now alright so the Box relatively
nondescript verizon at the top
blackberry logo down below little z10
emboss action what's in the box but of
course we'll run through all that and
that's about it we will ceremoniously
take off the sleeve boom nothing really
different about the verizon version
versus the unlocked or the gsm side but
i'll remind you what all the specs are
here in just a moment take the phone out
our version is all done up in white x
haven't seen the white version yet so
that's kind of cool um so there is the
phone i'll start the power up process
and say can be a bit long at the z10 and
of course we'll walk through all the
software stuff in just a moment it's got
enough juice to power on there it goes
so what are you get in the box you are
going to get a 4g LTE sim card you're
gonna get some start here information
and get this guy letting you know it's
using a Snapdragon processor got a wall
warts and a cable and that is it no
headphones to be found in that box at
all push all that stuff off the side
here is what you are here to see the
blackberry z10 so it's going to be
available for 199 bucks but of course
that price is always subject to change
so check with verizon before you pick it
up from into making standpoint in case
you forgot it's identical to the gsm
side 5.1 to buy 2.58 by a pretty thin
point 35 and it weighs four point nine
three ounces it's got a four point two
inch display which is not bad it's not
giant but it's a 720p display eighteen
hundred million of our battery 1.5
gigahertz dual-core snapdragon chip two
gigs of ram 16 gigs of storage plus
microSD eight megapixel camera on the
back plus 1080p video 2 megapixel
shooter on the front that can also shoot
720p we've got verizon's LTE service
here bluetooth for
poi note and NFC that was a mouthful all
right so here is the white version
directionally enough the white well not
being a the same backing as of course a
black one also feels different so the
black one has a bit of a soft touch
almost fake rubber feel to it the white
one has more of a plastic feel to it
they're both textured though so keep
that in mind as you pick which color you
want personally like the way the white
looks but I can weigh the black feel so
you're gonna have to decide they're
rather than that they look almost
identical so push that off to the side
let's go ahead and take a look at the
settings and see what software version
this guy is running will jump on into
settings one more time jump on in
settings and let's check out the OS the
hardware and the rest that information
so you can see what software released is
running it's running 10 point 0 point
9.42 to go ahead and go back that's your
real quick size comparison here we will
bring in the 4.7 inch HTC One again it's
a four point two inch screen here on the
z10 it look like big brother little
brother certainly those design a very
reminiscent of each other you can see
what they look like from a thickness
standpoint let's also bring in an iphone
5 so a 4-inch screen on the iphone
versus the 4.2 on the z10 see what those
guys look like and certainly the iphone
5 was definitely one of the thinner
smartphones and its day but not really a
title can hold on to any more the z10
definitely feels really good as
extremely thin device so go ahead and go
back up let's see what Verizon Pacific
apps are including here and what apps
are on so we've got facebook twitter
linkedin and Foursquare pretty much all
the majors except for Instagram on here
so you got my verizon mobile mobile
backup plus for all your contact backing
up smart tags included games and that
really looks it for a verizon branding
which is quite nice this is a global
ready phone so it'll work on GSM
networks wherever you might be other
than that though it's pretty standard
z10 we've got a charging and micro HDMI
on the side on the top in the middle got
your power and locked about 3.5
millimeter headset jack and you've got a
noise cancelling mic volume up or down
and a mute or stop button depending on
what you want to do of course the back
is
still removable so go ahead and pull
this out boom and this is where the
battery is going to live it's the ls1
and it's checks we can check the
milliamp hours on without pulling it out
all right we'll do a battery pull here
until you guys what milliamp hours we're
looking at it is an 1800 milliamp hour
ferrets where your micro sim cards are
going to live and if you want to do
expandable storage get pop that sucker
in right there so of course we will test
this guy and let you know how it
performs anything different we need to
note over a previous review that we did
at the z10 I will go ahead and augment
that review the link is going to be down
below then there is the NFC antenna so
what do you guys think you excited about
the z10 on verizon is the phone you've
been waiting for all the blackberry
faithful we love to hear from you white
or black we also want to hear which
color choice is best going to suit you
give this video a thumbs up we
definitely appreciate it now I'm John
Ranger from TechnoBuffalo and I'll see
you guys in the next video bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
