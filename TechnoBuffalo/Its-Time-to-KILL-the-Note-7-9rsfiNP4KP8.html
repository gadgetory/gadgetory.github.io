rants new to the channel if second I
used to do where I just yelled something
going on and I think this phone merits
rants coming back at least for one
episode Galaxy Note 7 hands down my
favorite phone of the year I loved it so
much I went out and bought one for
myself I love the screen I'll doing the
phone felt I love the pen everything
about it was awesome that is until the
phone started blowing up they did a
recall and I respected him for it
other manufacturers had phones and
battery that exploded happens due to the
lithium-ion chemistry in the battery but
not many of Asheville recalls so I
commended Samsung and now reports of
five replacement units are blowing up
which means Samsung really had no idea
how it to solve the problem or there was
more than one problem in the first place
that hasn't been addressed and to make
matters worse it appears that Samsung
was trying to cover things up according
to the verge Galaxy Note owner Michael
clearing had one of the replacement
units that blew up he said it was just
sitting on his nightstand and not even
plugged in he woke up in the morning and
they were smoking his room and it be
treated for an acute form of bronchitis
a few days later he'd been communicating
the Samsung who asked them if they could
take the phone he's declined then he got
a tech message from Samsung presumably
not meant for him which read just now
God says I can try to slow him down if
we think it'll matter or we just let him
do what he keeps trying to do and see if
he does it which presumably meant go to
the press which he did end up doing it's
time for Samsung to cut their losses
with the Galaxy Note 7 and that is not
something that I say lightly as I'm the
company should take lightly there's
probably one to two and a half billion
dollar loss Samsung is going to have to
take but the reputation of the note line
even the company itself is really at
risk here I'm not trying to be an
alarmist here and screaming your phone's
gonna blow up but there is a greater
chance the note 7 and any other device
that you are going to have some sort of
smoking or fires in your device if it
happens maybe when you're not home and
you have your phone left under badi to
bring it with you or during the night
time there's potential for catastrophic
damage the phone started smoking on a
Southwest flight if you've flown
recently there are warnings everywhere
to not bring a Galaxy Note 7 on an
airplane
that is a risk that Samsom cannot afford
to have they made an incredible device
with one two three four or five more
fatal flaws time to move on from that
focus all of your R&amp;amp;D I'm making sure
that Galaxy s8 is incredible make sure
it is solvent most important to make
sure that damn thing's not gonna blow up
I don't the note line can ever rebound
from this maybe we'll see a brand new
line of Samsung phones come out but I
think the note line is forever damaged
from these fires and from these smokings
that are happening it's been tough to
see rust on the phone that I really
liked so much and that aside from the
blowing up was a really solid piece of
hardware so the moral being if you
haven't returned your Galaxy Note 7 like
this one do it I'm gonna do make it back
to the store get something new get your
money back
I mean thankfully you're not one of the
very small groups who's had a phone
exploded again not trying to be alarmist
I recognizes a very small change that
phone's gonna blow up but a better
chance the note 7 than any other device
doesn't seem worth it to me what do you
guys think are you gonna take your note
7 back it's gonna turn you from trying
to find 118 ta stop selling I'm just
moving about to have you watch this the
other three US carriers will stop
selling the device as well it's gonna be
harder and harder to find the carrier
that wants a risk of carrying the phones
maybe you guys should need</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
