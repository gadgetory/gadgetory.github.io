technobuffalo at CES 2013 and i just
went to the ATT developer summit and i'm
here to tell you guys exactly what they
talked about so the two things that
stood out to me the most for their new
security system that they talked about
partnering with Cisco as well as they're
connected car and their digital life
digital life is basically they're going
to be connecting everything together
your devices your house your car your
tablet's your phones everything that you
could possibly have even your computers
are going to be connected with you now
you can call from your computers you can
text from your computer's everything
like that they're gonna have it all into
one pretty much device called digital
life so digital life is basically if you
guys have ever seen the movie smart
house it turns your house into that
pretty much it has a whole security
system built in and you can control it
from all your devices even if you're not
at home and as well as the digital life
is also this new connected car that they
were talking about kind of implementing
in with it they're gonna have everything
that you can control from your car it's
kind of like Siri for the iphone users
but it's for your car basically so they
can have everything controlled by it you
can turn your house lights off if you're
driving away you can unlock your house
you can check on your house you can
check the security system they also have
a new thing we're in the back of the
seats if you have kids if they have
anything that they're also going to have
TVs that are built into the cars that
you can use with their new system and it
showed a concept video of this new
connected car not going to say it looks
amazing if they can actually implement
this into the new car designs I
guarantee it's gonna kick off like I
definitely want to get it if I could
have the money to afford that kind of
stuff so they're really pushing this
whole connected thing you guys haven't
heard me say that enough already they're
really trying to get you to be able to
use all your devices to control your
life and make your life easier so hope
you guys are excited for all the new
things that eighteen t is going to be
coming out within the next few years I
