TechnoBuffalo I realized I said that
kind of fast so you can slow down the
video if you didn't quite understand me
we're here with the folks in next bit
they're all behind the camera and we're
a little camera shy but that's okay
because they gave me a few of these to
play with you guys have seen a little
bit of our coverage on next bit and the
Robin and you've seen an interview with
some of the folks from the team but we
have yet to have some serious hands-on
time with these and in the last 10 15 20
minutes I've kind of fallen in love with
this hardware it feels really soft and
it feels surprisingly snappy yes it's
only an 808 in there but for the price
point
gosh dang you might have remembered they
were initially going to ship with
lollipop but they did actually make it
all the way to 6.0 so they're shipping
with marshmallow
on board they spent the last few months
tinkering making sure that the camera
works just the way it should
downloading works just the way it should
etcetera etc and I'm really excited to
get a review unit in ASAP so I can put
this thing through its paces so they're
definitely going to be shipping in
February that is for sure we know that
much are gonna be shipping on February
16th but if you can order before January
15th you're going to get an early
shipping date you're going to get your
your next bit Robin much much sooner
maybe even hand-delivered who knows plus
if you're a Kickstarter backer I can
tell you firsthand that the Kickstarter
exclusive color electric looks baller
you guys have heard a lot about next bit
on the site and there are a lot of
really cool things that they've done to
Android to make sure that you never run
out of space so if you want to see more
information about that you can check out
all the other bits and bobs that we've
written up and you can most importantly
check out the interview two of the
founders of next bit Mike and Tom did an
interview with us here at TechnoBuffalo
and you should absolutely check that out
because it's a little long but there's
an enormous enormous amount of
information they're very excited to get
this in at the office get a lot more
time in with it you guys have any
questions please let us know in the
comments you guys are a backer please
let us know in the comments and let me
know what you want to see in the review
since we're going to be doing that very
very soon thank you guys so much for
