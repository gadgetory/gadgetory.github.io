TechnoBuffalo here the full review for
you of the thinnest lightest iPad ever
to come from Apple it is of course the
iPad air go ahead put it through its
paces figure out if it's worth an
upgrade or worth the purchase looking to
jump into the Apple acres
the way I do all of my reviews but they
disclaimer I use this as my only tablet
for five days and put it through all its
paces it did everything that I would do
with any of my other tablets which used
to be an iPad Mini and a Microsoft
service try to do everything with this
iPad air so let's go ahead and jump
right into the review this can pretty
much read like every other iPad review
since the first one it's lighter and
it's faster really a testament to Apple
but to me no current gen iPad ever felt
slow when I used the iPad one when that
was what was new and out he'd never felt
slow to me then I jump to that bad -
that never felt slow to me in the same
thing all the way up now through the
iPad air yeah iPad air though it takes
thinner and lighter to a brick in a
whole new level there's a 24% reduction
overall volume the fact that was Apple
was able to reduce the volume of the
iPad for just what I'm calling it it
wasn't really what it was called by
almost a quarter is absolutely
astounding engineering team really did
an incredible job with this the fact
that it weighs a pound is awesome I mean
it feels really light obviously I can't
show you how light it feels but I mean
doing this slices to say it feels really
really really light but beneath that
light body is an incredibly powerful
processor it's powered by the a7 m7
combo in the iPhone 5s the only downside
reviewing a device like this right now
is not much they could've managed the
new hardware yet aside from a few
dedicated Apple apps and selected games
well I didn't have a lot of fun with
GarageBand the power of the iPad air
that was really a bet on the future yeah
future developers are gonna take
advantage of 64-bit processing you're
gonna use you know the iPad hardware to
its full advantage that really is yet to
be seen and that's yet to be written you
know for another six months I could go
through new benchmarks really doesn't
mean anything what matters to me is a
usage how do I pad performance when I
want to play games what I want to do
some work on what I want to watch video
got an improved camera as well but
please don't use a camera for anything
else other than FaceTime I feel honest
example with the camera looks like
though we have them the full written
review be sure to hit the link right
down below you go impressive when it
comes to the lightness of the
and the overall feel is the battery
battery hasn't changed at all on this
which is really really surprising it's a
battery life hasn't changed at all it
still lasts as long as my last
generation iPad for today I'm easily
able to get through a full day obviously
I got through five days really using
this very heavily it's only charging at
one time another thing that's change
with the iPad air the dual speakers on
the bottom and they sound pretty sweet
it's nice to finally have stereo
speakers on an iPad it's kind of strange
to me that they're both on the bottom so
if you're holding the tablet we've got
your hands blocking and you've got it on
a table you're not going to be able to
sort of hear that music come out but if
you hold it to the side and they're
shooting right out one side it's going
to sound absolutely wonderful even more
fun though is taking the older
generation Smart Covers put it on top of
the iPad air and really appreciate how
thin on how small this guy so it's
really like Apple took one hold bezel
off the side of an iPad for a truly how
wide at the iPad air is as much as
things have changed with the iPad air a
lot of remained the same here you saw
that same nine point seven inch Retina
display with the 248 by 1536 which is a
PPI 264 not to say that hasn't changed
is it cuz it's bad the screen still
looks really good and still is one of
the better screens on tablets on the
market just looks really nice in fact it
makes me more excited to see what that
crazy resolution can look like on a much
smaller iPad Mini screen but that's a
video for another day there are some
strange emissions though for the iPad
air no touch ID seems a bit strange no
802 11 ac for tablet that simple
position for the future not having this
seems very very odd to me but did
include MIMO technology so take that for
what it's worth
we've covered iOS 7 ad nauseum but it
was really apparent that it was designed
with the iPad air in mind it's fluid
everything works absolutely wonderfully
so all that awesomeness though does not
come cheap it is pretty expensive going
at 499 bucks
only up to 930 for the 128 gig plus LTS
you gotta decide where you stand on that
price point that's really a personal
decision if you have no problem spending
that money the iPad air is gonna be a
great bet if you want to be more budget
conscious there a lot of other awesome
tablets out there there's a new kindle
line there's the of course the Nexus 7
the soon-to-come Nexus 10 that are all
great tablets Asus has a ton of options
out there a lot of Tegra 4 tabs you can
pick up there's no shortage of options
in the tablet market the bottom line
here though is that this is the best
I pad ever made looking for a good time
to jump into the iPad market though do
so with both feet I promise you guys you
would not be disappointed it's however
you have an iPad 3 or newer there really
isn't much of enough reason to tell you
to upgrade sure it's thinner and lighter
and more powerful but ask yourself
before you consider buying one you feel
the iPad are using right now is
underpowered chances are if you honest
with yourself you'll probably think
whatever you got gonna be fast enough to
meet tonight pad 3 Oren you're wearing
this guy is kind of tricky so I have to
try to remind myself I'm scoring this
just on its own merits not what came
before that's a testament to really how
good the iPads have been before your
grittiness just on the iPad air and
existing in a total vacuum it's a really
solid 9 it's a great tablet - a
wonderful tablet experience it's still
more for consumption than it is for
creation but it works really well video
looks incredible X looks awesome on it
you can do anything that you can do with
an iPad the App Store really is a secret
sauce here it's thin it's light it's a
pleasure to use and I would love to have
this in my bag for the next year so
