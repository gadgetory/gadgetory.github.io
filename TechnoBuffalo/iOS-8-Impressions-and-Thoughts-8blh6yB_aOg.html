to you by harry's what's up everyone
John render from TechnoBuffalo here and
welcome back there episode of rettinger
riffs this week I want to riff on iOS 8
apple's event was just a few days ago I
was there I've sit in the second row is
watching all the apple stuff come out
and I got some thoughts on it let's go
ahead get started so first being at
Apple events are really being in any
event it's kind of a cool experience
they're just huge stage in the
showmanship and you're seeing all these
people that you read about and you're
the first ones here and see what all
this new stuff sounds pretty excited I
was hoping that maybe there's gonna be
some hardware out there but I know wdc
specially just for developers last year
being the exception when they showed the
brand new mac pro but that was more of
like a hey look we can do it's coming in
a few years so no new hardware but they
did announced iOS 8 of course they
announced in the next edition of OS 10
Yosemite which I'm not going to talk
about right now I want to chitchat about
Iowa State which I've been running on my
iphone 5s since it was announced so they
now it's just a crazy ton of new
features I was hoping for a total
refresh the OS I think to say every
freaking year but it was like we're
going to get looks like what Iowa 7 was
was a total refresh and when iOS 8 is
more of a fine tuning and adding some
things that maybe should have been in
there with iOS 7 and some sort of very
useful features so before everybody
start yelling in the comments they're
adding features an Android had before or
vice versa just know that operating
systems are going to improve over time
there could add new features and only a
certain set amount features that you can
have so there's absolutely down to the
overlap between the two so keep those
comments just a little bit at bay so
there are over a hundred new features
but these guys are my favorites actually
did a whole overview of iOS 8 if you
want to see it you can hit a link down
below and we'll take you over to that
video so the first one was what was
rumored for a while we thought was going
to call health get turned out it was
just called health and Apple I think
there's really nice job designing their
icons this one is just like a square of
the heart in it so what helps it's going
to do it's going to take all these third
party hardware health stuff like
fitbit's and fuel bands and other fancy
bands sort of put all the information
into one application it's like passbook
for else people to get more used the
fast boat but it's there the usefulness
so i think is still yet to be seen
family sharing though was pretty neat so
if you share credit card with up to six
people your family you can access all of
their stuff not like their personal bio
like their stuff to be bought on itunes
so their music their movies pretty
easily just downloaded over the cloud
and it's right on your phone which is
really handy if your parents or husband
wife can other whatever it might be you
can access all that content off to buy
it twice that was kind of a nice and
welcome feature shared calendaring in
there and all kinds of other stuff as
well the one that I think has the most
potential is home kit essentially it's
sort of the Internet of Things is
through the terminology but a spork
connected home I've kind of gotten on a
little bit of connected home kit my own
personal house I've got a nest
thermostat i just installed the kevo
lock i'm sort of in evaluating what I
could do for four lights and garage door
in all kinds of other sort of appliances
and what home kids going to do it's not
like an apple sir products like a
physical product of what they're going
to allow sort of other products similar
to help work with apple's home kits you
can control everything from one
application I think that has a huge
potential if companies jump on boards so
it would be like Apple certified and
it'll work and that one could be super
neat third-party widgets I have been
clamoring for this for a while I was
hoping they were gonna do a little bit
differently I mean bread on the friggin
home screen but no it is in the
notification tray release its third
party widgets so that is awesome you can
do Sports Illustrated or ESPN anything
you want now right there which makes me
very happy interactive notifications
this one honestly should have been there
from rigging day one this is the point
where I will say this is where Android
absolutely nailed it now you don't just
close the application and jump back into
message you just pull it down and reply
which totally should've been there from
day one I would say it's got a ton of
features you can tweak your video and
your photos you can change the color and
saturation but one feature it does not
have is ability to make this face not
like Harry unfortunately the appropriate
link what Harry's have you covered
you're going to ship razors and shaving
accoutrements it's my fantasy where the
day right to your nor the company is
kind of cool
they're less than one year old and they
are already just disrupting the entire
shaving industry down with big shaving I
say and they're offering a better
shaving experience and most importantly
a better value than the Giants out there
they make pretty awesome amazing
german-engineered blades and they cared
so much about the quality of the shave
if they just purchased the entire 93
year old German factor that makes them
they're like hey factories you are mine
now so if you want to get really high
quality razors go to Harry dos caras com
use promo code techno and save five
bucks of your first purchase fifteen
bucks again to get you a set that
includes three blades shave cream and
shipped right to your door they even
offer custom in grading options with
your initials on the razor or you can
just spell out a funny name like a SS
that needs to do in Eagles arcades you
got a high score anyway check them out
at Harry's com be sure to use code tech
now now more I OS features reviews
speaking of should have been there from
day one third-party keyboards Apple was
one of the first serve made on-screen
keyboards mainstream and done a nice job
with it but they have been passed like
80 times over by third-party keyboards
on Android things like Swift and sort of
other third-party off as you get typing
experience that you want now you can
have that swype is coming to iOS and a
lot of folks going to be very very happy
about that things like predictive test
text it's kind of hard to believe that
Apple hasn't had that before but it's
now finally there and it works just like
any other braid to text so they said
it'll learn casual conversation versus
do this conversation I haven't seen it
learn anything yet but they're there and
that is awesome and probably one of my
favorite features group messages for a
few reasons first you guys have probably
been on those long SMS threads a buzz
like every three minutes people kind of
make plans then back out of plans and
then feel bad at backing out a player to
try to make other plans your phone just
buzzes all the time so you can now do
not disturb that the red which is
awesome you take yourself out of that
thread which is even awesomer you can
see who's in it you can check out all of
the pictures of video that have been
sent you can now sort of do a snap
chatty feature you can just make your
picture video disappear which is really
nice you can send voice messages right
through the new text it's just
a more full-featured and as I sort of
see those options in there as well I
really happen to be able to unsubscribe
from somebody's mass text very very
annoying so they obviously got on more
iOS 8 stuff to talk about a lot of cool
features some of it I think is just
playing catch-up like Apple sometimes
tends to do but at least they're there i
know for the apple faithful those are
evaluating what's going to get there we
have in OS allegiance it's going to be a
nicer of selling point but as goes with
usually SOS announcements the hardware
that's out now it's not the hardware
that stuff really is made for with it in
mind and you look at the next generation
of hard work so the iphone 6 you know
whether it's 4.7 or 5.5 inch screen
whether it's got crazy health sensors
just to be seen but certainly having
integrated sensors make sense with the
health app but who the heck knows but
one our way down much longer to see I'm
betting we'll see an announcement
sometime and and if august early
September to those phones ship around
that same time frame so hopefully what
do you guys think about iOS 8 you
excited not excited as it what you
wanted we've always hoped for or you
look listen Apple too little too late
man I have no interest in using you or I
teach you and gone on to beautiful
greener pastures I would like to hear
your thoughts and also I get a lot of
questions on this shirt people ask me
where I got it from we actually have a
merchandise store and we advertise it
all that much but i'll put a link down
below all the profit that we make from
it goes to charity we don't keep a cent
of it we have the store through
spreadshirt they charge us a certain fee
we marked it up ten percent in at ten
percent one hundred percent goes to
charity I just didn't feel right taking
money keeping it so let members of the
staff pick their own charity donated to
and we get over 100 bucks so we've
donated to the American Cancer Society
we sponsored a kennel at a local animal
shelter here in Orange County for a year
so if you're interested this whole store
put the link down below you can get
stuff like this and other things
technobuffalo and again we don't keep a
cent of it just kinda dirty keeping it
but anyway down below case you're
interested thank you guys for watching
