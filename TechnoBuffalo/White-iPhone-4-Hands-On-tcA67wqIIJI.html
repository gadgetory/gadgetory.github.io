technobuffalo here since i unbox is
white iphone yesterday i've been getting
a slew of questions in the comments from
that video but how the phone actually
looks and wanting to see some more
hands-on time with it if there's any
sort of screen gleaning and how the
quality looks so i'm gonna give you guys
serve with more thorough walkthrough of
the white iphone 4 let's get started so
the biggest question that i had was in
regards to the screen does the screen
bleed through to the white obviously
with black color is not going to come
through but there is some worry that you
might with white so here's what I've
done I've sort of lowered the lights a
little bit i'm going to go ahead and go
to a website you can start to see if
there's any sort of bleeding through
there we'll go ahead and jump on over to
technobuffalo and the screen looks
pretty good if i go ahead and sort of
cover it right there right where the
screen stops you can't see any really
light coming out same thing at the top
it blocks it out just like the white
version or the black version did really
isn't much of a difference here just
color a lot of people are also asking
about whether or not there were sort of
dead pixels with the screen so what I
did was I took a black image in a white
image I'm gonna go ahead and put them up
here on the screen we're gonna go and
see if there's a difference so let's
start with the black it's just complete
black image does not appear to be any
sort of dead pixels there at all looks
completely black next I have a white
image it's just the background that I'm
filming on right here I took a picture
of and again nothing nothing's black
nothing's glowing sometimes stuck pixels
can turn red I haven't had any sort of
issue like that so I didn't go to the
next one and even on any picture that I
have there's no sort of ghosting image
things seem to look very clear so the
next sort of big question was about
build quality how does the white iphone
look and we'll go ahead and give you a
bit of a more thorough walkthrough so
I'm going to zoom the camera up a little
bit here so things are looking pretty
stock I've got a invisible shield on
here now that wasn't on there yesterday
you could see it kind of a little bit on
the button you can see there's a little
bit of a plastic covering on just to
protect it from scratching so the
front-facing cameras lined up perfectly
so there's a microphone and proximity
sensor you can now see the proximity
sensor because obviously it's white on
the blackberry
and the black holes just kind of blend
it in on the sides things look just as
the black iphone forwarded on the bottom
the speaker and microphone and on the
other side as well I can see the
invisible shield their extends right up
to the microSD cover and then that's it
open so I can access it and then the
invisible shield starts again and then
the top of the phone and for those
you're wondering the invisible shield on
the side will stop that antenna issue
it's just something that covers it up as
a bit of a heads up so overall build
quality seems to be very good the phone
looks and behaves just like any other
iphone just happens to be white the
button works very well it's got the same
clicking button feel but the iphones
have always had in every way this is
exactly the same as a black iphone 4
just in white so there's any screen
bleeding through the bottom there aren't
any dead pixels on the phone it just
works and behaves as would any other
iphone 4 just in a different color and
we got to give any questions please let
me know i wish i had another black
iphone 4 to show you by comparison prob
about unfortunately i only have one
hopefully this helps and sort of can
show some differences between the black
and the white one if you have a block
one in your hand or your finger in the
store this will hopefully give you a
basis for comparison no word on what
Apple is actually going to release the
white iphone 4 it's still later this
year we're already in October of 2010 so
the months are quickly eroding away for
how much time they have left anyway guys
i'm jon rettinger from TechnoBuffalo see
in the next video bye bye
