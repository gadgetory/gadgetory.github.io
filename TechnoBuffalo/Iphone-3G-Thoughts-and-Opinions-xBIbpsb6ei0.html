doing well wherever you are at I've been
asked quite a bit to give some
impressions on the 3g iphone I'm waiting
to do so to head all the information to
apple and 18 teen really sell
information and it looks like now we
finally have so i'd like to go ahead and
present my take on the 3g iphone and
what i think it means the marketplace is
a whole study the marketplace as a whole
and whether or not i recommend buying
one or they're not i'm gonna get one
myself so start off this is not a 3g
iphone just coolin this is the old 2g
you can tell by the aluminum casing on
the back the new 3g version is i'm sure
most you know is going to be plastic on
the back similar to what the current
macbooks look like and it's going to be
offered in an 8 gigabyte 16 gigabyte
configurations in both white and black
and the 16 and just black on the eight
gig now what's unique about this iphone
as opposed to the first generation is at
least the united states AT&amp;amp;T is going to
subsidize the price meaning you no
longer have to pay six hundred dollars
for an iphone you'll now be able to pick
up a eight gig 3g iphone 4 199 or 16 for
299 which is a great deal nuts for new
customers or anybody who currently owns
a first-generation iPhones so
subsidizing the price makes it much more
affordable and have a much broader reach
into the masses hardware-wise is opposed
to like i said before the current
aluminum is going to be plastic but the
big difference hardware-wise is the
addition of a 3g radio which means
higher download speed to everybody knows
one of the biggest features of 3g that
people might not know it's simultaneous
voice and data that means you can be on
a phone call and check in your email and
going online and it's not going to go
right to voicemail which is a really
nice added feature i think and then in
addition to the 3g radio seems learn 18
not cingular AT&amp;amp;T and apple have also
added assisted gps now people have asked
but assisted gps is i'm going to try and
explain it a normal gps chip is
essentially just a chip in your phone
that's in
signal to the satellite the space beams
it back down tells you where you are
which is great if you're outdoors then
you have an open view to the sky if
you're indoors doesn't center they
worked well because a window or
something has been our window or a wall
or something is going to be blocking
your view to this guy so what assisted
GPS does this actually uses the cellular
data very similar to the way that the
current iphone and google maps integrate
and it help pinpoint your location using
cellular data as a secondary means of
location so it's it has a full on GPS
chip as well but in addition you can use
the cellular data so it makes it much
more accurate and makes it much quicker
defining your location now in addition
to the 3g radio and GPS Apple is also
launching their mobile me service which
will not be meat to the 3g iphone and
still be able to use it with your older
first generation model essentially what
that is exchange for everybody else and
for those that might not know what that
is essentially it allows you to sync
your wirelessly sync actually your phone
and your computer's whether it's a mac
or pc and you'll be able to sync
calendar contacts email so if i add a
new contact on my phone it immediately
show up on my outlook box at work or my
email on my computer at home and the
same things are true for calendars and
an email so it makes it fantastic one of
the best features i think that mobileme
is essentially push email and what push
email does is every time you get a new
get a new email now on the current
iphone it has to pull it down from a
service we have to check connect to the
server and pull the email down what push
does is actually pushes the message to
your phone your phone doesn't have to
keep possible keep checking all the time
for new messages which is really nice
thing it helped save battery life and
get the message almost as soon as it's
10 which is really great for business
users I know what I travel for work
having push email would make life a lot
easier remember when I had the
blackberry it was one of the best
features that I enjoyed
so those are some cool things and Apple
is also launching their iphone to point
o software which essentially just gives
you access to the app store which is
just a myriad of applications that
you'll be able to download for your
phone anything from games to medical use
it dumb and medical applications and
really everything in between some app
page you're going to be free some we're
going to go up to tie as thousands and
Applegate developers access to the
accelerometer to the full screen to the
buttons so the developers have carte
blanche will do what they like a bit so
should you upgrade if you have a current
generation iphone and you live somewhere
where there's 3g i say i upgrade i'm
using internet all the time on my iphone
it's one of the biggest features for me
and it was one of my top reasons that i
bought it so having faster data is is it
must have for me and I'm really looking
forward to it the GPS is a nice digital
feature wasn't a deal breaker but 3g was
really all that I needed and having
mobile me as well as it's great i'll
certainly be let me buying that it's a
hundred dollars for a year by the way
it's replacing the current mac on
infrastructure this will have email
addresses and in a lot business there's
an airplane flying overhead here so
figure so in conclusion if think you
should upgrade i think it's definitely
worth it you know if you dad is not
important soon you're happy with your
current phone you know then don't don't
bother still going to look the same but
if faster browsing experience and gps
important to you then i say go for it
