Buffalo show I'm live your to host for
today Sean ani editor-in-chief of techna
Buffalo am joined by executive editor or
mobile Todd Hazleton everybody you're
giving you peace signs like I did I
didn't even mean to hey we all just keep
peace chains uh so it's been a hot
minute since we've been here yeah it's
gonna walk yeah all those blasted
holidays and then see us finally arrived
yep it was crazy it was crazy so look
we'll just give a quick break down here
of everything that went wrong uh first
off I got a message from joey davidson
our gaming editor who was going to go
this year i get a message from him
sunday a few hours before his fighting
goes i think i have the flu if he hours
later i have the flu so we cancelled him
quickly because we did not want him you
know to just gift wrap the plague for us
and so Joey was actually going to join
us on this episode to talk about his
first see yes but he never made it so
there he go the then came all the travel
fun yeah oh yeah so for only the second
time in history I had a suitcase Chuck
suitcase not make it so that was always
fun and but I I'm one of those people
that I always believed in I pack all my
essentials in my carry-on so I always
have one day change of clothes I have
any medications I may be taking I have
you know over-the-counter medications
for headaches and stomach problems and
everything else and so I was an okay
shape but I got my check bag like what
was it I think like 2am whenever you and
I parted ways sunday night or saturday
whichever night was who knows Saturday
night but then when you were traveling
home what happened to you yeah well I
had mechanical problems I guess the air
conditioner on my plane
working from Las Vegas to Atlanta so
miss the connection in atlanta but my
bag just came all the way to New York so
I didn't have my bags and unlike you I
put everything in them because I was
like I haven't lost a bag in a decade
and it wasn't lost it just continued on
without Rob so then I mean I was in an
Atlanta Airport all night I didn't get
home until like three o'clock on sunday
so i feel like i'm still on CES just
still go out I can't believe it's I keep
it it's Thursday we've been back yeah I
drove home Sunday morning and you know
we you know I can't believe I've been
home you know for four days it's just
mind-boggling to me yeah I still feel
like I'm still on that CES like cuz we
started what last Sunday and then went
through all this sunday i mean this
previous sunday and now I just feel like
I'm still going on so this weekend will
be a good one yeah exactly whole thing
away exactly so uh one quick question
here from Sasha Mahal is actually I
clicked on the wrong one can we talk
about what joy was going to cover from
CES yes he was going to do smart home
stuff which unfortunately we just simply
did not have time to do since we were
down a man but yeah that was that was
the big secret i'm glad i didn't say
that before I help it back so yeah that
was a wise choice on my part but so
moving into CS and we'll get to another
question here from social Mahal how does
CES 25 2015 compared to years past and
I'm sure you and I both have opinions on
this so why don't you go first Todd yeah
well I think we sort of briefly talked
about this you and I yesterday how um
it's teams like their what there wasn't
like anything major in in terms of
consumer electronics like we had some
steps we had the G flex 2 right for
phones and there wasn't many phones
there lenovo had a couple
blue as a couple and then we went right
into TVs where you know the beautiful
OLED screens and they're curved but
we've sort of seen those before still
super expensive they look awesome you
know as they always do so I'd say
there's a similarity there and probably
priced way out of my budget but one
thing that did really stand out to me
was a lot of the smart car stuff and not
just smart cars but these autonomous
cars so how da dhone of the a7 concept
for sadies had what I'm sure there were
more and that was cool like the a7
concept for example from how he drove
itself from Silicon Valley to Las Vegas
which I think was like 550 or 560 miles
and then we saw the new LG watch that
they built for Audi which runs on webos
and is it able to start the car and
unlock the car with NFC and Bluetooth
it's really it was really cool so I feel
like many years ago i'd say like five
years ago i used to go to CES and see
lots of tablets and phones and you know
the carriers would be there i mean even
last year t-mobile header press
conference and this year it just it
wasn't mobile focus really I think we
have more Congress coming up at the
start of March and we sort of just came
off of Aoife in September so it's not
it's not so much a mole be fun and
productive unless right now definitely
at I think I was a bit surprised by the
number of car related items that were
being discussed the the ADI driving
itself to Vegas I thought was amazing I
think the difference for me this year
was it was much it seemed to me to be
more about refining existing products
and not even iterating existing products
but refining current products adding new
features to him adding you know things
that they couldn't do in the past and
but there was no you know it like in
years past there was always something
you know everyone talked about this one
item I did not hear any one thing that
was being discussed by everybody this
year mm-hmm I take a dick though Samsung
and LG had the washer machines with two
washers and everybody
seem to be talking about that well that
L oh and the other thing everybody was
discussing was the belle fille yeah oh
right right the butt selfie the butt
selfie stick which yeah none of us could
figure out why that existed but we were
talking about it out of just sheer why
as for the washers with the ability to
do two loads i think that was another
why moment as opposed to a oh this is
groundbreaking technology but no it was
an interesting show it was it was busy
for sure it was always good you know
working with the the crew for a week and
even if we are in a teeny tiny room you
know so we get to know each other really
well in that tiny little room under the
stairs that we work in but hey at least
we have a workspace that that's the main
thing to me oh yeah it was an
interesting show and you know I I
believe if the staff had had tomatoes
they would been thrown at me when I said
remember everyone 51 weeks to CES 2016
yes no one seemed to appreciate my
comment but that's just too bad but I so
was there any one thing Todd that you
know be it even on a personal level was
there any one thing it's he is that
really screamed up to you you were
excited about this um I think it was
probably that Audi self-driving car
because and it was something I saw
towards the end of the show but to me
that's just sort of incredible and it's
not something I'm used to seeing hi you
know I don't usually cover cars for
technobuffalo I just sort of we went
over the audi booth to find the the new
LG watch and so I talked to them for
just a while and checked out these
things so I think for me it was just
super exciting because you know I'm a
guy it's mostly focused on mobile and
gadgets and stuff like that so when I
see something like
here's this car that just drove itself
and there was somebody in the seat
that's just incredibly exciting to me so
I think I think that's what stood out
like when I think back at CES you know
when people are like what was it that
you saw it was really cool i think
that's it and the mercedes concept which
just looked at me saying I mean it had
that before seeds that can swivel and
look at each other and that drives
itself too but that's a concept and so
is a seven but I mean that was already
on the road there is nobody more excited
about self-driving cars than me as
somebody that absolutely despises
driving yeah you know but the same thing
as i know yes it's exciting that all
this stuff is coming along but you know
that the first couple years you know
there's no way the average consumer is
going to be able to afford this
technology yeah so at this point
considering i am 43 I'm just hopeful
that it's at an affordable price before
I die so i can only say I saw them you
know but yeah the ADI are not the adi
the mercedes you know that was very cool
I I didn't get to see that one in person
because I didn't make it over there on
Tuesday but the I there's something a
little disconcerting to me about the
idea of like here i'm going to reroute
8am i share hiring 80 degrees so buy
backs to the road i mean i've got all
this reliance of my software that it's
great to get me there safely let's
chitchat you know that that's maybe
pushing the concept a little too far I
at least with the ADI there's the
ability to take over the the steering
you know if need be the the Mercedes
might be getting a little little to
automated for my days have to see but
yeah that was a terse I'd say for me and
this was a very very minor thing I was
excited about the announcement that the
nest thermostat can now talk to the
Ummah I think that's interesting to me
because as I look at smart home stuff
there's so many different platforms that
are competing and you don't know if you
know this product is going to work with
this product and the way Nest has got
about it by opening up their AP
I is allowing people to build on top of
that and use the nest thermostat as
their hub I think that's very
interesting the fact that it integrates
with Dropcam and integrates with uma
that's pretty much the extent of it
right now but it's a great start and
that's the sort of thing I want to see
oh so now you can have these competing
brands or not even competing but just
different brands all coming together
under one umbrella right and so I really
want to see where nest is going to take
those down the road and where other
companies are going to take those down
the road as they work with ness to
improve their integration it's not only
how we like we keep talking about the
hub of these smart homes and in a lot of
ways to me like yes Ness is a thermostat
but it's becoming that up without even
like like it's just connecting
everything yeah it's not been the goal
of it I don't think what's interesting
yeah exactly a question from saha Raja
how many CES have you been to uh how
many have you I know you've been do more
than me Todd um I think it's just my
seventh I'm not positive okay this this
was definitely my fifth yeah so it met
many CES is she misses from Sasha Mahal
changing gears a little bit what do you
guys think of the project our stuff that
was shown off of the developers
conference I thought it was cool I
didn't know you know I've been following
it as much as I guess a lot of people
but I didn't know all these kind of
boundaries that they're hitting so for
example they were talking about magnetic
interference because if magnets to
attach these modules to the phone and
then also they were talking about how
spiral to latest prototype is only 3g
right now and like and it's like this
big step for them the place a 3g call
over this and i didn't realize that that
was such a big roadblock you know I
would have thought this was 4G LTE right
now I think by the second quarter so you
know anytime between March April May
time frame they were going to get out of
4G LTE model but you know it seems like
it's progressing really quickly they
announced their
their market pilots going to occur in
Puerto Rico which is interesting but
they said it has such a diverse wireless
landscape between local carriers and US
carriers that are down there and and
really want to target that for its first
I guess kind of soft launch which was me
and they're gonna selling out of like
food trucks which I thought was cool at
least in some areas not a unique way to
do something like that I mean they had a
partnered with two carriers in Puerto
Rico too so I'm really impressed it's
coming along it's a moonshot like they
say so there's no definite you know that
this is gonna happen but it seems like
it will so ya know I am I i think that
the Puerto Rico was the big surprise to
me I it was I didn't see that one coming
although when they listed their reasons
it made a lot of sense yeah I like the
free trade for you know developer models
comporting and stuff I thought that was
interesting and I guess working with a
local university and they said there's a
big artist community so you know one of
the things you're trying to do is sort
of get these phones of customizable I
think with different art on the back and
stuff like that so it sounds like a neat
place ya know and I the idea that they
still don't have LTE support lee i mean
if this was a consumer product I'd be
screaming bloody murder at this point
still developer product yeah you know
but yeah it seemed it is interesting to
me that they're still fussing with how
to get LTE to work in it ie they said
it's coming but just the fact that it's
not there yet is very very odd to me
yeah and one thing well they say they
have 11 modules right now for developers
like to toy around with as examples one
was up ooh
you should never want this on their
phone but the whole point is you can if
some developer creates this neat module
that does something that maybe you know
a small select few amount of you want
they can still buy it put it on there
thought that was neat but they also said
right now the hot swappable battery is
not quite hot swappable the devices to
be in low-power mode but by spiral 3 it
will be so presumably there's like a
little Bank of power in there and you
can pop a battery off and pop the new
one on so that's kind of neat here is
possibly the most important question
ever asked on this show relating to a
Twitter conversation you and I had what
is your favorite pitch perfect scene and
how excited are you guys for pitch
perfect 2 hahahaha uh what is my
favorite senior so many two words vomit
angel uh uh yeah I don't know I don't
know what my favorite scene I just like
the whole movie I think it's just kind
of stupid silly but wait what's the guy
when he comes down he sees like the
acapella guys and they're old and he
says something new home I always laugh
at that part oh yeah for those that
don't know what's going on I i was
watching pitch perfect in my hotel room
the night before I left for CES and I I
tweeted a picture about you know don't
judge me and Todd replied how can I
judge you it's my one of my favorite
movies and so now the world knows about
our love of pitch perfect as for being
excited for the sequel I've to see if it
works that that's going to be a hard
thing to do without make it just feel
like you really left at this in the
first one so we thought we'd do it
bigger to this time right yeah I don't
think I've really follow along with
what's going to happen fish perfect to
you I mean comedy sequels to me are
always difficult because they want you
well you found this really funny so if
we just do this again you laugh again
right yeah you know you have to have a
reason for the sequel to exist in my
opinion right so I all see it but I
know if I'm excited for you yet but uh
uh yes we need me to not reveal many
more of our movie loves on on Twitter
yeah but keep it to ourselves a question
here from Sasha Mahal about a question
more towards me what goes into planning
before going to a big show like CES and
how does working at CES compared to a
regular day of work well I can speak to
the planning portion months in advance
we start getting emails about the the
different press day events press day for
those that don't know there's actually a
day before CES officially starts called
press day which is just press
conferences and on that day we work from
a different location than CES itself
last year and this year we were at the
mandalay bay for press day and so what
it involves is we get the schedule of
all the press conferences and i take a
look at who i've got going to the show
and i start arranging i'm ok these two
people will go to this one this next
press conference butts up against the
back of that one so i guess and two
different people to that one by then the
first two should be ready to go to
another one and i can start moving them
around and that that's why i don't
remember who first called me this but at
CES i I've known as the air traffic
controller because I'm trying to keep
everyone flowing in different directions
at different times and trying to make
sure that they never collide but uh so
that's what a lot of playing goes into
and then as technobuffalo has gotten
bigger it's nice because a lot more
companies approached us about you know
do you want a meeting at CES and we tend
to not take too many official meetings
at set times because something
inevitably comes up at CES and you end
up having to cancel your appointments
but we we do set appointments with the
bigger companies and the other ones were
like we will stop by and see you we just
can't guarantee you a locked time that
will come by Ryan first or the booth
when you know we have a moment to get
over there exactly now as for how my
workday differs at sea
yes it's a lot of I we have a small room
which we were able to fit nine people
into although it feels like you will
never fit that many and I primarily just
sit third the entire day because
everyone kinda uses me as the hub you
know they drop stuff you know ok I'm
done filming I'm dropping an SD card off
with you so that when Ron comes back Ron
can start editing so I tend to sit right
there so my day really is that different
i said here all day how is it different
for you god i walk a lot more i'd say i
think i hit 20,000 steps on one day
there at CES the arm it's a lot of
meetings so and it depends on where they
are sometimes there are other hotels I
know that one day I had to grab a taxi
back to make sure i was back in time
what is it's a lot of you know meet with
company a take pictures film it run back
give it to shun me the company be repeat
so it's a lot of that it's it's similar
to do a lot of the shows we do fo mo
whole congress and stuff like that um
and oddly i think we'll see es is a
little more manageable actually because
there's so many of us there so you know
if i can't get to something somebody
else can it's a team experience it's
good yeah now that is nice it's nice
actually working with the team as
opposed to you and I work you know by
ourselves in home locations you know so
it is nice to actually work in a team
environment EO and have some very random
conversations in the middle of day that
you're like how did we even get on this
occasion who brought this up and why but
yeah it's a very different experience
going back to travel for a moment from
Dallben raji I'm sorry if I
mispronounced your name what's your
worst hate about traveling oh I have so
many mmm i think it's just you know not
knowing where you're going to end up the
end of the day like hopefully you get
from point A to point B and everything's
fun and usually that happens
you know finding out that you're gonna
be spending a night did Lana like that's
probably the worst thing you think
you're going to be home uh well I mean
for those of you who may have noticed my
voice sounds slightly different that's
because I came back from Vegas not with
a cold or the flu or anything else I
simply cannot breathe through my nose I
haven't been able to breathe through my
nose since i left vegas and i have no
clue why sometimes uh yeah so i would
say probably for me I every I've been
I've traveled for enough years now and
that pretty much any situation comes up
I'm just like okay sure why not no I
know something's going to go wrong this
might as well be it yeah I think that
yeah same thing I mean you saw just like
there's nothing you can do you try your
best to do it and not yell at the
airline but for example it was crazy I
was caught in Las Vegas he said I was
put on an eight o'clock flight I go to
my gate to print that out and they're
like no you're on this flight get on it
right now and like is that kind of that
part of traveling I'm like wait what
okay well he or he could be like the guy
from do who was on the delta flight and
he was alone food although did I did
here finally they did pull back to the
gate and get one more perler guy so two
of them up that's hilarious on one one
giant plane uh first question from the
same gentleman what do you guys think of
the news is it zomi is that how they
pronounce show me show me the show me me
note and the pro I just thought it was
interesting I mean I I saw the specs I'm
not overly blown away a little four gigs
of ram sounds pretty enticing I haven't
used it yet the thing that is just crazy
is it looks like an iphone but they're
stealing a name from samsung the note
it's like come on guys it just seems
like they just don't care anyway I mean
show me is the company that's long been
copying apple and whatever but you know
it's a popular brand in China it's
increasing increasingly popular
increasing market share and I just
wish I think they would do something a
little more original but you know who am
I to judge right no I understand yeah
it's although I that does bring me back
the LG G flex 2 s.d support mm-hmm up to
2 terabytes yeah isn't that crazy but
they don't even exist so I don't know
what the limitations are on that in
terms of software but hardware happy 120
till the max I think great yeah 120 it
will at least that's commercially
available i'm sure there's no special
ones out there but yeah I am yeah that's
cool that's awesome I I'm glad you can
boast that but yeah how many years is it
going to be before we get a two terabyte
card and I appears that we have lost
Todd off the show so hopefully he'll be
able to rejoin us here in a moment he
just imed me and OH his mac broke Oh his
macbook just turned off so we may have
just lost the audio version of the show
um I actually think we're going to cut
this a little shorter than everyone I
apologize for that once again the
wonders of technology we thank you all
for joining us and we will be back next
week and again my apologies and
hopefully we'll get this figured out
until next week take it easy as always
you can find us on iTunes stitcher and
all those places and we'll talk to you
then thank you very much and talk and
talk to you next week bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
