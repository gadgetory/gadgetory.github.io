to you by Full Sail University welcome
back to our episode of ask the Buffalo
this to show you can ask me John Breton
to any question you've got from the wide
wide wide world of Technology up this
week we're gonna talk a little bit about
the next generation xbox360 we're gonna
talk some personal stuff and some
TechnoBuffalo internals I'll wrap it up
with another little bit of Technology
this has to Buffalo let's go and get
started rom is Hussein asks hey Johnny
think there'll be a Kinect 2.0 and if so
what specs should it have yes I
absolutely did Olivia Kinect 2.0 the
text has been a huge success for
Microsoft Sony I'd expect Kinect 2.0 to
launch alongside the next-generation
Xbox we can call it Xbox 3 or Xbox 720
what you're hearing will launch sometime
around III so the original Kinect was
actually capable of capturing 720 video
but it was toned way way way down it's
not to like the next generation to be
able to capture HD video
I like that be able to capture more
points on the body making it more
accurate also expect a much more
detailed face tracking me naked track
when you're smiling where your eyes are
looking super apps it can be some motion
tracking in there as well with your eyes
actually I saw when I was at CES Chinese
company hire had some awesome eye
tracking technology I would love to see
that integrated connection or agent
connect only have a few more months
before we know for sure what do you guys
want to see a next generation Kinect so
the next question is a little bit to do
about TechnoBuffalo as a whole in the
company comes from Mark Dalton hey John
we look back at the start of TV and how
nervy was in the opening weeks or months
especially when server problems on
launch causing and delay how worried
were you at the time where do you see TB
going in the future it's a really nice
segue to something I want to talk about
we first launched TechnoBuffalo we I
don't know anything about launching our
website at all we made a ton of mistakes
and the servers just couldn't handle
even the minimal traffic we were getting
because of problems in the code and it
completely crashed
are we gonna take it down for three
months to get it back up before we could
go ahead and relaunch the site there's
always a struggle to sort of be
to be you know start your own company or
to try and grow an organization to be
the boss everybody wants to get to that
position but few people actually realize
the responsibilities that come along
with it we made an announcement last
week that one of our new additions was
going to be leaving TechnoBuffalo we're
so I'm talking about Aaron Baker and
there's been a lot of comments in the
video that he and I made it that'd be
sort of its professional and I respect
up to the audience to address it maybe a
little bit more Aaron was most
definitely not fired as surprised you
guys were when he left I was equally as
surprised as us and the TechnoBuffalo
family was he felt that it was a better
fit for him back where he started and we
respect it there's no hard feelings when
I said in the video sometimes things
just don't work out this was instances I
still have a lot of respect for Aaron as
a person as a human being it was one of
those things that just didn't work out I
respect his wishes to be let out of his
contract and go back to where he was
before to values where his heart was
there wasn't anything happened behind
the scenes we didn't get in a fight
there wasn't any sort of head clashing
we still have a lot of respect for each
other and that's really the whole story
there's no sort of weird secret behind
it he wanted to go back and we let him
do that we want to make a video serve
telling you guys the audience that
really was any heart feeling because we
both realized that it could seem like
there was some crazy stuff going on
behind the scenes that's that's really
the whole deal so you guys start
thinking about you know how you want to
either grow up or what you want to do
after school or if you're in a business
already how you want to grow and you
want to get up up up and hire you know
just remember that sometimes it's not
always what things appear you guys watch
our videos you know maybe one or two a
week maybe more we forget those this is
our lives and this is our job for eight
nine ten hours a day and a lot of things
that go on maybe you don't guys don't
realize I mean you see a video you see
the net product what I hope that you
guys can do is maybe see the work that
goes into it the work that goes into
running a company the work that goes
into securing advertisers and paying
salaries getting lighting and equipment
there's a lot to it and is a privilege
to be able to bring that to you in a
privilege that I love and I cherish but
think of what we do and what goes on
behind the scenes as sort of I try to do
into in my perspective a lot of things
that I see you guys are more than titled
to Europeans I just wanted to sort of
give you guys a bit more information so
hopefully that helps answer a lot of
questions
so let's wrap this up and bring it back
to technology 2012 is behind us and mark
wants to know what your top 3 Android
phones of 2012 would be it's a great
question number one would be the galaxy
s3 number two the galaxy note 2 and
number 3 would be the Droid DNA that
brought 1080p screens to the masses
through a ton of awesome Android phones
that came at you the left and right but
those three stood out and really no
particular order so what do you guys
think what three are your favorites and
what three do you think I missed when
they come in if I'm answering all the
questions to thank our friends and
