lakers calm with a review and overview
for you of the blackberry bold for AT&amp;amp;T
so before i go into my thoughts and
reactions to the device i want to walk
you through it so you can see what
device looks like i don't hope you give
her a better sense of where i'm coming
from when i talk about the review so
let's get started alright guys so here
is the blackberry bold for AT&amp;amp;T service
give you guys a nice overview of it here
so the front of device looks typical
blackberry it's got send key your
blackberry menu button scroll ball which
serves as a d-pad and also helps with
navigation for websites give a back
button and you have a hang-up and power
off button you've got a full qwerty
keyboard here and the keys do feel very
nice there's a lot of throw to them so
actually has a very nice feel the keys
are not actually spaced apart but
there's ridges on each key which makes
it actually very easy to type and move
your finger to the next key I had no
issue typing and I was able to compose
message very very quickly and very
easily on the bottom there are in your
typical blackberry shortcuts for caps
locks and text up and text down and
you've got some alt function keys all on
there for your punctuation a very
typical blackberry along the left side
of the device you've got a
three-and-a-half millimeter headset jack
which is very nice mini USB a soft
button you can use whatever you'd like
and a microSD expansion card slot which
is actually hot swappable pop it right
in there bottom of the device there's
your microphone and your back release to
release this fake leather backing on the
right side device you've got a volume up
and down toggle another soft key
concepts whatever you like and that's it
top of the device you've got a ringer
set volume button a ringer button now
the back of the vice is made of this
kind of fake leather stuff here if you
can see it there does have a nice feel
and doesn't make it feel slick in the
hand so when you're holding it you don't
feel like you're going to drop it
what does I know a complaint a lot of
people had what the curve that the phone
is replacing size-wise it looks much
bigger than it actually is when you hold
the device in your hand definitely feels
like it adds some heft to it so let me
show you a size wise compared to some
devices you might be familiar with here
here it is with the iphone and when you
hold both in your hands the iphone feels
so much smaller because of tapered edges
but what I was surprised to find is
there are actually almost identical
sizes and from the side as well really
almost identical so I guess it gives
credit to Apple for making the device
feel actually smaller than it is so one
of devices most people might be
replacing their bold width is the
blackberry curve so here it is with the
curb notice the curve has a space in
between the keys or as a bold does not
and the bolt certainly has a much larger
screen which I'll talk about in a minute
so just for size comparisons can see the
bold is a little bit bigger see the
sliver on the side it's also a little
bit thicker but not much so another
device you might be thinking about if
you're with AT&amp;amp;T is the samsung epix so
i'll show you guys comparison with that
similar form backers qwerty keyboards
screens on top although the epics is
running windows mobile and touchscreen
just for size comparisons I'll let you
see so pretty close to the same size
looks like the epics might be yep a
little bit smaller than the blackberry
but not much and thickness the epics is
just a little bit thicker I'm go ahead
and move all those devices out to the
side now the bowl gets its name from its
gorgeous half vga screen so I turned
down the brightness here as far as I
could hopefully be able to see the
screen I know this video won't do it
justice but it is an absolutely gorgeous
screen one of the best I've seen on a
mobile device let me zoom in so you guys
can get a better look here
okay so you're greeted with typical
blackberry home screen but the icons
actually just a little bit different now
it's got curve a neon look when you
scroll across to them it's a very nice
look that rim has added to their newer
devices the blackberry button that same
theme put this down maybe a little
better that same theme kind of carries
out through it looks like neon wiring
almost free to the icons so paramount to
me for mobile device aside from call
quality is browser and the browser on
the blackberry bold it's not as good as
I was expecting it to be let me go ahead
and give you guys a real quick example
of that okay so we're on a local Wi-Fi
network here I'll go ahead and load John
for lakers calm they're just booting up
Mishon should tell you this is a full 3g
capable device meaning it's fast
broadband like data which is very nice I
don't have a sim card in there currently
but 3g speeds are compatible as any
other 3g phone i've seen particularly
the iphone now blackberries in the past
notably the curve and the pearl had
awful browsers rim was not known for
their internet capabilities on their
phones they're really trying to change
that with the blackberry bold so i give
you an example of what typical internet
looks like on the bold and tell you some
of the positive and negatives about it
first it is definitely the best browser
that's research in motion also known as
rim has put out is capable of rendering
full HTML web pages which essentially
means you see the pages on your phone as
you would on a computer which is very
nice and the first time it really been
able to do that so we move this over
here so there's a full john for liquors
i don't know if you guys can be able to
see that up the text is very small and
the scroll ball right there actually
served as a little bit of a mouse and
you can move it around you have to
navigate left and right with it and the
text is way too small to read to have to
keep zooming in to view the text as you
zoom in you have to keep scrolling left
and scrolling right to really see
anything which is a bit on the
unfortunate side keep going down so the
browser while it does display full HTML
pages is not perfect certainly text
wrapping would be a nice feature they do
have it but it has not been perfected
and I think an easier navigation and
zoom method would certainly be a welcome
addition to the bold but that being said
it is certainly the most capable
blackberry browser to date that research
in motion has put out at least the most
that I've seen so certainly kudos to rim
for that let's go back to the home
screen here it is capable of playing
pictures and videos there's no YouTube
player on it right now so that's
certainly a downside video plays
fantastic on it's nice and smooth and
looks beautiful on the screen although
again in the video really won't do the
screen justice does have a full built-in
assisted gps 3g and it's a quad-band
phone meeting it'll work with any
network in the world which is very nice
go back to the home screen here you can
customize the background you can set
your ringtone profiles and of course you
get that fantastic blackberry push email
which really has been untouched by any
other company Microsoft and Apple
included rims email is absolutely
fantastic so that you guys have had a
chance to see the device let me talk to
you about it let you know what I think
so first and foremost with using a
mobile device you're concerned about
call quality and I'm very happy to admit
that call quality on the bold was
fantastic I did some rigorous testing on
3g and edge networks and I made a
transition from 3g to edge and handled
everything perfectly collars on the
other ends did not say they hear any
hissing I'm hearing hissing no
background noises everybody said it was
perfectly clear which was very nice
transition from 3g to edge didn't drop
calls user at the other end didn't hear
any static it was a nice smooth
transition which again is very nice for
a 3g device battery life
and could always be better but as you
saw in the unboxing the battery in this
thing is huge and I was able to get
about four hours of talk time out of it
which is pretty nice and again I put it
through some heart tests using the
internet for say two to three hours a
day which is quite a lot and maybe an
hour and a half of phone calls it will
last the entire day look at you through
an entire day but we'll have to charge
it every night which is really the most
i can ask for you go to bed you have an
outlet by you plug the phone in you
shouldn't have much of a trouble getting
through a full day of use overall I
really like the blackberry I've been a
real big blackberry fan for a while
before i switched over to the iphone i
had many room devices you can see in my
first iphone unboxing I was replacing a
blackberry pearl had a curve at 8700
before that I fat 8800 so I really do
like Blackburn this is definitely the
best full qwerty keyboard that rim has
put out today I have not seen the
blackberry storm yet so I can't comment
on that but at least for the gsm
networks this is hands down the best
blackberry if you're a corporate user
and you need push email eat a full
keyboard and you really want reliability
of rim the blackberry bold is definitely
for you if you're a heavy texter and you
like a full keyboard it's a great way to
go as well screen is gorgeous and it
just it's a great phone all around how
you recommend it on a one out of five
scale i give the bold four-and-a-half
only lacking because of some of the
browser shortcomings that's really hit
