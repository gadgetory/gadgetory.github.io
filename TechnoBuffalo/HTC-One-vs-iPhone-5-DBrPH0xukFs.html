TechnoBuffalo here at the head-to-head
battle of two of arguably the best
smartphones out right now in one corner
we've got HTC's flagship the HTC One on
the other we got Apple's bad boy the
iPhone 5 we're gonna put these two guys
head-to-head and declare a winner in
this smartphone smackdown
let's get fightin all right sweet
that'll hold these two phones back from
each other ever since we got the HTC One
in our hands they are ready for a fight
so if you caveat here these are two
phones as folks are gonna have a pretty
solid choice from without the deciding
which phone to get obviously the HTC One
came out much more recently than the
iPhone 5 when the iPhone 5 successor
comes out the five s to the 6 we will
update this but as of this filming in
the middle of March these are two phones
that are readily available that
consumers are going to be choosing from
so in previous battles we've broken them
up into categories and speed and see
which phone was faster but really
opening up apps and browsing websites
and seeing which one looks quicker just
doesn't work anymore phones are fast
every phone even entry-level phones
right now are very quick so that's not
gonna work the way we're gonna do this
video is I'm gonna mention something I
like about a phone something I don't
like about the other phone so it's
mentioned in the HTC One category it
means I like it better on the HTC One
then the iPhone 5 so let's go ahead and
start with things that are a wash means
I like them both on both devices and a
lot of these things you'll see are
things Apple used to have just
completely locked down in the past let's
start with build quality and this one is
a huge compliment to HTC they've learned
phone after phone after phone how to get
build quality just right and I think
they've really nailed it it's from the
culmination of years of phone making
with the HTC One and certainly the same
thing is true with Apple there's a lot
of similarities when it comes to build
quality unibody aluminum design we've
got antenna bands on the top and bottom
really done there's a very very nice job
with the build both phones feel very
cool in the hand I'm not talking cool
with like a that movie's cool weird that
gasps whoo girls cool I'm talking
actually cool to the touch the aluminum
absolutely incredible both phones screen
quality HTC has done an incredible job
with build quality and Apple hasn't
really been some of the best in the
industry
so next let's talk about boom those guys
let's talk about camera we did a full
comparison post comparing the HTC One
camera versus a slew of other smart
phones including the iphone 5 we saw
some interesting results so I think HTC
One is much better in low-light the
ultrapixels have allowed more light in
to get crisper images with less of
blurriness going on
I thought the HTC one had better video
quality as well 1080p video and also
better audio quality the iPhone I
thought did a better job in just a
normal light settings and has a much
improved digital zoom due to the
increase in megapixel count so if you
want to print images out gigantically
certainly the iPhone might be a bit of a
better option but for uploading things
to Facebook or Instagram you know both
are going to be great choices so one was
better one category has been better than
the other but when it comes to cameras I
think both these are great choices neck
is something Apple again used to have
locked up user interface the iPhone used
to be and still is very elegant easy to
use and easy to learn that was one of
its great appeals Android now I think
has that same thing I think sense five
for the augment set it's easy to use
it's easy to learn and it's a very
elegant interface now so hats off to HTC
and Android for catching up and in some
ways passing what Apple has done next
speed both these phones are fast doesn't
matter when that thing with quad-core
dual core here both of them just work
very well apps open quickly games play
fast they're both really fast phones you
know quadrant scores and that kind of
thing really doesn't matter that much to
me and user experience is what I like to
gauge my phones by and both of these
were really really really quick alright
so now let's get to what I like better
what I like worse let's start with what
I like better with the HTC One let's
start with this beautiful display the
screen I'm not talking about the screen
size size is subjective whether or not
you want a 4.7 inch screen a 5.5 inch
screen or 4 inch screen fan on the
iPhone talking about the panel itself
this is an absolutely gorgeous display
Full HD resolution and that is 1920 by
1080 with a ridiculous PPI of almost 470
things look absolutely gorgeous so I've
said in the past talk about the screens
videos look great pictures look
beautiful but really what I use the
phone for most you just noticed a
difference so when I'm reading emails
replying to texts or browsing Facebook
or Twitter or Instagram there's
something about the display that really
just pops to me it almost looks like
there's a sticker on it you have to peel
off and a real screen is gonna be below
it it is absolutely gorgeous and you
compare that to the screen on the iPhone
4 which is certainly not slouch the
resolution of 11 36 by 640 with the 326
PPI it's really incredible what HTC has
done with their screens here alright
next Google search I think is absolutely
outstanding the UI I don't think is as
solid as serious but when it comes to
speed information you get I think Google
search has Siri whipped and we did head
tech comparisons comparing Google search
with Siri but for my money I will go to
Google search nine out of ten times over
what I look on for Siri plus on the HTC
One it's actually British
what's the weather today today is
forecast for evan is 72 degrees and
mostly cloudy
who won the Lakers game the Lakers lost
to the Suns 99 to 76 what's the weather
outside who won the Lakers game seems a
little harsh
next Google now is something that I
really don't think we've seen anywhere
else Google now is an incredibly useful
tool if you have a long commute home at
say how long you have to go to drive
home
I'll give you sports scores it just does
a ton of really interesting things I
find very useful you can choose to use
it or not use it but it's really nice to
be able to have next let's talk about
speakers this guy right here
booms down it's not just the speaker
it's the whole algorithms that go into
making the sound come out the speaker's
here absolutely awesome in our review of
the HTC One we did a versus on the
speaker side versus H
versus the iPhone 5 you can really hear
the difference and we did the test with
front-facing cuz you're watching a phone
or watching a video rather are listening
to music you'd be looking at the screen
so that's why the tests were doesn't
like that and you guys can hear the
difference for yourself
so the HTC one does a lot of things
really well but and do everything better
than the iPhone five let's talk about
what the iPhone 5 does better than the
HTC one first battery life battery life
on the HTC One is no slouch able to get
through a full day with 20 to 30 ish
percent left on the iPhone 5 you can
found an extra 10 percent to that
battery life is really outstanding on
the iPhone 5 Apple's really optimized
the OS for the hardware
I think battery life so in the instances
where you really really see that also
charge time is crazy fast on the iPhone
5 from zero charge to full you can get
it almost up there and hour and a half
inch fish which is really impressive
next is one of my favorite features of
the iPhone and iOS and that's PI message
I think they've really knocked it out of
the park and I know that there are other
alternatives for Android I use whatsapp
all the time I don't have a desktop
what's up application I can't use you
know whatsapp on every tablet that's not
an iPad I love the way iMessage works I
love to be able to use it to text
friends and I wish that there was some
sort of equivalent on Android we're
hearing rumors of Google babble coming
out which might unify all the chat
platforms but right now apples got eye
messages and that really does an
incredible job next the keyboard I still
prefer the keyboard in iOS was one of
the first really well done on-screen
keyboards HTC keyboard is no slouch and
Ray built-in keyboards are no slouch but
I'm not a user of swipe so that really
hasn't affected me what I use when it
comes to just tapping on the screen I
still prefer the keyboard on iOS 5 next
integrated visual voicemail
I love how well is integrated into the
operating system on the iPhone 5 now
some phones have integrated some don't
on our international unlock you know HTC
One it is not integrated after use a
third-party app in this case I use you
mail but I really like how its
integrated right into the operating
system to write inside of the phone
application a next is app quality
certainly there are a ton of cross apps
that are available on both operating
systems but the quality of the apps are
designed for really one or two devices
and I think the apps are still have a
little bit of an edge when it comes to
iOS now certainly you can
every app on really any operating system
you want as long as into these two but
if you're comparing the same app I think
it just a little bit better experience
here on iOS so we put these two guys
head-to-head we talked about different
cat or talked about screens and speakers
and messaging systems which one is the
winner the winner for me is the HTC one
is the winner of this head-to-head
battle if I had to pick a phone when I
was walking in the store and these two
were sitting on the shelves
I would pick up the HTC One and I would
sign a two-year contract to get the HTC
One I'm really excited to see what Apple
has next the next-generation iOS is
gonna do its next generation of hardware
is going to be but for right now for my
money the HTC One takes the cake do you
guys agree disagree I'd love to hear
