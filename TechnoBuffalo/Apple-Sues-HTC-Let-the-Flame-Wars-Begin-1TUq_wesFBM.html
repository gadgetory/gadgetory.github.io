technobuffalo here today is March second
2010 a day that's going to live in
infamy as the start of the flame wars
I'm not talking about internet trolls
talking about people's moms or calling
people fanboys this is a day that Apple
threw down the gauntlet and file a 20
patent infringement lawsuit against HTC
which answer high tech computers the
makers of the majority of the Android
phones out and windows mobile phones
they make the nexus one and series of
others a hero as well Apple is alleging
like I said 20 iPhone related patent
infringement and some of them range
quite a bit I'll give you the facts
first now editorialize a little bit so
let's start with a quote from Steve job
which was released today I'm gonna look
to the side as I read this to you he
said we can sit by and watch competitors
steal our patented inventions or we can
do something about it we decided to do
something about it since Steve Jobs
Apple CEO we think competition is
healthy but competitors should create
their own original technology not steal
ours so from that quote you would
probably think that HTC put out an H
phone with exactly the same UI and
features let's go over some of the 20
patent infringement that Apple is a
legend so we'll start with patent number
5 million nine hundred twenty thousand
726 which the system and method for
management the power condition within a
digital camera device right in 1999 as
patents is relatively broad means
information from gadget I covers power
management a digital camera device power
management that sends information to a
promising controlling the camera so it
sounds like any sort of camera device
that uses power Apple is alleging a
patent door and give me the facts in the
toilet so that's one of the examples of
apple's patent infringement let's pick
another one here will go patent number 7
million 257,000 848 unlocking it advice
by performing
gestures on an unlock image that's
clearly referring to android sort of
unlock scheme that you can do I've got
the grids and you can make a picture of
it Apple is clearly alleging that they
they own that patents and I'll give you
one more example of some of the other
ones that are in there we'll go with pet
number seven million three hundred and
eighty-three thousand 453 you can look
these up based on those patent numbers
conservative powered by reducing voltage
supply to an instruction processing
portion of a processor it's a pretty
technical patents we graduated 2008
we're going to say it probably covers
powering down the processor and how it
uses power so a lot of these are very
very very broad really no secret that
Apple's granted a patent on multi touch
technologies before the launch of the
iphone now I think the problem here lies
with the US Patent Office granting
patents that are so widespread I'd be
like granting granting a patent for
having a speaker and a microphone on a
mobile device something that's so
ubiquitous that it's real it's really
hard to patent but they were issuing
these patents and Apple is defending the
patents that well evidently they own
which is a very hairy situation you know
certainly the way technology is evolving
there are only a few finite ways to
interact with the phone touch
technologies definitely one of them if
you want to have it on lock screen you
got to interact with the phone in some
way so apples claiming here to own
interacting with the screens unlock good
advice just an example of some sort of
the ridiculous patents that have been
granted now I understand protecting your
RMD which is research and development
Apple's certainly put years and years
and years and millions and millions of
sexy billions of dollars into their user
interface and their hardware and I can
respect the work done is that nap will
desire to protect them and they did do
their due diligence they try to pack
their ideas and they were granted
patents how ridiculous they might be and
if these pads do hold true it would
appear that HTC and every other
manufacturer for that matter is
infringing on Apple's patties and I
can't help but wonder if this is more of
an apple shot at Google more than is a
shot at HTC certainly there are other
manufacturer
devices this is what it's referring to
why is an apple suing motorola why is an
apple suing LG or Samsung they all use
similar interfaces this has to be
referring to the sense UI or the for the
touch you sent to your tired sense UI or
touch flow and touchflo 3d which is what
HTC puts on top of their operating
systems otherwise this would have been a
much broader lawsuit so what does sense
UI and touchflo 3d have that maybe the
others don't that's a scan the top of
the operating system it seems to be that
where Apple has their big issues is with
the sort of enhancements of the user
interface I think this is a lot of
posturing I mean this is ever going to
see the light of day in court I think
it's Apple sort of throwing down the
gauntlet so to speak and say we're going
to try and defend what is rightfully
ours and I guess it is rightfully theirs
viction have had it to begin with the
patents that were issued were just
completely asinine but they were issued
and whether you like it or not agree or
disagree with it Apple what Bentley does
have these very broad reaching patty so
it appears is every other manufacturer
can't make a cell phone now because
apple owns a patent for the stuff and
it's crazy to think that really Apple
can perceive carte blanche into anybody
who makes any sort of power management
system with a camera or any unlock
screen on the phone or any of these
other myriad patents it's going to be
very interesting to see how this plays
out and see who comes HTC is defense you
know are we going to see Google get
behind their handset manufacturer are we
going to see Samsung rally behind HTC
we're going to see sort of a Apple
against the world's type of mentality
it's going to be very fun I could see
how this plays out what do you guys
think is going to happen think we're
going to see this have its day in court
was going to fall and drop away as an
apple just posturing you think these
patents double got a ridiculous they
have a right to defend them very curious
what you guys have to say anyway jon
rettinger from technobuffalo and i am
going to patent the youtube video I'll
see you next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
