special shade of pale so I figured
there's some sunshine out today I will
exit my Hubble and perhaps try and turn
this clear skin red because I don't tan
but in that vein which is not a smooth
transition thought I can't do some
questions we're getting a ton of
questions about things coming out things
are out and what you guys should do
about your devices so this isn't ask the
Buffalo like a lot of questions for for
this just clubs Louis Jordan ship s neon
a grain intend to switch it what games
like the sea border to the console I got
a great one probably should have gotten
eng soil so I don't lose it and I love
to see twilight princess part over so I
love me some zelda I'm gonna I'm gonna
Zelda kick tell him put a shut up she
can talk for way too long I get it
domenico Lombardi says you think 18 by
nine will take off we're 16 by 9 3 by 2
or 21 by nine enough it's a lot of a lot
of things by nine I haven't used a g6
though I do think the two to one i'm
going to call it to 21 is a form factor
that's really used but i think we'll see
a lot of devices da fast equation moving
forward dan Gillis former intern here as
we've seen a lot of s8 leaks what is one
thing you hope Samsung does not do it
the s8 please do not put the fingerprint
reader right next to the camera sensor
that's the one of the worst ideas that
I've heard and seen you're just gonna
have a smudgy camera sensor don't do it
samsung who dey gupta ass is it work to
wait for the rumor 2 1 plus 50 just by
the 3t instead I mean it's probably
rumored to one plus six at this point
the 3t already has six gigs of RAM in a
Snapdragon 820 one pretty much has two
more gigs around the g6 that just came
out if you don't need a higher res
screen I think you're pretty set with
the 3t BAM bride vanished s with
smartphones getting larger than quill
see a larger iphone this year yes
supposedly the rumors are 3 version of
the iphone 81 being a little bit larger
than what we have now Oh point one
inches larger five point eight inches so
yes ah phones getting bigger just like
my middle and just Dino ass pic three
phone companies you would stay with for
a good while minor LG huawei and Sony
Apple Samsung
LG if they can't pick Google generally
make their own phones those are my those
those three sounds like rapid-fire ask
the Buffalo like lightning around style
if you like the style let us know give
it a get a video a thumbs up we
appreciate it I did it these are all
comments so we're gonna skip comment to
the day today but if you wanna be
featured I've come in coming to the day
