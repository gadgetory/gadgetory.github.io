from TechnoBuffalo here back with
another tablet Wars Smackdown this time
we've got Apple's iPad 2 and the Asus
built EEP Pad Transformer sound effects
and fire and all that business is gonna
be popping up we are going to put these
two head-to-head in a six round test if
you read or saw my review on the e Pad
Transformer you'll know that I thought
it was hands-down the best Android
tablet on the market and if you saw my
review on the iPad 2 you'll know that it
is Mike's have a choice so as you'll be
looking forward to putting these two
guys head-to-head and see which one has
a permanent place in my bag or on my
couch or sometimes the car or anywhere
else that I or you might use a tablet
let's go ahead and get started
so there are obviously a ton of
different categories that we can cover
but I picked the six that were most
important to me we're gonna cover screen
speed browser apps OS and some
intangibles now if this has been a 40
minute video I would have covered things
like camera and keyboard
those are things unfortunately you're
going to have to experience for yourself
I will touch on them a little bit
throughout the comparison alright so
let's start with screens this is what
you're going to be looking at when you
are using your tablet the iPad 2 has a
nine point seven inch diagonal screen
with a resolution of 1024 by 768 and it
is an IPS display which can show 132 PPI
or pixels per inch
it's a beautiful display if you've ever
seen it graphics look beautiful on it
images are very pretty and stunning the
screen itself is really really gorgeous
you're gonna have some problem in your X
unlit as a problem with most tablets
you're gonna get a bit of that tablet
glare you can't sort of see it right
there I've got some sunlight coming in
but such is life with IPS displays next
let's take a look at the Asus Eee Pad
Transformer now usually when I compare
screens to Apple devices it is always a
blowout the screens of the resolution on
the Apple devices are generally higher
than what the competition has to offer
not true with the e Pad Transformer this
guy has a 10.1 inch so that's going to
be widescreen IPS display with a
resolution of 1280 by 800 so a higher
resolution and a viewing angle of 178
degrees now you're gonna have that same
problem in direct sunlight unfortunately
but the screen here is absolutely
beautiful it looks wonderful pictures
pop images are bright text is extremely
crisp the screen is just outstanding one
of the things that I really do like
about the e Pad Transformer is the fact
that since it is a 10.1 inch screen so
it's technically widescreen it changes
the aspect ratio meaning the big black
bars that you get when you
viewing videos on the iPad - you're not
going to get while viewing them on the
EP transformer at least not generally so
that was something that I really enjoyed
a screen is perfect in landscape mode
for watching video or in portrait for
reading text so if this is something
that was interesting to you and the
screen is important the screen on the
transformer is absolutely wonderful and
was an absolute pleasure to use and this
round clearly has to go to the
transformer alright so next up is raw
speed and both these guys are packing
similar horsepower apples a5 chip
dual-core 1 gigahertz on each core just
about seems to be clocked at the
transformer is using NVIDIA Tegra 2 of
one gigahertz on each core it's got a
gig of ram really is represents probably
the pinnacle at least for right now of
what tablets can offer from a hardware
perspective and you'll be happy to know
that both of these tablets are absolute
screamers so I read the comments almost
all of my videos when I do speed tests
often times people are telling me that
I've got applications running in the
background when it clear applications
then I'm told that perhaps applications
that were cleared should still be
running so this is just going to be a
general usage test of how fast both of
these are while leaving things open I've
got a live wallpaper here in the
background which I really kind of like
as you guys might have when using the
tablet both of these things really are
absolute screamers let's go ahead and
look at the browser for example so I've
got TechnoBuffalo open up on opened on
each and I will say the flash has been
turned off for right now on the e pad
transformer so plugins have been
disabled so if it's a browser speed is
very quick while scrolling no problem
I'm not getting any sort of checkerboard
pattern which you get on some other
devices and it pulls up the content
right away same thing here on the iPad
no issues pinch-to-zoom very fast
attention to zoom here which is really
one of those things where I think
Android has been a little bit laggy not
a problem at all really works just as
fast as anywhere else go ahead and can
imagine okay bad people saying push 7
look what he's doing but definitely
works just as quickly
application launch also just
Sam safar would go ahead and launch to
applications again there are things
running in the background this is just
general processes like if you were
sitting on your couch watching
application you're not going to close
everything before you open something
things here are both very quick so go
ahead and try and launch Angry Birds Rio
or there's close to at the same time
both of them kicked up pretty fast they
were both running suspended in the
background you can see boot up time was
very fast let's go ahead and watch two
different applications just for sort of
speed and giggles I'll go ahead and
launch let's say will earth here I can
get a sense of the speed and Google
Earth is a very processor intensive
application very process and process of
intensive and you can see how quickly
something like this works on the
transformer I mean very very very quick
go ahead and close that and even if you
look at something like say I'm moving
another graphically intensive
application on the iPad it looks just as
quickly as well and in all honesty in
everyday usage I know a lot of people
that are in the Android camp or the
Apple camp want to see their side be
faster and they want the metrics that
are going to show about prove it but in
all actuality in everyday usage just
people use the tablets both of these are
very fast very very very quick it's hard
to believe even you guys have heard me
probably talk about this in my review
that the transformer shares the same
components pretty much as a Motorola
Xoom the zoom I found slow and laggy
even after software updates where's the
transformer is very quick and really
enjoyable to use all ugh printed by that
beautiful screen so you can see even if
I like grabbing a camera you can see it
tracks my finger very quickly as I go
ahead and move around and all this is
with live wallpapers running in the
background so both are very very fast
and I am extremely happy to say that
this round is going to be a tie so
whether or not you want and iPad 2 or
they're not looking for a knee pad
transformer both of your options are
going to be very very speedy so we just
touched on a little bit but our next
category is going to be the browser I
web browsers are more than anything on
tablets just a bigger rousing experience
for me as necessary and this is one of
the ways that I really liked using both
of these so let's start the transformer
first I've got Flash content turned off
and that means I've got the option term
Flash content back on with Flash content
turned off everything as bad as quick as
you would expect from any other device
out there works very nicely content
loads extremely quickly
I'll go ahead and refresh TechnoBuffalo
you can see what that looks like it's
just a nice pleasant experience so if I
wanted to go ahead and turn flash
content back on let me show you what the
difference is so we'll go ahead and go
back into settings we'll go ahead and go
to advanced I'm doing all this on camera
so you can see it we'll go ahead and
enable plugins will touch those always
on that also enables a few other things
we'll go back I'm going to refresh the
page so I like the option of having a
choice to have Flash content shown or
not certainly no secret a lot of the web
is coded now in html5 which is going to
be fully compatible with the iPad and
most other web browsers but I like the
choice if I wanna see Flash content if I
want to watch a video on YouTube that
isn't in a YouTube player hasn't been
converted I like having that choice my
wife and I love to watch Animal Planet
videos and a lot of their stuff for
example isn't converted over yet so I
can go right to the Animal Planet's site
and I can watch the videos right from
here now you do get a little bit of
speed decrease when you have flash can't
flash popped it on you can see that
there but it's not bad and does work and
attempts to zooming is still there so
generally I leave flash off unless I
need it
having flash on definitely hurts a
battery so what's the point about
talking about flash you guess you guys
can guess this is all about consumer
choice so if you choose to turn flash
off you're gonna have almost exactly the
same browsing experience on both you
turn to hat or you choose to have flash
on you're going to have a choice on the
transformer I'll go ahead and show you
something with flash looks like we got
some flash content living here we'll go
to youtube you can see what that looks
like so it'll probably pull up the
mobile version at least you can get a
chance to check out you know what a
flash video would look like so let's go
ahead and launch one and go ahead and
play through it something
look likes and I was loading the video
this is actually not even launching
flash so here's this guy no he is let's
go a little go to my youtube channel you
can see what that looks like it's a
little back out of here back there we go
now let's check out youtube.com slash
John for Lakers
there we go came up right below John
Stuart which is kind of neat so this is
going to take you to the mobile version
we'll go ahead and show the desktop
version which is kind of nice and then
this will show you what Flash content is
going to look like at long last despite
my ramblings you'll be able to see it
here now on video it's not the most
pleasant experience it's gonna drain
your battery it can be a little bit
choppy but the video is definitely
viewable so we're gonna go ahead and
play you can see you get an option I'm
on a relatively fast Wi-Fi connection
and I are playing here's my unboxing of
the Xperia Play and it is playing it see
my finger you could definitely watch a
video you could export it to your TV
with the HDMI out if you have the cable
it just works and I like having the
choice whether or not I want to have
flash calling for off and that factor it
was a very long explanation but that's
why this round is going to go to the e
Pad Transformer alright so next let's
talk about applications apps are often
the things that make the device have
additional functionality apps or what I
use quite a bit outside of the browser
and something that I really am happy to
have very vibrant at ecosystems on
Android or on iOS certainly Apple's App
Store is tremendous is probably no point
rehashing it there are thousands of
applications available not only for the
tablet but also for the iPhone which can
be scaled up to double the resolution
and viewed or at least blown up rather
and played on the iPad or used on the
iPad to the Android Market has been
around for quite a bit but the tablets
out of Android Market has not been
around for that much longer or that long
so there are tablet apps but there
aren't that many and there aren't that
many applications in addition to tablets
that are meant to take advantage of the
processing power the Tegra 2
so there's aren't that many applications
now certainly something that's going to
be rectified as developers continue to
develop applications they get their
hands on the SDK a little bit longer and
they bring some of those things that
maybe we loved from an Android device or
from an iOS device get ported and
recoated over for tablets but at least
for right now there
not that many applications here
unfortunately that's one of the big
downsides of honeycomb it's a great
operating system but you're not going to
get the app support that you get with
Android so you can run older Android
applications but they scale a little bit
funny and the menu systems don't always
work so the Twitter application for
example can look a little bit weird you
have another App Store you've gotten
NVIDIA Tegra zone here which is going to
download applications or give you the
choice to download applications that are
meant to be optimized for the Tegra 2
processor and you were going to see some
gorgeous applications with really
immersive 3d X graphics that are running
at incredible clock speeds at frame
rates that just look really good so
that's gonna be another choice that
you're gonna have the NVIDIA Tegra zone
however just due to glut of applications
and this will change I'm sure as
honeycomb matures as a tablet OS but for
right now
Apple definitely has the edge with their
App Store when it comes to applications
so this round is going to swing right on
back to Apple now it's time for the
rounds that the fanboys love we're going
to talk about the operating system so
I'm gonna give you guys full disclosure
I make no secret VATS iOS and Apple
devices are generally what I choose to
carry with me the iPad 2 is my tablet of
choice and generally I find myself using
an Apple iPhone I have been extremely
encouraged with Android I like that
there is user customization I like that
you can make it your own you can tweak
it if you want to you don't have you
don't have to necessarily but there are
all kinds of things you can do with
Android that you can't do with iOS iOS
is very easy to learn pelican to use
it's very simple you could give it to 30
year old to know how to use it give it
to a five year old or an eight year old
the chances are they'd be able to figure
it out I really don't like the
notification system I've sort of ranted
on this quite a bit
it's a truce if it pops up with what
you're doing I think that Apple could do
a much better job I would like to have
the consumer choice to customize and
conferences
and with a stock obviously
non-jailbroken iOS you don't have that
options I can change the background sure
I can make folders if I want to but I'm
really limiting what I can do and right
on the other hand give you the
flexibility to do all those different
things that I like
I've got live wallpaper choices and this
is one from Asus that I don't know why
forever reason I really like if I don't
like the way things are looking here at
the icons I can change it if you're
using an Android phone you can change
the launcher very easily without any
hacking you can just download stuff from
the marketplace install them and
suddenly things are looking very
different uh honeycomb particular has an
awesome notification system it pops up
in sort of a growl esque style right in
the bottom right you can exit them out
and they are extremely unobtrusive again
you can customize whatever you want of
course you've got the widget choices so
here I've got some of the Asus widgets
that are being shown which I believe is
called the weight share UI which is some
nice tweaks I know you like having them
you can have this from a widget options
is in the background this one though is
all about consumer choice oftentimes
people prefer the ease and elegance of
the Apple iPad and some people like just
want a tablet that's gonna browse the
web and do what they needed to do some
people are gonna like to be able to
change the experience and customize it
for them and that's where honeycomb is
gonna offer a really nice experience
honeycomb definitely has a bit of a
higher learning curve I have never used
Android in the past or you not familiar
with it as you might be for other
operating systems there definitely is
going to be a little bit learning curve
but give it a day or two you won't have
any problems the OS round is most
definitely a tie-breaking very unique
things for very different people alright
so now let's talk about intangibles
because each of these guys bring some
very different things to the table let's
go ahead and start with the iPad first
it comes in 3G versions now isus is said
3G versions of the transformer will be
available at least for right now all you
can get is a Wi-Fi version you can get
smart covers which are sort of a fun
option to have there are a ton of
accessories available for the iPad
- you can get full Apple store support
if you're in Iran Apple store can happen
shirt advisor you can just go walk it in
and say fix it and they will fix it or
give you a new one if you're still in
warranty there are a ton of Bluetooth
Keyboard choices that you can get the
price point ranges from $4.99 all the
way up to 830
you can connect now to HDMI within a
separate cable and you have sort of a
lot of choices you can also customize
color between black and white and decide
to go 3d versions you have your choice
of carriers either eat EMT or Verizon
from an intangible standpoint there's
also a lot to like about the transformer
first is this dock that gives it the
transformer name as a keyboard dock and
I didn't mention this in the review it's
a hundred and forty nine dollar
accessory so it does add a bit of a
price premium to it you are gonna get
two USB ports and one on each side which
is going to be expandable you can go
ahead and plug in a USB thumb drive to
get access to those files if you have a
full size SD card slot you can almost
double your battery life up to 16 hours
there's the other USB port that we
talked about it's a little bit bulky and
it weighs quite a bit and I didn't
mention this as part of the review
because it's a separate cost and there
are Bluetooth keyboard options for the
iPad this is going to give you track
support however when you use the mouse
so you are gonna get a cursor on the
screen any decent sized keyboard so that
is one of the cannibals and things you
can get with the Asus Eee Pad
Transformer if you want to see this in
action be sure to check out my
transformer review so one of the
intangibles with this transformer
definitely has is price is going to come
in at 399 for the 16 gig model but
you're also going to have micro SD card
expansion which is quite nice go ahead
and plug in a card and suddenly you can
up that 16 gigabyte storage the keyboard
dock we talked about certainly is really
nice you're going to get Mouse support
as well so you will get that cursor as I
mentioned you get the openness of
Android which is a really nice and
tangible for a lot of people see me
rotating things around if you want to
tweak and customize your going to have
capability to do so cameras as well it's
certainly something that's another
intangible the 5 megapixel camera on
back and the 1.2 shooter on the front
conveniently located where your fingers
are not going to touch them you're also
going to have a Seuss's my cloud support
if you want to store files up in the
cloud
this one as well it's going to be
whether or not you're counting six or a
half-dozen both offer a lot of
intangibles and a really nice solid
devices of course the transformer also
has HDMI out a separate cable and really
is gonna come down to personal
preference this round once again is a
tough so we covered a lot of tablet
action let me recap it for you screen
went to the transformer for its larger
size higher resolution and just all
around pretty viewing angle speed both
were very quick and that was at I
browser went to the transformer for its
ability to play flash whether you want
it or not and when it's turned off you
get the same browser experience as the
iPad apps went to the iPad 2 for the app
store
the operating system was most definitely
a tie and the intangibles were most
definitely a tie this is the tablet that
I think Android folks have been waiting
for and deserving in the past whenever
anybody asked me what tablet they should
buy my answer was always the iPad 2 now
I knew they wouldn't be able to
customize it or tweak it but I knew
they'd get an experience that was quick
and would work for them however now I
cannot say pick up the iPad to think
that I owe it to everyone to give an
honest opinion I gotta say you need to
look at the e Pad Transformer if you are
looking to get a new tablet regardless
of whether or not you consider yourself
Android or Apple again it really doesn't
matter I'm an Apple guy I use an apple
to edit my videos doesn't mean I can't
like Android and I really really do like
what they do here and what Asus has done
in particular with their customized
sedation's and tweaks just at a really
nice job
so the transformer won this head-to-head
battle they had two victories - the
iPads won but moral is you can't go
wrong with either they're two of the
best tablets on the market I'm John
Rhett enger' from TechnoBuffalo and
in the next video so do you agree
disagree am i way off I know a lot of
you guys like to have your opinions on
Apple or Android backed up but the end
of the day you really do have two
wonderful choices for devices and in the
world just about and have a choice and
finding what's best for you so am i off
am i not off is something that you would
have liked to see me cover for next one
I got to sort of keep the categories
limited but I love to hear your feedback
I am going to be reading the comments
video got to be a little bit long but I
thought I deserved it I'm John Rhett
endure from TechnoBuffalo
and I'm going to see you finally or if
mate see you what you guys will see me
I'll talk to you at least in the next
video goodbye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
