wanted to give you a little tour of my
five favorite Android launchers so if
you've ever been curious about rooting
your phone but maybe our little bit
reserved about it and are not sure if
you want to actually do it you can try a
custom launcher for your Android device
that can customize the way that your
phone looks and feels without having to
go through the process of routing it
won't give you as many options as
rooting your phone and installing say
CyanogenMod on it but it does give you a
lot of customization options that are
fantastic so let's take a look at my top
5 Android launchers I want to make a
quick mention of the fact that any of
these launchers may have the same
features across them so for example this
is action launcher Pro and we have a
folder in our dock bar lots of feature
that's pretty standard across launchers
but if I mention it you can probably get
something like this in different
launchers that I mentioned what we're
looking at here is action launcher Pro
and their main features are they have
three quick buttons here we have Google
search this is a link to the Play Store
which is kind of fantastic I always like
having that right there for me and you
can also go into some settings here now
my favorite thing about the app drawer
is it's actually not a drawer anymore
it's just this quick swipe to the left
and there are all of your apps
you also have widgets available inside
this same drawer making it really easy
to customize your homescreen so right
now I just have a really simple clock on
the screen because I want to just show
you the features of each launcher next
up I'm going to go into something a
little bit more robust this is ADW
launcher so ADW launcher offers a few
different customization options for you
you can see our app drawer has been
moved right into here and we have this
beautiful sort of moving forward screen
for all of our apps it's really lovely
you can also set up and manage groups
you can manage your app so if you want
to uninstall something and we can also
go into our atw settings one of the
things that I really like about ADW
launcher
is if we were to go into our home screen
here in long press we actually get a
really quick ADW config so let's say we
wanted to add more than one single home
screen to our atw we can do that right
here we can add it to left or to the
right you can see we have many many
screens happening if we want to get rid
of the screen we can do that let's get
rid of a couple of these and you can see
you can also pin a screen to be your
main home screen when you press the home
button if we wanted to add widgets we
just go over to add and we have launched
or actions custom shortcuts new folders
widgets and regular shortcuts so it's a
really great way to customize your home
screen next up we're going to take a
look at Apex Launcher so here's Apex
Launcher you can see it's a little bit
different we have just a simple Google
search bar we also have a bar here that
is going to show us the status of our
home screen so we have this lovely blue
moving scroll here's our app drawer it's
pretty standard reminds us a lot of
stock Android you can go to downloaded
so if there's anything that you've
downloaded so if you only want to look
at things you've downloaded and nothing
that came pre-loaded on your device you
can come right in here and we also have
widgets available to us inside our app
drawer now if we also wanted to go ahead
and see what our app menu was we can do
a lot of different things we can
actually change the theme of this one so
I've downloaded a couple of themes this
neon pixels one we can actually choose
icon skin and wallpapers so let's go
ahead and apply that and now that we've
done that you can see it's changed our
wallpaper and we have these beautiful
neon skinned app icons which is really
cool and if they don't have their own
icon it will just wrap it in a lovely
little neon box there and then it will
put the regular app icon inside it next
up we're gonna look at Go launch or e.x
a go launcher is one of the more popular
app launchers in the Android store but
one of the things that go launcher does
is it makes your icons these beautiful
sort of pillow box icons if we go into
our app drawer we can actually see it's
done it to all of our icons and we can
also see what
running right at the tip of our finger
which is really fantastic I really enjoy
that and we also have our settings down
here so instead of having it up at the
top of the screen we have it a little
lower which can be a little bit
cumbersome for some people if they're
used to hitting the app drawer right at
the bottom middle of their screen but
there are plenty of options themes
everything that you could possibly want
you can see here's a bunch of different
themes that they have available so lots
of ways to customize with go launcher
and lastly we have something that's a
little bit different it's called smart
launchers so here is smart launcher you
can see it's very minimalistic there are
no other home screens available to you
and you have six icons that give you the
ability to launch different applications
so if we wanted to get rid of something
like let's say we don't really use music
a whole lot we can always trash it here
but if we wanted to add something
different we can always long press on
the screen click on the ad
and let's say well maybe okay we did
want music we can choose which app we
want it to launch by default so let's
say we really love play music so now you
can see it's added it to this lovely
circle and there are also other options
available to us if we wanted to utilize
that something interesting that smart
launcher does is it actually categorizes
your apps so they have communications
internet games media utility and
settings and this is actually really
quick so it's very responsive I really
enjoy the way that they have set
everything up but generally speaking
very simple easy to use and certainly
for the modern person who loves
minimalist design on their phone so that
is it for my favorite custom Android
launcher as you can see I have quite a
few of them installed on here I've got
six including HTC Sense but I just want
to remind you guys that a lot of these
have free trials so you can go right
into the Google Play Store try them out
and if you like them you can buy the pro
version or the paid version that will
unlock additional features I know there
are some like Nova Launcher that are
very very popular out there and I'd love
to hear your opinions on what you think
is the best Android launcher thanks guys
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
