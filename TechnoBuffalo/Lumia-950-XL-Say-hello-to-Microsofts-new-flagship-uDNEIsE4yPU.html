Hazleton from TechnoBuffalo I'm here in
New York City where Microsoft just
announced the Lumia 950 XL and the Lumia
950 we're looking here at the Lumia 950
XL it's got a 5.7 inch quad HD display
the first on Windows Phone from
Microsoft so nice and brilliant here you
can see it's running Windows 10 for
phones or whatever we want to call it at
this point but the focus here is going
to be on a lot of what this can phone
can do when it connects to different
things but let's go over some of the
features right here you're looking at
the 20 megapixel camera on the back
tripple LED flash so you don't look like
a ghost as like yourself said and up
front there's another five megapixel
camera and then of course the iris
scanner so you can actually unlock the
phone while you stare at the screen
it'll just sort of recognize who you are
and unlock it so no more long passwords
or fingerprint readers or stuff like
that on the bottom of the USBC port for
really fast charging on the right hand
side you have the power button volume
controlled keys and then of course on
the bottom there the dedicated camera
which is awesome
Windows 10 as we've seen it before
through a lot of the beta tests we've
dug through it and then you can look at
the polycarbonate body here it's plastic
it's very light in the hand it doesn't
feel like some of the aluminum flagships
we've had before but otherwise it's a
pretty good device well I'm just gonna
dive through the excel here if you
connect this to a device with the
Microsoft Hub now they'll actually let
you blow up the full version of Excel or
a word or whatever you have so that's
gonna be really awesome that's called
continuum right here on the back again
is checking out the camera it should be
really great in low-light situations
that's what Microsoft said and really
focused on the flash there - 20
megapixels otherwise I think this is
mainly what we've seen before in the
beta tests Microsoft's not ready to give
us a firm launch date or carrier
partners but pre-orders are gonna start
really soon so you'll be able to to
check it out we're really excited to see
what kind of app partners come along as
sort of where Microsoft has struggled in
the past with these devices but let's
just check out Cortana real quick this
is the voice assistant this sort of the
guide for you
it learns the news you you like or the
sports teams you follow and stuff like
that so it'll constantly
you up-to-date also across your PC as
well so and and your Microsoft ban and
Microsoft announced a new Microsoft and
today to you sir pretty sweet want to
give you a quick look here lumia 950xl
