TechnoBuffalo here is an unboxing of the
Microsoft Kinect for the Xbox 360 this
is the motion controlling sensor that's
been making a lot of headlines recently
you actually don't use any sort of
controller your body becomes the
controller I know it's a real polarizing
unboxing and the real polarizing subject
but I'm excited to dig in and because I
am a professional nerd I went to the
midnight launch of this guy it is just
past midnight right now on the fourth
which is launch day let's go ahead and
see what your 149 bucks it's gonna get
you alright so here is the Kinect and
this is going to be compatible with any
Xbox whether it's new Xbox to the old
Xboxes if you do have an older model
you're gonna have to actually use a USB
adapter and probably will have an
external power supply yeah when the
newer Xbox is all you gotta do is just
plug it into the Kinect adapter in the
back but any Xbox 360 will be compatible
so here is a picture of the Kinect
sensor it's black got a sweet little
cameras and it does come with Kinect
adventure so you can get your adventure
game on let's go for the new Xbox
branding another picture to connect on
the top a little bit more about it on
the back you are the controller we get
it tell you how far to stand back people
rocking out and some Kinect adventure
stuff and Kinect Sports go ahead and cut
the seal here we'll go ahead and bust
out senior stab OH
cut the plastic and see what this guy
looks like you've got a little bit of a
foam on top to protect your Kinect go
ahead and pull it out huh
alright so looks like the cords are
wrapped in this little cardboard sleeves
button see we can open this up there we
go go ahead and pull off this cardboard
here are the cords and actually it comes
with the adapters that you're going to
need
you have an older xbox360 let's go ahead
and push the box off to the side and
take a look so here is the Kinect it's
not that big it's got sort of those
three sort of ominous looking cameras a
glare back at you
it definitely matches the new console
the bottom is sort of a rubber footing
so it'll mount wherever you want they
also have an adapter we can mount it on
top of your television xbox 360 branding
you can see how thick it is right there
it's not terribly thick it's got some
vents on the side and the nothing on the
back let's take a look at how this guy
is going to connect your Xbox 360 so if
you have a newer Xbox model I think that
all you're going to do is just plug this
guy in I don't they're going to be any
adapter needed however if you do have
one of the older models and this is just
what I remember from the press
announcement it's going to come in this
adapter plug it in there plug this guy
into your USB port this one into a wall
and you are good to go I've had a lot of
people asking about setup now setup is
going to work so I will do a
demonstration of that as well I also
picked up Kinect Sports uh here as well
so I'll be sure doing demonstrations of
all these games and we're guys I'm going
to go ahead and set this bad boy up I am
John retinue from TechnoBuffalo
and I'll see you the next video goodbye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
