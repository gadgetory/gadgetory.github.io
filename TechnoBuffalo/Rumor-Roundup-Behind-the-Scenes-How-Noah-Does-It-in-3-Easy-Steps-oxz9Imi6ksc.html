to you by netflix when the lights are
off the glamour is gone and i haven't
found my razor in like three days what's
it really like behind the scenes of a
fabulous internet TV show named after an
animal that roams the plains find out
now it's rumor roundup behind the scenes
hey what is going on everybody and
welcome to a special behind-the-scenes
edition of rumor roundup technobuffalo
on revision3 this week's episode is
brought to you by our good friends at
netflix we thought you know what it's a
short week it's Thanksgiving week here
in the United States wherever you are in
the US somewhere else happy thanksgiving
or if you don't celebrate thanksgiving
just happy day to you i wish you and
yours nothing but peace prosperity and
happiness for the rest of this week in
all the weeks to come thank you for
watching us and supporting us and
hopefully enjoying us and more
importantly you know all the best to you
and yours so we thought you know it'd be
fun to go behind the scenes right and
last week I was lucky enough to shoot
revision3 in the rev3 studios in San
Francisco the crew there was awesome the
studio the facilities were great the
show came out looking great you know
John Q had super high quality footage to
work with did a great job in
post-production as he always does and
the result was awesome so we thought
this week you know what let's go the
other way and show you what it's really
like here where I shoot the show in the
techno Buffalo North offices ie my home
office here in Oakland California and
now first things first when I get ready
to shoot the show on a normal week there
are three things that I usually do that
I'm not doing right now can you guess
what they are number one shave the beard
well I guess I don't always shave it but
if it's this long usually I'll shave it
a more vain about the top of my head
that might beard for some reason number
two clean off the workspace but I want
to show you what it's really like when
I'm putting the show together all right
so normally when I'm shooting the show
the background does not look this messy
they want the stuff to look nice because
after all it is TV on the internet but
just to show you what it's like usually
when I'm working coffeecup speakers
broken mac old USB enclosures more
speakers in the background lucky bamboo
of course there's the monitor there's
the Mac there's the power drill which
really I'm not that handy of a guy I was
just you in the using the power drill
because I don't actually have a Torx
screwdriver maybe you can see there will
zoom in I've got the Torx bit into the
power drill
because that's the only torque
screwdriver i have i have no geek cred
because i don't even have a proper
computer disassembly screwdriver set but
i was using that to take apart the apple
TV i got my new business cards over
there excited about that and of course
i've got a few review phones that need
to go back thanks HTC and nokia for
lending letting those to me i'm sending
them back right now I promise some
rechargeable batteries and my magic
weapon for all things video the elgato
turbo 264 HD USB dongle tell you what if

we sent you number three change out of
sweats I usually don't shoot the show in
sweats unless I'm shooting the show
wearing a hoodie because hoodies are
part of the tech hipster meme cool thing
even though i don't think i'm a hipster
or all that cool but I you know what
today I went for a run this morning I'm
still kind of kicking it in the sweat
where am I TechnoBuffalo sweatshirt
though new techno Buffalo gear coming
for the new year we're going to be
giving the proceeds away to charity so
check out TechnoBuffalo icon for more on
that that'll be pretty cool excited
about that but this is a this is the
half mock turtle zip neck sweatshirt
Lisa Rama with the TB logo on it the old
logo so I'm rocking that one for the
show here on the desk behind me the
computer set up thanks to my man glenn
from lending me his old apple monitor
which looks really cool and you know he
line it to me so she starts it's not
your mother's famous Glen otherwise you
know the computer setup in the
background we get the big TechnoBuffalo
wallpaper go in there when we do the
show and you know on a normal day I'll
come in you can see my coffee cup you
can see on my gear scatter around I've
got the stuff from the 20-hour mac
project which you should go check out on
technobuffalo here interested i took an
apple TV i got for twenty dollars off of
craigslist and turned it in to an OS 10
leopard mac it's fully functional the
performance isn't good enough to be used
as in every day Mac I'm using it as an
iTunes server and it works just great
thumbs up to check that out if you will
but anyway how does the show actually
come together well it's pretty simple
but it involves large data files
traveling over miles and miles and miles
of ether and a lot of magic from John Q
and post-production let's check it out
all right once the footage is shot I
loaded up into iMovie I use iMovie for
editing basically because it's cheap and
it's easy honestly you know what for all
the whiz-bang stuff is great when you
need it to go whiz-bang but if you're
like me and you're for John Q he needs a
more professional caliber editing tool
for me basically we want to keep myself
out of my own way I don't want to do
damage I just want to edit the footage
you know get the story together and
leave the color correction the
retouching all that stuff to the pros so
I use iMovie it's fast it's cheap it's
easy and I can't do much do too much
harm with it so here's the footage from
the November fourth episode of rumor
roundup when I was in the TechnoBuffalo
main offices down in Irvine California
so I've got my project down here you can
see the lookout a professional and
they're getting in the way the camera
got stuff on my arm terrific and so I
put it all together my export it using
like I said the secret weapon the elgato
264 HD it starts to export I go fill up
my coffee while waiting for a text we're
actually no wallet exporting i usually
do other work and once it's done
exporting i put her in the TechnoBuffalo
dropbox folder basically dropbox is a
neat little utility you can use to send
files across the interweb to people
large files
I usually these files are pretty big if
I go to the the November 11th episode
734 megabytes and menza get the files
over to John like I said then he does
the magic he makes him look prettier
sound prettier and that adds all the
titles animations and product shots to
make them look a little more fashion all
notes are a vital part of the production
process they give John Q notes to edit
from and they give the folks at our
revision3 the text that they need to use
to put on the website the meta info if
you will the descriptive info that goes
with the show so this week rue around up
behind the scenes once these are all
saved send into John Q along with the
file footage and the rest is what we
like to call the John Q magic alright
and so there you go it's a little
behind-the-scenes look at how rumor
roundup comes together and you know next
time you watch the show appreciate all
the effort I had to put into cleaning up
all my junk off of the desk so you could
have a nice clean studio set for rumor
roundup maybe I should shoot in the rev3
studio more often hmm have to check in
with the folks there in the meantime
thanks again to everybody for watching
thanks to netflix for sponsoring thanks
to rev 3 for having us three times a
week and as always thanks to John watch
for making my videos look way better
than I ever could till next time happy
Thanksgiving happy holidays everybody we
will see you for the home stretch the
month known as December which is crazy
crazy land in holiday electronic
shopping gift-giving extravaganza mode
getting tired just thinking about it I'm
gonna see if there any turkey leftovers
bye bye
