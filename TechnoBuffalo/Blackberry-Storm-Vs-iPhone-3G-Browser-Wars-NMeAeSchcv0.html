lakers calm here with a full browser
comparison for you of the blackberry
storm any iphone 3g i load several
different webpages comparing the 3g
speeds i also turn on the Wi-Fi and
compare Wi-Fi versus verizon's evdo
networks who really can get a sense of
how fast the phone is and what the
browsers actually look like on the
device little more in depth than I went
into in my first comparison video so
hope you guys enjoy and I will see you
in the next one bye alright guys so I've
got five bars of a video service on the
storm and I've got four bars of 3g
service on the iphone 3g so there should
be a very fair comparison as far as
browser speed to go memories been
cleared out of both phones let's go
ahead and get started I've got cnet com
cued up on both of these let's go ahead
and hit go and see how they do see
that's a fairly intensive site so it
should be a relatively fair competition
here all right they're both off
the iphones got some text up their first
let's play up a mobile version of cnet
and the storm is still going still
running scripts see it pulls up the full
version or the mobile version pulled up
the full version so I guess that would
be to the storms credit here that it's
noticing that the browser is capable of
a full website viewing and it's just
about done so the iphone sending out a
mobile signal the storm is sending out a
full web page signal let's go ahead and
try a new website let's try John for
lakers calm open that up on each
all right type it in here on the storm
keep what'll pop up all right so there
it is here it is here let's go ahead and
give them both the shot and they're both
off and they should pull up a full
website version of each appears if the
storm has a little bit of an early lead
here looks like it's three quarters of
the way done oh it out looks like the
iphones pulling up the text so go ahead
and let you guys see how that works it
looks like the iphone is almost done
alright the iphone just finished up and
the storm is still loading and this page
is both web friendly and mobile friendly
so they both have an equal shot here too
to load it up pretty equally alright so
just finished up and it appears the
block the iphone was quite faster let's
try one more site for comparison let's
try and gadget load that up here on the
storm
all right calm so we're set there go
ahead and load it up here I've got it
cued up in bookmarks and let's go ahead
and get started and we're off on both I
know a lot of people were concerned
about the browser so it looks like the
storm pulled up a mobile version of
engadget and did it quite quickly
whereas the iphone is loading the full
HTML version just as you would see on a
main web page so it looks like your
browsing experience is definitely going
to vary by phone sometimes you pull up a
mobile version sometimes you won't so
it's really gonna have to depend on what
your preference is posed for devices
they both do seem relatively quick so
the iphone 3g has Wi-Fi the blackberry
storm does not rely solely on verizon
evdo network so let me give you guys a
comparison of what you're losing with
Wi-Fi i'm going to turn Wi-Fi on the
iphone 3g on i'll do all this in real
time for you and i'll load up a site
that will load equally on both turn
Wi-Fi on okay so now we are connected to
my Wi-Fi network here so I didn't try
loading a site that loaded up equally on
both will try John for Lakers again and
we'll see what the comparison that speed
tests are it's a pretty simple site so
we got it right there we've had it right
here and this is with the iphone on
Wi-Fi and the blackberry storm just on
full strength evdo network so it's
almost done on Wi-Fi already and still
loading on the storm so it's done on the
iphone and now it's still still going on
the storm so you do see that you are
losing a significant amount of speed
without having Wi-Fi well I have been
very impressed with verizon z video
network certainly does not compare to
the speed of of Wi-Fi so guys hope you
enjoyed real quick browser test of the
blackberry storm in the iphone 3g for
more information be sure to check out
the website as you guys can see right
here john for lakers calm and if you
want some
exclusive content be sure to follow me

for lakers see you guys in the next
video bye-bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
