from TechnoBuffalo here at the full
review for you of Google's new flagship
handset the Nexus S let's go ahead and
see if it lives up to its heritage so
the Nexus S is a follow up to one of the
best handsets of 2010 the Nexus One so
this guy has very big shoes to fill the
news here is that it was the first phone
shipping with the newest build of
Android 2.3 you may have heard that by
the Tastee name of Gingerbread so Before
we jump into the review let me remind
you of the specs of this guy so it's
running a 1 gigahertz cortex a8
hummingbird processor same processor
that we've seen powering the Galaxy S
series of devices and Galaxy Tab is a
very capable processor really is quite
fast it's got 16 gigs of internal
storage curiously there's no microSD
storage here so leave your cards at home
it's got a 5 megapixel camera on the
back with autofocus it's got a 4 inch
Super AMOLED screen right here which is
measured diagonally with a resolution of
480 by 800 that Super AMOLED is going to
give you darker blacks and seen any of
you brighter colors and better
visibility in direct sunlight and is
also going to give you a bit of a bluish
tint which we'll talk about when we get
to the screen in a few moments and all
that is sitting on top of 512 megabytes
of RAM so specs and all that aside if
this thing's not going to make good
phone calls I thought can be of much use
to you as a phone so it is an unlocked
device which has support for t-mobile's
3G network in a tnt's Edge network it
does not have support for t-mobile's
HSDPA plus which is what they're calling
4G so I tested this on both t-mobile and
AT&amp;amp;T
that's the opponent very strong signal
strength with both networks certainly 3G
with t-mobile and edge with AT&amp;amp;T much
like the galaxy guest the radio in here
was very strong and I was able to get
full bars of service anywhere I went in
Southern California it might not be best
representative of what serves is going
to be in your area
but at least where I am was able to plan
a pretty strong signal especially
compared to other devices and my 20 call
test I did 10 on t-mobile and 10 on AT&amp;amp;T
I had to drop calls on t-mobile which is
relatively atypical and no drop calls on
AT&amp;amp;T speakerphone volume was average so
if you rely on speakerphone pretty
heavily isn't gonna be the loudest
speakerphone on the planet but it's
going to be decent enough all right so
now let's jump into the phone and let's
talk about what's new here with the
outgoing Nexus One or versus the
outgoing Nexus One so what we're gonna
see the big difference is the inclusion
of gingerbread which is the newest build
of Android as I mentioned that brings
with it a slew of new features now I did
an overview of Gingerbread going over
all the things that are new so I'm gonna
sort of touch on some of those points if
you want a full recap the link to that
big is gonna be down below so you're
gonna know there's a few graphical
changes here with the phone the icons at
the bottom now have color they've got
that green tint similar to the android
logo same thing here for the menu bar
the battery indicator has been sort of
turned on its side but the big news here
is third-party ap is and how 3d graphics
are going to be rendered this phone
really is very capable of handling a
vast amount of 3d graphic and she's
gonna give you much better in-game
performance so you might not see this
performance right now but as developers
get access to these new ap is this phone
in particular and phones that are going
to be running Gingerbread are going to
have much much much better graphics able
to take advantage of the processor and
graphics capabilities of the phone so
this is a slate device so it doesn't
have any sort of physical keyboard to
rely obviously very heavily on an
on-screen keyboard so we go ahead and
show you this real quickly it's
something that's new with Gingerbread
this keyboard certainly in my opinion
Android had a very nice keyboard before
Google has really improved that with
this version so it looks a little bit
different you've got spaces between the
keys which is quite nice the
unresponsiveness is fantastic if you
like typing on an android keyboard
before is it going to be an even better
experience and certainly being Android
and being open if y'all can to put on a
ton of third-party keyboards you also
have the voice recognition
and the speech-to-text options here so a
keyboard input on this device is
absolutely fantastic one of the things I
found really impressive with the phone
and that's really true with most Galaxy
S series of devices is the speed of the
phone now I think that's really able to
be tested in short of the prowess of the
phone and a very intensive application
like Google Earth so this is quite
processor taxing and graphically taxing
as well in my Nexus S versus Nexus One I
did sort of a versus and I showed Google
Earth been used here this is actually
one of the smoothest implementations at
Google Earth I've seen on a mobile phone
I really without any lag or delays so
this is not only doing some 3d
processing but it's also got a pulling a
lot of information that is now connected
to Wi-Fi and as you sort of zoom in it's
very very very quick and that same thing
can sort of translate over to the
browser as well certainly if you're an
Android user chances are you want to
take advantage of the fantastic browser
with this of course capable of Flash
10.1 you can turn that off if you don't
want to consume the extra battery life
but it does work very well here and
pitch to zoom obviously it says
multi-touch supported works very very
nicely on the device you can see some
flash content going on here certainly
turning that off is also going to
increase the speed of the device we also
brings to the table here a new YouTube
player and a new application store or a
new Android Market rather all that stuff
is available on older Android devices
some of the first times that we've seen
it however though are on here on the
Nexus S let's go ahead and jump back
home and let's talk a bit about this
screen and to do so let me go ahead and
pull up some pictures to give you an
example is what this is gonna look like
let's jump into wallpapers for example
when we go ahead and check out some of
the wallpapers here now maybe hard to
translate on camera but looking at some
images looks like at a very green image
and this is sort of going to be
representative review of a Super AMOLED
screen as a whole go ahead and go to a
new screen pictures look beautiful
colors really pop the resolution may not
be the highest at 480 by 800 but it's
very very very sharp images and very
readable text the one not that I've had
Super AMOLED screens versus regular
screens regular mbola technology over it
might be is that they do give a little
bit of a bluish kind of gray cast when
you look at white backgrounds so if we
jump back to this website which is
TechnoBuffalo you'll see in the text go
ahead and try and hit that the text does
look at least the background which is
supposed to be white it does have a
little bit of a tint to it now it's
nothing that's gonna detract from the
experience and you really don't notice
unless you have two phones next to each
other so that's gonna be a trade off but
not you can deal with that little bit of
a tint for the very very sharp picture
quality you're going to get and the
really nice texture you're gonna get as
well if i zoom in right there on text
you can see how crisp and how sharp it
is which is really important at least
for me if you've read a lot of websites
you do a lot of reading on your phone
you want the text to be nice and sharp
so the tint doesn't always bother me
sometimes I do notice it but I do test a
lot of phones and I see them next to
each other so that may be just a matter
of personal preference but something to
keep in mind one of the knocks I had on
the previous Nexus device the Nexus One
our the capacitive buttons at the bottom
I went on and on and on about how
unresponsive those capacitive buttons
were on the Nexus One on the Nexus S
that has definitely been remedied these
are very responsive two capacitive
buttons they might as well just be
physical buttons here at the bottom they
work very well and they work as
advertised so one of the concerns people
have been having with the Nexus S is
build quality Samsung has whether it's
justified or not a reputation for maybe
not the most industrial build quality of
phones so the Nexus S the back of it is
plastic and is a fingerprint magnet of
plastic but it does have a nice build
quality to it it's got the sort of
reverse chin the reverse hump and the
phone does feel very nice in the hand
the 4-inch screen I think really is a
sweet spot if you're worried about build
quality and certainly what you're
comparing that to is probably going to
be a more industrial feeling device here
like the Nexus One which has a lot of
metals to it you're not going to get
that in the Nexus S this is a mostly
plastic device which does take away a
bit from the premium of the phone and
this really is a very fast very capable
phone perhaps one of the
fastest most capable phones on the
market depending what your OS preference
is going to be camera wise looks just
like it expects from a 5 megapixel
camera it's nothing outstanding it's not
nothing that's gonna replace your
point-and-shoot or your DSLR that I can
be taking Ansel Adams's like pictures on
this thing and blowing them up to fill
up a wall or anything but if you want to
snap pictures of your friends out party
this is definitely gonna be a fine
camera the flash washes images out but
it's nothing terribly bad or even
terribly good for that matter the big
news here again sort of recapping this
whole thing is Android 2.3 it does adds
a lot of different niceties some of the
other features that it adds very quickly
and I'll wrap this up you now have a
full application management from inside
the operating system so if I hit menu
you can now manage apps right from there
if I go ahead and jump into settings for
example or any list you're gonna get
some nice graphical cues here so at the
top you see that little sort of yellow
bar that comes loose you know you're at
the end of a list just very nice and
you'll see Android 2.3 which brings a
lot of these features start to trickle
down to older Android handsets we've
already seen unofficial build for a lot
of phones and presumably we'll start
seeing official builds for a lot of
phones so if you want to taste the
gingerbread you're currently rocking
some Froyo
or even an earlier build of Android stay
tuned because hopefully you will get
your taste of the dessert so in
conclusion on a one to five scale the
Nexus S is a really really capable phone
a one that I could see definitely using
as a daily driver it's got a gorgeous
screen it's very fast really capable and
is probably one of the best Android
phones out on the market and it's
unadulterated Android there isn't any
skin on top of this so whether you like
it or don't like that doesn't that touch
worth it doesn't have HTC Sense uh it's
just soft Android as Google built it so
maybe you're getting some speed
increases by not having a skin on top
who knows
in my vs. video I ran a quadrant speed
test which is a sort of an arbitrary way
I guess to evaluate the performance of a
phone and
well actually got the top of all the
Android phones that had been tested so
this thing really is capable it does a
very nice job it's unlocked so bring
your own SIM card not going to type into
a contract well you can get it on
contract through t-mobile turn 18 chief
customer just remember that you're gonna
be limited to only edge speeds there
guys so on a one to five scale I give
this and I haven't given many five-star
reviews this one definitely gets a
five-star if you're an Android fan are
looking to get into the open-source
operating system and you don't currently
have a phone this is going to be a great
choice for you
I wouldn't necessarily run to upgrade
from a Nexus One or a Galaxy S type
phone but if you're using an older
Android phone or a flip phone you want
to get into the smartphone market this
is going to be a fantastic choice for
you guys I'm John reticent TechnoBuffalo
