to you by lynda.com what's up everyone
John render from TechnoBuffalo here it's
been about two years since I last ditto
what's on my phone and apps have changed
woods have changed and I've got a more
sleek customizable home screen now on my
Android devices I've got a chair with
you show you what apps I have you can
tell me what happens you've got on your
phone we could share pictures of home
screens and sort of find the best thing
that's gonna work so let's go ahead and
dive right in so I'm not sure when you
guys are gonna watch this video but it's
being filmed in August of 2014 and I'm
using the oneplus one for this running
CyanogenMod 11 or customized version of
CyanogenMod 11 just for this phone so
some things might be different what you
guys have when your Android device so
the first thing about the oneplus one is
it has capacitive buttons down below
gives you the option to also use sort of
on-screen buttons I chose to use
on-screen buttons here we'll talk about
them a little bit but they look like
Android L but I'm not running Android L
on here so cyanogen ships with something
called a trebuchet launcher you can
always customize your launchers on
Android it's fine it's usable when I
liked it but what I really liked about
the Nexus 5 I was using was ability to
swipe over to the left and get access to
Google now I really just liked having
that so I installed the Google now
launcher now before I had to go and find
the apk and kind of side loaded on but
now Google made it available to a ton
more devices you can actually download
it for a lot of phones out directly from
Google Play I definitely recommend it so
when I was at Google i/o they showed a
nexus 5 up on their big projector screen
that looked like this it had a row of
icons down the side and then served the
launcher icons down the bottom and the
dock and I loved the way that look that
looked really clean and slick and modern
great before I handed you so I did the
same thing I always keep a Google search
bar across the top with the Google now
launcher I get the ability to say okay
Google use tonight and yell into the
microphone and they'll let me start
doing the searching from there so I did
a row of icons down the side my wife is
at the top because I call her a lot the
dial is that I called the most my family
and such all of my social media I put in
the social folder so Talon is what I use
for Twitter actually I crowdsource that
I went to Twitter and I asked what do
you guys recommend for Twitter use for
Android people really
recommended talent I've absolutely loved
it so if you haven't tried to give it a
shot it's a couple bucks Instagram and
LinkedIn and then just a camera app that
ships with cyanogen if we go into the
actually let's go to the next train
usually in this big space I've got some
analytic stuff for the site I just
removed that for this video I've got a
profile lock switch right there so I can
control you know whether it's on ring or
vibrate torch for the flashlight in the
back although with cyanogen you can do
some motion you can do a V on the lock
screen to turn the flashlight on but I
kept doing that by accident I use you
mail for a visual voicemail it works
really really well
so cyanogen ships with its own gallery
app I'll sort of show you real fast here
what that icon looks like it's right
down there it's called gallery I really
didn't like the way it was laid out so I
downloaded Nexus gallery what that looks
like is essentially the way an gallery
looks like on a Nexus device it was just
much easier for me to use that's my
that's my son Nate so I chose that to
use for my gallery calendars with ship
stock settings a stock Play Store Marvel
Comics I'm not gonna lie I like to read
a comic every now and then so I've got
that installed on here let's go ahead
and jump into apps real fast I don't
have that many on here I tried to kind
of simplify my Apple I fear what I've
got on the phone analytics widget that's
what I use for checking analytics next
I've got Audio FX this comes with the
phone to sort of customize how the audio
works depending on you've got small
speakers you can choose different
profiles small speakers electronic or
custom I've honestly never opened that
up at a second time I've ever opened it
up battery widget evolved sort of shows
that thing up there too as much bad here
I have and gives you some stuff to when
you pull this down it'll show you some
things in the drop down menu if you want
it to I disabled I just like to see how
much battery percentage that I've got
calculator is all standard camera
standard the chase for banking of course
I use Chrome o'clock downloads drive all
comes here Dropbox Dropcam used drop
Kempton the opposite at home eBay the
default Google email app I like a
unified inbox so I don't use Gmail and
so I think the email app is great on the
past I've used things like k9 mail and
such but I always prefer email Facebook
file manager this comes on sign is lets
you navigate to where you want to go
Flixster for movies there's a cyanogen
gallery which i was not a big
fan of another analytics app everything
else you've kind of seen Google keep for
notes and other analytics app again
Marvel Comics my backup Pro is what I
use when I switch devices makes things a
lot easier for sort of backing up all of
your things so now you can pick what you
want to migrate over to another device
you can pick things I'll show you what
you can do here applications in media or
data and you can pick sort of a ton of
stuff and move all your app so if your
photos and music your videos and makes
it much easier to switch on Android
devices because there's sort of a
universal backup so that's been a big
thing for me we stopped for a quick sec

back to the video nest I've got a nest
thermostat at home he has already saw
the Nexus gallery pebble from a pebble
phone people photos nothing else really
exciting there everything else I think
you've seen does come a screencast
antigen model 11 which is really cool
it's you record your screen with audio
play memories I've got a Sony rx100 mark
two point-and-shoot camera it looks
magnetic you transfer pictures from the
camera right to the phone that sort of
Sony's own app speedtest.net that's sort
of the new speed test icon at least for
my theme pack and I'll show you guys the
themes in a little bit we've got test
slaps or the themes we can buy more
themes I am addicted to threes I play
that quite a bit
uber wanna want to call a car USAA for
insurance Google Wallet and whatsapp all
that stuff you should know whisper is
kind of a crazy out the idea behind
whisper app is lets you sort of
anonymously whisper things and through
just fun to go didn't read with people
our anonymously
confessing or not confessing so we'll go
ahead and go back please go home go back
into settings and that's pretty much all
the apps that I have I can I try to sort
of simplify my app world and then just
YouTube stuff so I talked about themes
something you do cyanogen you could pick
different theme packs make a look
sort of
different so I'll jump into settings and
I'll show you the theme that I am using
what sort of you can do with theme so go
to themes right here theme pack you can
buy it with impact some are free heck so
is a default one the chips I bought an
Android L one but it's kind of unstable
when I'm using right now I've got an LG
g3 one two because I really loved the g3
so you can sort of make the phone look
like an lg g3
this one it's called my antigen I really
just wanted the Android L sort of soft
buttons down there so that kind of gave
me that when you select when you can
pick really anything you want to have
style wallpaper you know fun booby
animations ringtones kind of anything
you want it's really cool to have the
power it's customized absolutely
everything in here the way settings look
so you can pick you know with the way
your settings gonna look if you pick the
LG g3 one's gonna look like LG when
you're coming here it just really could
have all the customization options that
you get with cyanogen
the last thing that I got to show you
guys is my lockscreen that usually did
customizable lock screens I did not do
that with the oneplus I like to turn the
luxury that it came with this is I think
it's a custom one
cyanogen did for the oneplus you have to
pull down to unlock but it does show you
notifications right here in battery life
and whether you can slide over to get to
the camera so this time I've got my
phone set up I tried to simplify the
apps I'd download the track don't
download the ones that I use I don't
really want a cluttered home trailer I
want them really really simple serve and
you're giving the ability to sort of do
that put icons just down the right-hand
side and curry buddy yells can do that
on on iOS I know you can do that if you
jailbreak I'll do another video showing
you how I've set up my iOS devices what
apps I've got on there as well I've got
a few more apps on the iOS side if you
want to see that let me know but the
apps do you think that I need to have or
try instead please leave the comments

what you guys to use I learn a lot about
what apps to try just based on what you

thoughts leave them down below until
