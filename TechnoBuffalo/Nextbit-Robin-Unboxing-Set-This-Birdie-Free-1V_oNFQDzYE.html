protecting a buffalo and I got pretty
tired of doing unboxings I know it seems
weird but so weird thing to do to just
sit there take things out of a box and
keep talking until you're done so I
figured why not just cut the fat and
show you guys what you came here to see
here's the contents of the box for the
next bit Robin and that's obviously the
next bit Robin right in front of you
real quick while we're looking at it
those are the LEDs around the back of
the device that'll let you know those
four little dots when something is
backing up or restoring from the next
bit cloud the device is really really
striking I also just want to get this
out of the way really quick
this is reviewer packaging this isn't
the production packaging they're not
sending wooden boxes to everybody but as
you can see what we got in the box was
the Robin itself that you see adapter
USB cable a little figurine and two
cases to continue along with the visual
tour the device we're looking at USB see
at the bottom a little microphone there
and that's actually a little charging
led at the bottom don't know if it works
for notifications just yet along the
side you can see that greenish button
there this is the mint color scheme so I
guess that mint button above the SIM
tray that's actually a fingerprint
reader and I've really really enjoyed
the placement of it so far I really like
it don't it seems to work really really
well those rounded elements are really
really striking aren't they those two
round pieces are both speakers
front-facing speakers which is really
nice and both lenses all the flash all
that stuff all the sensors are all very
round it's actually a really cool cool
feel especially with the contrast of
such a sort of boxy device but it feels
fantastic in the hand I gotta say what
we're looking at underneath the hood is
a Snapdragon 808 three gigs of ram 32
gigs of storage onboard and that's a
hundred extra gigs online with the next
bit cloud as well the camera is 5
megapixels on the front-facing 13 on the
back that got face detection autofocus
at 2680 milliamp power battery and that
screen is an IPS LCD display at 1080
gotta admit I am amped about this phone
it's it takes a lot to get me excited
about phones these days and this one is
doing it so I can't wait to really put
it through its paces if you guys are
interested in the the Robin review be
sure to let me know in the comments if
there's anything that you want to make
sure that I cover please
you let me know otherwise thank you guys
so much for watching hope you enjoyed
this quick little unboxing be kind of
one another and I'll catch you the next
video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
