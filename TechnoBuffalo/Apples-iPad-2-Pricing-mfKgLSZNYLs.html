to you by Linda what's up everyone
welcome back their pursuit of or
Ettinger's rants I'm host John Ritter we
have had a chance to talk and rent since
Apple's iPad event last week but this
seems like a really good time what the
hell's with the $400 iPad 2 was written
just ran gonna get started
the last week Apple unveiled
I think the pretty awesome thus far iPad
air and iPad Mini has read in this plane
they looked awesome they got little
price increases going to $500 or the air
and 400 for the iPad Mini with Retina
alright I can understand it I don't like
it I can get behind it I've been a big
fan of the iPad I've gone back and forth
on my love or hate with iOS on a phone I
really haven't used an iPhone very much
in the past year so but I do always
enjoy an iPad I sort of under like
between using an iPad or a surface pro
for my tablet needs depending on what
I'm doing so I do have a soft spot in my
heart for the iPad and then Apple took
the stage and they're like hey guys by
the way you can buy the iPad 2 I was
like alright this is gonna be a super
dis kind of $1.99 people could finally
get into Apple's ecosystem they can make
up any money if they're even losing it
on the app purchase but no they threw a
but we're a hundred dollar price tag on
it 399 to be fair be forever buddy
cracks me in the comments it seems
absolutely asinine even more asinine and
iPad Mini is staying at 300 bucks as
well so if you're doing the math
correctly an iPad 2 which is about two
and a half three year-old Hardware can
be had for eight hundred dollars less
than the brand new iPad air and I'm not
saying hundred bucks is a lot of money
but give me a freaking break that seems
absolutely ridiculous so the good news I
suppose is that all the iPad twos out
there are suddenly worth way more money
in fact we are using an iPad 2 as a
teleprompter and it's now a really
expensive teleprompter this move by
Apple makes no sense now maybe they did
it give the components the same the iPad
2 and the iPad Mini sort of share the
same parts I can sort of see that but if
they do share the same parts that
reduces the supply chains that would
reduce operations which should reduce
costs which is clearly not being put out
to the consumer
apples long been chastised for having an
Apple tax the products usually come with
a premium and there's sometimes you can
defend it sometimes you're not this time
there's very little defense the pricing
is even more ridiculous when you factor
in how much the really awesome and
gorgeous Nexus 7 cost the Kindle Fire
HDX the surface to even a surface pro 2
price seems absolutely asinine what was
Apple thinking with this it makes
absolutely no sense to me at all
heading to the holiday shopping season
people buying a ton of products I can't
imagine anybody wanting an Apple store
being like hey that three year old piece
of hardware 400 ollar seems like a super
good steal let me take seven
it is beyond fathoming I can't
understand it what do you do at Apple
if I'm missing something here please let
me know you figure Apple would sell it
for coffee and below costs make the
money back on the app sales but
absolutely not in this case it just it
is mind-boggling it's the same thing
with the iPhone 5s they dropped the
iPhone 5 and they sort of kept the
iPhone 4s but they made it free on
contract so I can sort of wrap my head
around that
what the hell with the iPads you know
just kind of all if you buy a carrier
version you're still paying that
ridiculous price for it let me interrupt
the video for a minute to only exhale
but thank our friends at lynda.com they

follow video tutorials taught to you by

more if we thought to yourself self I

comment down below am i way off with my
