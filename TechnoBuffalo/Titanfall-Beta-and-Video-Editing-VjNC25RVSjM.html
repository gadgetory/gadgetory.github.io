to you by Linda calm hello internet and
welcome back to another episode of ask
the Buffalo the show where you can ask
me Ashley's gather any question you
might have for the wide world of
technology every tuesday we put up a
call for questions on technobuffalo calm
you can leave your question in the post
comments otherwise send one to me
anytime of the day or night on twitter
at technobuffalo or at Ashley ask ever
just use the hashtag ask the be so I can
see it usually answer around four
questions every episode so let's get
answering because this is ask the
Buffalo will asks hi Ashley I own a late
2013 macbook air 13-inch and I am
getting into the YouTube world find me
at everything tech 131 what software do
you advise me to get for video editorial
and special effects i already own I
movie on my Mac love the site and shows
well we'll congrats on your YouTube
channel and I love your shameless plug
that's how you got to be on YouTube you
can be shameless about plugging your
site so you're already on the right
track as for video editing so you have a
few options obviously you do have iMovie
which you can use I personally not a fan
of iMovie but that's because I was sort
of brought up on bigger editing Suites
so avid sony vegas premiere things like
that so for me i would say if you would
like your cheapest option for a better
video program video editing program
would be adobe premiere elements which
is not quite adobe premiere pro a
premiere pro zylle more expensive you
would have to subscribe to Creative
Cloud which is Adobe's cloud service but
you could do that you could also shell
out the money for Final Cut Pro X but i
would say if you're just getting started
maybe shell out the cash for adobe
premiere elements and then upgrade to
either Final Cut Pro X or Adobe Premiere
as you see fit so that's my advice to
you and good luck with your youtube
channel at our cab 9 asks hey ashley
Esqueda will Apple gain their lost
consumers by just bringing in big screen
iPhones this is a good question I think
that they're going to bring back some
people that maybe
they've lost to Android bigger screen
android devices and Windows Phone
devices however it's not going to be
just big screen phones I actually really
do think that for Apple to really gain
that ground back that maybe they lost to
people who left for larger screen
android phones one of the greatest
things about android is widgets like
that is my absolute number one thing
that i miss from being on android as my
daily driver i use an iphone 5s now and
that's the one thing i really do miss
everything else is kind of neither here
nor there and i feel like there are
equivalents for every mobile operating
system but for me widgets as one thing
that is really missed in iOS or
something to that effect so we have
something we have a widget system in OS
10 and i actually think that iOS 8 is a
really good opportunity for them to sort
of push forward with something a little
bit different for a larger screen size I
think that the icon system has worked
really well but if you're going to go
4.7 inch and bigger you got to have
something else in that screen I mean
that's at least that's what I think
otherwise it's just going to be a giant
grid and that's kind of weird sam asks
do you believe that titanfall is a true
call of duty killer they said the same
thing about battlefield 3 and look at
that turned out has anyone at the office
played the beta if so do they enjoy it
thanks a lot of people at the office
have in fact played the titanfall beta
it is fantastic it's really really fun I
definitely think the call of duty series
is getting a little bit stale I think
that there's kind of that annual cash
grab feel to it at this point where it's
not quite polished enough for innovative
enough for people to really kind of go
crazy for it like they did for black ops
2 which was a huge deal um but I
definitely think titanfall is going to
be one of those console sellers for Xbox
I think this is like one of the things
that xbox really has their fingers
crossed for and even though titanfall is
coming out for xbox 360 in addition to
pc and xbox one I think Microsoft is
hoping that you are going to go ahead
and bite the bullet and go out and pick
up an xbox one and get titanfall because
you're going to want to play at the
highest resolution possible with your
friends but honestly it's really great
and I think that the games journalism
community would not be talking about it
so much if it wasn't so good
so if you guys are thinking about
getting into app development or some
other facet of the business of
Technology you should definitely check

techno Buffalo siddhesh pie asks hey
Ashley do you think Google will surely
kill the nexus series if yes will they
launched a new line or what this is a
great question there have been a lot of
rumors that Google is going to kill off
the Nexus series actually here's what I
think so if you have not seen the movie
Blade Runner the line of replicants that
are the replicants that these four main
models are based off of in the film our
Nexus 6 so I think there's a little bit
of a conflict there I know that they
already had issues with nexus one and
there was sort of this thing or nexus 2
i'm sorry notice we never had a nexus 2
and that's why so because of philip k
dick estate and do androids dream of
electric sheep all this other stuff lots
of copyright issues with the name Nexus
and there are a couple of choice numbers
that can't really be added to it without
some pretty serious licensing things so
the next phone in line of Nexus devices
would technically be the nexus 6 but I
think because of Blade Runner we're not
going to see a nexus 6 and this might be
Google's opportunity to really say okay
well we're gonna have to think of a
different line name for our devices
maybe they're going to be Google Play
edition devices maybe we just won't see
the Nexus line anymore and it'll just
say here's the google play edition you
know motorola phone or whatever our
lenovo i guess now
these companies by each other so quickly
uh but yeah so I think that the nexus 6
issue actually is going to be sort of a
death by necessity something that
they're either going to shell out a lot
of licensing money for or change the
name and I think changing the name is
really the the better solution for them
in the long run let's it frost the
