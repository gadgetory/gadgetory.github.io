the five words I never thought I'd say
I'm excited about a zune the new zune HD
since I let us film my Twitter questions
video when I talked about the zune more
information has kind of come to light
and videos of the device itself have
actually been released so some of the
specs it's got a 3.3 inch o LED which
stands for organic LED if the screen is
trying to seeing a lot of cell phones
it's a brighter less battery intensive
non backlit screen in this case it's a
capacitive screen similar to what's
found on the iphone and the t-mobile g1
it's got a 16 by 9 ratio which is very
nice and a resolution of fourteen eighty
by 272 so it actually is a relatively
high res device oh it certainly not
capable of showing HD on the device
itself it is capable of 720p HD output
mean if you have an HD video on it
hooked up to your TV it'll come out in
720p assuming your TV can show that
resolution it also has a built-in HD
radio which is kind of cool HD radio is
this new thing that I think the
terrestrial radio sort of came out to
compete with satellite radio its
frequencies really in between
frequencies need a special radio to be
able to get them it's new programming a
lot of it is very music intensive or
talk intensive and less commercials it
also has the zune features that you know
and may love or not love Wireless that's
got wireless syncing it's got the zune
store on there and you can share devices
wirelessly with your friends this
version of the zoom zoom HD also has a
dolton web browser which is based off of
i hate to say it internet explorer which
I am NOT a big fan I think pocket
Internet Explorer is awful on windows
mobile devices I'm very curious to see
how it looks on the zune HD Microsoft is
claiming this device will have
multitouch so ability to pinch and zoom
around and double tap to zoom on the web
browser also it has a picture viewer
with the folks
rahmanir the unique turn chain to the
devices you can flip through which
sounds like a very very very familiar
scheme that I've heard on a few other
devices may have that I'm not going to
mention any names microsoft hasn't come
out with pricing on this yet really
don't know storage capacity or any of
that yet either but Microsoft is
scheduled to make an announcement at
this coming III which is the electronic
entertainment expo which will be held
next week in Los Angeles I would expect
some sort of games or Xbox integration
to be launched with the device possibly
even some sort of App Store to launch of
it and rival the ipod touch that is
clearly the competitor here the zune HD
actually it's a very elegant looking
device I've never been a fan of the way
the zooms looked but this zune HD
actually looks very nice it's ditches
all the old buttons and a little touch
pads that they had on the previous gen
device and really goes back to well i'm
going to say the apple one button it's
got one button in the middle and that's
where you need to go back to your menu
does what to be a really nice device and
all these nice things I'm saying about
it are fantastic but the end of the day
I can't use it I can't buy a zune I can
get a zune because there isn't any mac
client for it so that is quite a
fortunate I would expect that if
Microsoft to look and get this a little
more mainstream there will eventually
release a mac client least I would
assume so the zoom will also come with
the ability to buy a zune pass meaning
you can the subscription service so you
can download as many songs as you want
for around 15 bucks a month you can also
actually keep typing 10 of those songs
that you download and of course they are
drm-free so this is just my quick take
on the zune HD looks like a very sweet
device I'm actually excited about it to
see when I get my hands on it what do
you think is it going to make you
rethink the zune brand the zoomin aims
been just drug through the dirt and it's
gonna be hard for Microsoft to overcome
that negative brand recognition but this
is zune HD interesting it's something
that maybe you'd like don't like you
know what are you guys
I'm very curious to hear your thoughts
anyway so John render exclusive content
