you by jack threads hello there folks is
John Q here from TechnoBuffalo hope you
guys are doing fantastic especially for
those of you in States right now
celebrating July the 4th welcome to
another episode of what's the app today
we're gonna get our mobile tablet e
gaming on with a little game on the iPad
called band together
hit man man together as a highly visual
puzzle based game on the iPad your
objective is to help these little guys
called Bandys survive and head towards
the exit for me the characters are a
little reminiscent of gur from invader
zim combined with the body of an ant the
gameplay and environment sorta has a
little big planet kind of feel where
your main guys are these little guys
trapped in this big world trying to get
to the end of the level hopefully with
all of your buddies intact the gameplay
is simple enough you tap and swipe to
control and move your guys swiping
across multiple little dudes allows them
to band together like the title and move
as a group as you progress further
levels introduce new obstacles and the
concept of light and darkness we have
this little dude with a candle on its
head little Bandys outside the reaches
of the fire fall asleep instantly so in
order to move your narcoleptic little
dudes about you'll have to safely
maneuver your candle guy I call him the
chosen one close enough to wake them up
I can't say which is cooler the concept
of using light as an obstacle or the
fact that later on in the game you get
this little makeshift looking chainsaw
thing that cuts through chunk to
styrofoam or oh I know how about the
graphics I think they've done a stellar
job at rendering and creating the levels
some elements look almost photorealistic
which in my opinion definitely adds a
lot to the overall gaming experience the
audio is also pretty neat it's a looped
little ditty featuring what sounds like
some banjos with ambient noises and
echoes it's an interesting mixture of
wacky and eerie which works perfectly
with this game but it's one of those
tunes that can get annoying after a
little bit especially if you're
struggling with a particular level so
personally I mute the game one of my
favorite aspects of the game would be
these Demetri Martin looking sketches
you get before every level most of not
all of them are guides highlighting new
obstacles are explaining how to complete
certain levels very cool stuff some
shortcomings are band together are the
limited levels at
the moment there are only 30 levels that
you can play through the controls are
responsive and smooth for the most part
except I found that things are a little
tricky near the left edge of the screen
especially if you're trying to move your
buddies away from the bottom left menu
there also isn't too much substance to
the gameplay but I feel like the awesome
graphics helps compensate for it and
speaking awesome I'm gonna take some
time to thank our friends at Jackthreads
only suckers pay full price okay and if
you're into alternative apparel brands
like Kidrobot Hurley and Stussy but you
hate wasting all of your hard-earned
cash on them listen up you can score
these premium brands at up to 80% off
every day there's a new invite only
shopping club called Jackthreads serving
up Street skate and surf wear brands at
prices that'll melt your brain okay
there's a wait list to join but if you
head on over to jack threads.com slash
techno again that's jack threads.com
slash techno you'll get instant access
to all of their killer hook-ups go now
back to the review overall if I had to
describe the experience a band together
in one word it would be neat the
gameplay and the story isn't really
anything to write home about but the
stunningly semi realistic graphics
quirky music cute Bendis and hand-drawn
sketches really immerse you in this
LittleBigPlanet esque world the game is
free for a limited time right now so if
you have an iPad it's definitely worth
checking out band together 3.5 out of 5
well I hope you guys enjoyed my review
of band together and again for you folks
in the States have a wonderful happy and
safe July the 4th this was John Q from
TechnoBuffalo thank you very much for
tuning in and I'll see you guys next
time
