to give you a demonstration of the
keyboards and text input methods found
on the blackberry storm 2 i'm new to the
storm family so i'm not an expert typist
on it so this is going to mimic the
experience you would have if you just
picked up the device if you use the
storm one and you're a pro your
experience is going to be even faster if
you're curious how the new storm sure
press technology and the screen works
i've got a video explaining that up on
my channel so if i check it out and i'll
put a link to it in the sidebar the
storm one typing experience was not that
accurate for me the screen just never
seemed to hit what i wanted to hit and
the wait time between waiting for the
screen to come back up make the typing
experience a little bit choppy so let's
see if that's improved with the storm
two we'll go ahead and open up a new
message to compose an email close the
wizard I don't have an email associated
with this yet and here we are so you've
got your typical sure tab key word that
you've seen on the storm one now you
find on the pearl and the pearl flip
let's try and type out a message here
will type out this is a test and see how
it works
this is a test I made a mistake but it's
spelling correction picked it right up
this is a test they will take that no
problem and the screen does feel nice
and natural now it does feel like you're
just pushing a button which I assume was
the experience that RIM was going for
with the initial blackberry so this
being a full qwerty device and having an
accelerometer when you rotate it you get
a full qwerty landscape keyboard I think
the landscape keyboard was one of the
places at the initial storm was really
efficient it was just very hard to type
on and like I said very inaccurate let's
see if it's improved with the storm two
will type the same thing this is a test
I always hit the voice command button on
the bottom there and it corrected me
again and this is a test I can tell you
that this is a keyword that I think that
I could definitely get used to it was
relatively quick and pretty accurate
typing as well so if one of your
concerns with the storm two is how the
keyboard is going to work if you'd seen
the storm one and you weren't impressed
I think your concerns can really be
offset with the storm two it seems to
just work and respond much better
overall than the storm one and then you
sure press green technology really seems
to be a big step forward from the last
generation making this a really
worthwhile upgrade or new purchase if
you're looking to hop on the touchscreen
blackberry bandwagon so guys this is jon
rettinger for exclusive content check me
out of twitter twitter.com / John for
lakers and to learn more about
technobuffalo check out technobuffalo
comm links to all that business will be
up in the sidebar and i'll see you guys
next video and stay tuned for just a ton
of storm two coverage bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
