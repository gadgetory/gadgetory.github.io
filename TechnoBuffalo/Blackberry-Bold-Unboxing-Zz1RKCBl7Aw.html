for Lakers come here and I've got an
unboxing for you of the BlackBerry Bold
9000 it's a the first 3G blackberry
released for the GSM networks and it's
out on AT&amp;amp;T hope you guys enjoy the
unboxing and I'll see you in the next
video bye bye alright guys here is an
unboxing for you of the BlackBerry Bold
9000 this is the first AT&amp;amp;T 3G
blackberry that's been released there's
been a few 3G ones on the CDMA networks
but this is the first gsm 3g
BlackBerry's let's take a look at the
box here on the front of it blackberry
bold 9000 with the 3G logo and the rest
of the 18 T business and a picture of
the device on the front with some
information on it right there blackberry
bold what the package contains you could
read that since we're gonna see it in a
minute some legal mumbo-jumbo
some IMEI in spec numbers and on the
back some specs in the device I will
give you guys the highlights here
it's a tri-band UMTS HSDPA device so
that's the 3G band it's also quad-band
GSM ed so it's a world's phone work
anywhere in the world weighs four point
eight ounces has 624 megahertz processor
which is actually pretty fast talk type
to 4.3 hours and standby time of 10.5
days
I opened as a good battery it's 3g life
on most phones it's not so good it's got
a half VGA LCD screen which means it's
480 by 320 pixels over 65,000 colors 128
megabytes of flash memory and one gig
onboard memory and also has a micro SD
card which let go up to 16 gigs it's got
Wi-Fi built in 802 11 a B and G and it's
got a built-in GPS so that's the facts
let's get into the good stuff what we
are all here to see when I'm dying to
see it's actually when the first times
I've even held that we're seeing a
BlackBerry Bold it's been so elusive its
release date has been pushed back so
many times
so here we
we open it up we got some welcome to 18t
information there thank you for
purchasing a BlackBerry Bold blah blah
blah all right guy this is not gonna
replace my iPhone just gonna use it to
play around this for a while so here's
some documentation blackberry bold 9000
getting started guide all that stuff
that most of us probably never read
click zoom this out just a little bit
all right so there's that and here is
the device blackberry looks like this
comes up like included a SIM card what's
already be in the device little plastic
thing covering it Isis a way to protect
it
here is the BlackBerry Bold 9000 went
that off to the side for a minute see
what else is in the box I think there's
a battery here yep battery let's see
what's a milliamp hour battery milliamp
hours hopefully it's strong at least
1300 milliamps it's a big better it's
long it is doesn't say but I believe it
as a 1,300 milliamp hour battery
it's kind of long and thin put that off
to the side see it also we got in the
box nothing else under that tray like
this whole thing this up alright here's
I'll be peripheral goodness it's got a
nice holster here with that holsters
made out of
that open this up and let's see if this
passes the brinded minimun patented
leather smell test here let's give it a
smell and that does appear to be all
leather and it's got a nice little
magnet on it right there little close up
and we put the device in it'll turn it
off and let's like it's a swivel holster
- that's handy I guess if you're into
the holsters not my thing but if you are
good to have put that off to the side
we'll keep going through the box here
this appears to be a USB to mini-usb
cable for charging which is nice it's a
standard non-proprietary always happy to
see what I'll stay including the box
here 3.5 millimeter headphones won't
expect you to win any headphone awards
but nice that's ett and blackberry
included them wall charger and some more
documentation blackberry bold 9000 this
QuickStart guide looks like a CD for
user tools so let's push all this to the
side let's take a look at what you guys
all want to see what I'm dying to see
the BlackBerry Bold itself so here's the
phone you can see it's got a full QWERTY
keyboard it's actually four rows you
then focus there all the way across
first impression the keyboard feels nice
feels like a typical BlackBerry keyboard
but again I'll use the device let you
guys know what I think a little bit so
move on to the back of the device it's
got a nice kind of fake leather feeling
here I'll do a real quick size
comparison for you I'll also do a full
hardware overview on the device but you
can't have a size comparison without an
iPhone 3G since that's what everybody
compares it with so I'll zoom in here
and show you guys all right so here are
the two devices they look to be just
about the same size wise check it
doesn't focus there you go just about
the same size let's see how they stack
up on top of each other
looks like the well seemed to be pretty
similar there too and a whiff comparison
they seem to be actually relatively
close almost identical in size although
the iPhone because it's tapered feels a
little bit smaller in the hand but it
does feel nice so guys here's just a
unboxing of the blackberry bold 9000 for
AT&amp;amp;T I'll do a full review for you guys
after I use it for a few days and I will
do a first boot up video I know you guys
like to see that also so look for that
