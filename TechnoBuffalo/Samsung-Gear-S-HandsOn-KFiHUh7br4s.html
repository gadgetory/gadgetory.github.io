TechnoBuffalo I'm checking out the gear
as samsung's new SmartWatch you can see
it's got the curve display here really
unique form factor obviously on the back
you've got the heart rate monitor that
we saw in the earlier products but check
out that little trailer that's for sim
cards because this is capable of running
without your smartphone I can get next
to the internet either with Wi-Fi or on
a on its own wireless connection so
there's this home button here you can
press and takes you right to the home
screen where you can see the watch face
but then you can also go through and
access health messages miss Cole's
there's your pedometer and the goals
there so you can see with the larger
screen there's a lot more room for
information here's a text message the
missed call and then if you swipe up you
can clear everything but also if you if
you click into the text let's see down
here you can actually respond I with the
full keyboard here which is uh not that
easy to fu I meant to write hi not that
easy to type on obviously but
unique nonetheless and there's also the
pre-installed messaging options there so
you can say I'll talk to you later or
whatever you want let's try pulling down
from the top you can put it in do not
disturb mode then also you can see the
battery life signal and stuff like that
so in any case this is a quick look here
at the galaga the gear s rather and this
is Todd Hazleton from technobuffalo
