tecnica Floyd I come from here at the
app nation San Francisco conference in
San Francisco California I didn't want
things just getting started people
waking up getting this set up general
sessions going on behind me and
everything but I'm over here at the
Samsung mobile stand where I got my
hands on the Galaxy S player this has
been launched already has not shipped
yet ship date is imminent I was told but
I have not actually seen this one in
person
it's a 5-inch display and it's basically
you know it's it's a Android based
multimedia player this is running
Gingerbread with Samsung's TouchWiz
interface over it it's not a cell phone
it's Wi-Fi only and you've got the
TouchWiz UI and you know basically the
stuff that you've seen on the the new
line of the Samsung S gingerbread
devices you can see it's got the galaxy
s logo on the back there but it's got a
larger screen and so I have an
interesting device because you can see
it here next to the galaxy s2 and the
five inch display you know really makes
it feel kind of like a mini tablet which
it is larger than something certainly
you know next to the apps yes here but
much larger than something like an iPod
Touch which would be one of its main
competitors and then also of course
there are a bunch of Android based
personal media players out there on the
market but you've got you know what
you'd expect from the device the Google
Apps the Samsung Apps when we go into
the applications here we'll take a look
at the screen I'm good at gallery
and you know really the screen just
really pops in person very vivid
obviously it's got the auto-rotate all
that stuff you'd expect very speedy very
responsive and I don't know this is
coming through on the camera and I just
have my little Sony Bloggie camera with
me today but I mean this this this image
of the trees here just really pumps you
know obviously they're going to pick out
the images to show off the display
capabilities but I definitely really
pops on the bottom you've got you know
just three buttons two capacitive touch
buttons here the Menu button the back
button and then one physical button for
home go to videos get a look at a video
here
on the side you know nothing on the
sides there on the other side you've got
the power switch and the up-down rocker
switch for volume microsd card slot on
the top microphone and headphone jack on
the bottom so ostensibly you could use
this for for VoIP applications
you know Skype that kind of stuff on the
back there's your camera we'll get the
full specs we'll put them down in the
subtitles of the video for you but
really you know you can see again I
don't know if it's coming through in the
video but kind of the 3d effect it's not
a 3d display obviously but the screen
just super rich motion is you know very
little blur looks really nice and it's
very thin so interesting offering from
Samsung again we hear this is a the
launch of this is eminent imminent
rather and be interesting to see if this
thing takes off you know in the US
globally as something like an iPod Touch
competitor and now I'm looking at the UI
and thinking about how Samsung and Apple
are suing each other but that's a story
for another day
with the galaxy s player a 5-inch Wi-Fi
only Android device from Samsung I'm at
the Samsung mobile stand at appellation
San Francisco 2011 much much more on
techno buffalo</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
