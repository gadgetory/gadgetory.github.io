to you by Jackthreads welcome back of
the episode of ask the Buffaloes to show
you could ask me jon rettinger any
question you might have from the vest
will the technology of this week on ask
the Buffalo we're gonna talk about
google i/o what iOS 7 needs xbox 720 and
where the heck am I gonna be in the
future this is asked to Buffalo go and
get started so first question comes from
Josh hey John what are you expecting the
xbox 720 to have with it with the
announcement coming up in made you think
I'll be superior to the PlayStation 4
sony has taken the very first wraps off
the PlayStation before we don't know
what it's gonna look like and there's
presumably a ton of new features they
are going to announce that III which is
really just coming up in a few weeks but
we don't know anything about is it's
microsoft competitor the next Xbox oh
I'd love to see a few things in the next
generation Xbox first I'm super curious
they put blu-ray in there certainly Sony
is one of the pioneers the blu-ray
formatting they have majority of the
seats on the blu-ray board so be
interesting to see if they're kicking
back a little bit of money too so need
to use blu-ray I'd assume though this is
gonna be last generation of consoles
that relies on physical media so it's
gonna have to have blu-ray to get those
disks to have the size they need the DVD
format that the originary text box has
just ain't gonna hold it so let's see a
bigger emphasis on social gaming some of
the cool stuff the PlayStation 4 had the
ability to screencast games have friends
over the web take over your game or
really awesome innovative features i
love to see Microsoft out for something
similar I love to see xbox glass from
Microsoft glass project glass take a
next step before you can do for a second
screen they can do a ton of new things
and this one is probably never ever ever
gonna happen but I love to see 4k games
sony said please asian for is knocking
support for kid games from the beginning
i think that's a chance where Microsoft
could really get some superiority
granted 4k gaming probably won't take
off for many years these consoles have a
decade in lifespan so our next question
comes from Twitter at wise gadgets asked
at John for lakers what do you think
I'll be announced on Google i/o this may
last year we Sonya
this is we saw the Nexus Q which came
and went google glass debuted you're
gonna see a ton of awesome stuff at
Google i/o so here's the list of things
I think we can expect to see first next
generation of android 5.1 pie yay next
generation Nexus phone perhaps the Nexus
X made by motorola I think we're going
to see some much much much more
information on glass and some retail
availability aside from the $1,500
Explorer edition I think it's also
expect us to see next generation Nexus
tablets next to 7 Nexus 10 so I'm super
excited about we might see from google I
Owen and May and of course check out
technobuffalo calm because I personally
will be there in the audience bringing
you all the latest uh-oh buiness it's
the next question comes from rahat Khan
arkaen also from twitter at john for
lakers what do you think is a main
reason android is taking over and iOS is
falling behind if you compare the iphone
5 to pretty much every other android
device out there still out selling it
android has the market share because
there are many more android devices on
every single carrier so falling behind
you know that's up to the end user I
think of where they falling behind those
in her perception iOS is still a very
usable operating system it worked well
it does what you need full is falling
behind that the OS stayed very stale and
not to say it's not functional but it
stayed the same essentially since 2007
so I think what you're trying to say is
I os7 compete with what's coming up next
and man I hope so I really do I missed
the days of steve job within the angry
Apple I miss him getting up on stage and
saying flash is stupid no one's ever
gonna adopt mobile flash even if you
disagree with them it was fun to have
that fights made for a really
entertaining story I'm hoping whenever
they take the stage again at WWDC and
Tim Cook comes up there announces
hopefully iOS 7 maybe the iphone 5s or
wherever else they do there's some fire
behind that we can get some good
competition because things continue the
way they're going I think android is
gonna have some serious domination over
the next few years this one question
comes from Matthew Bob me who asked at
John for lakers what do you see yourself
in 10 20 or maybe even 30 years from my
office a tough one answered have our
time think you wanted to be doing ten
minutes from now so ten years will put
me at a very whopping 43 years old I
hope to still be doing this I hope to
still be sitting in front of a camera
talking about my love and talking about
technology I hope that you guys still
you mean the opportune
to do then hope that I can still you
know be in touch with stuff that's going
on I hope to have a family um you know
growing family will be in my 40s love to
have a couple kids at that point still
somehow be valo tech knowledge and i
hope that i'm still at technobuffalo so
my 50s 1 i'm 20 i hope to still be doing
this still talk about technology but
also i would love to get into politics
I've always had a desire to push change
in this world i don't feel that my
generations voice and politics are
really represented it out there i think
most people think politicians those
liars and only out for themselves i
would ideally like to be in a position
where I don't need a salary for my
political job right ok I'm going to
donate every cent of my after-tax income
to a non-political non-religious charity
and I can do it just because I want to
help I want to sort of pull back that
veil on politics I want to show what
happens really have had the scenes you
know why Congress is making problems
only Congress can solve and that's been
happening whether Republican to
Democrats the majority it just the way
politics work and I think it's
disgusting and I think that someone
needs to talk about it even if I'm only
fortunate enough to be elected one term
I love the opportunity at some point so
bring to light and serve be a force for
change that's always been my dream who
knows if ever happened I've I love to
make a difference in 30 years today oh
man I hope to be a maybe a grandfather
now maybe not yet not yet but shop have
a nice family hope to have a nice life I
would be doing some that I love and be
surrounded by people that love me and
folks that i love i love to still be
working i hope that i can still talk
about technology and i hope that i can
still sort of share my life consumer
electronics i hope i can show you you
know the iphone 26s and the galaxy s 17
are to the galaxy s 40 whatever it might
be the time i love this this is is a job
certainly but it's a love every day I
come to work doesn't feel like a job and
I hope that that continues to the next
10 20 and 30 years so if it'll help
