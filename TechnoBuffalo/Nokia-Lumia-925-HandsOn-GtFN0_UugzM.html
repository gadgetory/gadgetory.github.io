we are doing a hands-on of the newest
t-mobile Windows Phone 8 flagship the
Lumia 925 let's check it out alright so
here it is the Nokia Lumia 925 for
t-mobile obviously the very first thing
you're gonna notice that's different
about this particular Lumia is that it
has an aluminum lining all around the
corner all around the sides everywhere
it's really beautiful and it's got white
polycarbonate at the back that's a matte
white polycarbonate so very difficult to
put some fingerprints on that big fan
there the speakers in the back here if
we want to get close on this have these
little nubs that allow you to not have
to set this flush on a table so if you
do have this screen side up and you have
your speakerphone on this will enable
you to you know get a little bit more
projection out of your speakers are
coming from the bottom of the device and
on the back we've got an eight point
seven megapixel Carl Zeiss lens this one
actually has a sixth lens as opposed to
its brethren I guess I'll call them the
Lumia 920 triplets because I do have a
Lumia 920 and a 928 here this one has
six lens it doesn't have a xenon flash
like the 928 so two things that are a
little bit different it's a given a take
on each one of those on the top of the
device we have our 3.5 millimeter
headphone jack
our bane of my existence micro USB port
on the top of the device which I'm not a
huge fan of but to each their own some
of you don't care and of course our SIM
tray slot so there's our door and our
little keyhole right there on the 925 we
have the exact same processor as the 928
and the 920 we have a dual-core 1.5
gigahertz Snapdragon processor so you're
gonna get that same snappy speed
responsiveness in Windows Phone 8 that
you would on either of those two devices
so if you're on t-mobile and you're
worried you're getting the short end of
the stick in terms of processing speed
you're not compared to the 920 or the
928 you get the same which is really
nice of Nokia to hook us up with that
you get the same 1 gigabyte of RAM so
again same
sponson is same speed and you get the
same screen size this is the exact same
screen as the 928 but almost the same
screen as the 920 so I'll tell you the
difference this is a 1280 by 768 screen
it's four and a half inches just like
the other two phones but the only
difference between this phone and the
920 is that this phone and the 928
there's a lot of 920 and then an X after
that so the 925 and the 928 have AMOLED
displays and the 920 actually has an IPS
LCD so it's just a little bit different
these two are the AMOLED ones are
pentile just so you guys know if that
means anything to you some of you will
care about such things some of you will
not storage wise you're going to get a
little bit of the short end of the stick
on this particular phone you end up with
16 gigs of memory now 16 gigs starting
which means when you get really down to
it you only have about 12 gigabytes free
once the phone is set up so you have to
have all that space for Windows Phone 8
and everything else
however just so you know you do get 7
gigabytes of SkyDrive free so you don't
have to worry too much about it you get
a little bit of extra space but if
you're really in an area where you need
offline storage for your music or movies
or anything else this may not be the
phone for you beyond that same 2000
milliamp battery that the other two
devices have unfortunately no wireless
charging but let me show you why look at
how fat the 920 is compared to the 925
this one has wireless charging on board
of the 925 does not if you're desperate
for wireless charging that's ok you can
get a case that snaps onto the back of
this and will allow your 925 to charge
wirelessly beyond that there's only a
couple more things this is by far the
lightest of the Lumia 920 line up the
the 920 triplets the 925 clocks in at
139 grams the very lovely 928 clocks in
at a hundred and 62 grams so quite a bit
heavier and of course the 920 the AT&amp;amp;T
Lumia 920
clocks in at the heaviest by far at a
hundred and eighty-five grams so
positively chunky by comparison now last
but not least let's check out Nokia apps
I want to show you guys this they of
course have all of their proprietary
apps here to help you transition away
from anything like Google Maps for
example so Nokia has some great stuff
like here city lens here drive plus
which of your navigation your maps here
transit and the like so they also have a
creative studio and the camera is also
very very good really great stuff
happening here if you're a big fan of
Windows Phone I highly recommend it so
far so good
we'll have even more in our review I'll
give you the full rundown of my thoughts
and opinions on the 925 but if you have
