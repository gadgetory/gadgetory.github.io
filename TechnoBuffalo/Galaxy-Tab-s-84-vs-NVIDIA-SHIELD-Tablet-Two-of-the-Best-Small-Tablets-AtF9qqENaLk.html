to you by go daddy what's going on guys
a m√§rklin segment from TechnoBuffalo
and it's another Tuesday show so that
means we'll be comparing the Galaxy Tab
s 8.4 and NVIDIA shield tablet and see
which one we think is better so let's
get on with the video so first things
first we'll give you guys a rundown on
the basic specification on these two
beautiful tablets the Galaxy Tab s has
an 8.4 inch Super AMOLED display with a
resolution of 2560 by 1600 which looks
absolutely gorgeous the device also
comes equipped with an octa-core exynos
5 meaning there's 2 quad core chips
inside 3 gigabytes of RAM 16 gigabyte of
expandable storage up to 128 gigabytes
Android 4.4 with TouchWiz and a pretty
beefy 4900 milliamp battery there's also
a built-in fingerprint scanner which we
rarely see on tablets nowadays it works
but not as well as a touch ID on
something like the iPhone 5s Nvidia
shield on the other hand sports an 8
inch 1920 by 1200 IPS LCD display and
it's the first tablet to be driven by
the crazy powerful Tegra k1 processor
it's got 2 gigabytes of RAM onboard 16
gigabyte of expandable storage for up to
128 gigabyte a larger 5300 milliamp
battery and stock Android 4.4 KitKat
with a few of Nvidia shields a
pre-installed the shield tablet also has
dual front facing speaker which sounds
incredible for a tablet to size and a
mini HDMI port so if you ever want to
hook it up to your TV and play your
games or movies on the big screen you
have that option to do so moving on to
the design both devices are made out of
high quality plastic the tab S is much
lighter and thinner and it makes a
shield tablet feel downright huge it
looks beautiful as well and the
lightness makes a tab as super easy to
use with one hand but honestly I prefer
the shield tablets much more durable
build quality it is twice as heavy as
the Tab s and noticeably thicker but
it's not unwieldy and the soft touch
back feels great the tab S is about 0.4
inches bigger than the shield tablet and
the tab s is Super AMOLED display is
just unreal colors are super vibrant
which some may or may not like but
gladly Samsung included a few screen
options to where you can tweak the
overall look of the display so it's much
easier on eyes now the shield tablets
display is great too but don't expect
the same vibrant screen from the tab S
though it's good enough for everyday use
in playing games which is what the
shield tablet is for anyways and above
and below the shield tablets display
dual front-facing speakers and I can't
really explain how great they sound
compared to the tab passive speakers
having the speakers up in the front
definitely makes a huge difference when
using the tablet for watching movies or
even playing games performance wise this
is where the shield tablet shines the
Tegra k1 processor is just an absolute
monster it can pretty much handle
anything you throw at it whether you
want to play games from invidious grid
service stream game stream ready games
from your PC or if you want to simply
just browse the web it works flawlessly
now the tab S is no slouch either it's
plenty fast for regular tasks like
browsing the web watching movies and
playing games but sometimes we get the
occasional lag when we're navigating tab
s is home screen which is inexcusable
it's not a huge deal breaker but just
know that it happens now battery on both
device is good and even though the
Galaxy Tab s is battery is smaller it
can last about 11 or so hours on a full
day of use and a few days of standby
time
the shield tablets on the other hand can
last about eight to ten hours of heavy
usage even when gaming and videos latest
Tegra k1 processor performs very well
both of them offer different power
saving modes too which means you can get
extended use if you use them casually
software both are running Android 4.4
KitKat though Samsung's tab S has a
TouchWiz skin over it whereas the shield
tablet comes with stock Android now if
you've ever used a Samsung device then
you'll feel right at home with the Tab s
it's got the same overall UI other
Samsung devices out in the market
including the same colorful menus that
we're all familiar with TouchWiz is
definitely an acquired taste though it
really has improved quite a bit over the
last few years
Samsung's magazine UX features
prominently offering a Flipboard style
like layout in one of the home screen
that allows users to easily see their
stuff like calendar appointments emails
and other information in an easy-to-read
E layout so let's take a quick break
from this video and thank our friends at

some limitations apply see website for
details other great features that
TouchWiz offers is the ability to use
two apps at once through multi window
that means I can easily watch youtube
videos and browse the web with Chrome at
the same time which I wouldn't be able
to do with a shield tablet multi window
is great but it does lag a bit after
using the tablet for a while and it
becomes a little cramped on 8.4 inch so
you're better off using the larger 10.5
inch tab s now there's also side sink
where you can control your supported
Galaxy smartphone straight from the
tablet to make calls
send messages so when you leave your
phone charging somewhere else you'll
still be able to use your phone as if it
was in your hands now the shield tablet
on the other hand has pure stock Android
4.4 KitKat and it looks just like the
Nexus 7 but with a few even videos apps
pre-installed now I really like the pure
stock Android look the menus and
settings aren't too cluttered and
everything else is just very simplistic
but everything you need in an android
tablet is all here you have access to
the Google Play Store and on top of that
and videos very own apps like to shield
hub and grid which means you have access
to a ton of shield ready and console
quality games when it comes to pricing
the shield tablet retails for $300 while
the Galaxy Tab s 8.4 retails for $400
which is a pretty big difference to
really get the most out of the shield
tablet you'll probably want to buy the
$60 wireless controller but even then
you're still spending more if you buy
the tab s by themselves though you get
more value out of the shield tablet even
if you have no intention to playing any
games but it's really up to you whether
you want a super portable tablet with
TouchWiz or Nvidia is more powerful
husky tablet with stock Android so to
wrap things up for you guys I'm still
going to have to go with Nvidia shield
tablet on this one it's cheaper more
powerful and having access and videos
gaming service is just a nice addition
to the tablet the Galaxy Tab s is great
too and offers an amazing display in
such a really thin and light package but
overall we think the Nvidia shield
tablet is the winner here anyways that's
it for this video guys if you guys have
