we are checking out iOS 7 and you know
there's some things now that iOS 7 has
gone live that people are not huge fans
of or you know they want to adjust so
we're going to adjust 10 small things in
iOS 7 to change your experience the
first thing people might want to adjust
as parallax so this is the thing that
causes the screen to have a little bit
of depth where the wallpaper is when you
move the screen around you might be able
to see that the the background kind of
shifts if you don't want that to happen
that's okay you can totally fix that all
you have to do is go into settings and
you actually want to go into general and
accessibility it's an accessibility and
from there you want to look for reduce
motion so when you tap and reduce motion
just go ahead and toggle that and it
will kill off the parallax effect the
next thing you might want to do is shut
off control center for certain apps so
let's say you play games or there's
something in particular that you don't
want to draw control center up for so we
want to go back into settings and from
there we just have to go to control
center and from here you can choose
access on lock screen so if you want to
have control center on your lock screen
you can turn that on or off or access
with an app so if we want to shut that
off so that we can't actually access
control center in an app you can do that
a lot of people have been talking about
battery life in iOS 7 and if you want to
shut off something that might help your
battery life you can head into your
settings and shut off background app
refresh so this is in settings and in
general so if you go there and you look
you can see there's background app
refresh if you tap on that you have a
couple of options here so you can
completely disable background app
refresh by toggling this offer on but
instead of that I'm going to go ahead
and actually toggle a few things that I
don't use so if i wanted to disable
stocks may be whether different things
like that but keep in mind that anything
with a blue arrow next to it is a GPS
app that sometimes needs to refresh in
the background because it has location
services available so if you're using
google maps and you navigate away from
that app the multitasking will actually
stop
freshing that app so you don't want to
actually disable things like Google Maps
just keep that in mind I would say go
individual apps on this one but head
through list toggle off whatever you
don't use and that should help your
battery life even if it's just a little
bit so Notification Center is something
that they've added a little bit to that
three tabs here but what if you don't
want that view well you can adjust your
notification center by going into
settings heading in a notification
center and you can see you have some new
options you can shut off your
notifications on the lock screen you can
show off the today view which will kill
off your your calendar or if you want to
kind of granularly go through each one
of the options for today view you can
actually set those so if you don't want
to see your calendar Dave you can shut
that off another thing that
automatically turns on in iOS 7 is auto
app updates if you want to shut that off
because you know sometimes you don't
want to automatically update an app it
might be broken there could be a bug all
you have to do is go into your settings
and you want to look for iTunes and App
Store from there you'll have a couple of
options you can show all of your music
and videos and all that good stuff but
here's what you're looking for automatic
downloads if you want to do app updates
you can do that here if you want to shut
that off you can you can also shut off
automatic downloads for music and apps
just in case it's something you're
interested in those are some other
options that you have available to
toggle on or off to your liking one of
the features in iOS 7 that people have
been kind of complaining about today
when it was released is the fact that in
messages and sometimes in mail it will
actually shorten the name of the person
sending you something so if you have
more than one person in your contacts
list with the same first name that could
be problematic but you can fix that you
just go into settings and from there you
want to go into mail contacts and
calendars and from there you're going to
scroll down and you are going to look
for short name so here is short name you
can see there are some different options
I'll go ahead and pick first name and
last initial because I like short name
but I want to make sure that I sort of
know exactly who is messaging me it's
one of the features in iOS 7 that's
interesting is you can now teach Syria
to pronounce a name that maybe they have
not done a good job pronouncing in the
past so camera guy Ralph his last name
is yet a mess but see really doesn't
really understand how to pronounce
said so we're gonna try to get Siri to
learn how to say Ralph's last name
that's not how you pronounce that Ralph
yet in s so obviously better than before
still not quite one hundred percent but
you can't expect that from a robot of
every single time I'll take it as long
as it can be improved in some way shape
or form iOS 7 uses bing as the search
default we're going to just look this up
really quick just to double-check find
images of Buffalo ok so there's Bing
right there and of course we can look on
Twitter and all this good stuff but what
if you wanted to search via google what
if you weren't a fan of Bing you could
then say google images of Buffalo so you
can still go ahead and do that via Siri
it's just one extra step of them opening
up Safari and searching but you can tell
Siri to use google as your search engine
it's just a little bit of extra work
some people have complained about the
text being not quite bold enough for
their taste you can actually fix that
it's in the accessibility options so if
we go back into settings we go into
general and then go into accessibility
we have some options but here it is
right here you can actually turn on
larger type and bold text so if you do
that it's actually going to restart your
iPhone so let's hit continue and restart
the phone and give it a second and
hopefully when it restarts will see some
bolder font choices now of course this
takes you back to something that's a
little bit more like iOS 6 so it's not
for everybody and it definitely changes
the design of your home screen
if you like that Boulder font it's
definitely a choice for you and is
available for you to toggle on or off if
you're looking to find out when somebody
sent a text message which can be a
little bit frustrating if you don't know
how long ago somebody sent something you
just want to go into messages and then
just swipe over from right to left and
you can actually see the timestamps on
the right side of the screen so it's a
super easy way to see when somebody sent
a text message to you or when you send a
text message to somebody else so there
you go ten tips to adjust and customize
