TechnoBuffalo here's an unboxing for you
of the Motorola devour a new consumer
oriented smartphone running android for
Verizon Wireless this is a Best Buy
Mobile exclusive for right now at least
and it's gonna set you back ninety-nine
bucks on a two-year contract it will be
coming very soon to Verizon stores near
you this is running motoblur sitting on
top of android 1.6 motoblur is a skinned
up Android
similar to Sense UI they may have seen
on the hero or other HTC devices this is
kind of being considered as the little
brother to the Droid let's go ahead and
dig in and I have yet to use even
motoblur phone so I don't know how the
skin works and quite looking forward to
it
so this ascent it's from Verizon for
review if you've got some press material
inside push that off to the side teeny
tiny box Wow zoom in just a bit so here
is the box for the Motorola Devourer
picture of it on the front some SKU
information picture of it on the back
and some what's in the box stuff but no
need to go over that since we're going
to open the box so here is the Devourer
handset it feels heavy I mean pick out a
very solid feel to it we'll look at that
in just a moment let's go ahead and see
what else you're gonna get with your
smartphone it's like the usual array of
stuff you've got micro SV charging wall
connector where you plug that into and
some getting to know motoblur stuff so
let's discuss some respect to the device
and they'll give you a tour so when you
first look at the Motorola Devourer I
think you're gonna notice two things
first you get a vs. screen which comes
in two three point one inches and it's
capacitive and you're also going to
notice the pronounced optical track
that sort of uses your d-pad or scroll
ball and also can be pushed in for many
notifications or to turn on your phone
like we did right here this Motorola
icon is just an icon doesn't have any
sort of cool functionality just is for
looks you've got some motoblur buttons
on the phone too that are capacitive
you've got your unlock button you've got
a notification LED blinking sort of
hidden lis right there home button and
back button on the left side of the
device you've got your charging port and
actually your battery port as well if
you slide this off to the side you get
access to your battery which is side
loading interestingly enough go ahead
and push that back it's also where your
micro SD card goes and included with the
device let's check out the size that
micro sd card phone freaks out you're
going to get a 8 gig micro SD card go
ahead and push that back in ok so moving
right along on the right side of the
device you're gonna have your volume
toggles up and down you're gonna have a
hard button I'm not sure sure what that
does we'll see what that functions as in
a minute and you've got your dedicated
camera button on the top you've got your
three point five millimeter headset jack
lock and power button back you've got
that sort of Motorola logo with the
motoblur and verizon branding and a very
pronounced speaker on the bottom you
take the phone and slide it out you are
greeted with a full QWERTY keyboard and
the keys here seem to be very nice
they've got a nice press and throw to
him you can really feel a difference in
the keys that was one of the knocks that
I had on the Motorola Droid was that the
keys were big what they were ben-moshe
and close together and they were hard to
use and type one does not appear to be
the case with this however a separate
compromise was made with this keyboard
if you're looking at oh there's a full
number row but the bottom letters the ZX
CV and the rest of them actually on the
same row as a space bar which can
they take some getting used to so if
you're interested in picking up a
Motorola devour something that you're
going to want to keep in mind I assume
that's going to take a bit of practice
the sliding mechanism is spring-loaded
and really has a nice go to it the
phone's got a very industrial high
quality feel I don't know if they
actually translate to good build quality
or not but it does feel really nice it's
got sort of a sturdy feel in the hand so
let's compare it very quickly to the
droid it's big brother so to speak and
for a lot more Devourer Android coverage
stay tuned to the channel and
TechnoBuffalo we're gonna be doing some
head to heads and more comparisons there
so from a size standpoint clearly a
difference in the screen believe you're
looking at a 3.1 I believe the droids is
a 3.7 so definitely a bit of a
difference when you're using the
Devourer you'll definitely notice that
there is a very pronounced bezel along
the phone I'm you stack them on top of
each other to see a difference in
thickness you notice there really isn't
one there despite the increase in
processor speed that the droid has to go
ahead and look at their keyboards the
devours targeted more at the consumer
market those looking for maybe a texting
and feature phone with some smart phone
capabilities whereas a droid is geared
more towards a business oriented crowd
or a more power user than a bit of our
but you can see the differences right
here keys I was talking about nospace
sort of hard to feel in a bit mushy
these are sort of spaced out and have a
bit more tactile feedback to them I'll
be doing a full overview on the Motorola
stands outbreaks a thumbs action my
first time ever using sense so I'm kind
of curious to get in and play with it I
should also mention that the Devourer
does have Wi-Fi and the GPS and since it
is running Android 1.6 you can get the
Google Maps Navigation for the
turn-by-turn directions so this is
really a quick look at moto blur I went
ahead and set it up and asked you to
type in your Twitter your Facebook and
the rest of those passwords and it
appears to have imported everything in
this weird Moodle blurry way of no idea
what this does yet
I'm getting tweets are all sort of
coming in you do get five home screens
however in case you're wondering so I'll
go back there
message from LP you get five home
screens which is quite nice you can
customize them any way you want either
with motoblur the standard widgets we'll
go over all those standard widgets sort
of are I just want you to navigator by
accident so this is sort of what
motoblur is gonna look like for you tray
and everything looks similar to what
you've expected dialer and Sajal I'll
show you guys when I do a tour of the
operating system anyway hope you enjoyed
I one last thing that I do want to
mention is we're looking on the back at
a 3 megapixel camera a lot of features
to go over on on these phones no flash
so hope you guys enjoyed this overview
and unboxing of the Motorola Devourer
