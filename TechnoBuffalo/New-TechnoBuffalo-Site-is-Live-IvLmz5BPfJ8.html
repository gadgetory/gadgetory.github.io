technobuffalo here I'm just back from
CES and we had an absolute blast

a completely new overhaul there's a ton
of new features you're going to see the
site look entirely different we've got a
new user submit feature where you can go
ahead and submit your own article on
your own video and we'll go ahead and
review it and if we think it's going to
add value to the site we're going to
publish it we can help you get some
exposure if you've been out there sort
of laboring on your own blog or labor
you on your YouTube channel you're
looking to get some eyes on it so going
to be a great way to try and get some
exposure we've got a new voting system
in place where you can vote on each post
and help us know what you like and don't
like which i think is kind of neat we

lot of awesome giveaways coming up I

show you how the tech can help change
your lives it's sort of a solution for
the digital lifestyle not just a speck
rehash of a new phone or a new laptop
