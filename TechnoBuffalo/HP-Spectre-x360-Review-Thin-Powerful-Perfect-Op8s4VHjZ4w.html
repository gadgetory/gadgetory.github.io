from TechnoBuffalo and over the last one
to two years we've seen PC manufacturers
really stepping up their game from Dell
to Lenovo to Microsoft themselves we've
seen awesome products in terms of
hardware HP has also been one of those
companies and today I want to talk about
their spectre x360 to let you guys know
how it stacks up against the competition
and to see if it's worth taking a look
at HP is in a really good job here in
terms of build quality the laptop feels
very sturdy good weight to it in the
hand good feel to it overall despite how
thin the laptop is it doesn't feel
flimsy or plasticky at all feels like a
good nice hunk of metal the design is a
little more subjective I think it looks
good but by no means great also by no
means ugly it's just a very neutral
looking laptop the very thin has a very
slick profile but it's definitely not
something crazy like the new Lenovo
products with their floaty holographic
keyboards or anything like that
and speaking of keyboards this was one
of my favorite things about the spectre
x360 really really nice keyboard keys
were nice and big and the spacing was
good felt a tad cramped sometimes but I
really like to travel on the keys
despite how thin the laptop is they
still are very very clicky it was a
pleasure to type on it actually made me
want to type up more thing so that's
probably the best compliment I can even
give a keyboard trackpad was a little
bit weird very wide but short regardless
a big enough trackpad that after a
little bit of adjustment you get used to
scrolling and gestures were all very
smooth in terms of ports we have one USB
type a on the left as well as the
headphone mic input right next to it and
on the right way of 2 USB see
Thunderbolt 3 Ford's would have been
nice to see one extra USB see
Thunderbolt 3 port on the left or see
them split one and one on each side just
for flexibility and charging just be
able to charge from both sides of the
laptop but not really a big issue and
speaking of charging the battery life on
the spectre x360 was slightly below
average in my usage I was getting about
5 to 7 hours of good usage time that was
with a combination of document creation
web browsing watching Netflix and then a
little bit of video editing some
slightly heavier stuff on the side
moving on to the screen we have a 13
inch display here in 1920 by 1080 w LED
backlit touchscreen I think it looks
fantastic 1080p is perfectly fine
and for the screen size images look very
sharp very saturated very vibrant colors
my favorite thing about this whole
display however was the super thin side
bezels it gives you this feeling that
you're watching some widescreen
experience or watching movies and TV
shows it's really enjoyable now if
you've been looking at this laptop and
you haven't guessed to get HP loves the
name of this laptop hence why it's over
the entire thing but there's another
name as well on the speakers and that's
Bang &amp;amp; Olufsen HP seems to be very proud
of their partnership with them and I
gotta be honest the first time I use the
speakers I really wasn't that impressed
they were very loud but the sound is
very muffled but it then found the Bang
&amp;amp; Olufsen app as well as the HP audio
app both of which give you full control
over the sound profile you get a full EQ
so you can control the levels of all the
frequencies and whatever you're
listening to as well as standard bass
and treble controls with this manual
control in the correct settings
depending on what you're listening to
and what you prefer in terms of sound
you can get some really good results out
of these speakers they're nice and
powerful without sounding like they're
too loud or busting at the seams and you
can tell HP was really focusing on the
speakers and sound of this product
because they had speakers on top but
also speakers below they made sure to
place them in such a way that no matter
what mode you're in laptop mode tent
mode or tablet mode you're always
getting clear loud audio and speaking of
those modes that's the big thing with
this laptop it's a convertible and HP
like other manufacturers is marketing
the convertible as this amazing laptop
in this amazing tablet and my experience
of using and reviewing convertibles I've
come to the conclusion that as of now
and this can obviously change in the
future the perfect laptop doesn't make
the perfect tablet the perfect tablet
does not make the perfect laptop the
spectre x360 is no different it is a
much better laptop in my opinion that it
is a tablet and there's two big reasons
for this when you flip it back and use
it in tablet mode it makes for a very
very thick tablet because you have two
parts where you of the keyboard base and
you have the screen also having that
keyboard flip back even though it's
turned off you're still sitting there
pressing the keys while you're holding
it in tablet mode it just doesn't feel
as secure and as pleasurable to use as
dedicated tablet would that being said I
don't think it's really fair to complain
about it because as a feature it doesn't
take away from the device being a good
laptop at all it's just more of an
additional
thing if you want to use it moving on to
performance we ran some Geekbench tests
and got a single course score of four
thousand and thirty seven and a
multi-core score of eight thousand and
thirty six we also ran an open CL test
and got an open sales score of 19107 so
you guys can go see how that compares
and contrasts against other computers
that are priced similarly or whatever
you may be using at the moment from what
we saw this is about on par with things
like the MacBook Air which the spectre
is clearly competing with and the
spectre actually came out quite a bit
faster on some of those tests in my
real-world usage it was definitely quick
very zippy got everything I needed to
done if you're gonna be a regular user
browsing the web creating documents
watching videos this laptop is gonna be
more than a quick enough and does a
really good job stacking up against the
competition and so those are the big
things that kind of shaped my overall
experience with the spectre x360 however
there were a couple of other small
features that I thought were awesome
very thoughtful and very helpful and
also define maybe who this product was
for features like quick charge allowing
the battery to charge up to 50 percent
in 30 minutes HP's sleepin charge mode
where the computer can be sleeping or in
the hibernation mode and still be
charging things plugged in like phones
or tablets via USB these features plus
the slim profile of the computer make me
really think that it's made for someone
who is traveling constantly on the go
and needs a super versatile device that
can be charged up very fast and charging
other devices when it's in your bag I
know what I'm traveling these features
are very welcome and would be greatly
appreciated let me know in the comments
down below who using this computer is
for is it for you if you're in the
market what does it have that you like
what is it missing that you would like
to see I'm very curious to hear so leave
us that comment down below I'm Ron
pretty from TechnoBuffalo thank you
again for watching and I'll see you guys
