from TechnoBuffalo and today we'll be
taking a look at android lollipop on the
nexus 9 and over I'll see what's new
with Google's latest Android operating
system so what Android lollipop you get
a ton of new features but probably one
of the most popular feature and the most
interesting one in Android 5.0 is your
new design language material design
basically everything you touch brings
something on to the screen or moves it
off so you know exactly where they're
coming from a lot of the google apps
have been redesigned to fit android
lollipop so material design language so
that means apps like Google music Gmail
and the photos that will have that
material design look everything you
touch animates and overall just looks
really cool now probably one of my
favorite features from some Android
devices like the g3 or the oneplus one
was the ability to double tap to wake
the device and when Android lollipop you
now have the ability to double tap to
wake the screen which is always an
awesome feature to have and now that
I've gotten used to this feature I
barely use a lock and unlock button on
my oneplus one and I could probably say
the same for the Nexus 9 the lock screen
for Android lollipop has changed quite a
bit too it looks a lot like Google now
scarred based system and all of your
notifications are displayed directly on
the lock screen you can archive an email
tap reply expand notifications to see
more information and so on now if you
don't want any of your sensitive
information on your lock screen you can
set them to be redacted when they show
up on a lock screen now probably one of
the best notification enhancement in
Android lollipop is something Google
calls priority mode it's a bit like Do
Not Disturb on iOS but it seems much
better here you can choose which apps
can still disturb you when priority mode
is enabled even better when you set it
Android gives you an option to set a
duration before it goes back into normal
notifications that way you won't forget
to switch it off so with Android
lollipop when you swipe down from the
top you get all your notifications in
one place and you also now have access
to your quick settings by swiping down
one more time the quick settings looks
much cleaner and simplistic than before
you have a few more handy new features
here like a shortcut for your flashlight
which wasn't in KitKat and a new
brightness slider which i think is more
useful than what we had before in KitKat
now Andrew does a lot of multiple user
accounts on tablets for a while now but
in lollipop there's a new option called
guest mode that works on both phones and
tablets the idea is that it creates a
clean safe and disposable workspace that
anybody can use your guests can even
quickly log into their account to check
emails and when
done using it you or your guests can get
rid of the data inside the guest account
at any time leaving no trace of
information from that guest session now
let's say guest mode is too much work
for you and your kid or friend just
wants to use an app on your tablet or
phone you can now pin apps which
essentially locks the app down and that
way your friend or kid won't go snooping
around your email or personal data it's
somewhat similar to guided access
feature in iOS but much better in my
opinion the multitasking view now is a
new name it's called overview and a new
material design look each app is a big
card stacked up and you can scroll
through many more recent app that you
use to be able to but the best feature
is that any app can create multiple
cards so for example when you compose a
new mail or do a google search you can
switch back and forth between tasks in a
single app when it comes to the home
screen your first impression of the home
screen likely won't be too different
from what it is now you'll still have
the same screen of apps and the same
status bar as before but the Google
search bar uses material design and the
soft navigation keys at the bottom look
different too
you get a bunch of new wallpapers which
all look beautiful and swiping right
still takes you to Google now which
looks almost the same except the
customization options reminders and
settings no longer live in the bottom of
the screen but now as an overlay menu
accessible by another swipe to the right
now moving on to the other cooler
features it wasn't a problem on the
Nexus 5 but non Nexus devices running
KitKat except for the Moto X couldn't
use ok Google Voice activation which
lets you dictate commands hands-free
lollipop is taking this feature one step
further by letting you do this when the
screen is turned off into phones lock
technically Google says that any phone
with the capable of digital signal
processors should be able to take
advantage of this new functionality
unfortunately unlike the new Moto X you
won't be able to use your own hot words
to activate the device Android lollipop
also features project Volta and a new
battery saver feature which essentially
cuts off a lot of activities data and
performance when a device gets down to
15% and so to sum it all up for you guys
it's hard not to be impressed by
Google's effort in building android
lollipop
it not only introduces a completely new
design but a bunch of new software
features that really improve the Android
experience overall it's one of the
biggest upgrades Android has seen yet
and it's definitely worth making the
jump when your device eventually gets it
