from TechnoBuffalo a busy busy Wednesday
in the tech world today februari second
we had the Apple and News Corp event at
the Guggenheim in New York City this
morning to announce the daily the
all-digital iPad daily newspaper 99
cents a week forty dollars a year you
can get all the news that rupert
murdoch's sees fit to print or to
publish I guess beamed to your iPad
every morning that we had the Google
event a little later in the day late
morning here California time in Mountain
View California at the Googleplex they
showed off a kind of an in-depth preview
of a droid 3 that oh honey comb I guess
not a preview but an event talking about
honeycomb the honeycomb was shown off on
the motorola xoom at CES early last last
month but I month ago in January but the
zoom is getting ready to hit probably
later this month Oh show cinco's got one
already so you know it's got to be
coming soon and then at Mobile World
Congress next month or rather in a
couple of weeks this month I get out of
play in a week from tomorrow are we from
friday i get my dates straight get on a
plane on februari 11th i believe it is
and i'll be headed over officially
kicking off on monday we for monday's so
stay tuned for that but they're going to
have all kinds of honeycomb tablet more
than 50 developers on hand in barcelona
showing off honeycomb optimized apps we
saw the CNN app for honeycomb today we
saw some google stuff gmail and video
chat on honeycomb we also saw the new
android market web store launch today
you can go check that out right now and
then also in-app purchases on android so
all kinds of stuff in the android
ecosystem in general but also
specifically for honeycomb for tablets
so here's my question to you what do you
think about all this tablet stuff a ipad
is the way to go ipad to whether or not
you care about this daily thing but you
know ipad 2 coming imagine we'll see you
know front-facing camera at least for
video chatting that kinda
thing be Google Android Honeycomb 30 all
kinds of form factor for factors but all
kinds of manufacturers you got the zoom
from Motorola 10-inch on verizon you got
the g slate t-mobile nine inch with the
3d technology the toshiba all the other
tablets coming from from google and it's
honeycomb partners or something else
entirely maybe it's HP webos john and i
will be at the webos event in San
Francisco a week from today for brewing
ninth will be covering it live expecting
to see the first webos tablets maybe
it's the BlackBerry PlayBook the
PlayBook very impressive all you do need
a blackberry phone to sync it with to
get the BBS services and stuff but the
PlayBook announces CES going to be
hitting sprint pretty soon maybe it's
that maybe it's something else entirely
maybe you know a windows 7 tablet or or
whatever's next from Microsoft maybe
it's me go maybe something else or maybe
you don't care about tablets you think
they're silly you just want a laptop so
you can really get some work done what
