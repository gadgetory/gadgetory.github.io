for you know it's been a while since i
posted a video but definitely a couple
more coming the first step update i
wanted to give was on my iphone it
actually stopped working on me about we
can have to go before i went away the
speaker stopped working people couldn't
hear me and I couldn't hear that
monocles started on a Friday one away
came back on saturday came back on
Sunday and Sunday afternoon had made an
appointment at the apple store the apple
tech checked it make sure wasn't dropped
a broken and actually are nice to have
to replace the phone so now using a
brand-new iphone which is working well
as well as the other one did before it
broke actually the battery life from
this one even seems to be a little bit
better so that was an update with that i
haven't had it hurt anybody else having
that problem so maybe was just unique to
mind and in preparation for leopard
launching tomorrow I went picked up a
500 gigabytes external hard drive my my
book western digital hard drive to use
with time machine it has to be at least
the size of your hard drive which is 160
gigs but the recommended is twice the
size of your hard drive so 500 gig
should be perfect and give me some room
for other storage the driving that I was
using was that little I can grab it for
it western digital passport this little
drive some 160 gigs so that's not going
to cut it for time machine so i'll just
use that as a traveling drive I need to
back some up and bring it somewhere so
guys I'm very excited about leopard
coming out tomorrow I will have it
tomorrow night and if your interests at
all show it to ya doing unboxing and
i'll use it i'll give you guys review
and if you're interested I'll show you
some screenshots and some video of me
using if you want so anyway that was it
guys nice and quick hope you're all are
doing well looking forward to showing
you guys leopard tomorrow and thank you

subscribing dr. guys soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
