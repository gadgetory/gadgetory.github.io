nowhere from technobuffalo calm and wow
you know by all accounts there's
probably never been a two-week period
like the current two-week period in the
world of tech news the latest and you
know it there was an earthquake in New
York yesterday so why not more
unexpected surprises Steve Jobs has
stepped down from his role as CEO of
apple press release came out today this
is my iphone would be a fanboy four
seconds my iphone original iphone box
from the iphone 4 gigabyte model iphone
14 gigabyte got the doc in here the
phone is somewhere else but the original
doc is in here anyway jobs announced
apple announced rather the senator press
release and the text of jobs letter of
resignation to the board today wednesday
the what is today the twenty twice x try
fourth party vote day today that steve
was stepping down effective immediately
he's been named chairman of the board of
directors and a long time apple chief
operating officer Tim Cook has been
named CEO and will also sit on the board
in his role as CEO and in jobs letter of
resignation he basically said that I if
the day came that he couldn't perform
his duties what was expected of him in
the role he would have to step down and
that day has come and you know whatever
whatever your views on Apple products
and the way they do business and
everything else there's no denying the
impact that Apple with jobs at its helm
has had on the world technology in the
world of business think about it go back
to the days when Jobs was ousted when he
was CEO and he was out
did and they're a bunch of different
CEOs and this is going way back 10 15
years something like that I'm
remembering that i was at i used to be a
teacher some of you might not know that
I used to I used to teach computers and
I used to live in New York and I was
teaching at a school in in Brooklyn when
the first fruit flavored I max came out
and there was their huge the kids were
all nobody'd seen anything like it in a
computer you know and it was a it was
huge everybody got all excited that's
when jobs really started turning the
company back around and you know went
from a point where the company was
really on its last what's last 90 days
before possibly being shut down and got
to the point now where a couple times in
the past couple weeks they've been the
most valuable company in the world
surpassing Exxon in terms of market cap
value that's just it's an amazing story
I mean again whatever you think of it
you know whatever your opinion on Apple
the products and steve job himself and
anything else it's just it's literally
an amazing story for better for worse
for whatever so from that perspective
alone it's huge news and personally you
know being I kid around call myself a
fanboy because enough people out there
call me fanboys and call TechnoBuffalo
you know some sometimes people call us a
an apple fanboy website of course we
sometimes get called you know in voice
of other stuff too comes with territory
but I've been an Apple user since I was
a kid at my elementary school in upstate
New York had an apple to be in the
library and then we got an apple 2e
eventually at home and then I went off
to college rise in high school and as
the editor sports editor of my high
school newspaper little known fact one
of the co editors in chief of my high
school newspaper is now a senior vice
president at Nvidia go figure bonus
points if you can name him anyway um but
we used a network of Apple Macs back in
it and Mac SE and then the mat classic
came out after that but you know we have
this whole what did they call local talk
network with all the Apple
little boxes that you would plug into
the back of the computer and then you
put a phone cord into them and that's
how they were network with a little
network of them that we did the school
newspaper on using a aldus pagemaker
before it got bought by Adobe and then
went off to college and had a bottom mac
it was a mat classic with a an image
image writer or style writer forget what
it was but there was a bundle that i got
and that was my computer at school until
when i was a senior i bought a
refurbished powerbook duo that's my
first laptop and that computer was
awesome like nine inch screen little
trackball totally portable is fantastic
at evident Mackey's are ever since I've
used Windows machines I taught for a
year I was the tech guy and computer
teacher in an all windows school I've
worked at jobs where we use Windows
machines I have a windows machine right
there and msi laptop running windows
vista but i use macs day to day and i
use them because i like the software
mainly they do look cool i think but for
me it's the software i like the way the
operating system works but more than
that i liked the video and audio editing
stuff on it so you know that's where I'm
coming from with all this but there's no
denying the impact of especially in the
last several years with iphone and now
ipad really really making its mark on on
the world of technology and the world at
large as mobile technology becomes a
more and more pervasive part of more and
more people's lives across the globe you
know when i started doing this you may
not know this but i am I keep saying all
these things you I think you think I'm
making this up I used to be a teacher or
I used to be this used to that but it's
all true I used to I started out in tech
writing writing for a little publication
called Mac directory it was a glossy
magazine came out four times a year
covered apple stuff and then I got a job
as a writer and then the reviews editor
for a website called powerbook
central.com and then I moved
on to start my my career covering mobile
tech which event eventually led me here
to technobuffalo and so I've been
covering this stuff for a long time and
you know it's just it's the Apple world
the cult of mac right there's a psycho
cult of mac Killian who works for
technobuffalo now also works for call to
Mack it really is it's a cult and the
cult has the comments gone from the
ipods with the white earbuds to the
iphone and out of the ipad and it's just
remarkable what they've done so the
impact i have my own trip down memory
lane there but i don't know I thought
maybe you could appreciate it because I
think there's stories like this
technologies become so personal for
people that stories like mine i'm sure
you know people have other choice i can
remember when i got my first calculator
watch i can remember when my dad bought
a used atari 2600 when i was home from
school with the pneumonia i was out sick
for two weeks with pneumonia and he
picked up a used atari to keep me
entertained while I was laid up on the
couch I played a lot of space invaders
you know i can remember these things i
can remember the apple 2e i can remember
my first laptop people have these
stories now with technology and when i
started covering mobile phones you know
full time the sony ericsson walkman
phones and the k-series and the nokia
nseries the n73 and 95 and 91 those were
the high-end amazing phones and rumors
started kicking around about apple doing
a phone and the whole thing an iphone
came out man and it just it changed
everything I was a skeptic at first I
was not a fan that was underpowered
overpriced closed ecosystem the whole
thing and I became a convert like many
people did and you know again whether
you're a fan or not the impact on the
industry just just undeniable so what
happens now a job stepping down
apparently he's still going to be
involved a lot in the big picture stuff
as chairman of the board but you have to
imagine and it doesn't take a lot of
reading between the lines to read his
letter of resignation this is very much
health-related he's been battling cancer
people know that the logos off that's
all right we don't need a logo you
um we just got that reflection of the
light bouncing on the screen back on in
my head but I its health related and if
you've known anybody who's battled
cancer or you know battled it and
survived or battled it and succumbed you
know it's a nasty nasty disease and I
would not wish cancer on even my worst
enemies and you know it's funny the
first thing this made me think of was a
teaching job the last teaching job I had
before I became a full-time reporter
blogger person was at a school we were
Mac school here in Oakland and I worked
there for two years and my boss it was
the director of technology during my
time there I contracted pancreatic
cancer pancreatic cancer and Wanda wound
up losing the fight he died within those
two years when I met him perfectly
healthy diagnosed with pancreatic cancer
fought it and died within those two
years and it's a it's just ironic that's
what it made me think of because of the
jobs cancer thing the Apple connection
and all that so um you know I wouldn't
wish cancer on anybody and you know
Steve may I may the rest of your days on
the planet be good ones may be healthy
and you know if you're not able to be
healthy may you enjoy it over time you
have left and the same goes out to
anybody was battling cancer or anything
else really but the point being that
it's health related and so you have to
kind of imagine without getting in
speculation that you know things are
pretty serious they've been serious for
a while but perhaps more serious and so
what happens now Tim Cook's been around
Apple for a long time you've seen them
and some of the keynote addresses and
the product launches coo you know you
have to think a company like this i mean
you know a company like this has a
product roadmap several years in advance
they have a bunch of products that will
probably never make it to retail they
have products that will make it to
retail they have strategies these
strategies go beyond
iphone 5 and ipad 3 you no longer range
strategies so um things probably won't
change all that much and they have so
much cash on hand you know the plans for
the new apple campus in cupertino
underway so much cash on hand but you
have to wonder what's going to happen
the fickle stock market already you know
in crisis the past several weeks not
just in the US but globally so how will
stock market react Apple stock trading
was halted after hours today just before
the news broke and see after wonder
what's going to happen with that and you
have to wonder what's going to happen
down the line you know the next slip-up
Apple has every company has slip-ups the
next slip-up they have will probably be
over scrutinized to the point of
craziness and so if the next product
isn't a home run if there's another
antennagate you know something like that
if Apple the next iPhone and the US does
wind up on sprint and or t-mobile and
their issues or it's not a raging
success or something you know that's
going to be under a microscope like like
like nothing ever has before and so
what's that going to do what's that
going to do to Tim Cook what's that
going to do the other people at Apple
what's that going to do to the
shareholders and and and mindshare you
know it's going to be interesting it's
going to be crazy but I down the road
you know is when the products that
aren't developed yet or the products
that are still in that phase of concept
and they might get approved am I not
that kind of thing you know jobs
notorious for being the guy who at the
end of the day says yeah we're doing
this no we're not this is good enough
this isn't I want to be like this I want
to be like that who's going to be that
person Tim Cook going to be that person
is Johnny I is going to be that person
is there somebody else inside of Apple
there's somebody else is going to come
in from the outside and sort of step
into that role and help out you know
it'll remains to be seen there's a you
know there's a handful of people in the
world leaders of industry leaders of
people who can do that thing be that
visionary and also be that kind of
personality you know nice to be around
or not
and by some reports jealous not
necessarily always nice to be around but
be that personality who can really drive
the ship and see the vision executed and
those people are kind of rare you know
so we'll have to see what happens it'll
certainly be interesting it'll be
interesting with everything else going
on in the mobile industry and the shift
towards you know tablets being hugely
popular right now but really only for
Apple me not only but predominantly for
Apple really if you look at the numbers
and is this a trend that's going to you
know eventually the other other players
in the space the android tablet makers
and the other companies will be shifting
towards you know like HP getting out of
the the pc hardware business moving
towards software only and enterprise and
the ones who can be competitive and
tablets will will be the new kings of
hardware or is it just a fad that will
fade out i don't know we'll see but it's
an interesting time anyway and now with
this news i'll tell you what it's been a
couple of weeks man google buys motorola
HP cans webos hardware don't forget the
fusion garage the grid 10 juju too and
you know and this news from apple just
craziness anyway if you're with me still
if you're still listening thanks for
listening thanks for you know wanted to
hop on here like i said i don't know if
SS in the other video john's over in
London so it's the middle of night right
now but I'm sure he will weigh in on the
subject in the days to come as well
everybody else in the herd we want to
you know we want to hear from you what
do you think is going to happen can
Apple not survive because they'll
survive for a while there's so much cash
on hand and so many great products
already out popular products um but can
they thrive without steve jobs at the
helm or you know what will happen very
curious to hear your thoughts hit us up
in the comments hit us up on twitter on
facebook of course on the website and
again you know steve jobs from for me
you as an Apple user is an apple fan
because i am thank you for all the
amazing cool
if you've brought into my life as a as a
geek as a nerd as a tech enthusiast and
tech reporter and you know may the next
innovator whoever you are step up and do
cool stuff because that's how it works
you know there's a there's one after
another after another that's how it goes
alright I'm rambling I can hear it in my
voice I heard a few minutes ago but I
had to keep going I'm gonna stop now
Steve be healthy there you go much much
more on this story and everything that
comes with it including you know
eventually the next iPad the next iPhone
the next whatever it is that Apple's got
up its sleeve and what all the other
players in the space up their sleeves
