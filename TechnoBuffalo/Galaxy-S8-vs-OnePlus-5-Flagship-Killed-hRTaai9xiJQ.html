thank our sponsors Zolo Liberty plus the
very first legitimately no compromise
wireless headphones get up to 48 hours
of battery life is graphy and inside of
these things that use the anchor battery
technology to make them last and last
and last things are absolutely
incredible fun to learn more about them
so they will be down below
time for an epic smartphone battle this
is the Galaxy s8 versus a one plus five
these are two incredible phones that
bring a lot of specs and a lot of
performance to the market
I put these two head-to-head and declare
a winner none of that cop-out whichever
one is best for you there are a lot of
categories you could have picked from
but I picked a seventh and I think some
up the phone's the best we've got design
screen software camera battery
performance and intangibles and we will
declare a winner design is a huge
category when it comes to phone it's a
big determining factor and you look to
buy most phones do the same stuff the
design can separate one phone from
another let's start with the Galaxy s8
got a really nice metal frame a glass
back glass front curved on both sides
it's almost all screens is infinity
display got an incredible 84 percent
screen to body ratio and it is super
thin at 8 millimeters the elongated
aspect ratio make its 5.8 inch screen
seemed kind of approachable it's not as
a giant behemoth as you would expect
fingerprint reader is located on the
back and we will definitely talk about
that despite looking and feeling really
nice does have a bit of a fragile feel
to it maybe I'm a little bit biased
admittedly there because I have dropped
and cracked a galaxy s 8 plus when it
comes to design
Samsung get this one out of the park so
I mentioned how thin the Galaxy s8 was
this thing is even thinner at seven
point two millimeters which is an
engineering marvel when you consider the
incredible specs that are packed in here
I've got a 5.5 inch screen with a screen
to body ratio of about 73 or 74 ish %
oneplus is said they wanted to do sort
of an infinity X so I didn't have the
resources to do it as I go through and
do this versus oneplus is a smaller
company going head-to-head toe-to-toe
against one of the behemoths of the
industry and they did an awesome job
I like the rounded edges on the back and
eyes aluminum so really good it kind of
has a feel of an old-school HTC phone
and a modern-day iPhone a huge
compliment to oneplus got a pretty
pronounced fingerprint reader on the
front which I'll talk more about but is
crazy fast it looks really nice and
there's no design slouch and so it's
going up against anybody else it might
have a chance when it comes to pure
design the Galaxy s8 is the clear winner
so next let's talk about screen this is
what you are looking at all the time
Green sucks your phone experience
they're going to suck no matter what
expect let's start with the s8 the cue
HD screen so it's 20 960 by 1440
resolution is not the whole story here
so don't think it's over because this
packs more pixels than the full HD
screen on the oneplus 5 pictures video
games when the phone is a static it's
like there's a sticker on it the best
way I can describe it it doesn't even
look real
more use the phone more I can appreciate
the incredible nurse of the screen
things can look and middlee a little bit
saturated I've gotten used to it and I
kind of like it that is going to be a
personal preference but one plus five is
a really nice job with this display so
it's full HD it's 1920 by 1080 it's an
optic AMOLED panel which is really solid
the 401 PPI it's an evolution of the
three T's display but does give a lot of
customization options support things
like srgb DCI p3 a one caveat I want to
mention here is if er is important to
you the low resolution is not really
going to lend itself to any sort of VR
experience so the full HD panel on the 1
plus 5 is good and it skims even say
it's great perhaps not as good and not
as great as the best in the industry the
Galaxy S state same issue we ran into
talking about design the Galaxy s8 takes
a category before you start screaming
and yelling at me in the comments let's
go into the next category in that
software Samsung TouchWiz is used to be
the biggest knock on wood used to be
pretty awesome hardware it was bloated
it was cartoony and made the phone slow
but since the Galaxy s6 Samsung I think
it turned a pretty big corner as of this
filming it's based on Android 7.0 and
it's surprisingly solid actually prefer
to use this versus what I usually use a
Nova Launcher on most other Android
devices to give it a gives you a clean
kind of Nexus style launcher which I
appreciate
they've downplayed the cartoony aspects
of this a lot and they've done a lot of
nice UI tweaks you're definitely not
going to mistake this UI for stock
Android but just look and perform well
on its TouchWiz that aspect of TouchWiz
gets you away from Samsung in the past
definitely worth looking at oh what's
software on oneplus I was a huge fan of
cyanogen when oneplus
first launched I shed a nerd here when
they ditched it I went for own oxygen OS
which was a little bit half-baked when
it first launched but much like touch
with oxygen OS is really coming to its
own the 1+5 least ads of shipping based
on android 7.1.1 so almost the most
recent version of android and it looks
and feels like stock where the pod of
customization you can choose to the
advantage of or just sort of leave it
and get a really nice really close the
stock Android experience if you decide
to dig into the settings you're going to
find a lot of really cool options to
make this phone your own things like a
reading mode night mode gestures
launcher settings Vegas might even be a
more complete OS and you can Android
itself oneplus hasn't always been the
best with updates so bear that in mind
but this has a stock feel and it kind of
seems like a hybrid between Nova and
just naked nude Android and for me that
is a winning combination I love what
oneplus did oxygen OS this is a clear
winner for the 1+5 all right so let's
jump in and talk about camera this could
probably be a 13th 45 minute video on
its own but I tried to hit the
highlights a little cliche but the best
camera is the one you have with you and
 Cesare you're gonna have your phone
with you so camera is a big determining
factor in which phone people buy the
galaxy si I think it's a big omission
from Samsung not putting a dual sensor
setup on the back of the phone a lot of
the competition has including the
oneplus live that doesn't hold a 12
megapixel sensor back too much pictures
are awesome in normal light
I think this shines in low light so it's
clean high ISO and processing the glow
light shop looks surprisingly good but
the less like that's there the more
artifact you're going to have that's not
unique to the Samsung on it's kind of
true with any camera but really good in
low-light photos are a little bit warm
and kind of contrast yet that's personal
preference they make colors look a bit
brighter
I like it you may not also oh is is a
huge help on the video side and also
eight to those low-light shots and if
you want to get in save photos as raw
when it comes to camera on the oneplus 5
this is really what they're selling it
can blaze into two separate times on the
box they want you to know this is an
incredible camera and it definitely is
it's got two sensors the usual setup you
see with those tools
got a wide angle and a telephoto and I
couldn't mention at this point they
pretty much just ate the iPhones camera
UI which they did but the good UI and it
works well here and just realize impact
the camera fidelity for the longer focal
length in distant portrait mode is nice
to have but the portrait images look
crazy artifact II does not look real at
all you don't get that natural K effect
I think they're trying to go for I
magically fixed with software but if you
want this over portrait mode I would not
rely on this for it at least as of
shipping solo like shot suits are
important to me did not come out as well
on the 1 + 5 maybe there's a lack of oh
is that really impacts the pictures got
a smaller than point 2 micron pixels in
here as well the things just looked
artifacting grainy and not nearly as
clear this one was kind of a tough one
for me to call like you add a
flexibility of the wide-angle and
telephoto by myself taking a lot of
low-light pictures though and again as a
dad that's where a lot of my photos are
taken think which is my kid sleeping
image in Italy is a little bit creepy
but I really like to have a camera
that's good in low-light the addition of
oh is on the galaxy s 8 and a little bit
of a better front-facing camera as well
I mean this round is surprisingly going
to go to Samsung your phone's only going
to be as good to you as long as it's
working the battery life is I think it's
an important category as well the Galaxy
s8 has a 3000 milliamp hour battery
which is good but not great we recharge
me a wireless charging or quick charge
and generally in my usage which is
surprisingly heavy by end of the day I'm
around 25 to 30% now your usage is going
to vary but I'm pretty tough on my phone
there's a lot of YouTube watch and
there's a lot of social media a lot of
pictures being taken a lot of things
running in the background which is
pretty impressive considering the amount
of pixels thing is pushing and the
processor that is going along with this
a battery expect to be a huge difference
on the one plus five that's got to be
the trade-off for having a 1080p screen
a little bit of a bigger battery so it's
got that going for it at 3300 milliamp
hours and it was better than the Galaxy
s8 but not by giant leaps and bounds
it's about 10 percent better than what I
got on the Galaxy s8 so 35 to 45 percent
I probably could have pushed that a
little bit more and gone for
almost two days of battery usage Jen I
got my display set about 50% I think
that is where the 1+5 tends to shine
if battery is going to be important to
you there may be better battery savings
phones out there but if you want a phone
it's going to last a lot longer than the
competition at least so one puts five
did a really nice job with that you got
to decide if that trade-off is worth it
do you want the extra pixels of a Galaxy
s8 or another flagship phone you want a
really solid screen with the admittedly
better battery life
the oneplus five offers battery life was
very clear winner here going back to the
one part so this category I've added
from our last verses performance I
generally don't do this because every
phone now it tends to feel fast it's
hard to find a phone that feels slow and
the Galaxy s8 certainly does not feel
slow Snapdragon 835 eight gigs of ram
almost up-to-date version of Android is
an incredibly fast phone there's still a
few things that slow it down that bother
me like I try and search for a stick
allow for the keyboard to pop up but
overall it is a very fast experience
whether I'm playing games or browsing
the web or scrolling pretty rarely do I
notice and you slow down and then on the
1 + 5 the version we have is packing and
insane 8 gigabytes of RAM I get the RAM
it's different than your laptop but let
that sink in a lot of computers out
there I'd wager don't have a gigabytes
of RAM in them it is an insane amount to
pack into a phone I'm not even sure
Android take advantage of the full
amount of RAM all of that couple of the
Snapdragon 835 you've got a recipe for
it incredibly fast phone and it is in
fact I noticed how zippy it was and
perhaps maybe with psychosomatic joiners
8 gigabytes of RAM in here but
everything on this phone just felt that
even that same thing that bogged down
surprisingly the galaxy had bait trying
to pull the keyboard searching for an
app team fat it might be attributed to
oxygen no a source of TouchWiz I don't
know but everything felt quick zippy and
in other words like used to describe
fastness felt that on the 1 + 5 so if
you're keeping track at home we are all
tied up 3 2 3 heading into the last
category and that is intangible than
both these phones bring a ton of in
tangibility to the table on the estate
side you've got things like wireless
charging iris scanning Fisher
recognition a headphone jack Samsung pay
absolute killer screen expandable
storage and you can buy it on all four
carriers on the one plus five side
you've got just insane performance
you've got - charging way better value
for the price if you're not buying ideal
on the galaxy s 8 and there are a lot of
deals to be had on those phones got
better audio headphone jack as well it's
got more band support and it is dual SIM
for me though violin charging is a big
one for me waterproofing also someone
who's dropped their phone and water the
big one to have this is a tough one to
call but a tangible for me go to the
Galaxy s8 so we've got a winner by four
to three the Galaxy s8 takes this crown
there's a big testament though to 1+4
phone that is at least full retail price
about two hundred dollars less to
compete with a flagship from Samsung one
of the largest manufacturers in the
world damn impressive what 1 plus has
done they didn't build a perfect phone
they built a really good phone I would
have loved things like waterproofing and
a high-resolution display but those
things drive the price up oneplus is
trying to find a nice value price versus
performance and they struck a really
nice balance I love doing use versus
videos let me know down below which
verses you want to see come up next our
last time we did was the Galaxy s8
versus the iPhone 7 if you want to check
that out you guys agree with me am i way
off base leave in the comments and let
me know I want to hear from you we'll
have the whole discussion about it until
next time I'm John Ranger from
TechnoBuffalo
we took these two mobile units and put
them head-to-head which is not easy to
do but one thing that is easy is to
finally tell you there is a legit no
compromise wireless headphones outs if
you sick of bad battery life or doesn't
stay in your ear or the audio fidelity
sucks the Zolo liberty plus have you
covered these things have a ton of
Technology and teeny tiny little earbud
size packages so the first big thing to
know about the liberty plus to get to 48
hours of battery life which is
absolutely insane and beyond that
they've got alexa built in so just tap
your Liberty plus ask Alexa what the
weather is as
your shopping list whatever you want her
to do she can do for you want to take a
pair of these up and if you're in the
market for wireless headphones you
should really consider these you get the
kick starter price for 99 bucks for the
price jumps up to a hundred and
forty-nine bucks
