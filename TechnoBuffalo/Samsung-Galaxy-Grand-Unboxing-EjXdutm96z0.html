TechnoBuffalo yours an unboxing of one
of the coolest phone you've probably
never heard of this is the samsung
galaxy grand available only unlocked it
slots in between size-wise between the
galaxy s3 and the galaxy note 2 but it's
got a pretty neat trick it's got two SIM
card slots let's go ahead open it up dig
in see what it does
so here is the box for the galaxy grand
although Samsung should call it the
galaxy about 400 bucks since that is
what it costs it looks pretty much like
every other samsung galaxy box that
comes unlock the galaxy s3 and the note
2 or what pictured advise on the front
like and suspiciously like it's big
brother the galaxy s3 and I say big only
from a specs standpoint from screen size
standpoint this guy is right in between
the s3 in the note 2 with a 5 inch
screen so let's go ahead and bust out
the scissors and while I am doing that
let me thank our friends who sent this
device to us Negri electronics that's
where we get all of our unlock devices
from and you guys should to link to them
if you want to pick this guy up is going
to be down below but of course check
their site for pricing pricing always is
changing so go ahead and peel off the
plastic ceremoniously looks like I'm
doing a little bit of my electronic
strip tease here you can't see through
it so it's super fancy alright so galaxy
grand we'll go ahead and open it up the
big deal here this guy is it's duos
technology it's got not one SIM card
slot which is for suckers
it's got two which is for not suckers so
I'll talk a little bit about why you
might want to do a sim card slot in just
a moment us guy shipping with Android
4.1.2 onboard and there it is looks like
a small note to or a large galaxy s3 and
Samsung's made it easier for us that
they put all the specs right on here it
is a dual-core 1.2 gigahertz chip with a
5.0 1 inch screen that's WVGA ton as a
point which means a resolution of just
480 by 800 but does have a make pixel
camera
something we don't really see very often
to SIM slots let's take a look around
the device looks like the back of a
Galaxy s3 with Samsung's plastic back
that we seem pretty much everywhere but
the duo's branding up top letting you
know that it is indeed dual-core camera
on this guy is an 8 megapixel affair
that gets you 1080p video and a 2
megapixel sensor on the front got multi
window support like the note 2 which is
also cool no NFC video Bluetooth 4.0
push it off to the side for just a
second see what else we are going to
have in our samsung galaxy grand box
Quick Start Guide for you know it
getting started quickly and a day NCO
rapido which I'm gonna use my keen
translating skills to mean Quick Start
Guide getting started quickly so here is
the battery which is a twenty one a
hundred milli amp hour battery which
should be plenty
we've got ear bones yeah with ear buds
and inline mics I always like to see
different earbud sizes so if you got
weird freak tiny ears or big ears you're
gonna be set we've got a US wall work
which is kind of interesting
this phone is primarily being sold
overseas I believe it's available in
India on a carrier but nice to see a US
charger in there and then of course
we've got now the cable everybody's got
a billion of the micro USB cable push
all that business off to the side
come here business you go off to the
side let's go ahead and pop in the
battery and talk about this phone all
right I will
seductively pull off the plastic of the
back of this let's try to go and it's
off that's another little piece under
there too and it's that same plastic
back we've seen on most of Samsung
devices
I assume the screen is going to come off
the same way or the back rather is going
to come off the same way they're gonna
find a little indent which lives on the
left-hand side pop this sucker office
where things should get interesting
so there's your micro SD card slot for
obviously expanding your storage gigs
internal but here are two sim card slots
so why would you want to sim slots well
if you live in a place where you travel
different countries and you want to use
your SIM card that used for home for
making phone calls another one
internationally for data it's a great
reason if you want to combine work in
business it's going to be another good
reason to have two SIM cards I've never
actually used a phone with two sims so
kind of curious to check this sucker out
and see how it works and see if it's
actually practical would you guys use a
phone with two sims there aren't that
many out there I believe there's a
version that note two actually which has
two sims as well it certainly is a niche
product but it's a niche it's been
around for a while so it certainly is a
need for it so go ahead and pop this
battery and I assume we'll see a pretty
standard TouchWiz 4 interface again
we've got Android 4.1.2 shipping on this
guys let's power it on put all the
battery back pill out screen protector
and we'll talk a little bit more about
the phone there we go it is booting up
Android technology and that guy is off
the screen so I've got the same
capacitive buttons we've seen on most
Samsung devices hidden under here we've
got a menu button and a back button one
giant home button volume rocker up and
down on the left on the right got power
and lock there you go the buttons sort
of showed up for a minute while it's
booting up on the bottom noise
cancelling mic and your charging and
sync courts on the top three point five
millimeter headset jack and another
noise cancelling mic speaker grille is
on the back eight megapixel camera and
LED flash looks like the back is
textured but just take my word for it
it's not it just looks that way so go
ahead and do the setup here and we'll
come right back alright so you've got
the phone all powered up the ready to go
and I want to wreak Lera fie something
that I said earlier so only one SIM card
is actually HSPA+ the other one is 3g
but you can use both for data or voice
so nothing here all that excitement we
haven't seen but something new is in
settings a SIM card manager you can set
what each SIM card does so you receive
in some coming calls on sim one or have
data you sim 2 or dual SIM always all we
can receive calls from both SIM cards
even during calls which is kind of neat
so you can really do a ton of different
things with two different SIM cards here
everything else though is pretty
standard TouchWiz nothing that we
haven't seen I'll definitely the lower
Ellucian exact con certainly look big
but screen resolutions not your thing
there's plenty of specs here to keep
this guy running gig of ram a dual core
processor and of course that fun 2 SIM
cards so love to know what you guys
saying something that you use not use or
what use you might have for it I'm very
curious to check it out
anyway thank you again to our friends at
Negri electronics are hooking us up with
yet another awesome device to show you
I'm John renter from TechnoBuffalo be
sure to check us out for leticia
