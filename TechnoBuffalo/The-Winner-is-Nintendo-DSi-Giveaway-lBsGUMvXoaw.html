the winner of the nintendo dsi giveaway
this was to commemorate hitting 20,000
subscribers and was just a way for me to
say thank you for your support for
watching my videos even the ones you
don't like for your comments and for
just for everything it really does mean
the world to me so thank you overall we
had well over 3,000 comments left on the
video the video is actually even
featured on the YouTube homepage which
was certainly pretty cool so before I
get to the winner let me go over some
kind of ground rules it's very hard i'm
finding to do wit contest and keep it as
fair and impartial as possible you know
doing a comment contest like this it's
next to impossible to know if any
comments people were leaving that's why
I didn't say you know just leave once I
did try and keep it fair what I did was
I took all the comments people left and
I faced them all into a Word document I
put about 20 per page and about 150
pages I then used a random number
generator to pick a page number and then
use that same number generator to pick a
comment number on that given page and
that's how I determine the winner I got
a lot of emails people ask him for the
d/s and I heard a lot of stories so
thank you for sending those I really do
appreciate it but to keep everything
kind of as fair and impartial as
possible I did have to use and random
number generator if I was giving this
away you know just bits on a personal
story you know that would have been
possible to choose when so many people
out there wanted it people you don't
need it but again I come and give it to
one so if you didn't win don't be
disappointed I have plenty of new
giveaways coming up in the path I give
it away a flip minnow an LG view and now
the nintendo dsi i have a lot more
really cool things that are on level
with this or even better coming up so
you know be sure to stick around and
stay tuned because hopefully you'll win
one of those if I could guys I would
give each and every one of you to help
me get the 20,000 in Nintendo I think
you all deserve it and unfortunately you
know just can't so the winner of the
nintendo dsi without any further ado is
twitter user Jack me not a joke Jack me
jcm I and his or her youtube name is Jax
1511 I did confirm that they are a
subscriber and following me and did go
through and leave all the previous
qualifications and did here to them and
I went through and did another search on
the comments and they actually only left
one which is actually pretty rare so I
guess that shows that system maybe it'll
work a little bit so if you are the
winner of this I will contact you i'll
send you a personal message and i'll
send this I don't know where in the
world you're located but wherever you
are this will be yours and it will be on
its way tomorrow so thank you guys again
for your support for entering and be
sure to stick around because a lot more
contests coming up any guys i'm jon
rettinger and i will see you in the next
video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
