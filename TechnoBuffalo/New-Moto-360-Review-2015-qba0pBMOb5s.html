watch is back with a vengeance but is it
a worthy successor I'm Mar person /
technobuffalo and this is the new Moto
360 I am an early adopter at heart so
when the first moto 360 came out I was
pretty rabid to get my hands on one I
missed basically every online order and
I called countless best buys but I
finally found one that had him in stock
so I was really excited to get one and
in its infancy Android wear didn't
really have a whole lot to it and that
kind of became really clear really
quickly but now that it's been given
some time to mature a year later is my
favorite thing to have on my wrist the
new Moto 360 is definitely an
incremental update to the original but
it's enough to make you take a pretty
close look let's talk about the changes
to talk about what stayed the same the
first thing you're going to notice is
the addition of lugs to the new watch
face the new body the lugs allow for
much much easier quick release band
changing which is now easier than it's
ever been it's a more free hanging strap
now too and it alleviates the issue that
many first gen users had with the
plastic backs on the back of the face
they were cracking if you're wearing
them too tight that's no longer an issue
the next thing you're going to notice is
that the button has moved from the three
o'clock to the two o'clock position on
the face and the button itself is
actually a lot click ear I don't push
the button very often but compared to
the last year's one it's not quite as
bushy it's got a really good bit of
travel and it clicks nice and loud
nothing has changed in terms of
functionality with the buttons though
the watch face also retains the same
dimensions as last year's model with the
exception of being point 1 millimeters
less wide so thinner on the you know
horizontal spectrum but not on the
thickness spectrum the processor in the
old 360 was just a little single core
texas instruments omap three at one
gigahertz this new model is sporting a
quad-core Snapdragon 400 yes quad-core
in a watch and the difference is
striking my old 360 was super laggy
already and the signs of age were really
starting to show the new one is snappy
zippy quick and any other words that
might mean
asked the device is easily twice as
responsive as last year's model granted
that's anecdotally I didn't do any
actual tests to see how much faster it
is but in everyday use you are
absolutely going to notice the change in
the processor the major pain point for
last year's 360 was the inconsistent
battery life or at the very least
consistently poor battery life I'm very
very happy to report that the battery
capacity has been upped from 322 400
million powers so between that a more
efficient processor moderate to high
usage I'm able to get through a full
day's usage with about fifty percent
left in the tank believe it or not this
is actually what is expected Motorola
claims one point five full days of use
without the ambient display turned on in
one full day with the ambient display
turned on granted it wasn't ever a
gigantic pain point for me on last
year's model because I didn't use it
with ambient mode turned on but I'm
really happy to see that it's something
that I no longer have to worry about and
if you were holding off on the first 360
for a better battery life then now is
the time to do it the men's large model
which is what we have for review ways in
measures in maybe at one point five six
inches with a resolution of 360 by 330-4
a PPI of 233 the smaller one point three
seven inch model is just a little bit
more dense in terms of pixels at 263
because of its smaller face housing the
almost identical resolution of 360 by
325 the higher PPI screen is totally
welcome I didn't anticipate it making a
big difference and it sort of really
doesn't but it doesn't mount to a more
premium feeling device then of course
there's the ever so polarizing flat tire
which is very much still present for me
it's really not a big deal the flat tire
allows for a very small bezel and a high
screen to bezel ratio it makes things
look silly sometimes but it's really
nothing egregious it doesn't change the
functionality at all so I don't consider
it a deal breaker if you don't like the
flat tire obviously this isn't the watch
for you but for me it means that small
bezel and that nice big screen so it
really doesn't bother me all that much
ambient mode is something that I'd
considered a luxury until now I never
had it activated on my old model and
even if I did it's still insisted on
deciding on when it should be on and
when it shouldn't be the new one however
I've had ambient mode turned on since
I've gotten it and it still makes it
through a full day on the battery while
staying on all the time to boot plus the
accelerometer is much much more accurate
the display always wakes up from ambient
mode when it slipped it to my face or
even just looked it a little bit plus
the wrist flicking gestures work work
much much more reliably than they ever
did on last year's model the price has
gone up from the initial MSRP of 250
from last year's to three hundred
dollars for this year and that goes all
the way up to four hundred thirty
dollars for any other bells and whistles
that you might want like bands and
changing the actual material for the
body aside from the price everything
else is as it was in the original we're
still looking at four gigs of storage
half a gig of ram a heart rate monitor
microphone and it is still ip67 water
resistant which by the way does not mean
that you can swim with it as past me
would have been very happy to know as
far as looks go I'm definitely more of a
function over form kind of guy so I like
something that's a little more
utilitarian understated especially when
it comes to a watch you know I'm not a
watch guy I don't want a really flashy
thing I'm not looking for anything
beyond a great watch that tells me a lot
of information without having to look at
my phone so the 360 fits right in with
that I'm super happy to wear it on my
wrist plus I wanted something circular
that's why I went with the first 360
against you know what one of the other
models that were square that were out
last year if you are looking for
something flashy err though you can
always motor maker up something in gold
or with a different band if that's
something that you are after in terms of
software where 1.3 is finally something
that I feel really comfortable
recommending to Android users well some
apps are certainly rough around the
edges all the new interactive watch
faces really make where feel very
futuristic to me the together watch face
can be used to link up another moto 360
user or Android wear user just like the
Apple watch to sensitively little
doodles photos current transit status
can use this with my wife for example so
when I leave for work my little face on
her
watch we'll have a little bike right
next to it because I'm biking on my way
home it really feels cool to feel like
you have someone especially your
significant other just sitting right
there on your wrist to be reached out to
at the touch of a button or I guess
finger touch of a screen overall I'm
really really happy with the quality of
the new Moto 360 and the improvements
they've made I'm not quite sold on the
price point though I bought the first
model at full price for 250 when it came
out because I really want to be one of
the first people with a SmartWatch but
for this incremental upgrade I can't
really recommend upgrading if you have
the first model because the changes are
pretty evolutionary once the price comes
down I think then it's a total
no-brainer or if you're in the market
for something new if it's your first
SmartWatch this is absolutely a great
one to pick up even at the full price of
three hundred bucks there you have it
guys there are my thoughts on the brand
new Moto 360 4 2015 I was really excited
to see that it lived up to my
expectations because I was really really
excited to play with this thing let us
know in the comments if there's another
watch that you'd like me to compare the
360 to or if there's another watch that
you want to make sure that we cover
definitely let us know down there on the
way to the subscription button which you
can click on if you want to get these
videos directly to your inbox as they
come out as always thank you guys so
much for watching be kind to one another
and i'll catch you in the next video
of course let me know in the comments if
there's another watch you guys want me
to compare this to we're going to be
looking at a handful more as they hit
before man that was a good take two</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
