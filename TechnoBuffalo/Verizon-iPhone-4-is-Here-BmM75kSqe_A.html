technobuffalo here and January 11th has
come and gone on with a bit of
excitement but mostly a whimper verizon
announced the iphone for today and
that's it they just announced the iphone
4 which i guess is a pretty big
announcement this guy has been rumored
in the tech world for years really ever
since the first iphone debuted in 2007
i've called it the Loch Ness monster the
Sasquatch the unicorn of the tech world
well we have now discovered all of those
and the iphone four for verizon is now
with us or will be very soon the
conference just ended subsea me look
down so i got some notes in front of me
alright so let's go ahead and get
started let's talk about all the release
stuff that you want to know it's going
to be available the very beginning of
februari on februari third existing
customers can pre-order on februari 10th
you can be able to pick one up if you're
not existing customer at a verizon store
at an apple store or get it online so if
everybody 10th is our movie state can be
very third I'll be pre-orders for
existing customers it's going to cost
199 for the 16 and 299 for 32 hotspot is
going to be included which is actually
pretty cool for up to five devices
verizon would he want to emphasize how
ready they were for the iphone to be on
their network it was really a subtle
knock at the other carrier they've said
they've tested they've tested it tested
they are ready for the data hungry they
didn't announce plans but it's presumed
to believe that these will fall in under
their unlimited plans as well we can
amend this though as the plan to get
released so the verizon iphone is here
are you excited are you going to switch
over it is not 4g LTE unfortunately it
is a cdma only iphone to going to get
all your full iphone is on a cdma ev-do
rev a connection i personally enough
however it is and does look just like an
iphone 4 including that will break on
the antenna on the left-hand side just
minus a sim card slots you're going to
get all the iphone 4 features that you
either love or loathe the retina display
your gift FaceTime all
stuff and is essentially just an iphone
4 on verizon so this really begs a good
question of what's gonna happen with the
iphone 5 really cycle we generally see
new iphone every June or July it
Verizon's got a new phone februari not
going to put up a few months behind 18t
for every phone that comes out I think
that sort of has yet to be seen so the
big question here are you going to run
jump and skip to verizon are you going
to stick with AT&amp;amp;T it's probably going
to make things a bit easier for AT&amp;amp;T as
the people really stop using their
network and the people that I've
continued to use it I will be able to
suck up some of that available bandwidth
I hope we get the much-improved
connection so it should be interesting
to see I think it's a win-win situation
for everyone ultimately for AT&amp;amp;T
certainly for verizon and obviously for
the consumers and I guys I am jon
rettinger from technobuffalo at the
recap of the finally verizon iphone I'll
see you guys the next video bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
