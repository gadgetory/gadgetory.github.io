technobuffalo here and i am excited to
announce the winners of our inspire 4g
giveaways but in camera frame i'm
experimenting with some new lighting
here so hopefully it's not gonna make me
look like an oompa loompa are we
partnered with the folks from AT&amp;amp;T
starting contests on februari 8th to
help promote their talk and surf
challenge letting people know that of
course on 18 sees network you can boat
talk and surf if you want to get more
information or show your support for
them I check out facebook.com / 18 key
link down below so all you had to do to
enter this you wanted to make it super
easy was just leave a comment I'm a
technical Buffalo article made it nice
and simple for us to track now I know
what you're going to say these phones
are I know you're saying second here
dear phones are locked to the US and the
audience is outside of us so what I
wanted to do to try and open this up to
the world was at our own expense if
someone outside the US won and assuming
you had a paypal account we were going
to send you two hundred and fifty
dollars us that I might not be enough to
buy a new phone wherever you are but
it's still 250 bucks that you didn't
have yesterday so I hope you guys enjoy
um I am so lucky to have an audience
that's global and TechnoBuffalo has got
a following that's global and I didn't
want to limit everybody and I didn't
want to limit the giveaway it's a chance
always giveaways arisa just a chance for
me to say thank you I get reviewed
technology for a living which in my mind
for free geek at heart is such an
amazing blessing and I wake up with just
a giant Czarist probably scary grin on
my face the fact that you guys give me
the opportunity to do this so it was my
way of saying thank you so thank you
enough with the mushy stuff let's go
ahead and get to the winners we had
almost 20,000 comments for the giveaway
only about 17,000 member Val
because the other two thousand ish were
entered after the deadline expired which
kind of sucks but rules are rules so I
exported all the comments put them in an
excel sheet use random.org to pick the
numbers it was completely random Tim you
guys left some really funny jokes in the
comments I tried to go through and read
them all or much as i could 20,000 was a
lot but the winners were pitched
completely today at random and in
addition to the inspire 4G that we're
giving away we also had back comprises
more free stuff yay oh we have three jaw
bone icon headsets and I did the same
thing here that I did with the inspires
you for outside the US and you win and
you have a paypal account which is one
of the conditions will send you 50 bucks
um which is kind of neat so if everybody
outside the US wins gonna be expensive
um but we kept it totally random and it
was sort of just our way again to say
