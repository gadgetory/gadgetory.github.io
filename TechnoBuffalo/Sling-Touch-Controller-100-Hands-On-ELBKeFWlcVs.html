basically what it does is takes the
basically everything you can see
everything you can do with a traditional
remote through the on screen interface
and gives you all those features in the
touch screen device itself rather than
you know pull up the guide on screen and
stroking and scroll through the nine
thousand channels i have paid now it on
my touch screen remote i can set up
filters which are basically like
favorites and I say okay I want to see
all of the movies better on right now
please go out that on the screen against
a guy yeah exactly because only
supported through the cable pyretic
right right it's an OEM product and so
we sell it into TV service providers
because integration that has to be done
on the set top box we have to rinse off
with a bunson set-top box have you
announced any partnership did for a
predator no I think nothing announced
yet nothing else here so right so right
now we're looking at all the movies on
now we can say okay turn HD on I only
want to see high-def movies
connect over Wi-Fi Wi-Fi yeah what's
this act is always a little scary when
your devil in here with Wi-Fi with the
size of the screen 4.3 a shape a
sodastream capacitive touch or 80 x 272
sig would run the satiric see the sides
of the boat that's great then it's got a
nice big battery in there too to poor
shooting for about 10 hours of active
use what decides the battery I want to
say 1700 milliamp and it just has a dock
connector right yep just pop this guy in
the dock and it'll actually you can use
it while it's it was designed to be able
to be easily as well as charged the
experiment
this was a first look at the sling touch
control anything else yeah so one of the
other key features of the product not
only can you control your DVR it's also
a full Universal ir remote so i can
program the hard buttons to control my
TV volume of mute also if I had a sony
blu-ray player on my rack for example i
can add control the sony blu-ray player
some of my living room i say alright
well now i want to use my sony blu-ray
player pops up at owens from her you
know my actual physical sony remote not
on launch so it's definitely something
the lat later on down the road but on
launch we're just going to give you the
basic ability to load the different
remote in control them the signal smoke
very impressive thank you very much
