technobuffalo calm and i'm here with a
playthrough of journey so journey is a
unique game it's from that game company
to the same folks that broad PlayStation
Network flower and flow their games in
general are unique the kind of challenge
what's consistently thought as gaming
experience so this title check centered
around two to three hours i played
through it once and that's what's going
to allow me to do what i do halfway
through this playthrough here and you'll
see what I'm talking about when i get
there but i'm i'm gonna do this
playthrough a little bit differently i'm
not going to narrate the entire time or
talk to you guys about the game because
the game kind of it speaks for itself I
actually really want to bike in this
game a lot probably a lot more than I
even thought it was essentially and as
you're seeing unfold on screen here
you're dropped in a desert and you're
presented with a destination that's a
mountain in the distance that's it
you're just told to go the game gives
subtle cues obviously as to where you
should be going and how you should
proceeding and it kind of teaches you as
you go along but it doesn't beat you
over the head with instruction I mean
what you just saw there the controller
on screen that's pretty much the most
instruction you're going to get it does
have cutscenes but there's no dialogue
you're not beat over the head with
narrative but there is a story here and
I really won't get into the story at all
of this game because it's probably aside
from the aesthetics and the way it's
played the story is probably one of the
best parts of the title and that's
something I certainly did not expect so
as I descend from this mountain you're
gonna see or this dune you're going to
see the title of the game obviously and
then you're going to see me kind of
explore the desert and head to this big
open circle area so within that circle
area typically that's where you just
proceed to your next step in the journey
but since I completed the game that's
the chapter selection hub so you're
gonna see me kind of stand there and go
off to the left and go into a room I'm
actually picking my favorite space in
this game I just wanted to show you guys
what
it's like and when you actually get to
that level that that area that I'm going
to take us to something special is going
to happen but I'll tell you about that
when we get there for now just enjoy a
little bit of the aesthetics of journey
also keep in mind that we did an
interview with Austin Wintory the game's
composer so the music you're hearing in
the background we actually have an
article on TechnoBuffalo calm it was an
exclusive interview we did several
months back and I'll get the guys when
they post this to youtube to pop that
link in the video description so it
should be below right now if it's not I
don't know what I'm gonna do so stay
tuned to watch the play through journey
and I'll be back once we get halfway
through
okay so here we go this is the level
selection that I was talking about at
the beginning of the play through so and
again this is probably one of my
favorite parts of the entire game it's
absolutely gorgeous and towards the end
especially which I probably won't be
talking over that portion but you'll
know what i mean when you see it but
this is the special thing that i was
talking about it we're about to get to
it but in journey the multiplayer is
handled probably unlike any other game
I've ever played there is a multiplayer
component you can play with two players
at once but you'll never know the other
person's username and you won't be able
to speak with them to a microphone
sounds weird I guess and if you're used
to communicating in those traditional
ways obviously as we all are it might
seem almost like a turn off at first but
it's totally not the way that the game
is played it actually works we don't see
the other player yet I'm when I go
through a big jump you'll see them not
this week a different name job but the
way that we communicate once we realize
that that we're together in a space is
really unique will wind up seeing each
other and then using that pulse you get
that pulse by hitting the circle button
when we see each other we'll start to
work together and kind of move together
in the same space and it's a really
unique I've never actually had anything
quite like it and this is actually the
first time that I ever bumped into
someone was when I was reporting this
playthrough not very many people at the
game right now I guess PlayStation Plus
subscribers those with the review copy
when I was reviewing it I didn't really
see anyone at all it's pretty
disappointing but you see him down there
you see the the shimmering scarf and it
seems start to pulse see those pulses
that's him once he sees me and once we
realize and I assume it's a he maybe it
says she I don't know once we realized
who's who will start to play together so
you'll see how it works I'm going to
leave it at that I'm also going to leave
this playthrough there i'm just going to
kind of like i said let the game speak
for itself it should wrap up after we
drop into a dark room so don't be called
off card by the end when it comes this
is journey for the PlayStation 3 it's
available right now if you're a
PlayStation Plus subscribers
I believe it goes on sale next week for
normal PSN users it should be 15 bucks
again two three hours that may sound
weird but it's not i've been able to
play through this thing multiple times
after even after recording this gameplay
footage i managed to play through it
again with the guy that you see me
rolling with right now it's enjoyable
and it's well worth the money so check
out journey if you guys have a chance
and i hope you enjoyed this playthrough
we intend to bring you more and more as
more interesting games come out and
games that we think are worth your time
alright guys take care
you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
