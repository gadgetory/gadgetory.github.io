brought to you by carbonite welcome back
to the episode of rumor roundup if you
don't have the time to follow all the
crazy tech rumors of the world we will
condense the mash them bash them into
one video telling you everything you
need to know of this week
iPhone 5s production is allegedly
already underway Samsung is prepping a
5.9 inch Galaxy Note 3 allege AT&amp;amp;T
galaxy s4 screenshots of surface showing
a few interesting tidbits and Google
might be gearing up for war against
Amazon Prime this is rumor roundup I'm
Rose John renter iPhone 5s production is
allegedly already underway at Foxconn
they've supposedly started just about a
few weeks ago historically applicants
the same body between each yearly
upgrades to the device which means they
really won't have that much to deal with
from a manufacturing standpoint we're
expecting a faster processor the very
least and probably a boost in memory and
storage and that's probably gonna be
about it
latest rumors suggested Apple will
launch the device sometime in August
this isn't the first time though we've
heard that Apple's production will begin
in March back in January actually
Jeffrey's analyst Peter misuk whose
track record is pretty shaky to say the
least
Perth did that production would actually
start this month at that same time misuk
also suggested the vise will launch in
June or July so if you thought the
transition from 5.3 inch Galaxy Note 2
5.5 5 inch Galaxy Note was big wait till
I tell you Samsung is allegedly prepping
a 5.9 inch Galaxy Note 3 at this point
for coming as a tablet you might as well
just like hold the giant iPad to your
face a fresh report from the Korea Times
quotes an unnamed Samsung executive they
say that the firm is working on a
phablet with a 5.9 inch screen to
compete with similar recently launched
device by Huawei and ZTE and so 5.9 inch
is crazy it was already hard enough to
fit a 5.5 inch phone in your pants I'm
not sure how they're gonna do 5.9 and
maybe shrink the bezels completely just
make it a little bit bigger certainly
not a device for everybody I love big
screen phones
it looks like Samsung is gonna be giving
us big screen phone lovers something to
lust after
come IFA time around October despite a
number of leaks were still not 100%
positive with the Galaxy s4 is gonna
look like which I kind of like for a
change it's nice to not know exactly
what things are going to be when they
finally get announced earlier in the
week though we got some pictures which
might provide a glimpse of what internal
software is gonna be on the 18 t variant
here's what we do know the phone is very
likely to offer Android 4.1 point
whatever is gonna be at at the time
jellybean Samsung's custom TouchWiz
would say sometimes call an H or UX user
interface we can see the icons have
changed just a little bit and they're
also new menu options Android Central
duct through the menus I noticed a smart
scroll feature it would confirm reports
we've been able to use our eyes to
scroll through websites and other pages
and finally the system page confirms
rumoured specs of a full 1080p display
5-inch screen 13 megapixel camera 1.7
gigahertz quad-core processor all rumors
and all veil speculation will be lifted
in just a few short days or we will be
at attendance at Samsung's press
conference on March 14 so of course stay
tuned for more information so Google is
allegedly prepping a new shipping
service aimed at taking on Amazon Prime
supposedly called Google Shopping
Express service is going to undercut
Prime by 10 to 15 smackeroos offering
the same delivery from local retail
stores it's unclear when and if Express
will launch publicly but Google
employees may already be testing the
service out TechCrunch said and I quote
we're hearing that the product is being
run by Tom fallows an e-commerce product
manager at Google and as an effort to
focus on Google's ecommerce initiatives
Google Express will apparently tie
Google Wallet and go shopping together
in beautiful harmonious NISS we're not
sure if brick-and-mortar stores are
gonna participate TechCrunch speculates
the partners will include nationwide
retailers such as Target Walmart
Walgreens and Safeway Google previously
acquired buffer box for delivery lockers
and channel intelligence for
coordination adding more credence to the
online to offline service amazon has its
own delivery locker service too and also
offers similar benefits with prime
including access to instant streaming
movies library books and ton more
service cheaper than prime is a pretty
exciting idea but now I really have no
idea it's actually gonna come to
fruition but it certainly sounds kind of
fun and when companies compete you and
me we went to make things get
better we get more value get more
services for our money so you guys
thinking of all these rumors what do you
want the most
iPhone 5s galaxy s3 galaxy s4 this crazy
new same-day service and these sort of
weird to buy some online and just have
