store with a demonstration for you of
the new 27-inch iMac and let me tell you
this thing is fantastic the high
resolution screen is absolutely gorgeous
I've got two windows here open an almost
full length so I've got a safari and
I've got a pages window open and you can
almost have two things open in full
screen so it's pretty much like having
two separate monitors I think just looks
nice you can see sort of the lower chin
and the bigger high resolution screen is
absolutely gorgeous on the side of it
definitely thinner there's a new magic
mouse so there is the SuperDrive and the
SD card slot if you turn around on the
back you've got your array of ports
hopefully you guys can see not the best
camera work there we go there is a your
standard reports that you're probably
used to one nice thing to know about
this new imac lets you do video in and
out she actually uses as an external
monitor which is a very cool just wanted
to give you guys a real quick
demonstration of the new 27 inch imacs
they have to pick one of these things up
they look quite quite nice i'm not going
to lie they just look really really good
especially coupled with the new magic
mouse definitely makes for a very tasty
looking computer I mean so essentially
this gives you two monitors which is the
biggest thing the design it wasn't that
they have changed but their high
resolution screen is just absolutely
gorgeous let's take a look actually at
the resolution here
let's here we go
so go to school a look at that so it's
256 x 1440 is just absolutely crazy I
mean it's such high resolution what
interesting thing is that Apple sells
the 30 inch display you can see over
there for about eighteen hundred bucks
so for a little bit more even so now for
about 17 for the lower end 27 you're
getting a 27 inch high-resolution
monitor even if you never use a computer
that's still a pretty decent deal for a
great monitor so just something to keep
in mind anyway guys for exclusive
