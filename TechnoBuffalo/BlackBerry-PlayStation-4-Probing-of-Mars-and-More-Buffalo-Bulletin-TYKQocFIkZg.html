links or click on the graphics for each
story if you have annotations available
and toggle on i'm ashley sceva hair your
top stories it looks like oppo vice
president pete lau has resigned in order
to work alongside cyanogen Inc savage
and mod creators Steve Kondik and
developer couche de de posted a picture
with Lao late last week revealing the
reason for their meeting was to discuss
their vision of a high powered phone
running amazing software we're assuming
the amazing software is cyanogen of
course but it remains to be seen how Lau
will assist on the hardware side of
things the one thing we are sure about
though is that this is a most intriguing
collaboration and one with enough
potential to make any Android fan
excited blackberry unveiled the p'9982
the sequel to the p9981 which is a very
expensive handset designed alongside
Porsche there were rumors going around
that the two companies would collaborate
again on a second handset and now those
rumors are official it has a stainless
steel front interchangeable
leather-wrapped back panels and shares
the very same in size as the blackberry
z10 it will be available at London's
famous Harrods department store for
twenty four hundred dollars I guess they
can sell one or two everyone in Waterloo
gets a poutine of the Month Club
membership for the holiday bonus I got
nothing over in gaming the big story
late last week was the PlayStation 4
launch and now we've got some sales
numbers to go with the new console the
ps4 smashed sales records for consoles
in North America selling out its entire
initial shipment of 1 million units in
just 24 hours it's now the biggest
console launch of all time but we'll
have to wait and see who comes out on
top because Microsoft is looking to
topple the record this friday with the
launch of their xbox one
unless though of where your console
allegiance melee it's a really good time
to be a gamer if you're not familiar
with metal gear solid 5 ground zeroes
it's kind of a little prologue and keep
us satisfied until metal gear solid 5
the phantom pain drops but even better
it seems that metal gear publisher
Konami says there's going to be an
awesome easter egg in the playstation 3
and playstation 4 versions of ground
zeroes a special deja vu mission that
takes snake back in time to the first
Metal Gear in 1998 low polygon count and
all series creator Hideo Kojima has a
pretty well-known sense of humor so I'm
sure this bonus level will hit the mark
for Metal Gear fans everywhere our
wildcard story for today takes us into
the final frontier space yesterday NASA
officially wants the Mars atmosphere and
volatile evolution probe or maven for
short unlike the Mars Curiosity rover
which focuses on Mars's surface mavens
job will be to study Mars's atmosphere
over time NASA hopes to learn why Mars
is currently the way it is since they
believe at some point it may have had an
atmosphere similar to ours here on earth
we can expect maven to start sending
data back in late-september of next year
so we got a little while to wait that's
