technobuffalo here 3 view of this guy it
is the galaxy gear it is Samsung's first
smartwatch and perhaps the SmartWatch
that's going to lead the SmartWatch
charge of the next few years I put it
through its paces let me tell you what I
think so as I do with all of my devices
and give you a disclaimer I used it as
my only watch for seven days which is
the first time I really ever get to say
that so this is one of the hardest
devices I've really ever had to review I
try really really hard to keep all bias
out from any product I checked out but
from the get-go I just really couldn't
see the point of the galaxy gear on the
outside looking in it's got a super low
res 1.9 megapixel camera it really
doesn't do anything that my phone
doesn't but I gave it a shot mostly
because I had to and as it turns out the
more I wore it the more I started to see
its utility which is really surprising
it's for my mind it's kind of harder to
change someone's mind than it is to
reinforce already preconceived idea
about a product so it's still far from
perfect so let's go ahead and get
started so for the hardware standpoint
it's got a 1.6 inch screen an 800
megahertz single core processor but it's
not a phone it's a watch and doesn't
suffer at all from any lack of power in
fact you almost want less power to
maximize battery life everything on the
you I felt really really zippy I
actually really liked the way the watch
looked the brushed aluminium and
textured rubber band actually looked
pretty nice and the camera getting out
the side sir and made it look very
high-tech surprisingly comfortable to
wear at least as comfortable as any
other watch might wear watch all the
time it felt a little bit on the thick
side better day or so I really didn't
notice it mentioning that camera the
shots on this camera are awful I don't
mean just like bad I mean really really
bad i'd say probably been worse than my
first camera film from like a decade ago
video predictably is equally as bad I
really ended up only using the camera
when I was showing someone what the
watch could do and be like hey look it's
got a camera and its really sure you
take pictures with it on your wrists or
have to hold it and you got to tilt your
head up and look and then finally take
your picture it just didn't make sense
me it didn't look good it's a bad view
finder it's a bad
the gear has an outdoor mode which turns
up the brightness but doesn't like to
see the screen at all in the daylight or
with polarized lenses on at all I might
as well just be black so if you want to
use in the daylight you work in direct
sunlight you'd have a really really hard
time with it the more you keep it in
that outdoor mode the less your battery
going to be which we will definitely
talk about so let's jump over to
software this is where we get down to
the functionality of the watch that from
getting the UI is actually pretty simple
you swipe left and right to get to your
apps and your settings and all that kind
of stuff and from there it's just
tapping and scrolling what you want to
use a modern smartphone it's actually
pretty intuitive let's go to your watch
screen you just swipe down from anywhere
it's almost like pulling down the
Android of occasions tray you're
supposed to be able to turn the screen
on by lifting your wrists sort of doing
like at this motion it only worked about
sixty percent of the time times you
really have to like exaggerated it like
this to get it to turn on mostly I just
push the button on the side to get it to
turn on and we get to that watch screen
you can customize it which is actually
pretty nice for mine I had the time and
at three shortcuts made it very easy I'd
have to go into the settings or the apps
all that often everything I needed was
right on that home screen their apps for
most things including a pedometer
notifications and more can be downloaded
I liked that it gave me notifications
for text messages it was actually really
really handy and let me read them but
why didn't it do that for male so I give
an example of how I start to find the
utility here with the galaxy gear so I
just had a newborn baby and it was about
four in the morning I was trying to rock
him to sleep in his rocker had my phone
in my pocket and had the galaxy gear on
I got a text message from a friend on
the East Coast and I couldn't turn my
phone on to look at it because the light
would have woken up the kid if you ever
had a child do not want to wake a
sleeping baby could be hours before they
go back to bed so i was able just to
check the message right on my phone the
light didn't wake him up and it was
really easy in a sort of at that point
start to see okay I can actually get why
you might use this it does rely on s
voice for voice commands not the google
search which is really a shame so it's
really a crap sure it's actually going
to work as voice i am not a fan of at
all and it doesn't really work all that
well here on the watch so back to camera
you can only view the pictures you've
taken not those on your device so it's
kind of annoying pinch-to-zoom though it
works pretty well on those and it'll
sink the pictures automatically from the
gear over to your Galaxy Note 3 which it
only works with right now it does not
work with
any other device only the Galaxy Note 3
which is kind of silly Samsung's guts to
nap call the gear manager lets you
customize your device and download tons
more applications so many of my gripes
should have got could get a dress by
applications and there are as I use the
device every day it seems to be more
apps are available so much like a phone
it also makes phone calls essentially
just a Bluetooth speaker on your wrist
you had a speaker right down there
there's a microphone built-in so as I
mentioned they started to find the watch
more useful and again somehow involves a
baby so I was holding the baby in one
hand I had my phone on the couch and I
was trying to rock him to get him to
quiet down and my mom culture is coming
over with dinner which is super
appreciated and I couldn't have made it
over to get the phone and answer it
while sitting the baby was able just
answer the phone right for my wrist talk
to her have her come over bring us a
delicious fish dinner coincidentally and
so is then I thought okay no one's
around so I don't feel silly going like
this the quality of the speaker wasn't
overly awesome but I definitely able to
use it and it was really really helpful
to have and I wouldn't have realized
that if I didn't use it for as long as I
did so a big question mark from you is
how is battery life going to be on this
and it lasted pretty solid two days in
this frenzied from 7am to 7pm I turned
it off at night which was not awful you
can charge it's from every day and be
fine speaking of charging it is a
gigantic pain in the butt you need an
adapter to do so you don't have a micro
USB port on here you got to plug it into
this pre clunky adapter and then you can
charge it so the galaxy gear for me
feels very very much like a public beta
sort of like Google glass does a
finished product I do now totally see
the utility behind it but if 399 only
working on one device I could never ever
ever in a million years justify the
price for this it was useful for those
few times I was holding a baby or rocky
baby to sleep but doesn't do anything
that my phone doesn't so me Baker's
carry my phone with me in my pocket or
maybe trying to brighten is down I'm
trying to rock the baby to sleep and
then the galaxy gear maybe not so much
right now a few glaring omissions I be
able to read emails on it makes very
little sense of relying on s voice makes
even less sense to me the speaker
quality is mediocre it looks cool it
functions pretty well it's relatively
comfortable but there are a lot of holes
in need to be addressed if you're
thinking about getting the galaxy gear
I'm best bet is to wait for Jen to this
gets a six on the TechnoBuffalo
a scale which is a much improved or what
I thought was gonna get initially it's
got utility but it's very far from a
polished product so when you guys think
of our first SmartWatch review do you
like the Galaxy gear is it for you not
for you I would love to hear your
