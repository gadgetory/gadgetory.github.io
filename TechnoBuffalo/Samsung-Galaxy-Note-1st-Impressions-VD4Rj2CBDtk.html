TechnoBuffalo here just fresh out of the
Samsung best event where they introduced
a tooth on of late breaking new products
if you look down so I got some notes in
front because these things are hot off
the presses first and probably the
biggest thing everyone's talking about
is the new Samsung Galaxy Note this is
either a giant bone or a tiny tablet
with a 5.3 inch 1280 x 800 Super AMOLED
display with an eight megapixel camera
on the back and a 2-megapixel camera on
the front and again that is a 5.3 inch
bones we're going to need giant pockets
don't think you're going to be wearing
skinny jeans it carried this guy along
with you to power district DeMuth is a
removable 2,500 in the amp hour battery
which is almost doubled more pristine
typical smartphones so pretty awesome
you should have plenty of power to get
you through the day it's got samsung's
new for 1.4 gig our pictures gonna
plenty of power so the battery will
certainly helps ah the power consumption
extremely thin at nine point six five
millimeters of a good point three eight
inches thick and a pretty light 178 gram
would be back home six point three
ounces of course android 2.3 with
samsung's touchwiz on top got a
retractable pen it's funny we got so far
away from Silas's and now we're coming
back Silas's it's a magnetic silent was
kind of interesting it's got a new
optimized user interface which use the
pen called s Samsung sayings going to be
making a a public SDK available so
hopefully a ton of developer support
because it is opponents are they going
to have hspa+ support no
elvia this time and also question
everybody's lips no word on pricing or
availability so hopefully we will see
note sometimes in your future you guys
expect what do you think 5.3 phone too
big is it too small to be a tablet
something you can carry out of your
pocket I'm very curious what you guys
have to think I had some time to
actually move within the handle like
should film it I had a great feel to it
you almost feel like a tiny tiny baby
holding a huge boat at Riverside bit
holding a bone that's how you feel
holding this thing synaptic I give me so
it won here you guys have to say leave
