a tantrum technobuffalo checking out the
brand new Xperia z3 was announced here
at Aoife 2014 in Berlin a really nice
phone some minor upgrades I'd say over
the Xperia z2 you've got a nicer body
there with the metal metallic border
running along it also camera
improvements you still at the 20.7
megapixel camera but you have a better
sensor in their improved software and
other features like that you also have
better dust resistance in addition to
the same water resistance that we had
before under the hood you have a
Snapdragon 801 processor clocked at 2.5
gigahertz an Adreno 330 GPU you've got
three gigs of ram 16 gigs of storage and
then up to 128 gigabytes of additional
storage using microSD card slot you also
have a dedicated camera key there the
volume buttons the power button there's
the area where you'll add in your
microSD card slot of you off to 3.5
millimeter headphone jack up top little
area a little spot here for putting it
in the dock and then obviously you've
got the brilliant display up front here
and just to go over the display real
quick that's a 5.2 inch 1920 x 1080 P
it's a live color LED triluminos display
with x-reality picture engine so quite a
lengthy name for the screen there but
otherwise you've got android 4.4 kitkat
on here and one of the features that
we've been talking about today is the
playstation application which will allow
you to stream your games from your
playstation to your phone and then use a
controller to play them so that's really
cool and probably one of the big
standout features that you'll see that
with the experience e3 any case we just
wanted to give you a quick rundown of
the phone here obviously as I'm turning
around I wanted to remind you that
that's also glass on the back
in addition to on the front of the
device this is Todd Hazleton from
technobuffalo reporting live from Aoife
2014 in Berlin and that was a quick look
