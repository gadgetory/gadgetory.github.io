online and today they showed up they
said it could take 10 business days came
right quick so you guys are thinking
about taking advantage of the student
promotion i recommend doing it you will
get your money very quickly it's
amazingly fast turnaround so very happy
about that um I my Mac review is coming
shortly but initial impressions are to
think it's just blistering fast and
that's still only with two gigabytes ram
I have four gigabytes coming on friday
so i'll put that and give you guys some
impressions as well but i couldn't be
happier at the imac it's been a really
good machine for the past just about a
week so if you're thinking about pulling
the trigger on an imac definitely
