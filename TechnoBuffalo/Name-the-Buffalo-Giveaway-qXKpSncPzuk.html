sort of ramp up but I wanted to thank
the folks at AT&amp;amp;T for helping us out
with this definitely give them a shout
out in a check i'll put a link to their
Facebook page which are they trying to
push the social networking aspect of the
phones and also it's a great way if you
have ATT questions to ask them they got
some great people that are built there
on the staff to answer your Facebook
questions really anything has to do with
your phone so anyway I hope you guys
