Samsung talks foldable screens catching
shiny pokemon ea's worst company title
and for Marvel heroes head to Netflix
special bulletin time
hello and welcome to the Buffalo
bulletin where we recap five major
stories from our site technobuffalo calm
every tuesday and friday if you're
interested in reading more about any
story i mentioned on the show check the
description below for links or click on
the graphics for each story if you have
annotations available and toggled on I'm
Ashley skava I don't have the flu
anymore so here are your top stories
some interesting market share news from
comscore this week as their latest
report on us smartphones went live
platform wise android's market share
took a small dip this summer but don't
worry it was just point 2 percentage
points dropping from fifty two percent
250 one-point-eight percent Apple's iOS
increased by point seven percentage
points to forty point six percent
Windows Phone climbed point two
percentage points to a three point three
percent share and poor poor blackberry
dropped another point six percent
wah-wah samsung also in the news this
week holding their second ever analysts
day filled with presentations intended
to impress investors one presentation in
particular caught our eye Samsung
promised to roll out smartphones with 4k
displays and even handsets that can
actually bend within the next few years
apparently they're hoping to have a
foldable handset by 2016 which isn't too
far off and those 4k display smartphone
should hit around 2015 now I just want
to know who's promising battery life
innovation am i right over in gaming a
Pokemon master or a polka master if you
will has dedicated an entire machine to
finding rare shiny water pokemon shiny
pokemon have less than a point 1 percent
chance of appearing in battle and this
guy didn't want to waste his time
looking for them himself so he made a
computer notify him when the bottom 3ds
screen animation was longer than usual
indicating a shiny pokemon was at hand
that's amazing and terrifying it looks
like EA is finally realizing that maybe
being consumerist coms worst company in
America two years running really isn't
the best thing ever new CEO Andrew
Wilson told kotaku quote we don't want
to be viewed as the worst company in
America unquote and quote the consumers
out there telling us something unquote
which aside from both those statements
being hilariously obvious at least
indicates someone an ea's executive team
is
ready to stop blaming homophobes and
football fans on the poll results lastly
our wild card story for the week is an
exciting one if you're a fan of comic
book heroes it looks like Netflix has
just inked a deal with Marvel to produce
four different shows based on daredevil
jessica jones iron fist and Luke Cage in
2015 they'll all be 13 episode seasons
and when those are done the heroes will
team up for a miniseries called the
defenders let's hope this set of shows
holds up to the high standard Marvel's
been putting out over the last few years
