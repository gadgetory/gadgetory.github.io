technobuffalo here there's an old saying
that you can put lipstick on a pig but
it's still going to be a pig and it
looks like apples about to smack some
lipstick right here on their Pig of an
ipod the current generation ipod nano
over the weekend we saw some alleged
parts leaked out of what's supposed to
be the next generation ipod nano and it
doesn't really improve much of what
we've seen with this dog of a device
you'll still have the 1.5 4 inch
touchscreen with the incredibly
difficult you I hopefully it'll be
reworked a little bit I can have all the
buttons in the same spot however a
little bit of lipstick that Apple's
adding on their pig is going to be a
camera one of the things that went
missing from the last generation to the
current generation including the touch
wheel and the typical average
traditional ipod nano design when i did
my review of the ipod nano I really
lamented how it worked the functionality
this was not a very eloquent package to
me at all I was hopeful that apple would
perhaps your redesign what might be
considered their non ipod touch flagship
ipod i know it's a weird thing to say
but the ipod nano is definitely one of
the more popular ipod devices and this
has been a really tough sell i believe
for the company so the alleged parts
show a camera that we're going to have
in the upper right-hand corner it's
going to require a shrinking of the
component part so we'll see a smaller
battery this is not necessarily a less
or not it says lower battery life but a
smaller physical battery will see a
shrinking of the components and we'll
see a smaller clip one of the things
that i really did like about the ipod
nano was that clip which or took cues
from the ipod shuffle everything else
will be the same spot 30 pin connector
3.5 millimeter headset jack on the top
you'll have the volume buttons which i
do like the physical volume buttons and
we'll also have your power and a lock
button camera that we're going to get
here i wouldn't expect a higher
illusion camera probably the same thing
we see in the last generation ipod
touches very low resolution shirt and
shoot pictures I don't know it's going
to use it it will probably give you
minutes of enjoyment for your ipod nano
letting some sort of credibility to
these alleged specs are the location of
the screws are very sort of typical
apple as we've seen from the last
generation tear down from I fix it the
screws are located in the same spot
which does lend a little bit of
credibility to this rumor take this all
with a grain of salt we might see a
complete redesign these parts that we
sign might just be a prototype and one
design Apple is considering but if these
are realness are these are what we see
in the next generation ipod nano will
you guys be excited is a camera enough
to make you go out and buy one or buy
another one do you like the design do
not like design I really want to hear
what you guys have to say if you want to
go back and check out my review of the
current generation ipod nano all them
links will be down below i'm jon
rettinger from TechnoBuffalo see the
next video
