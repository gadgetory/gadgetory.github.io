brought to you by Samsung Smart TV
welcome back to another episode of ask
the Buffalo i'm your host jon rettinger
and in honor of facebook's IPO day today
is friday may 18th i am doing my best
mark zuckerberg impression i got my blue
hoodie with the white strings and my
green t-shirt I'm rich alright let's go
ahead and jump right into the questions
the first one comes from Josh she wants
to ask John what are your predictions
for apple's WWDC well WWDC used to be a
place where Apple would announce stuff
for developers hence the D in it then
later it evolved into a launching
platform for new products where we saw
the first iphone and subsequent versions
of the iphone up until the iphone 4s
which sort of changed the complete
release cycle I do not think we're going
to see a new iPhone or new iPad announce
at WWDC you think that's going to wait
until the October timeframe for a for a
new iphone iphone 5 wherever they decide
to call it what i do think we're going
to see our new laptops and desktops i
think we're gonna see updates to the
macbook air macbook pro and imac lines
all getting retina displays you get a
Retina Display you get a retina splay
you get a Retina display everybody gets
a Retina Display of my Oprah impression
macbook air going to get faster
processor it's gonna move over to Ivy
Bridge macbook pro is going to get a
thinner design may also get USB 3.1 or
boat got some awesome io options
bubbling up for fast data speeds imac
smaller chin retina display faster
processors one more thing with apple
sometimes there is just one more thing
like we're going to see iOS 6 i'm going
to talk about what i think we're going
to see an iOS 6 and another question so
our next question comes from andrew who
says hey John I asked this question on
time but you never answered what is your
favorite phone well Andrew I'm going to
answer today there are three phones that
I carry with me all the time or at least
one of the three that I'm carrying with
me all the time I've got the privilege
of being able to test it for devices let
me show you what they are phone number
one
iphone 4s clearly white the next phone
is the Galaxy Nexus this is the unlocked
penta band version that works with AT&amp;amp;T
hspa+ or t-mobile's hspa+ network and
the one that is currently mod daily
driver we got the HTC One X here either
it's the AT&amp;amp;T version or it's the
International Tegra 3 version that
Grace's my pockets so the next question
wants to talk about the iphone and user
totally 8806 wants to know John you
think the next-generation iphone to be
an all new device and what do you think
it should have so every generation
iphones been an all new device might not
have looked all different but it has
been all new iphone 5 i think is going
to be an all-new looking device four
inch screen I think seems to be all but
determined that it's going to have a
little bit different on the backward
rumors perhaps a teardrop shape i think
aluminum is going to make its comeback
hey rumors of liquid metal to make it
thinner and more durable one thing i
think it is going to have though and the
rumors that that spins the contrary that
guy i'm still going to have a physical
home button it's probably gonna be the
last generation iphone that is going to
have a physical home button alright the
next question it's come from user the
sequin kid needs help picking a phone he
asks hey guys a technobuffalo should i
wait to see if the samsung galaxy s3
comes down verizon or should i grab an
iphone 4s or the HTC Rezound no i phone
4s is in the later stage of its life
cycle the sound the later stages of its
life cycle don't go for either those you
should probably wait a few months we
don't know what US carriers gonna pick
up a variant of the samsung galaxy s3
perhaps verizon will they do not pick up
a galaxy s2 because they had the Galaxy
Nexus coming so no one knows the
incredible 4G LTE varying it had a
chance to play with its CTI it's a
gorgeous phone it was quick has a great
screen that may be one you want to wait
for and wait to see what Apple is going
to do is you can help decide which phone
is best for you want to take a minute to
thank our friends and sponsors at
Samsung and they're incredibly awesome

access in the future though you can
upgrade your TV experience and
functionality with the smart evolution
kit learn more about all the features
found in the samsung smart TV at
facebook.com / samsung TV USA and our
last question is promised earlier it
comes from revolution brews to ask John
what features are you hoping we're going
to see in iOS 6 iOS 6 is going to be a
redesign of iOS it has to be iOS has
been almost exactly the same those first
announced in 2007 you still have square
icons and you still have square icons
you can move around now like do a little
jiggly dance you can rearrange them you
drop them into folders but things have
stayed relatively stale we've got sort
of multitasking now my double clicking
the home button got a notification
center one way or another Apple is going
to have to offer users a way to quickly
view information whether or not they
take live tile approach like Windows
Phone or a widget approach like Android
so however Apple decides to do that I
think we're finally going to see it in
iOS 6 i'm hoping that we'll see better
use of the lock screen perhaps we'll
have a gesture area on the phone as well
probably a bit unrealistic i think more
realistic though especially being a
developer conference or I think we're
going to see just announced WWDC we'll
see perhaps third-party api's for series
so you can save series launch Foursquare
check-in at my mom's house and I'll be
able to do that series snap picture and
you can hold it up newly snap I don't
know what that would be I'm not a
designer and we got up to people way
smarter than me and of course LT
compatibility in iOS 6 which certainly
the iphone five will have so you guys
expect for iOS 6 you agree disagree Oh
No thank you guys for watching this
episode of ask the Buffalo i'm jon
rettinger and i'll see you guys next one
bye bye
good advice and what do you think it
should have mmm different chances I'm
rich</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
