that's what I named our review unit and
Tim here has 4 main differences versus 1
+ 3 counterpart first processor we've
gone from a Snapdragon 820 to a
Snapdragon 820 1 the batteries got a
really nice increase this is probably
one the biggest reasons to get the phone
it's gone from 3000 to 3400 million
powers and if I was good at math I could
play a percentage increase that was the
front-facing cameras also been improved
mate megapixels it's been doubled to 16
and also increasing is the price the one
plus three is for 309 for 64 gigs and if
you want to get a 64 gig variants of the
oneplus 2 ricci you'll be paying $39
more that math I can do that comes in at
439 dollars there's also a 128 gigabyte
available and a few other minor
differences you can get now a gunmetal
color which we have here opening the box
the 1 + 3 T it's gonna look just like
the 1 + 3 and it's definitely gonna be a
theme of this review you've got a
profile switcher in the upper left hand
corner which I really like on Android
devices you've got a volume rocker up
and down dual SIM tray and then
underneath that you're going to have
your power button on the bottom you've
got your downward firing speakers the
USB type-c port so noise cancelling mic
and a 3.5 millimeter headset jack is
here on the phone the display hasn't
changed it's still a 5.5 inch 1080p
optic M OLED display and it looks really
good in fact I'm almost hard-pressed to
even tell that it's a 1080p screen and
not a Q HD screen it looks really good
and beyond that it looks nice in direct
sunlight which is really like the like
kryptonite for smartphones and viewing
angles here are also still really good
this still sounds silly to say but there
are six gigs of ram in this phone now
not all 6 gigs are being used kind of
depends on the app how much ram is gonna
get used auto genoa is still here it's
not yet based on Android nougat it's
still based on marshmallow but it is
still really good you get some nice
features things like enhanced doze mode
adaptive brightness ambient display and
a ton more we've done a lot of coverage
and oxygen OS but it's pretty decent so
there's a lot to like about the 16
megapixel rear facing camera this is
definitely a higher extra line of
cameras that we've tested if you want to
see more camera
let us know but in the meantime we want
to see a gallery probably let me just
look in full resolution hit the link
down below for the article on
TechnoBuffalo calm in our tests of the
original one plus three we didn't have
any heat issues but I didn't notice the
one plus three T did get a tad on the
warm side when I was playing a lot of
videos and it would take about 10-15
minutes for the worms to actually be
detectable nothing that's gonna burn you
in the pocket but something to be aware
of you'd expect from that extra four
hundred million powers battery life to
be better and it was better from already
really good battery I was able to
stretch this out to almost two days of
heavy usage there's a lot more to talk
about with the one plus three T but we
covered a ton of it in our one plus
three review which you should watch but
overall oneplus did I don't think a lot
of people were asking they made a really
good phone even better and the one plus
three is probably when I favorite phones
of the year and the one plus three T
just makes even faster I don't notice
much miss P difference between the
Snapdragon 820 and 821 the clock speed
difference is almost nominal benchmarks
were a little bit higher but that didn't
really change any of my daily usage a
fast phone is now a faster phone that's
important to you and then look for the
one plus three T now is it worth the
extra forty bucks from the one plus
three either way you're getting great
value for your phones I think it's gonna
come down to what I eat the bigger
storage and once when eights available
for the three T or whether not you're
just like doing gunmetal color I think
if I was buying one I was gonna use for
a few years I'd probably opt for the
three T just the extra horsepower make
me feel a little bit better let me know
what you guys think in the comments down
below give the video a thumbs up we
appreciate it until next time I am John
