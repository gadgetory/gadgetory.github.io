technobuffalo here one of the big
selling points of the infuse 4g aside
from its gorgeous 4.5 inch screen is
that 4g part of the name so regardless
of whether or not you think hspa+ belong
thing called 4g AT&amp;amp;T is calling it as
such it infuses the first device that's
got support for hsdpa cat 14 which means
very fast downloads supposedly up to 21
megabits per second as well as support
for hsupa cat 6 which is fancy term for
really fast uploads so let's go ahead
and run a speedtest the hspa+ network
isn't rolled out really everywhere in
the country yet we happen to have it
here in Southern California you can see
that h plus logo with pretty nice
service bars there so I figured let's
run a speedtest let's see how fast it
really is going to be now the usual
caveats apply it's going to vary
depending where in the country you are
the time of day the speed test app sort
of all the stuff you can expect this is
a very unscientific test mostly I'm just
curious so we'll go ahead and run the
test will use a speedtest.net app it's
see a previous result will go ahead and
restart it's going to ping the la-based
server and in an upcoming video I will
run a test comparing AT&amp;amp;T s 4g offering
to verizon's LTE t-mobile's hspa+ and
Sprint's wimax so I've run this test a
few times I've gotten speeds about as
low as 1.5 down and as high as about six
on the download uploads have been pretty
consistent at about 1.5 which is pretty
nice upload speeds so certainly we're
not looking at least right now as fast
as verizon's LTE but much faster than
what AT&amp;amp;T was previously offering on
what you could get on a device like the
inspire 4G so let's go ahead and bring
in a 3g only device that's a lot of G's
here we've got the iphone 4 not
connected to Wi-Fi with pretty solid 3g
service we're going to run the same
speed test app and
see what our results are let me go ahead
and open it up at least you can get a
chance to see the differences and again
all the usual caveats apply time of day
test Network all that thing very
unscientific test is mostly a curiosity
thing so we'll go ahead and let this guy
run so we're looking at about 2.6 now on
the download wats extremely fast this is
actually the fastest that I've seen a
team teas 3g network oh it was actually
quicker than the hspa+ the upload looks
like going to be a little bit slower but
very fast speeds here from the iphone 4
again this is no Wi-Fi this is just
straight-up network speeds so pretty
nice results actually so in case you
guys were wondering what sort of speeds
you can expect as the infrastructure
continues to get rolled out presumably
the infuse is going to get a little bit
faster than what the iphone 4 or any
other 3g phones can't offer so i hope
you guys enjoyed this real quick network
speed test i wanna know you guys get run
a speedtest app and let's see what you
guys are pulling in where you are and
leave in the comments what phone you
guys are running let's sort of compare
i'm jon rettinger from technobuffalo
i'll see you next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
