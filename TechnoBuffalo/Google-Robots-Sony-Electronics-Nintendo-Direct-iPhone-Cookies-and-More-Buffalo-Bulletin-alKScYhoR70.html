Nintendo Direct and a fool on his iPhone
cookie are soon parted it's Buffalo
bulletin time hello internet and welcome
to the Buffalo bulletin where we
recapped five major stories from our
site TechnoBuffalo calm every tuesday
and friday if you're interested in
reading more about any story i mentioned
on the show check the description for
links down below or click on the
graphics for each story if you have
annotations available and toggled on i'm
ashley sceva here are your top stories
google took another step towards a I
autonomy this weekend announcing they'd
acquired engineering company Boston
Dynamics if you're not familiar with
that name you probably know their work
anyway this is the company that worked
closely with DARPA to create some really
crazy robots like pet man and wild cat
it's also likely x android head andy
rubin will be working with Boston
Dynamics on their future projects as he
was moved over to robotics earlier this
year this is the eighth robotics company
Google's bought in the last six months
which pretty much means we better find
John Connor before the terminators do in
a surprising move president of sony
electronics and coo phil molyneux
stepped down yesterday sony's current
vice president and US sales chief
michael fuccillo will take over on
january first and Molyneux will still be
part of the company but he'll just be a
non-executive chairman this is all part
of an ongoing effort to reestablish
Sony's name as a premium brand here in
the US and Sony is hoping the transition
to 4k will help them do that i will see
if sony can pull that off but for now
they'll just have to settle for basking
in the glow of the newly launched
playstation 4 over in gaming it appears
marvel vs capcom 2 is getting pulled
from both the playstation network and
xbox live arcade if your playstation
game where you left act quickly mvc2
will be removed from the PSN store by
tomorrow xbox live arcade users have
until the 26 of this month to pick up a
copy we're not exactly sure if this is
Disney pulling Marvel rights from Capcom
but regardless of the reason
this is your last chance to grab an
excellent classic fighting game that you
can play on modern consoles also in
gaming nintendo announced another
nintendo direct event this morning and
it's scheduled for tomorrow according to
the email invite we received nintendo
will be discussing Wii U and Nintendo
3ds software launching through the
spring of 2014 now I'm hoping that will
not only see scheduled releases for
quarter 1 2014 but also maybe a trailer
or two for some new first party titles I
personally have my fingers crossed for a
new Metroid announcement but I also will
not be holding my breath lastly our
wildcard story for the day is the tale
of a joke gone horribly wrong an LA
comedian decided he wanted to get pulled
over for driving and talking on an
iPhone made out of a cookie when he
finally got stopped the comic took a
bite out of his iPhone and asked if
cookies were illegal the annoyed cop
then checked the guy's license and found
a warrant for unpaid parking tickets the
comedian was arrested and his car was
impounded and that friends is how the
story went from kind of amusing to
hilarious that's the Buffalo bulletin
for today if you enjoyed the show what
thumbs up would be super awesome of you
