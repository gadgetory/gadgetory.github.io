to you by lenscrafters welcome back to
another episode of ask the buffalo i'm
your host jon rettinger this is the show
you could ask any question that you have
from the world of technology not sure
what phone you should get this is the
place where asked that question not sure
if quad cores really gonna make a
difference this is where you ask not
sure which tablet or phone or watch
weird hybrid tech thing to get you get
the idea go ahead and ask them here
let's go ahead and jump it to the first
question it comes to us from the
TechnoBuffalo website and it's from
Stuart Stuart asks my contract is up but
I want a phone that allows to me the
whole two years which phone you think is
best for my network AT&amp;amp;T on the phone I
think that's best for your network
that's out now are coming out is the one
that I've got in my pocket right here
boom galaxy note definitely is my
favorite phone on 18 team probably my
favorite phone of the last 12 months
gonna be coming out on the 19th you're
going to have LTE you could have a giant
5.3 inch screen go check out
TechnoBuffalo calm for my one month
later review the galaxy note but
definitely my favorite phone for AT&amp;amp;T so
Stuart hopefully that helps answer your
question alright so our next question
comes to us from users snack EG he asks
what piece of tech are you most excited
about for this year rumored or announced
this is kind of fun the announce stuff
we already know it's coming it's way
more fun to speculate on rumors the app
will television on Apple TV that ninety
nine dollar box been out for a couple
years this is the actual apple
television but what's cool about it and
what's supposedly going to be cool god
this is where all the rumors and fun
sort of come in is the way it's
controlled it's going to face detection
technology and so it could detect who
you are and whether or not you should be
controlling the television and you can
control it via serious obviously voice
enabled which is actually going to be
awesome during sports games and that
Jim I'd say you're watching the lakers
and Kobe misses dunk and you know and
then your TV turns off or you yell slam
it home and the TV just falls off the
wall long-winded answer that's what I'm
most excited about all right so our next
question comes to us from Marcus William
he is asking when will TechnoBuffalo
shirts to be available to those folks
that cruise the site 15 times a day well
Marcus we want to make sure that our
fans have a chance to get the same stuff
that we wear perhaps you're talking
about the shirts that you saw us donning
at CES and ready boom boom boom boom
boom chicka boom these shirts are
actually available for everyone to buy
at TechnoBuffalo dot spreadshirt dot-com
I've been wanting to do merchandise for
quite a while but I didn't feel right
taking and keeping money from it so one
hundred percent of profits are going to
go to charity every time I get a hundred
dollars i will make a video showing live
that donation being made we made a
donation of about two hundred and sixty
dollars about a month or so ago and that
video is all filmed we marked everything
up about ten to twelve percent and one
hundred percent of that goes to charity
we don't can't keep a sense of profits
is the only way that I could feel good
about selling merchandise it just felt
wrong to sort of keep money for that
thank you for asking your question and I
want to take a quick minute to thank our
friends and sponsors at lenscrafters so
here we are at lenscrafters learning
about their a cue fit system let's go
and check it out did you know that you
can take the same I wear prescription to
a different vision care professional and
actually see differently the placement
of prescription is placed in your frames
which should be a custom fit to your
face it's also important to seeing your
best well now you're a movie star cuz
you're on camera with this in mind
lenscrafters has designed and launched a
key fit technology and exclusive
state-of-the-art digital measurement
system that delivers the best possible
placement of your eyewear prescription
within your glasses frames a key fit
technology precisely measures the
relationship between your eyes face and
frame to more accurately place your
prescription in your eyeglasses frame
and has been proven to be five times
more precise than manual measurements
I'm pretty excited to get your frames
I'll tell you one thing I'm also
learning I got very bushy eyebrows more
precise optical measurements resulting
clear crisper vision
Alexa silly but it's gonna be great go
to lenscrafters calm / a key fit to
learn more and find you're near so
lenscrafters store to experience a cure
all right let's go ahead and jump to our
last question this comes from user Gus
esta bar who is asking which sports car
of any type would you buy the most good
question I'm much like come on an
Android kick right now I'm on a huge
electric car kick but electric cars for
me are awesome for technology the tech
that goes into them and torque you get
that instant torque right away so I'm
big on electric cars the two that are
most exciting to me right now the Tesla
Model S looks absolutely gorgeous got
that 17 inch screen it's being powered
by nvidia tegra processor had a chance
to check it out at CES and was really
impressed not necessarily a sports car
but the thing is fast so that's a car
that I'm most excited about I'm Tesla is
also going to be announcing their Model
X which is they're all electric SUV will
actually be there for that on the 9th in
Los Angeles so check us out for all of
that coverage also one Segway I hear
everybody's saying Oh electric cars
aren't any greener for the environment
because coal is burnt to make the
batteries and that's true right now
conversely there's only one way to get
oil for traditional combustion engines
coming from the ground and it's got to
be mine from the ground an electric car
doesn't care where electricity comes
from so right now it's being made in
coal burning facilities but in the
future perhaps it'll be able made for
more green technologies maybe we'll be
able to get electricity from wind from
waterfalls or other green sources so
it's not an investment in how things are
created now it's more forward looking
for how we're going to create
electricity in the future so a bit of a
my thoughts on the whole bunch of car
thing and awesome on the low end torque
but they're quiet they're quiet quiet
killers my wife and I always joke that
the prius isn't the parking lots are the
silent killers because he never hear
them coming and then the smack read you
