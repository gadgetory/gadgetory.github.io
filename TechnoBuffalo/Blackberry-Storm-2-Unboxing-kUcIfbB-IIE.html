unboxing for you of the new blackberry
storm2
for Verizon Wireless I was admittedly
not a biggest fan of the storm one
because of its sure pressed keyboard I
found him to be finicky and very
unnatural but from what I understand the
storm 2 fixes a lot of those concerns so
I'm really excited to dig in and take a
look if you're interested the starting
to will run you 179 after $100 ml and
reboot and you can get it started today
so I'm not sure if this is going to be
retail packaging or just demo packaging
but the only one way to find out and of
course we will use the big ol knife to
rip this sucker open another successful
unboxing about slicing my finger open
let's see we got inside it appears to
just be a demo unboxing when you buy
this from the store I'm willing to bet
you'll have a sleeve that will go them
over this so let's open it up and see
what we get so there's the device
sitting on top not too secured what
we'll put that off to the side for just
a minute we'll even compare it with the
outgoing store model keep going through
it lift up the cardboard tray we've got
a USB seeking cable which is going to
micro USB got a pair of headsets
headphones and the BlackBerry standard
wall charger with micro USB but the
accessory is not wire here let's take a
look at the device itself so here we
have the blackberry storm2 let's go over
some of the specs then we'll do a size
comparison the highlights of this the
dimensions are 4.4 by 2.4 by 0.53 weighs
approximately 5.5 ounces and it's got a
1400 milliamp hour battery which should
be pretty decent and rising claims
you're going to get 330 minutes of talk
time or up 260
nine hours of standby time it also comes
pre-installed with a 16 gigabyte micro
SD card which is really nice the screen
resolution is 480 by 320 and supports
over 65,000 colors it does still have
the sure pressed keyboard but instead of
just having one button in the middle it
now has four on the corners so it should
be a little bit more accurate it also
uses a new technology where on the phone
is off the screen doesn't push down at
all which is very interesting so let's
take a look at how this thing stacks up
next to the original blackberry storm so
here we have it right here and they look
like very close siblings these storm 2
has these heat sensitive buttons whereas
a storm 1 had these actual clicking
buttons this is turned on you can see I
can click anywhere on the screen and
sort of get that up-and-down motion for
clicking with the storm 2 I can actually
not click when the screen is off and
I'll do more demonstrations of this in
future videos let's go ahead and power
it on see if it's got a charge in it and
while the device is powering on we'll
run some there is batteries about to do
die on it will do some comparisons with
other devices and actually once it turns
on you can start pressing the screen and
on first blush the screen definitely has
a far less distance to travel as opposed
to the first storm one of the big knocks
on the first storm was that if you want
to type get a wait for the screen to
come up before you hit the next letter
and it over time it adds up it appears
that there's a much shorter throw on the
storm 2 so that's quite nice so
comparing it with another device you
might be familiar with here is the
iPhone 3GS you can see they definitely
have a very similar slab-like interface
stack the two together star 2 is just a
little bit thicker but not by much and
the last phone that you guys may be
considering if you're looking at the
storm 2 is the t-mobile g1 which looks
like a garden
and fat cousin next to the storm - it's
a very f slim design on the storm you
can see the thickness so let's go ahead
and take a look at the device itself
it's got your sure press screen and your
LED indicator that most people are
familiar with on BlackBerry devices
you've got your standard array of
BlackBerry buttons you've got your send
button your BlackBerry Menu button your
back and your end button on the left
hand side of the device you've got a
programmable hard button with the
charging port on your right hand side
you've got a volume toggle up and down
and you've got another programmable hard
button 3.5 millimeter headset jack and
on top you've got your volume mute
button and a lock button and the back of
it looks very different than the
original storm we still have the same
3.2 megapixel camera but the sort of
metal feeling door is gone it's still
metal but it's got more of a plastic
feel to it looks a little bit more
secure let's take off the door and let's
see what we have inside and see if even
this is as a SIM card see if it can be
used as a world phone all right so we
got the back of it off and it does have
a SIM card which will make it a world
phone for those you that are in the US
and wondering you cannot use this over
3G with AT&amp;amp;T or t-mobile network it's
really the GSM radio is meant just for
international I suppose you could
probably use it for edge
here's your 1400 milliamp hour battery
and that's where the micro SD card slot
is so it does not appear that there is
one in there although when you buy it it
will come pre-installed with a 16 gig
card just bigger than the 8 that the
original storm came with so guys stay
tuned to the channel for a ton of storm2
coverage I'll be doing comparison videos
with the iPhone 3GS
we're taking you through the operating
system and the browser the storm 2 and
seeing how it holds up and compares to
the original so for exclusive content be
