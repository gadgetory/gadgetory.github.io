to you by Full Sail University what's
going on everyone and welcome back to
another episode of rumor roundup but not
just another episode this is going to be
the best episode ever
why because I got a good night's sleep
last night and I'm feeling super
positive up this week on rumor roundup
we're gonna talk about a brand new m8
maybe getting a plastic shell Amazon but
to get into the phone business and LG is
looking like they may be building
screens and batteries for the iWatch and
last but not least a larger iPhone 6 I
can just leave that one on here for
every episode of him around up until
probably September humor roundup but to
start just round them up in a hug ammo
let's start with HTC usually phones go
from plastic to metal but looks like HTC
is going in Reverse so source is
speaking to TMT post claimed that HTC is
considering the idea of releasing a
plastic m8 an effort to reach her a
wider presumably less expensive consumer
base according to the report plastic m8
potentially be offered specs intact so
same spec for 450 bucks of contract
compared to the 700 you have to buy if
you want the sort of hot aluminum
version so I get it I see the reason
behind it but I think they're gonna kind
of dilute one of the big drawing points
they're having a mate and that's a crazy
good build certainly getting more phones
and more hands a good way you get into
HTC ecosystem get people used to sent
six and maybe buying HTC apps and HTC
accessories so I understand the business
reasoning behind it I can hope it
doesn't come to fruition but my bet
would be it probably is gonna happen so
if you're thinking that you like
everything about the HTC One except the
price point you might be in luck this
does come to mark it probably won't be
that far away since if they wait that
much longer the next version will be out
so probably look for this the next four
or five months if it does come to market
on that price point is pretty good at
four hundred fifty bucks that's only a
$200 or hundred bucks more than most
two-year contract phones with subsidy so
for a little bit money get a phone you
can just keep and then maybe sell when
you're done with it so it could be a
good idea I hope it doesn't dilute the
HTC sort reputation they've got her
building an awesome phone but I don't
know let's stick with phones and let's
talk about the mythical Amazon phone it
looks like
going to be coming it's been almost a
year since we're the rumors started to
float around the Amazon was working on
their first smartphone but it looks like
it might be code to fruition very soon
we finally got a glimpse of what it
might look like thanks to the folks at
BGR showed a prototype however that we
do have some interesting tidbits and
tasty morsels to consume and our tech
eleven bellies so first thing look at
the pictures
notice the sensors all around that
display this kind of lines up nicely at
the rumor is that the phone will come
equipped with several cameras you're
probably saying hey Jon why several
cameras the answer good friend its
provide just your base 3d interface so
let that one sink in for a minute
oh they're also reportedly being used to
track your eyes and face in other words
consumers to be able to interact and
Amazon's smartphone and similar fashion
tell him I interact with Microsoft
Connect like going like this to know
that's page you're going like this to
zoom in or like blinking to go to the
next page the potentials crazy the ever
reliable focus The Wall Street Journal
also suggested this by itself will be
able to provide 3d imagery without the
need for 3d glasses although we largely
saw that technology sort of go the way
the dinosaur a few years ago primarily
because the tech just felt awful and
super half-baked
Amazon though might have reason to bring
that back BT I did say this will have a
4.7 inch screen 720p 3d display which
would be used to show off products on
how users to view serve different angles
of a project you're looking through it
like imagine trying to buy a phone and
be like look at it look underneath it
could be kind of neat it seems like a
pretty compelling use for 3d but also
sounds like a bit of a shopping gimmick
but into the day if it gets you to buy
more Amazon things then they'll probably
be pretty happy and I probably sell
quite a lot of them so what is this
thing gonna be coming supposedly it's
going to launch sometime this summer but
it could be announced in that couple of
months and although some are suggested
it's not going to ship until September
which probably a lot of competition in
that month a second model though might
also be in the works it lines up with
report suggests the Amazon was building
as many as this many smartphones and
that's one two three so a lot of
smartphones can be coming presumably a
high-end one perhaps are really in
low-end one middle one what's
interesting we don't know yet if it'll
be ad supported meeting
could it be come in at very little money
presumably even free heard rumors am
somebody offer a free smartphone that's
ad supported we saw them do their Kindle
lion takes the price
down too difficult Lee but never a free
phone especially with those crazy specs
it'd be pretty awesome I think a lot of
people would jump on board no no it's
gonna be a carrier phone or just be sold
unlocked but all those questions he'll
feel beyond Stan sir it in the next few
months we're gonna jump around to
another company it begins with an A and
that's Apple so we all know that I watch
it's probably coming no it's probably
gonna look like a watch which means
probably have a curved display what we
don't know is who's gonna make a said
curved display it looks like the folks
at LG have been tapped to make that
display and they're also rude to be
using their step batteries to go inside
of that watch as well which is kind of
cool
so the LG's already hinted that it's
already spent a production of their
flexible OLED screens an important last
year candy apple had partnered with them
way back in October 2013 although a
separate report I mean I watch is going
to ship with LG's new step batteries so
I just mentioned I would saw featured in
the G flex which helps them to give them
the curb shape oh jeez a pretty major
display supplier so it makes perfect
sense that it be tapped to provide
components for Apple it screens are
already using the iPad Mini with Retina
display so our relationship there
samsung also has little flexible
technology but I think Apple is probably
trying to take a few steps back from
working with sampling although they're
kind of frenemies for some things you
can provide parts for the iPhone but it
would make sense that LG would be the
lucky lucky supply chain tap so we don't
know what about the auto watch other
that's coming I wouldn't be surprised
for to see it though at WWDC perhaps
tied in with iOS 8 which is coming up
and at this point out just almost about
two months but take a real quick break
to tell you what you probably already
know the mobile industry is going crazy
right now but you might not know is that
by 2015 mobile app development projects
gonna outnumber actual PC projects by
four to one so if you're interested in a
future in technology mobile is where
it's at and Full Sail University is
online and on campus mobile development
bachelor's degree program can teach you
the skills that you need to take
advantage of these crazy emerging
opportunities that can help set you on a
pretty good career path you think you're
ready to try and master technology and
software I kept it in this really fast
growing industry you should check out
Full Sail edu slash TechnoBuffalo again
that's Full Sail utu so that
TechnoBuffalo in get your career or
second career or third career started
and the steadfast rumor the statue the
one that's never going away a large
my phone sucks at this point obviously I
think confirmed Apple can change your
mind but it seems like I get foregone
conclusion iPhone 6 is gonna get bigger
the Chinese social network it's Teno
Weibo shows what an iPhone 5s might look
like next to a larger iPhone with a 4.7
inch display and looks like it expect
it's just a larger looking screen does
have thinner bezels though which is kind
of cool
listen this thing's coming 4.7 inches
gonna be a next iPhone 6 I'm not holding
my breath unfortunately for a 5.5 inch
phone then it could be pretty awesome
but 4.7 is put 4/7 and we've got right
now
so these apples up English greets at
least be competitive with some of the
Android offerings already out there so
it looks like we're gonna be getting
this I would still say September we're
just more proof that it's going to be
coming so if you're looking at getting a
an iPhone in the next few months you
should definitely wait and I'm staring
my glance at our camera guy Ron he was
acknowledging that he got an iPhone 5s
last month and she wasn't to us here and
waited so wait if you want to get an
iPhone to see what's gonna come and come
very soon they can catch for watching
episode of rumor roundup hope you
enjoyed I always love making these and
talking about technology let me know
what you guys think about any of the
rumors or any rumors that maybe we
didn't cover you think we should talk
