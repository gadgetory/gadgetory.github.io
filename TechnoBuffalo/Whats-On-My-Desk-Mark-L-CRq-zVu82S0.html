to you by the National Highway Traffic
Safety Administration what's going on
guys the Marklin sang it from
TechnoBuffalo and you've already seen
around our new office you've seen
everyone's desk but I thought it'd be
cool to do a close-up video on what's on
my desk and what I look at on a daily
basis so let's go ahead and get started
now it was John mention in the video
here's Mark's desk mark is very into
wood
I think the wooden accessories looks
good and gives my desk a bit of an
earthy look so starting from left to
right I have my retina MacBook Pro 15
inch it's my portable powerhouse so
whenever I have to edit at home or edit
videos on a go this is what I use it's
rocking a 2.7 gigahertz i7 with 16
gigabytes of RAM once every bite of SSD
and a 2 gigabyte of Nvidia graphics card
this thing is an absolute monster moving
on I have my pen cup thingy that I got
from Grove maids so basically everything
that you see on my desk that's made out
of walnut wood is from Grove made and
they're actually handcrafted which is
pretty impressive because nowadays
mostly everything we own are all done by
machines and knowing that someone got
their hands dirty to make the product
says a lot about the company next up for
these two Docs one is from fuse designs
and the other of course is from Grove
made the fuse design doc was actually a
Kickstarter project I backed a while ago
and it's compatible with pretty much any
Android smartphone tablet or iOS device
the dock from Grove made is for iOS only
so this is where I usually plug in my 6
plus moving forward to have my basic SD
card reader that's hooked up to this 24
inch cinema display we have a bare
Android figurine next to what I like to
call mighty Edison lamp is it necessary
maybe maybe not but I like having it
there and of course we have this 27-inch
iMac from late 2012 it's not the latest
5k iMac but inside this behemoth packs a
3.4 gigahertz quad-core i7 with 32
gigabytes of RAM a 3 terabyte fusion
drive and 2 gigabytes of NVIDIA GTX 680
MMX graphics card now I added most of my
videos or John's videos on here using a
we Premiere Pro Photoshop and After
Effects and with Adobe's dynamic link it
works even better so I know I'm not
marked
you're watching marks video but I'm here
to talk to you because mark is sick
about driving safety
I know usually we do some ads usually
about learning something new maybe
trying to get you smoother shade but
this one is actually super important
just don't text and drive people I've
said this last week I'll say this till
I'm blue in the face don't do it it's
not worth it you might think that you
can handle it no problem until a
pedestrian jumps in front of you a car
stems on the brakes before you know it
you're in front of your car has met the
back of their car on the best case
scenario worst-case scenario somebody
gets hurt so don't have those cars meet
they don't want to be friends just don't
text and drive you can wait moving on I
have this little holder for
miscellaneous stuff like SD cards or SIM
cards and right behind my iMac are my
two external one terabyte G drives
connected via Thunderbolt and these are
usually used for backing a project files
so I can quickly dump them from my iMac
so an external once a project is
finished now this black book is from
moleskin I jot down notes for upcoming
videos or write a shot list for b-roll
and whatnot moving forward we can't
forget about the keyboard and mouse I
have my Apple wireless keyboard on top
of Grove Bates keyboard tray and under
that are some extra batteries for my
headphones business cards and that's
about it for now as for my mouse I was
using the MX Performance Mouse from
Logitech but it's been acting weird
lately so I've been using the Magic
Trackpad from Apple and I really enjoy
using it for my daily driver I'm using
iPhone six-plus and the note for both
incredible devices as you may all know
and as for my headphones I'm using two
Bose QC 15s I highly recommend this
headphones as it's super comfortable
sounds amazing and the noise
cancellation is unreal there is a newer
QC 25 but it's a bit out of my price
range right now Plus this one's still
working for me and I don't really see
the need to replace it just yet now for
the miscellaneous stuff I just have
hooks for my keys and cables around a
desk and we also have this rolling seat
/ drawer beside our desks that we can
pull out - if we ever need to
collaborate with one another there's
really nothing inside my drawer right
now so there's really no point of me
opening it but yeah that's about it
