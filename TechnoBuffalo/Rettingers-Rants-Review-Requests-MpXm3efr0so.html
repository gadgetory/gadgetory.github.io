to you by netflix what's up everyone
welcome back to the episode of rettinger
trance I'm John rende your back from
vacation a little bit Tanana when I left
I want to thank a sh Lee for filling in
with me while I was gone whoo so this
weekend written just rinse we talked
about some a little bit awkward got this
rash I've always been a very open book
when it comes to videos I've done on
Rangers rants or videos I've done on
TechnoBuffalo something that's coming up
more and more in my life it's kind of
awkward because I know it's gonna make
me sound a little bit like jerk but it's
something that happened I know you guys
may be encountered as well if you do
YouTube videos or you own your own blog
or you run your own blog so i want to
share it with you this is an episode of
retina schrantz go ahead and get ranting
so in my life there are a few things
that are more important to me than
family and friends those two are
probably some of the most important
things that have in my life and I do
everything I can try and protect those
two and everything I can to help those
two but sometimes there are things that
I just can't do so obviously I've got a
platform I make youtube videos we have a
relatively large audience we have a
growing website as people look at that
and see an opportunity to promote their
own product which is fine I've often
times I get a lot of requests from
friends and family and saying hey my
friend owns an iphone case maker can you
promote his case or hey my friend is
selling their iphone 5 on ebay can you
make a video on it or can you put a post
up on TechnoBuffalo and the answer that
always have to say is no I can't do that
I always end up feeling like a jerk
because of it but can you imagine just
before you guys go calling me names big
a man you think you're so fancy do you
imagine if I put an article up on
TechnoBuffalo saying hey you should buy
this iphone 5 on ebay ever put a video
up saying hey you should buy this iphone
5 on ebay can you imagine what you mr.
watcher or miss watcher would say to me
if I did that I'd be destroyed the
sledge credibility would be lost my
credibility would be lost I would feel
super bad about it and beyond that there
are FTC guidelines we almost have to
disclose if it doesn't provide
reasonable information to the audience I
have to disclose that hey I'm doing this
as a favor to my friend and it just
takes away from the integrity of the
site it makes us look less like
journalists and more of just people that
words on a site and it always hurts me
every time I have to say no to somebody
will have to say no often time taking
people that are super offended you know
why would you do that you owe me
something from X well why don't you do
it for me we've been friends for 15
years or you're my 15th cousin how come
you won't do that for me it always makes
me feel like a huge jerk and I don't
think I'm alone in this I think if you
guys have a youtube channel you've got a
blog you probably counter this all the
time so if you guys had something like
this happened to you have you had a
friend come up to you and say hey can
you promote this or can you do that for
me and you just can't do it if you guys
don't remember I fought a lawsuit for
the better part of a year we were being
sued to reveal a source and we were
being sued because the people were suing
us say we didn't qualify as journalists
so I fought for a year to stay a techno
Buffalo and online bloggers are indeed
journalists are in town to that
protection if I were to violate that
journalistic ethics whether you think we
are not as irrelevant in the eyes of the
law now we officially are on that would
take us 10 20 steps back and it always
kills me whether you've been
dispossessed be in this position you
know someone that position you think hey
I even selling my phone or I know a case
manufacturer or my friend makes an appt
can you promote it think twice before
you ask them to put some in a really
uncomfortable position and maybe this is
a PSA maybe I should have you know
rainbow graphics around me insane
friends don't let friends ask for help
online but if Joe gets put on my mind
it's happened to me since I've been back
from vacation three times already in the
past two days I just been sort of top of
my head so I wanted to share with you
maybe I'm offline maybe I'm not maybe
I'm being a huge jerk and I just do it
I'd love to hear you guys thought on it
leave your comments down below I wanna
take a minute to thank our friends and
sponsors at Netflix you know you'd love
