from TechnoBuffalo here and here is a
video sample of the rear facing camera
on the iPad 2 we've got Mercedes as our
subject sitting there looking kind of
cute with her tail curled in this is
average light situation filmed in the
morning so weirdly isn't any artificial
light going on here
this is just the standard quality of the
camera go ahead and sort of see what
else things look like
so controllers there's your bed daylight
outside it does kind of focus and adjust
for it go back down see if we're Sadie's
will give us a smile there we go
alright let's let's switch over to the
front-facing camera alright so here is
the front-facing camera we have our same
subject Mercedes who is just sort of
sitting there doing her thing we're in
the same time of day same amount of
light and you guys can see what the
video fidelity looks like and also it's
test of the internal microphones found
on the iPad so you could test the audio
fidelity of them as well or it as well
all right so here we are now on
front-facing camera at the exact same
time of day exact same light situations
and one thing is painfully clear today I
should be behind the camera and not in
front of it as my gross beard and
uncombed hair probably are telling you
but at least this is the quality of the
front-facing camera
found on the iPad 2 and a test of the
microphones on the iPad as well same
microphone of course for both cameras at
least you'll be able to hear the audio
fidelity</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
