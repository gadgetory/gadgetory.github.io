like a combination of like iPhone 8 hype
and like galaxy s 8 hype like combined
into one tech loving car enthusiast
machine but there's something coming
next from Tesla after the model 3 and
that is the model y they're smaller than
Model X crossover with the Falcon wing
doors that Elon Musk had said was coming
sometime late 2019 early 2020 he had
said it's going to be built on a brand
new architecture not using the model 3
platform even model 3 underpinnings
which made very little sense so on
yesterday's quarterly earnings call Elon
Musk said and I quote upon the counsel
of my executive team who reeled me back
from the cliffs of insanity much
appreciated the model I will in fact be
using substantial carryover from the
model 3 or to bring it to market much
faster he also added I want to thank the
executive team for stopping me from
being a fool so there's a lot to read
into that I think when you think about
Tesla I oftentimes think about it it's
just
Elon Musk but he's surrounded by really
smart dudes you got JB Straubel Franz on
hold Houston who did all the design
really smart guys you probably thought
that building a brand new platform does
not make much sense specially from a
business standpoint so you look at the
model 3 right now we've got about
450,000 reservations at $1,000 each if
they were going to use a brand new
platform for the model one only would it
complicate the assembly line platform
for a new company it also would probably
push back the date of delivery and if
you figure that 2019 2020 date is now
going to be earlier for the model why a
lot of us didn't give a date but would
assume now probably late 2018 maybe
early 2019
that means Tesla could have jumped
started almost another half a million
reservations at $1,000 each there was a
lot of money they're bringing to the
table earlier you're probably wondering
why musk would even try and build a new
platform for the model why it goes back
to the Model X and allegedly just the
damn disaster that car was for Tesla
it's based on the Model S but they
couldn't get the engineering right it
was delayed by almost a year they had
quality problems the cars for shipped
almost through a year after shipping a
lot of
tributed to the Falcon wing doors so we
said you know what screw it we're able
to brand your platform with this design
in mind and they certainly backed off
from that so a few things refresh you on
the model why it is going to Falcon wing
doors give me about the same size to
think of a BMW x3 or the Audi q3 store
the smaller crossover there won't be a
third row seat it'll have a Franck and
I'll have a hatchback in the back of
course and the last thing about the
model Wyatt can be the first card can do
away the 12-volt batteries addition to
having that big old battery injected car
every Tesla still has the old school
lead acid battery in there so the model
y is going to do away with that so made
a ton of sense
I give much credit for backing off I'd
expect to probably see a model Y
announcement towards like the early part
of 2018 and then do a big date with the
model 3 have another announcer on their
ready to ship and then deliveries
probably a year later so I love talking
about Tesla it's a credible story the
mayor came manufacturing it's brilliant
engineering it comes from the mind I
think of one of the greatest visionaries
that we've seen in almost the past
hundred years it's a passion of mine I
hope you guys don't mind me chatting
cars over now then especially electric
cars kind of cool to chat about but
before I end I do want to thank audible
for making this video possible you guys
probably know who audible is that a
leading purveyor of audiobooks and

I reached out to audible to try and be a
sponsor because I legitimately use their
service on a daily basis to go to

it's been kind of fun I went on a
historical biography kick for a while I
did 1776 which is awesome Street of
course about the Revolutionary War I did
devil in the White City which was about
the Chicago World's Fair the murders
