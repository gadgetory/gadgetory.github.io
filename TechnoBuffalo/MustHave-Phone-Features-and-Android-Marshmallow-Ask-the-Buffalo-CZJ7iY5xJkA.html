technobuffalo here and welcome dear
friends back to the / soda of ask the
Buffalo to rap put my big fat butt on
this couch and I answer your questions
about things that that's happening
happening in tech let's go and jump
right into the questions first one comes
from math t Stegall 266 us at john for
lakers android m's name they're very few
questions on the show that i can just
answer like for sure and no because
earlier today which is monday google
unveiled the android marshmallow statue
their campus it's just the green android
guy just holding a marshmallow I was
hoping for like a marshmallow with
antenna and the legs but it's just an
android guy just just get his love on a
big marshmallow so that's coming it'll
be Android marshmallow it's official I
think kind everybody even marshmallow
but maybe milkshake so maybe google is
where'd they put no Jake out in their
front yard the be too many boys our next
one comes from ad Ezekiel who asks at
John for lakers thoughts on the new
galaxy s6 edge+ until five I've been
testing them since friday i'm filming
this on monday so it's been about three
days i'm going to obviously a full
review more feature breakdowns but i
can't say the screens are absolutely
gorgeous fingerprint sensor works great
you don't have to swipe your finger
danny is push it on it's worked almost
every single time the hardware feels
incredible the phones look and feel
awesome battery lepto seems to be
another story but i am still testing the
international units so I'm hopeful that
maybe that my horrible battery life has
been because constant looking for a
network so I get care units in then
we'll do a little more battery test for
you but it's a preliminary for the mini
baby review somani Alexander ass at John
for lakers what did you expect years
back after starting technobuffalo famous
or just a website when I started
technobuffalo I was got about twenty six
I was like just just foolish enough to
not know what it took to start a
business and naive enough to think that
I could do it starting your business is
daunting I'm not trying to discourage
anybody from doing it but actually
running a business business is is hard
man I mean in the seven years we've been
here I've had to fight to lawsuits had
to go through an audit that took almost
two years
it's all it's draining and it's hard and
if I knew what I know now what I still
go back and do it probably I think I
still would but I go in a little more
eyes open dance your question I think
was gonna be famous I had no idea I just
want to start a website that I would
want to read that put a lot of emphasis
on video and it's your wrote dressing
articles that i found interesting
whatever was gonna be was what's going
to be last egg quility asks at john for
lakers hi what is must have feature that
will influence your choice of phone and
what is your most wished for for me it's
you know if they're dirt slabs it's a
gorgeous screen and battery life i want
a really nice screen doesn't always have
to be qhd but certainly nice and I want
me some battery life those are the two
things that are most important to me
every phone out doesn't matter what
prostituting is gonna be fast enough it
was matter if it's not dragon ate away
day 20 if it's got quad cores on it at
least and least 2 Giga daram it's going
to be plenty fast I don't put that much
stock in processors camera matters not
that much ms long the pictures are
decent I'm not blowing them up or
anything as long as I can look at on my
phone or share them and maybe print one
out of the five by seven if I want
that's really all that I care about but
screen and battery life those are
putting my two big ones but what are you
guys one of the two things that you care
about most of the phone maybe you guys
disagree maybe it's all about processor
or ram I'll take your thoughts on it
leave it think your comments like here
like my knee blew my socks down
everything you guys for watching your
episode of ask the Buffalo if you guys
enjoy these I really love making them
until next time Jai renders
technobuffalo see you guys next video Oh
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
