technobuffalo here at the review for you
of the sonos zone player s5 this pretty
high performance wireless music system
is going to run you three hundred and
ninety nine dollars so this is a review
unit sent from so knows if you'll bear
with me i'm going to get a bit geeky
with you and go through some of the
specs on the device so since it is a
speaker system you want to know what
sort of speakers it's got in it it's got
a five driver speaker system including a
two tweeters 23 inch mid-range drivers
13.5 inch woofer and each driver of the
so no systems individually powered by a
dedicated amplifier manager guys will
here in a few minutes you can really
hear the speakers and hear the quality
of the music coming from such a small
device they say that it's got crystal
clear room filling sound and i was a bit
skeptical I've got a pretty large room
here and this device does a very nice
job with it so let me walk you been
around it and I'll show you some of the
cool features and especially nice about
this is how the software interact with
the hardware so it's very clean on the
front you've got the speaker grill
you've got a mute button and a volume up
and down on the top and this is of
course a network device on the back
really not much to see there either
you've got audio in and some audio out
ethernet ports and power and that's
about it and a handle it's not the
lightest device in the world certainly
it's able to be moved with one hand
let's go and take a look at some of the
software in the ways that you can
interact with the sonos s5 music system
alright guys let me give you an example
of the sonos desktop software that comes
bundled with your music player
compatible for both Mac or PC running
here on a Mac essentially what it does
it will import all a music from itunes
or whatever music player that you use if
you've got music stored on your hard
drive or an external drive it'll import
it in took about three or four minutes
to pull in about six gigs and music for
me so you can do that math accordingly I
don't open your library and they look
just like it would
in itunes whatever player you you can go
ahead and view all of your different
artists and sort of pick one that you
like so let's say you want to get pumped
up listen to some eye of tiger you go
ahead and just hit play and of course
we'll play on the SONA system in
whatever room of your home it is now you
get a limp or your albums your genre
even your playlist you can create on the
go playlist here in the sonos player by
taking advantage of that add to queue
button down below so there are a few
other cool services that you get here
and of course you can see that you can
do shuffle loopback keep playing if
you're having a dinner party or I keep
playing classical music and you've got
all those options here some additional
music services you get laughs FM I can
also get access to sirius satellite
radio the internet stream by there even
more button if you want to make your own
playlist still show up right here and
you have access to certain internet
radio shows i'll show you what that
looks like in just a few minutes in
addition to some of the line in options
so it worked very well just as you'd
expect to go and hit play and it just
starts playing control the volume right
from here as well but this isn't the
only way to control your sonos music and
i want to give you an example of how the
music quality actually sounds on the
player let's go ahead and go mobile so
one of the cooler waves interact with
your sonos player is its built-in and
free iphone application just download it
from the App source and then go ahead
and launch it and show you what you're
going to get and I've got the sonos
player directly behind us about two feet
away they'll be able to hear what the
music sounds like now go ahead and open
it up launches a player and let's go
ahead and back out of this and view
music this is what your main menu is
going to look like when you launch it
for the first time setting it up is just
as simple as pressing the volume up
button in the mute button on your sonos
player and that sets the pairing so you
give music view your music library which
will go to right away and i'll show you
some of these other options here as well
see music library looks about we expect
to look like just as it did on the
desktop you can do your albums artists
and what have you let's go ahead and
we'll jump to artists will pick through
a random artist here let's go ahead and
pick green day for example so 21st
Century Breakdown it also is pulling in
the album art if it's available
and we'll go ahead and just pick a song
for it quickly and i'll play its you
hear what the sounds like but so i don't
get busted into a weird copyright stuff
so you can click it you do play now you
can play next you can create a tack you
add it to your queue so if you're having
again a dinner party or a part of your
people over and you want to sort of make
a playlist as you go or someone wants to
hear a song you know you have to run
your computer this is a great way to get
to it so let's go ahead and play it now
and it starts to play neatly control the
volume right
the fats are just a bit you can view the
scrubber
now the video is not going to do justice
to the player the quality of the
microphone just isn't as professional
grade as a sonos would probably really
justify fills up a room very nicely it's
got nice rich deep sound it doesn't
sound tinny like you get when you're
blaring sort of crappy speakers on a
high volume it's got a very deep sound
I'd say it's definitely on par with the
bose offerings so let me show you some
of the other options that you're going
to get with the player here we'll go
back to music get access to a ton of
internet radio shows as well then go
ahead and view them really by a few
different ways let's go to talk radio
for example and let's go to news now
you've got a thing you won't listen to
traffic you've got a lot of shows you
can listen to here go ahead and you
let's say all stations now go back and
let's view all shows so you can view a
lot of shows that are playing right now
there are ton and go ahead and just
click him and they will start playing I
guess it's nice you're sitting on the
couch and you wanted to sort of listen
to these go ahead and get started takes
a minute for the stream to start and
then you will be off so it goes it's
playing a clearly not traffic however
it's classical music these are not
labeled properly and I found this in a
lot of them their 70s music in the ones
labeled Maggie's rock and traffic where
there should be music and music where
that should be traffic they just saw
here you get to play around to really
see which stations are going to function
best for you so you can go ahead and
view all your line and if you've got a
line coming in with another source you
can get some more music options take a
look at that again there's your last.fm
and you can add serious stream if you
want to set some sort of alarms you can
do that as well and the settings that
you're going to get let's take a look at
the used own player settings this is the
one that's set in my living room and
from right from here you can control all
your bass treble your balance your
loudness and do a complete reset all
right from your mobile device
one other thing that I want to add since
you do have to have the zone player
connected to an Internet Jack if you
want to have this in a room where you
don't have a route or you don't have
internet connection that something so
nose has called a zone bridge which is
99 bucks which lets you plug in any set
of speakers you want and you can have
your music stream that way just another
option overall I've been very impressed
with the sonos system it works really
well the quality of the music was quite
nice however it does come at a high
price 299 it's certainly quite a premium
there are plenty of less expensive
options available if you are an audio
file and the quality of the music and
the quality of the base and the treble
is about most importance to you it's
going to be a great investment 309
you're going to get a really nice system
that's a bit inconspicuously to put it
off to the side and that's going to rock
your house but if you just like listen
to casual music and you want to be able
to have some sort of internet streaming
um 499 or 399 is going to be a tough
price point four hundred bucks you may
be better off looking elsewhere so it's
going to come down to what your music
preference is for me I'd have a hard
time justifying 400 bucks on this but
again i'm not the biggest audio file if
you are it will certainly be a
worthwhile investment hope you guys
enjoyed is this oh no system something
that you're interested in is it is it
not very curious to hear what you guys
