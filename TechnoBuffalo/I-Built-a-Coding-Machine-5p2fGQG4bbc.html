bit of a secret it's dirty dirty secret
haven't shared much online I don't know
the code and not just like I can only
codes like small things like I'm not a
code at all I've tried I failed tried
and failed again I've got three
different books on JavaScript to learn
how to code and I feel like it's a big
gap in my geek cred so I'm gonna fix
myself I'm gonna better myself
and I got something that looks looks
kind of fun that'll help me learn how to
code
we got Berto off camera Berto can oh so
supposedly reason I was kind of
attracted to Cano aside from its it's
pretty red box is that it makes coding
super simple it's drag-and-drop coding
like scratch which which for me makes
sense if you use JavaScript if you're
more advanced and it'll work with a Mac
or a PC the self-contained computer with
ports go take a look we've got make a
lightboard stickers which one which one
looks like me let's go the guy who's so
pale you see through just like just like
me and and Berto off camera from berkos
bulletin all right so so you got going
on here
all right essentially this is a single
board computer with the LED array just
snap on top of it but it looks like
Santa fancy so pull that out to the side
we got some batteries it's got three USB
ports on there for accessories we got
Mike USB charging cable you got a case
to hold it in and more stuff for that
case more things for the case and we got
this thing
I love this is we'll figure out what
this is all right
here is the pixel brain cases oh it's a
mode dial and these are joystick buttons
case you're wondering so far so good
I haven't broken yet it's got first
impression buttons are very clicky nice
it's like an old-school HTC phone now
had the joystick all right this one push
that in there all right time for the
mode dial go ahead and do that
each turn sends a signal to the brain
and it snatch it like this okay now that
you like that all right place a battery
in shiny connectors first so there third
there there's that and there's that I
think that's the shiny connector all
right all right
powered on great now keep it strong and
safe let's make a case all right so to
front the case on a flat surface I can
do that
all right make sure the port speak out
see the port speaking out you see it
mark you see him that's what he's kept
falling out because it didn't have the
case to keep it in so wasn't my mistake
I'm gonna try and plug it in because
I've got a newer generation MacBook Pro
okay
dongle life all right so nothing has
changed is exactly the same that's said
if we had before let's plug this in all
right so now I'm in the critic I can
build ones different stuff in their
training apps let's go to make a light
show okay so I've got the canvas or I
can go into the JavaScript if I want to
do that but I am not that good so I've
got these golden diamonds some what to
do I'll push next
all right so control this is control so
every one seconds do something so what I
wanted to do when the app start every
one second I'll go to light board
turn light on to then drive that there
you go I did something look I did that I
so I went through and did some of the
challenges that you can tell by my
proper rainbow in my light challenge I'm
probably the best coder that's ever
lived
so they set it up kind of a cool way
you've got a canvas where it's heard a
lot of the drag-and-drop stuff like I
said like scratch you go and you can see
how things connect and they have
different colors and you go and drag
things down below or off to the right
and the program will execute them and if
you want to see if the JavaScript is you
can see that as well if you want to sort
of learn the JavaScript or if you
already know you can program directly
into there but it was really simple and
it starts off very simply I started off
just lighting one pixel that I moved
that pixel around then I created a light
strip and I got to change colors and I
got to do a little little color dance
and serve goes to show and you can have
a foundation for coding you know strip
using this drag-and-drop framework
ultimately you'll learn some JavaScript
as well as you're going to look
which is kind of cool to see so as you
go through and finish your own
challenges or if you decide to create
your own project on the candle kit you
could also share it around lang
community which they've appropriately
called Kanna world you can check out
other people have created you can leave
a comment or decide to remix other
creations you can use what other people
have done you can improve or modify and
make it better and show your programming
skills you can use across multiple
platforms either Mac or PC can't oh
don't care this was it was the Meccano
asked me to take a look at this and
something that I wanted to try they did
spawn to the video something something I
really wanted to learn and I want to
sort of share kind of share it with you
guys so this is something that you want
to try we'll put a link here and link to
it down below they also be a five dollar
off coupon down there cupen if you want
to try it so if you guys go to code
leave in the comments down below give me
a thumbs up cuz I tried
I'm really trying to learn how to code
and if I feel the encouragement the
community love I will share the stuff
that I'm making with Meccano with you
guys and you guys need some advice I'm
learning how to code
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
