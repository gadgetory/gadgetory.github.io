TechnoBuffalo here last week Tom Merrick
from cnet.com put up a video about how
you can well sort of use the iPhone on
Verizon or Sprint network no hacky
required and while it was a very good
post actually was really informative I
thought it needed a little bit more
explanation and you can go it's a little
bit more detail about the nuances of how
to do it
so let me go ahead and explain before
you guys get too excited about using
your iPhone on Verizon or Sprint
completely and freely it's not gonna
happen but there is a way to sort of use
your iPhone on Verizon or Sprint
completely legally non hacking non
jailbreaking or nothing and it involves
a device you saw me review last week the
MiFi and again this is available on
Sprint or Verizon buddy that may not
have seen the video what the my fied
does and this is the Verizon version
sucks in Verizon's CDMA network and
spits out a Wi-Fi signal which is
actually quite needed use it for data
for any Wi-Fi equipped device laptop or
phone so what you can do turn the MiFi
on it really just let the side about
eight credit card stat so quite small I
can fit at your pocket or a backpack or
purse whenever you might carry and hook
it up and connect your iPhone to it so
now essentially what you're doing is
you're using Verizon is a video network
for data on your iphones nothing
terribly fancy right there but it's
coming out looking like Wi-Fi but you're
still using Verizon's EVDO network so
that's fine for data what if you want to
make calls well there are a lot of
options you can do now to make calls now
that you're using
Verizon's EVDO network you can use call
forwarding with a system like Skype so
if you got a verizon number you can set
that number to forward to your Skype
number and always have Skype up and
running on your iPhone with things like
Google Voice which I assume will
eventually be released for the iPhone
there are a lot of other voice over IP
options that you can use
so essentially you really don't have to
go through AT&amp;amp;T if you want to use the
iPhone although you do have to purchase
a my Fi
running either $99 on contract or if you
want to buy it out of contract about two
hundred and sixty dollars and you got to
be careful with plans with this too you
can either spend about 60 bucks a month
for a five gig plan or forty bucks a
month I believe for a 250 megabyte plan
and those prices are the same with
Verizon or Sprint so it's not an
unlimited all-you-can-eat sort of
solution but it is a way to go if you
are stuck in a Verizon contract you're
waiting to get out or maybe you don't
get 18 G service where you are but you
get better Verizon or Sprint coverage it
is a nice way to go one of the other
side effects about using the MiFi is
your phone thinks that you're connected
to Wi-Fi since well it really is doesn't
know that you're just using a EVDO
network that's being converted so you
get around a lot of limitations at the
iPhone put in place for instance slim
player if you use sling player you can
only use it over Wi-Fi but since you are
technically over Wi-Fi you can now use
sling player anywhere you are the same
is true for a lot of other Wi-Fi only
applications for example like Skype or
like iTunes if you need to download a
app that's over ten megabytes you can
now do that and you can use a lot of
streaming applications as well like
juste that is only Wi-Fi so you it's a
nice sort of middle ground right there
so it's not the iPhone on Verizon or
Sprint that some of you might be looking
for but it is definitely an alternative
for how you can do it so just a kind of
a short summation about how this works
in case some of you got confused the my
file this little device right here
converts a cellular data network into a
Wi-Fi signal so think of it as a
portable portable router essentially so
you turn this bad boy on you connect
your iPhone just like you'd see any
other Wi-Fi network you throw this in
your bag you put in your back pocket
whatever and now you're connected via
Wi-Fi to sprint or Verizon's EVDO
network you can now set up call
forwarding and you can have all your
calls forwarded right to Skype or a
voice over IP client actually works out
quite well or you can just use the other
carriers data network if you prefer like
I said if you don't get good
tea coverage where you might be if
you're in a rural area or if you're in
just one of those spots that doesn't
quite work well it isn't very nice
alternative and I think it's a very good
idea and I think Tom Merritt when he
first brought this up really had a
brilliant idea to to use your iPhone or
really any phone for that matter on
Verizon's Network and this sort of trick
and not really hack again will work for
any Wi-Fi equipped phone kind of cool
anyway hope you enjoyed it something
that you're gonna consider doing you do
have to eat a $60 a month plan but
technically you could not have a data
plan on your iPhone and just keep this
with you you could not even have a voice
plan actually on your iPhone and keep
this with you and it's always have Skype
or some other sort of voice over IP
client open and well you can use it so
it's something that you might consider
is it worthwhile not worthwhile I can't
tell you that the mind 5 works
fantastically data rates are really
really really fast but you are gonna be
capped to five gigs of space or five
gigs of download or upload so I hope you
enjoyed hope this is a good explanation
if you have questions go ahead and leave
them in the comments down below and
leave your video response if something
that you think that you might do anyway
