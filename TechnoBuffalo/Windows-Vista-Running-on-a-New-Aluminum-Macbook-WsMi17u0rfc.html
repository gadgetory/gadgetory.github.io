lakers calm i want to give you a very
quick look of the performance of windows
vista running on a stock configuration
aluminum macbook 2.4 gigahertz nothing
terribly in depth here just general
vista stuff i don't have many programs
get installed on a window side I only
put windows on the mac because I'm gonna
need some programs for graduate school
that are windows only so Vista was
installed via bootcamp and it's vista
home premium and if you'd like to
install windows on your mac at home all
you need is OS 10 leopard and a full
installed version of either XP service
pack 2 or newer or windows vista that's
it installation is a piece of cake so
guys hope you enjoy i did do a quick
vista score for so you can see general
performance and just some simple stuff i
know i have leave questions down below
and i will talk to you guys soon bye hey
guys jon rettinger from john for lakers
calm here i'm going to give you a
demonstration of windows vista running
on a stock configuration 2.4 gigahertz
new aluminum macbook and it's running
windows vista home premium and I
partitioned off 45 gigabytes of hard
drive space and it is loaded in here via
bootcamp and the discus partition to via
the bootcamp installer so let's go ahead
and get this started so here is the new
aluminum macbook when you turn on the
computer just like any mac running boot
camp you want to hold down the option
key as soon as the boot screen comes up
we'll go ahead and hold down the option
key let you guys see how long this takes
and then i'll cut ahead for you so there
you go we are now greeted with two
options one that says macintosh hard
drive here the other one that says
windows so we'll go ahead and boot into
windows and it is going to go ahead and
launch Windows Vista what you guys see
really what this looks like from start
to finish
sorry for reflection there the light is
coming on so you've got microsoft
corporation you can see windows vista
booting up and actually is relatively
quick which is nice not as quick as OS
10 but it is nice and fast so go ahead
and give this another few seconds to
load up there's the little windows vista
icon and here we are let me type in my
password login so here we are windows
vista and it is very quick and very fast
and i haven't had any crashing issues
with it so i'll show you some of the
features of vista and kind of show you
how arrow works and some of those other
things so i open up firefox here I don't
have any programs really installed on
Windows I don't use it that much but i
will show you kind of what it looks like
and show you how quick things are and
how the mac can handle it so here now
all will launch the switch between
windows bars part of Windows Aero you
can see the three-dimensional stuff that
pops up here I really see it's very
quick very seamless no lagging at all
with the new nvidia integrated processor
and it really is nice and fast i will
show you guys also how fast the computer
can can benchmark actually i'll do a
windows vista benchmark score for you so
we'll go to start menu will go to
control panel and there should be a
performance and the mouse by the way
while we're in Windows Vista works just
as it would in OS 10 two finger
scrolling works for going up and down
and for clicking you can either click
the button or double tap although the
only thing that's a little bit odd is if
you want to write
click instead of two fingers like in OS
10 it actually has three fingers on the
trackbed so three fingers will pull up a
right click it's a little bit weird but
you know one of those one of those
things to get used to very quickly so we
will go to performance okay performance
information and tools and I already did
the benchmark here but I'll do it again
for you guys so you can see what the
score is here so we will update my score
now this takes a few minutes and so I'm
going to turn the camera off three and
i'll show you guys what it looks like
when we're done bowling you see that
it's working we will continue part of
the nice fun with windows vista ask your
permission for everything so it is going
to do its test here and i will show you
guys a score in a minute alright so i
had to plug it in and actually won't do
it when it's not plugged in but the same
results did come back the macbook 2.4
gigahertz a 5.2 for vista which actually
is a very very very high score the
processor was a 5.3 the ram was a 5.9
graphics was a 5.4 gaming graphics was a
5.3 and the primary hard disk was a 5.2
so let's say very high rating for a any
computer really especially one with
integrated graphics shows how capable
the new macbooks really are so guys it's
just a real quick demonstration of
windows vista running on a Mac and show
you how quick and easy it is to work and
I hope you enjoy it i'm jon rettinger
