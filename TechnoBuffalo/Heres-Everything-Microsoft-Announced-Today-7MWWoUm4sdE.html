to you by domain.com forget stella you
guys microsoft has got their groove back
mr percenter TechnoBuffalo and this is
everything you need to know about this
week's microsoft event let's get some of
the smaller stuff out of the way still
exciting but we want to get to the meat
and the potatoes so firstly new Xbox one
limited edition consoles are on the way
you've been waiting to dive into the
current gen or you're looking to switch
or fill out your entertainment cabinet
the consoles featuring Xbox biggest
titles might be a good time to make a
move limited edition consoles are on the
way for halo 5 Guardians Forza Tomb
Raider and years of war that's not all
in gaming though today Microsoft demoed
their hollow lens technology as it
pertains to gaming calling it mixed
reality this allows developers to
dynamically evaluate the room that the
game is taking place in whether it's
your living room or an arena the dev kit
for hollow lens is going to be available
in q1 of 2016 for three thousand dollars
not to be left behind in wearables
Microsoft updated their band today the
band 2 is an incremental update that
makes many of the user requested changes
like a more comfortable strap in the
addition of a barometer for elevation
tracking course it also supports
notifications and like but obviously
that's going to work best with in the
Microsoft ecosystem that new Microsoft
band is coming in at $249 all right now
the good stuff even with all the leaks I
still get so so stoked to see devices go
official the Lumia 950 and 950 XL are
our brand new flagships from Microsoft
the 950 is sporting a 5.2 inch 2560 x
1440 display for a ppi of 565 a
snapdragon 808 a three thousand million
power battery and that suckers gonna
start at 549 the XL is rocking a 5.7
inch 2560 x 1440 display for a ppi of
515 it's got a snapdragon 810 that is an
octa-core processor and a 3340 milliamp
hour battery the XL is going to run you
649 MSRP both devices have 32 gigs
starting internal expandable up to two
terabytes believe it or not even though
you can't get a two terabyte SD card
they both have the same camera sensors
on the back in the front 20 megapixels
on the back 5 megapixels on the front
both of them have USB type-c and both of
them have a dedicated camera button
which one of my favorite things of the
old school nokia devices they both also
have liquid cooling I have no idea how
that works but I can't wait to see if it
makes a difference in terms of
performance and they have ambient AMOLED
displays very much like what you see on
motor devices and a handful of other
Android devices even cooler they can
also be used as full on desktop machines
with the windows continuum display dock
which gives you access to USB 3.0 ports
HDMI ports and even display for it out
if you're looking for something in the
tablet arena the surface pro 4 is also
here I loved the three so I can't wait
to see how the four stacks up the 4
comes with a new type cover which has a
much improved keyboard trackpad and a
brand new fingerprint sensor for
Microsoft hello the screen features what
the Microsoft team calls pixel sense
which makes for the realist looking
image that you can expect on a portable
device we will have to see if that lives
up to the claims though underneath the
hood the pro 4 is rocking the latest gen
intel processor up to 16 gigs of ram and
up to one terabyte of storage the pro 4
also comes with a brand new redesign pen
that microsoft says is their best yet
with 1024 levels of pressure a full year
of battery life and a new eraser on the
back end the surface pro 4 starts at
eight ninety nine and it's available for
