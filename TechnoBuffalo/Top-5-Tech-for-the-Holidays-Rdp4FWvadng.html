holidays can be a very stressful
experience especially if you are on a
budget so to make life easier for you
I've got five tech gifts that I think
will make an awesome present for out
loved one in your life here they are in
really no particular order coming in at
number five the sphero bb-8 app-enabled
droid aside from being Lucy's favorite
toy around the office this rolling movie
prop can be control with your phone
tablet I can display holographic
messages on whatever device you're using
his personality actually changes
depending on how you use it so if you
ram it into the walls a lot it's gonna
get mad 150 bucks it's not the cheapest
gift out there but if the star wars fan
this one is a must-have number for the
parent Zeke tues these have been my
go-to headphones for over a year and I
haven't been disappointed featuring both
Bluetooth connectivity and noise
canceling these lightweight headphones
have been an absolute dream if you're a
frequent traveler you like the removable
battery option you can keep a charge one
on hand the regular cup features a touch
panel that helps you control the volume
tracks and calls be prepared to launch
i-tunes any time you touch it with the
Zeke 3 is hitting now's a great time to
pick up these awesome headphones for
about two hundred fifty dollars number
three the kindle fire 7-inch when it
comes to tablets i'm usually focus on
specs but for fifty bucks this
underpowered almost disposable tablet is
surprisingly useful its 7-inch display
looks decent enough but you look at
access to over 100,000 apps amazon
appstore with a tiny bit of side loading
and get full Google Play access and for
the price you can just pick one up for
every day of the week number two the
boosted board this test slopes keyboards
is not for the faint of wallet your
$1,500 will get you 2,000 watts of power
that you've carved like a snowboard and
ride like a skateboard at just 13.5
pounds light enough to carry with you
has a seven mile range and go as fast as
22 miles per hour but again it's not
cheap but the vanguard bamboo deck and
orangutans heaton wheels are all premium
plus you're gonna look like a pro and
number one something we actually just
picked up for our studio the vizio d
series array LED TV big nough TV is
super confusing trying to find the right
combination of looks and performance can
just be dumbfounding we've been rocking
a vizio p series their primary opposite
for well over a year here's our unboxing
of it and we've been absolutely loving
at the before
grunts has been stellar so I wanted to
stick with the brand like I said this is
going to be our studio set so wanted
something with really deep blacks the
d-series actually has something called
active led zone to get those blacks
really dark it also gives you really
bright colors plus a full array LED
backlighting because a killer picture
also has smart TV functionality and all
for under 800 bucks for 65 inch set it's
really hard to beat so what do you guys
think which one of the top five are you
picking up for yourself or maybe that
special someone in your life love to
hear your thoughts on it leave in the
comments down below until next time I'm
John rende Yorkin technobuffalo two guys
