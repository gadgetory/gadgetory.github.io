took the wraps off Android wear and
since then the UI I stayed relatively
similar that is all about to change with
the release of Android wear two point O
Developer Preview I'm drought rendering
TechnoBuffalo we are live at Google i/o
2016 in beautiful mountain view
california so what is android wear two
point O going to bring you that maybe I
don't have on your existing wrist while
the few giant ones jump to mind the
first you have to find the watch face it
has the information for the app you need
now any watch face can show any
information from any app that is a huge
and welcome update Sandridge where's
been all about notifications but how are
you going to be piles notifications
android is taken what they've done in
the past really just to the next level
we now have a full qwerty keyboard with
swipe gestures you can use your finger
to draw on the screen now it's actually
gonna scroll across give you infinite
space to scroll out your message you
want to tell your mommy will be home at
ten you go and just type that up on your
wrist if you use your watch for fitness
Google's got some treats in store for
you now you can leave your phone at home
go for a run or jog whenever you want to
do with your watch on and it will
automatically send all the information
to the phone at your house if you're big
music fan as well you can now play music
on your watch without the need for your
phone all that is great but for me the
biggest update is standalone apps
finally coming to Android we're no
longer you have to wait for apps to load
from a phone or connected device they
can now launch directly from your wrist
meaning we're going to get faster more
powerful apps finally coming to Android
wear why don't you got the first
developer preview it is available now we
don't know where the final race is going
to be or what Android wear device are
going to get this presumably will see
them how to hit the market in the next
few months what does anybody enjoyed
where's that worth waiting for the next
version of the Moto 360 or maybe the
wall way watch ever might be coming soon
on one hear your thoughts on it leave
the comments down below the next time

next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
