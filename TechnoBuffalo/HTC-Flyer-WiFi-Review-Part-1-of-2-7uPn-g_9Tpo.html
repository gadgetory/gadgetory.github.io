Kravitz from TechnoBuffalo calm and you
know this whole tablet computing
revolution when I really think about
what a good use for a tablet is this is
what I think about its first thing in
the morning I head outside to the porch
a cup of coffee tablet catch up on what
I need to get caught up on before I get
into the thick of the day check email
read some RSS feeds read some web pages
you know maybe do a little video chat
conversation with one of my colleagues
just to kind of you know do it a little
morning check in and talk to John maybe
talk to Sean see what's going on today
what we need to cover and the fun thing
about a tablet is in theory you can do
all this stuff almost anywhere it's even
more portable than a laptop but you know
a little bigger a little more
functionality than a smartphone one of
my favorite tablets of this year or when
I first saw it at Mobile World Congress
in Barcelona was the HTC Flyer now that
I've had the Wi-Fi only version for
about a week now along with the magic
pen it's still my favorite let's find
out
all right so here's the HTC Flyer the
tablet it's available right now through
Best Buy the Wi-Fi only version which is
the one I have here 16 gigs of internal
storage
it's 499 dollars no contract it's not
through a carrier its Wi-Fi only and
then if you want the stylus as well the
HTC scribe active stylus pen here this
is an additional 80 it's $79.99 so if
you buy the two things together you're
looking at five hundred eighty dollars
plus tax depending on where you live out
here in California that's a ton but
you're looking at six hundred a little
bit more than six hundred dollars for
the package which you know is
competitive with tablets but also kind
of expensive actually a little bit more
than some of the comparable tablets and
certainly for a seven-inch tablet you
know a little bit on the pricey side now
carrier versions will be coming out all
but certainly the first carrier version
will be on Sprint the HTC EVO view no
pricing or ship date has officially been
set yet but I'm hearing late June
probably June 24th and I'm also hearing
that Sprint will probably package the
stylus in with the device so I don't
know what they'll sell it for but you
figure you know competitively probably
around four hundred maybe five hundred
dollars on contract with the stylus
included so after having used the device
for a few weeks you know what I think of
it is a couple of things I think it
works really really well I think they
should see issues you need a bang-up job
on the design and the implementation I
think actually that you know for the
basic software the basic functionality
using Gingerbread as opposed to
honeycomb you're not really losing
anything and I actually think you might
actually be gaining something here
because the honeycomb tablets that I've
tried so far they work well but you know
there's not a lot of polish on them not
a lot of customizations yet you know
it's sort of it's the first generation
of products and you know some of them
have you know 3.1 isn't quite out yet
and that sort of thing and so you kind
of get what you get with those which is
um you know sort of a brand new
experience with a lot of potential but
you know still a lot of things coming
you know even things like resizable
widgets on the home screen are coming in
3.1 but they're not available for most
of the tablets out there yet the zoom
you can get two three
update it said there's a lot that's
coming on the other hand the two decks
platform has been out for a while HTC's
certainly been working working on it and
doing a lot of customizations to it and
they've taken their game to a new level
here with the new version of sense and
you know just really done a nice job not
just with the widgets and the 3d effects
here on the carousel and that sort of
thing but also with little things like
the new launch bar on the bottom where
you can you know have your shortcuts to
your to your apps that you use
frequently into the app launcher little
things like on the browser if we go back
to the home screen here and go to the
Internet and we'll see on the browser
when you pull down the notifications bar
you have not just you know your
notifications but you also have and this
isn't just in the browser bin the
notifications bar you know shortcuts to
your most recently used apps shortcuts
to quick settings things like that that
just kind of increase the productivity
on the slightly larger display of the
tablet it's a 7 inch display 1024 by 600
and those things work in in portrait
mode as well going back to the browser
you know a nice little thing here if you
hit the windows button you've got you
know thumbnail view of your windows and
you can easily add a new window and now
you go back and you can get an overview
of what's in each window and you know
sort of like tab browsing you know just
little things there that that really
just you know when you're when you're
working on a platform you've been
working on for a while you can continue
to refine as opposed to having to go you
know jumping to honeycomb and
immediately sort of not starting
entirely from scratch but definitely
starting from scratch in some ways
because there are things on honeycomb
like the placement of you know the home
and back virtual buttons you know in
different apps aren't consistent things
like that and so I think HTC was wise to
stick with what they've been doing for a
while and there is a honeycomb version
of flower you know they will be
upgrading it now the downside is that
you don't get access to all of the
tablet optimized apps that are out there
for honeycomb devices so you're looking
at using apps that were built you know
basically built for smartphones and then
the first generation of Android
tablets that are really running you know
what Google is said is not a tablet
optimized platform so you know there's
definitely a trade-off there but again
HTC has said that they will be upgrading
the flyer to honeycomb at some point so
you are a little bit future proofed in
that regard as for the device itself
whether or not you want to use a 7-inch
tablet it's definitely a matter of
personal preference one thing I am a
little disappointed with and having the
flyer you know around to use for a while
especially in comparison to some of the
other devices it's a little bit heavy
and it's not a deal-breaker and it feels
really solid the aluminum unibody
construction I mean it's fantastic the
device you know whether or not you like
the gray and white is a matter of style
but the device is very well made it
looks and feels great the use here of
the aluminum back with these rubber
grips and the top and bottom is really
nice because when you switch from
portrait to landscape mode you know you
can grip onto these contoured kind of
plastic rubber panels there which is
kind of a nice touch and and the thing
feels solid and it's tough I was talking
to James Kendrick why do the good to go
show with we're talking about the device
and how he dropped I believe it was him
we said someday I was talking to another
reviewer said they dropped there's no
problems at all with it
it's definitely built well built you
know to step up from the plastic tablets
that we're seeing from other companies
but the trade-off is that it's heavier
and it's noticeably heavier it's heavier
you know I picked this up and then I
pick up the Barnes and Noble Nook color
which is a similarly sized device and I
noticed how much lighter than of colors
or I pick this up and then I pick up the
Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1 which is a
10-inch screen device and I feel like
the Galaxy Tab is lighter as well so you
know I definitely that's that's
something that the more I've used this
I've been a little bit disappointed just
in that it does feel heavy that said you
know again it's not a deal-breaker at
all and I think you get used to a pretty
quick and it's still light enough to use
for one-handed reading it's just you
know not the lightest 7 inch tablet or
lightest tablet out there for sure
performance has been great the 1.5
gigahertz Snapdragon processor you know
forget to talk about dual core single
core whatever it's been plenty fine
1080p videos
they're just a little tiny bit you know
but web browsing page rendering all that
kind of stuff works really well you know
the accelerometer kicks in you know no
real problems
in terms of performance on the device
the cameras it's got front and back
cameras the cameras a little bit of a
disappointment but most tablets are like
that these days for sure getting into
some of the you know so overall not to
gloss over the stuff but overall the the
performance of the device has been great
and you know pushing it's a slightly
smaller screen 1024 by 600 means less
pixels to push which means you know it
it's a little bit a little bit easier on
the processor we're looking at the HTC
watch service now and I'll preview a
trailer here this is over Wi-Fi right
now HTC watch is another online media
store the performance isn't pretty good
you know you can rent movies
competitively price you know three four
or five dollars for a rental you can
play them on the screen the playback
looks good it's not HD it's it's 600
pixels tall but then you can also output
the movies via DLNA to a DLNA equipped
device so you know wires wirelessly
streaming over Wi-Fi and watching the
big screens that kind of thing it's a
nice system but frankly you know how
many it we're starting to get in this
fragmentation with the media stores
smart investment of HTC's part 2 you
know to invest in a company and now you
know you can buy and rent movies
directly from ECC and they get the
revenue but you know as of right now
it's pretty limited in terms of you know
how much stuff is in there and do we
really need another media store and you
know would we rather instead see
something like a connection to HTC's I
mean to Amazon's media store because
you've got the Amazon mp3 player in here
and you can upgrade to use the Amazon
lock or the cloud player so you know
wouldn't it be kind of better to hook
into that player for video content from
Amazon who's already got a huge library
but that might be coming anyway you've
got your you're connected media which I
was alluding to which is where you can
shoot you
music videos and photos out to a nearby
connected player over over DLNA so there
I've got some camera shots there was the
one I took of James now we're talking
about the tablet the flyer I'm not our
last good to go show so I'm searching
and I don't think I have anything
connected right now so it's not gonna
yeah the HTC Flyer is the only thing
I've got right now so it'll just play it
on the device but if you have a DLNA
device you can use that otherwise we've
got snap booth which is a a little kind
of Apple photo booth type app for I
don't mean to compared to Apple but yeah
they they have it out there so whatever
it's a little front-facing camera app
just kind of fun you know some other
little stuff like that
you've got the e-reader and this looking
into talking about the pen which is what
I want to talk about so you write your
e-reader in here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
