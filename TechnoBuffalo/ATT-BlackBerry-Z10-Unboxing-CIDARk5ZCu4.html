from TechnoBuffalo today we are unboxing
the blackberry z10 on AT&amp;amp;T it took us a
little while we had the galaxy s4 event
you have the HTC One review we had tons
of stuff in any case it's finally here
we're gonna unbox it for you right now
alright sim card slot holder thingamajig
the phone itself let's go through the
box real quick and then we'll go to that
Quick Start menu does anybody read those
things inside your new smartphone
Snapdragon stuff your guide to using it
some terribly cheap headphones they're
like super plastic this yet your micro
USB charging cable and then the wall
wart that comes with it okay so while
the phone does support hdmi out and it
doesn't come with that so you'll need to
get that yourself let's go over the
futures real quick you've got a four
point two inch display right here that's
got a 1280 by 768 pixel resolution by
the way I set this up a little bit
because I didn't want to have to it like
sends you through all these startup
menus I want to be able to show you the
phone moving around micro USB HDMI up
top you've got the 3.5 millimeter
headphone jack a power button on the
right volume buttons nothing on the
bottom and then we'll pop off the cover
now to get it set up actually i have my
nano sim from my iphone working just
fine here but otherwise it's a micro-sim
slot you've got the battery itself I
forget that rating off the top of my
head in case in our original review were
getting about a day of battery life out
of its not too bad 8 megapixel camera on
the back capable of HD and the flash
there then of course you've got the
camera up front for video chats
blackberry or BBM chats whatever alright
let's quickly go through some of the
features there you sauce on my calendar
events I have a breakfast tomorrow
morning swipe left and right we've
showed you this in our reviews so I'm
just going to go through real quick app
selection is okay right
we've got a hundred thousand
applications i believe twenty percent of
them are actually powered by android so
that's kind of wild we're built upon
android rather and then you've got other
things you got the drop down menu here
bluetooth Wi-Fi rotation lock very nice
and i actually like this feature and
we've showed it to you in our original
hands-on demo yes snap that back down
original hands-on demo but when it's
locked you can actually just slide up
it's kind of a cool effect to unlock the
phone any case wanted to bring you a
quick unboxing of the z10 from 18t
there's a logo right there 199 dollars
or two hundred dollars if you want to
get legit with it with a two-year
contract this is todd Hazleton with
TechnoBuffalo checking out the
blackberry z10 480
