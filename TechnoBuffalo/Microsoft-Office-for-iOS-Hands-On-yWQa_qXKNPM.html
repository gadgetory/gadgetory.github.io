i have had a very long week at e3 but i
did get to spend time today back in the
office with microsoft office for iOS
it's new it's exciting but it's also a
little bit basic so let's take a look at
how straightforward Microsoft Office for
iOS is so here it is Office Mobile we
have the icon here ready to go it's iOS
ready and here is our office when you
open this for the first time you'll
actually be prompted to log in with your
office 365 account which we've already
done and now we have a few different
things so these three demos are on
SkyDrive so they're available to us to
check out and then we also have some
sample documents available by default in
office for iOS so let's let's take a
look at everything so if we have a word
document you can see that's something
open it's got images you can actually
comment on things if you want if you hit
the edit button here you're now able to
edit so if I wanted to change anything I
could do that
but if not that's okay but nice
collaboration you can comment on things
so you can make notes which is always a
nice thing to have when you are
collaborating on a document and if you
want to go to outline view or find
something you just tap on that eyeball
there and of course if we want to share
save or save as we want to make a
duplicate we can do that in the file
options but pretty basic not a whole lot
going on in terms of extra functionality
I mean you're not going to have a full
formatting table here which is a little
frustrating you can of course save
changes cancel whatever you want to do
we'll just save them and get out of here
so here's the save screen and you can
name it whatever you want and once we
hit done it will connect us back to the
main page of Office for iOS and you'll
see it'll start refreshing and then
here's our file right here so it's
downloaded from SkyDrive right now but
we wanted to remove it from our device
we could just do that and now it will go
away which is always very very nice if
you don't want any clutter here is the
Excel spreadsheet this is the sample
that we have you can see you can zoom
out if you want to get a better view of
what's going on of course you have your
different tabs here all the same stuff
that you would see inside Excel for
desktop just a little bit more compact
so here are some different options
available to us on editing tools you can
format you can do an autosum if you're
doing something that has to do with math
like an invoice and also you have
viewing tools you can sort your
different columns you can apply filter
find all that great stuff and of course
our file options share save save as we
haven't really changed anything so
hopefully it won't ask us if you want to
save yeah great and now lastly there is
PowerPoint sample presentation so here
it is right here you can actually swipe
through and look at the different slides
and what the notes are on them if you'd
like to add notes you can do that just
by tapping it's really simple you can
also see a full zoomed out view of all
of your slides you can go to any
particular slide you can edit you can
move a slide hide a slide or edit the
slide text this one doesn't have text
these are graphics right here but if it
did you would be able to do that if we
go to the one previously should be able
to edit the text here so here's the text
very simple unfortunately it doesn't
look like you can control transitions or
anything like that inside this
particular editing of the sample
presentation if we wanted to make a new
document we could do Word or Excel but
you'll notice no PowerPoint so you
cannot actually create a PowerPoint
document or presentation from iOS which
is kind of a bummer but honestly I think
if you're using PowerPoint for
presentation you probably wouldn't want
to make a full presentation on your
phone but it is nice to be able to just
go in and edit those presentations they
also have some templates available
agenda outline room report and then on
Excel budget event schedule and mileage
tracker making it really easy to do
something that
if you want to share something that's a
little bit more used very often so
here's our settings really basic you can
reset it help and support about Terms of
Service privacy and improve office
that's it there's not a whole lot of
stuff going on here it's pretty basic
but generally speaking it is really nice
to be able to collaborate with office
and office 365 so if you have an office
that uses Microsoft and the office suite
this can come in very handy and I'll be
checking it out a little bit more to see
if there are any deeper options but as
of right now it doesn't quite look like
there's much more to it than that
so that is Microsoft Office for iOS it's
pretty straightforward pretty simple but
also pretty useful if you use the office
suite
