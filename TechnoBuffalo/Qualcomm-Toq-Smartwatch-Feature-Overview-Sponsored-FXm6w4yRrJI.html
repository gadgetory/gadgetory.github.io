qualcomm booth at CES 2014 CES can be a
crazy convention with a lot of action
happening and our site has a lot of
people running around the show but it's
a lot easier this year because I've got
a qualcomm toq smartwatch here's why a
convention like this is huge spread out
all over in multiple hotels a convention
center and everywhere in between so it's
really easy for me to lose track of my
technobuffalo teammates but not anymore
because with talks integrated google
calendar all it takes is a couple of
swipes and i can find out where
everybody is and when if I'm in the
middle of a meeting and I get a non
urgent message from a team member I want
to be able to reply discreetly and the
toq smartwatch app for Android allows
you to make quick reply messages that
you can then choose on your talk
SmartWatch no more looking rude right in
the middle of a meeting the weather here
in Las Vegas can be pretty unpredictable
from an overcast day like this too not a
cloud in the sky and 80 degrees but with
Qualcomm's mirasol display technology it
is always on you're always going to be
able to see what's happening on your
talk no matter what time of the day or
night CES lasts for about a week which
means this is gonna last me for CES but
when I get home I'm gonna need a charge
which is why I'm gonna use the talks
hassle-free charger so what I do is
press the button place my talk down walk
away for a couple hours and then when
it's done I'm ready to cover another
show for another week a huge part of CES
for me is networking and if i want to go
to an after-party i'm pretty stylish and
i can't possibly be seen wearing the
same watch face that i was wearing on
the convention show floor so that's why
i can use the talk app for Android and i
can choose which watch faces i want to
use just in case i want to get a little
more wild at the end of the day or if I
want to just match my outfit so if
you're an on-the-go professional looking
for a little more organization while
you're out of convention like CES or if
you just want to be on the cutting edge
of wearable technology the qualcomm toq
could be for you you can find out more
