questions I get more than any other is
when should I buy my new mac and it's a
tough one to answer because it varies on
the time of the year but twice a year I
like to put out a video where it's most
appropriate to try and answer this
question and now is one of those times
they're sort of leading up to the
holiday season so there are some max I
think sure a perfect time to buy it
right now no danger of being updated and
there's something I think you should
wait on I'll give sort of some caveats
at the end on the ones I think that you
should wait on and maybe why you should
possibly pick them up so let's go ahead
and get started first one the macbooks
the plastic macbooks that we all know
and love just got updated just gotta
refresh the unibody design and now spec
for spec actually match the lower end
MacBook Pros with the exception of
obviously the plastic shell it's a great
time to get a macbook just got updated a
few weeks ago and you're getting really
good value for your money so if you're
looking to get a macbook hop right in
your getting a backlit LED display
you're getting a new multi-touch
trackpad you're getting a solid
construction unibody classic design
you're going to get a great computer
next thing that you should definitely
pick up if you're looking to get one or
ask for one for the holidays the new
imacs those clearly just got updated
into no-brainer now is a good time to
buy an imac you can get all the way up
to the core i7 you can go to a little
lower 27 inch or you can go to a 21 and
a half inch there's a lot of ranged a
lot of value to be found in the imac
line so you've been waiting for an i'm
at now is a fantastic time to jump on
board i think it's one of the best on
ones out there and the resolution now on
a 27 inch and for the price you're
getting a fantastic 27 inch monitor and
are getting really a impressive computer
to go along with it the next one that is
probably a great time to buy as well if
your address it is the mac mini the
cheapest way into the macworld those
were just updated you can get it with an
optical drive or without an optical
drive as a mac mini server either way
it's a great time to pick one up it's
gotten really nice fax actually
represents now very good value and
surprisingly good performance for an
entry-level map
the mac mini ever really had the best
performance but now that has been fixed
Mac Mini is a perfect computer for those
that are looking to get into the ematic
world so what I don't recommend you get
you both some of you guys might not want
to hear this the macbook pros those did
not receive an update a few weeks ago
and I think they're probably toward
towards the end of their life cycle
probably about out of three or four
months before we see an upgrade but most
peoples are like me you don't want to
get a new computer and a few months
later have them be updated and I know it
probably sucks a lot of you were
probably hoping on picking one up or
asking for one for the holidays but I
recommend you wait on the macbook pros I
think that there's definitely going to
be an update I think you're going to get
possibly mobile core i7 chips and some
up specs and possibly a decrease in
price sort of in need the apple shred
recently so if you're looking to get a
macbook pro whether it's the 13 15 or 17
I think that if you can you should wait
if you can't wait to thank you buy it
now you're getting a great computer at a
very reasonable price next the mac pro
don't know how many of you out there
looking to get a mac pro but definitely
wait on that that thing hasn't seen an
update in quite a while and it is
certainly do so now there's some caveats
to the things I said you shouldn't buy
so I said you shouldn't get the macbook
pro but there's sort of one exception if
we're in the US the day after
Thanksgiving holidays called Black
Friday I would wait to see what sort of
deals Apple offer rumor has it they may
be offering up to twenty-five percent on
some math lines and if I suddenly
they're offering twenty percent off or
even ten or fifteen percent off these
macbook pros suddenly you're getting a
$79 computer for market ibly less at
that point they gets a great time to
jump into the macbook pros you may you
know may get updated in a few months but
either you got a great deal on it now so
i would definitely wait until black
friday to see what apple announces
before you go and pick one up if the
deal is not good enough then I think
you're going to have to wait a few
months if its outstanding then you know
it's a good time to jump in on the on
the other mac front looking to get an
ipod ipod classic i think you're fine
the ipod touch you're not going to see a
camera for a little while
you're fine there ipod nano just got
updated ipod shuffle just got updated to
i think you're going to be fine in those
apartments if you wanted to pick one up
now or give it as a gift for the
holidays so guys hope you found this
useful and open answered some of the
questions that you've had i know it's
it's sort of tough to gauge what to buy
our products because they get updated so
frequently and really without much
warning and generally go here maybe a
week before those are to some rumblings
so you really don't know it's quite a
little bit of difficult proposition hope
this helps shed some light on your
buying patterns so leave a text or video
response are you going to be getting a
new math as holiday season if so which
one are you excited about it you know
thought I would just leave that out
there and the last Mac that I didn't
mention was the macbook air just sort of
in the middle of its product life cycle
but the macbook air in my opinion
doesn't fit in with the rest of the
macbook line from a design standpoint it
still has the grey bezel it still has
the button for the mouse book instead of
the all glass trackpad spec-wise though
it did just get updated you've now
getting a pretty fast 128 gig SSD on the
higher end model she's a very fair value
the macbook air I think from a speck
point it's probably fine to be bought
you just updated a little while ago from
design standpoint I would probably wait
until sort of matches the rest of the
line I've had an eye on the macbook air
for a while and i'm holding off
personally if you can consider it until
it gets a redesign even if doesn't have
to have a spec bump it's a pretty fast
powerful computer right now in a very
lightweight package anyway guys that was
it and hope this helped for exclusive
