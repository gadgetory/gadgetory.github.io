technobuffalo here there's a lot to like
about webos there's even more to like
about the palm pre plus and the palm
pixi plus both for Verizon Wireless so
you guys may have seen me review this
device a few months back it's called a
mifi or a mobile hotspot and essentially
what that does is it takes verizon's 3g
evdo signal sucks it in and kicks it out
as Wi-Fi that you can connect to really
as you would any other Wi-Fi network in
fact you and four friends can connect up
at the same time as will handle up to
five signals so it works again just like
any other router you get router
configuration options for setting your
password and network name and it works
just at verizon's 3g speeds well with
the palm pre plus there's no need for a
mifi device anymore for a five gigabyte
data plan on the mifi it costs you sixty
dollars with the palm pre plus and the
mobile hotspot app that comes on it or
is a free download from the App Catalog
it's gonna cost you forty dollars a
month so actually it's twenty dollars
cheaper on the palm pre or palm pixi
plus and the mobile hotspot options are
exclusive to just the plaza versions of
both those devices so I give you an
example and show you how this works turn
on a lock the device so there it is
mobile hotspot so it opens up and you
get to rate your standard router options
you can change the WPA or wpa2 password
change the pass phrase you can change
the name of the network I've just called
the palm pre plus cuz make sense go
ahead and turn it on and I'll show you
the speed and how it works though it's
turning on the hotspot and one of the
nice things about this as well is that
it will work when the pre is asleep so
if you connect it to a network and it
freezes sleep it's going to just
recognize things automatically so I am a
connected to a network so I'm going to
smooth down roads the computer and show
you what this looks like so here is my
macbook with a little bit of dirty
desktop go ahead and check out the
network here so there is palm pre plus
already been connected to it
put this right here so you can see and
let you know that you're connected to a
device will go ahead and close it it
will open up Firefox hello TechnoBuffalo
it's a pretty graphics intensive site
you can see an example of the speed now
I would recommend streaming video or any
sort of heavy content but this does work
for a regular internet viewing even some
light youtube watching and email sending
it's going to work quite well you will
have a fun goodbye cap but for 40 bucks
it's actually a relatively nice value
when you need internet on the go and
especially if you're a pre user so here
we are already loaded here's the youtube
video right on the homepage click it I'm
got to volume muted and you can see how
quickly it loads so it's loads pretty
fast 24 second clip but it's playing
right from the palm pre plus go ahead
just do your regular browsing just as
you would on any other Wi-Fi network
really it's kind of nice that they have
this I know a few other mobile platforms
have had something similar for a while
of Windows Mobile in particular but it's
nice to see the sort of move over to
other platforms especially webos and are
you guys from jon rettinger are we
putting the palm pre plus through a
series more tests and be putting it
head-to-head against some of the most
popular smartphones on the market today
so be sure to stay tuned to the channel
technobuffalo for all that information I
am jon rettinger and i will see you in
the next video bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
