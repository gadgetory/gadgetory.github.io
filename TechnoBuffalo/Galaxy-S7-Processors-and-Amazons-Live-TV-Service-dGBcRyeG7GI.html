to you by domain.com hey what's going on
guys a märklin Sangin from
TechnoBuffalo and on today's episode of
rumor roundup will be talking about
Apple's new iMac Samsung's Galaxy s7 and
Amazon's live TV service this is rumor
roundup let's go ahead and get started
according to a report from Bloomberg
amazon is looking to create its own live
TV service yes similar to sling TV and
PlayStation view which have been among
the first to truly cater to the cord
cutting fantasy amazon has apparently
met with CBS and NBC Universal to
discuss the service though talks are
preliminary at this point as of now
Amazon Prime offers a nice mix of TV
shows movies and original content as
part of an annual $100 membership but if
Amazon can somehow bundle in the cost
for its rumored service would prime it
would make what's already one of the
best deals in tech even better and as a
competitor to services such as Netflix
and HBO now amazon prime would suddenly
seem like the service to beat bloomberg
notes that Amazon could simply be
looking at the economics of such a
service with no plans to offer an actual
product it seems like Amazon is very
serious about pushing prime to new users
and what better way to interest folks in
with a new live TV service Apple could
release it's rumored 4k 21.5 inch imac
as soon as next week according to 925
max mark Gurman the new desktop computer
will hit stores on tuesday october 13th
in limited quantities the company
apparently plans to ramp up production
on the Refresh iMac starting in november
so it may be hard to track one down
until then Apple Mina actually changed
the design though it's allegedly bumping
the resolution to 4096 x 2304 pixels and
including a beefed-up graphics card the
4k model will also run OS 10 El Capitan
out of the box and cost a bit more than
the current version 9to5 mac notes that
Apple is also developing new versions of
its magic mouse would force touch
technology along with an upgraded
bluetooth keyboard would better battery
however it's still unclear if these
accessories will be ready to launch
alongside the new iMac it doesn't sound
like Apple's planning a formal events
announced the new 4k iMac but we'll keep
an eye out for any news or an official
announcement from apple let me stop this
video real fast and thank our friends

comms check out same thing is reportedly
prepping three different versions of the
upcoming Galaxy s7 each with different
processors according to Sam mobile the
South Korean company will offer a
slightly different version of the
flagship phones depending on where in
the world you purchase it specifically
the company plans to pack the galaxy s7
with a cutting-edge XE knows em one
processor in Korea Japan and Europe
meanwhile Indian choppers will get a
slightly less powerful XE no 7422
powered handset same thing will
apparently ship the galaxy s7 to the US
and China with a snapdragon 820 on board
this would be the first time the company
released a device with three different
processors though in the past Samsung
has offered two different versions of
its flagship phones depending on the
region Samsung still has at least a few
more months before the Galaxy s7
actually arise and plenty can change
between now and then the company
typically reveals its new S series phone
in late februari or early march though
recent rumor suggests that the release
could be pushed up by a month or two
