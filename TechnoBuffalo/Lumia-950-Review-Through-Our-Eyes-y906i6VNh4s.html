to you by domain.com hello it's me Ron
Purita here normally I'm behind the
camera shooting editing and cutting a
lot of the videos you guys see on the
channel but when Microsoft announced the
Lumia 950 I was really excited to check
it out because of continuum and a couple
other features so for about a week and a
half I completely sacrificed my dignity
threw it out the window strapped this
GoPro to my head and my chest walked
around looking like a fool so I could
bring you guys this review from a
first-person real usage perspective so
first things first build and design this
phone looks and feels fine I've
personally always been a fan of plastic
phones I know some people are not I
don't really have an issue with it feels
great in the hand looks great looks
simple pretty much like any other
smartphone nothing really to it my thing
with Windows 10 has always been that it
has a ton of potential black tiles I
think are great I think it is one of the
most gorgeous you eyes we have but I
don't think it's really been executed
very well for example live tiles not all
apps have live tiles and even apps that
do don't really optimize it in my
opinion Instagram would be amazing if
you could have a feed of playing in your
live tile if you actually had a live
feed that you could scroll through on
the tile and that brings one to the next
issue which is app support as we've
always known Windows Phone and now
Windows 10 have always had a big lack of
app support and that's a huge huge
turnoff here we don't have a full
version of Instagram and we don't have
any version of snapchat there's not even
an app for YouTube which is really
strange the app you download just forces
you to go through the browser which is
kind of man the camera on the Lumia 950
was awesome not much to say here images
looked great super sharp contrast ratios
were good but one of my favorite
features of the camera was actually the
shutter button it's a two-stage shutter
button and I know we've seen this on
tons of other phones but it's just
something small that we don't see on
every phone that I really really
appreciate having a two-stage shutter
button makes us feel more like a real
camera and really lend itself to making
you take more pictures on a regular
basis it was a real pleasure to use
sometimes the camera would be a little
slow to react but it's nothing you can't
overcome or deal with and so now moving
on to one of the big features I was
looking forward to on this phone
continuum as of late we've seen
Microsoft move towards a convergence of
products across their line from the
surface pro for the surface book and
was the Lumia 950 continuum for those
who don't know is a dock that connects
via HDMI or DisplayPort into an external
TV or monitor that essentially allows
you to use your phone on sort of
fullscreen closer to a desktop type
configuration that being said it is not
a full desktop OS it's more so a skin
for mobile Windows 10 it was pretty damn
good
it wasn't obviously as fast as a laptop
you can't really go in with those
expectations we're just not there yet
with the processing power you can browse
the web you can walk YouTube videos you
can check your email now there were some
problems for example I couldn't set up
an account through Outlook but I could
get through messaging and certain apps
weren't supported and again this tends
to go with a theme of this phone and a
lot of Microsoft products for that
matter great thesis I love the direction
they're going but unfortunately it just
wasn't executed very well that being
said I thought continuum was a great
feature for people who are Lite PC users
people who just checking email just
watch videos online don't expect that
much from their phone it's a very very
feasible thing for them one of my gripes
with Windows 10 of software was the
loading screens I literally felt like I
was playing my ps1 all over again I was
just loading screen after loading screen
hoping Spotify I had a loading screen I
was like what is the deal here 2,000
years later the phone isn't slow the
Snapdragon 808 is great but three gigs
of ram are great it functions perfectly
but the OS itself bogs down the
experience you spend so much time
looking at loading screen and those
three to four dots just circling and
moving it it gets kind of ridiculous one
of the other neat features with Windows
10 is supposed to be Windows hello it's
me the idea is that the front-facing
camera scans your retina to unlock the
phone rather than using something like a
fingerprint reader or a pin it works
really well and one of the cool things
is that actually if you continuously
scan in your retina in different
Lighting's and locations and different
perspectives it gets better and better I
found that to be true it definitely
improves it definitely works it's really
good I don't know how much better it is
than using a fingerprint reader but it
is a cool feature and maybe it's the
future maybe it's the future of not
having to touch your phone at all to
unlock it so even though Windows 10
doesn't have the greatest app support
right now it is Windows 10 different
from Windows Phone so now their desktop
and their mobile platform is built on
name architecture so the hope is that
building apps will be easier with a
couple added lines of code you can take
a desktop app turn it into a mobile app
so it is a possibility that we see
better app support moving to the future
but there's no guarantees and I wouldn't
really hold out for it but fingers
crossed there's not much to say about
battery life other than it was good one
charge would last me about one day phone
does charge via USB C and charges pretty
quickly as well so those are pretty much
my thoughts on the Lumia 950 I think
it's a great phone and I really respect
Microsoft for trying to do something new
and paved the way with merging devices
like laptops and tablets and that phone
with four pcs with continuum I think
it's a really cool effort but I don't
think they quite hit the nail on the
head with execution unfortunately for
most people I have to give this one and
don't buy your switching from Android or
iOS the app support just isn't there but
if you are using Windows Phone give this
a good look
