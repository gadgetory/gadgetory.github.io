coverage what's up everyone
John retina from TechnoBuffalo here and
we are live from the LG press event from
CES 2013 it just ended and they went
through a ton of new stuff they talked
about TVs front loading washers smart
refrigerators all kinds of other
appliances let's go and start with some
of the most exciting stuff they talked
about and that was their TV lineup 2013
is all about crazy high-definition and
new technology 4k and oh le d-- so
previously LG only had an 84-inch crazy
expensive 4k TV it's gonna be joined by
two little brothers a 65 and a 55 inch
sometime around the March timeframe
there o LED TV 55 inch we'll be shipping
in the u.s. in March that's finally
coming they announced a ton of touch
panels as well so for those of you guys
looking to get a new monitor for your
Windows 8 machine LG is going to have
you covered I will say the 4k TV and oil
ad TVs I talked a lot about we had a
chance to take a look at and say they
look absolutely stunning now 4k looks
great
sounds awesome is four times resolution
of 1080p but unfortunate is not that
much content for it right now
oil ad technologies the next evolution
of the LED technology the o stands for
organic you get darker darks brighter
colors more vivid pictures they do look
absolute gorgeous also enables a
manufacturer to make much thinner bezel
list displays talked a lot about their
Smart TVs Google TV integrations going
to be there as well and the new magic
remote or if you let you actually in
addition to just talk to it natural
voice you actually draw out the numbers
that you want when you want to change a
channel so it's pretty cool a lot of new
stuff coming to LG they didn't announce
any new phones they did say though they
will at Mobile World Congress so we can
take a look for the lg optimus G 2 and
maybe the vu 3 whatever else they might
have in store but of course we'll have
all that coverage coming Mobile World
Congress sometimes next next month
overall though very impressed with LG
announced their TVs are gorgeous from
the market for something new in 2013
recommend waiting so after March to see
what you can get your hands on from LG
and for the folks from my South Korea
life really is good thanks again to Ford</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
