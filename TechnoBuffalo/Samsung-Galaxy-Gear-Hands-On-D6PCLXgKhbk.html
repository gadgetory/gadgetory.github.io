checking out the galaxy gear here it is
this is this is the watch form everyone
has been talking about here it is we're
going to talk about it for a second tell
you guys what's going on it's a pretty
nice little watch it's a companion for
the note 3 and there are two noise
cancelling microphones on this you can
see there's one here right here and on
the other side there's one right up here
and then actually your speaker phones in
an interesting location it's actually
right here this is your speaker it's
pretty loud we heard it earlier which is
pretty nice and you also have a lovely
little home button right here so we're
going to tap on that and you can see
that we have this lovely matching watch
face swiping down will bring you right
into the camera so you can see here's
the camera if you want switch to video
you can tap right on that that will
switch a video to give you about 10
seconds of video I will switch back to
the camera and I'll take a quick picture
point point it down here some of the
watches and tapping the screen will take
a picture so it's really easy to use the
gestures work really well if you swipe
down you can go right to your dialer
going up or I should say swiping down to
go up will take you back a page if you
swipe left or right you can check out
your menu options you have notifications
your voice memo which will actually
transcribe your voice memo for up to
five minutes pretty cool s voice allow
you to search for anything on your note
3 pretty neat gallery the screen on this
is actually quite nice it's a super
amoled if you're wondering how to charge
your Galaxy gear this is very
interesting the way that they've sort of
set this up so we have our galaxy gear
you can see the pins right there and
it's actually a little guy right here so
you will put your watch inside close it
up lock it and boom you got your micro
USB right there and that's how you
charge the device takes about 60 to 90
minutes to charge so not too long and
they are saying that it should last you
the battery
the Galaxy gear should last you about a
day think you guys will be pretty
pleased with this if your note fans oh
and before I go I want to show you all
the different colors check these out so
you have this go serve oatmeal beige
rose gold the orange that we just saw
wild orange lime green chip black oh
this is actually the mocha this is a
mocha gray it's very very nice I'm sure
we'll go with everything um and of
course the jet black that's rolling
around on the table because it just
wants to go home with me that's how it
works really love this rose gol they
think a lot of ladies will be excited
about this one and anybody who has
impeccable taste but yeah that's these
are all the different models the boxes
are super cool they look like they are
from the Jetsons from the future so this
is a really great companion piece to the
note 3 and we're going to have a little
mini hands-on of the note 3 momentarily
so be sure to stay tuned for that but
this is the galaxy gear the samsung
