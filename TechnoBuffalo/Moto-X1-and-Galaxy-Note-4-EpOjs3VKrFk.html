to you by godaddy what's up everyone
welcome back there pisode of rumor
roundup just to show recit and this year
chair and I Pam through all the rumors
of the week and there were a lot of
them's we can I pick the three I thought
were most interesting not an apple rumor
among them we're talking about Sony's
Xperia z3 the motorola x plus this many
and i'm going to wrap things up with a
nice romantic discussion on Samsung's
Galaxy Note 4 this is the second time
I've had a film this video let's go
ahead try it one more time this rumor
roundup let's go and start rounding them
up let's begin with the folks at Sony
Xperia z2 I think was a huge success
might not have had the sales number Sony
was hoping but it was a great phone it
was well spect and really well received
but looks like it's gonna get a
successor it's all starting to come
together we've seen several reports
leaking the alleged hard respectfully
xperia z3 but most of them going to just
teeny tiny little bumps and hardware
snapdragon 801 processor expected to get
a slight speed increase for example and
ram and karen module and storage options
i'll look about the same on paper but
there's a big big round but here we're
trying to see what sony might be doing
our friend a bleak on thursday posted a
new picture of the alleged xperia z3 we
can see that it's thin beautiful it
looks like a supermodel all airbrush on
the cover of vogue so he's got the
design language pretty consistent across
Xperia lineups but this does show a
little bit more skin also shows a nice
rounded approach to the phone instead of
the rectangular look of other experience
sets we can't really tell much from the
picture but it does seem possible is
also more brushed metal involved instead
of just plastic but that is this guy
talking out loud the staple round silver
colored power button still being used
and we can see that Sony isn't ditching
its dedicated camera button anytime soon
I love camera buttons please put them on
more phones my best guess Toves xperia
z3 will be unveiled during the IFA trade
show in berlin in September which of
course we will be there they might not
be the only big phone getting unveiled
we'll talk about that in just a minute
what do you think about the z3 there's a
lot of great phones out there there's
your m8 there's your 1 pluses there's
your Jeep
Ruiz is your Galaxy s5 is the z3 really
gonna offer that much that makes you
want to wait for it wanna hear your
thoughts leave the comments and my
nethers so from Sony let's jump to
Motorola we love the Moto X here it was
fun of the year for a lot of our staff
Motorola clearly had its head on its
hands but like the phone world it's time
for an upgrade on that man majama and a
new set of photos published recently
show the device is moving quite nicely
even show some information that we had
heard about yet the photos you looking
at right now were published by our
friends at android police reportedly
show an almost final prototype of the
Moto X plus one so if you look closely
you'll notice Motorola fortunately is
keeping the freaking awesome
customization options intact complete
with wooden back panel presumably and
other color options we've also heard
reports model is going to get kind of
kinky and throws some leather into the
ring this time around android police
said the metal strip running around the
phone is indeed aluminum or aluminium so
just don't yell at me also note the
massive camera on the backside is
apparently a 12 megapixel shooter to
compliment a this many megapixel
front-facing camera and now show the
flash flanks both sides of the lens the
very poorly is going to have a 5.1 inch
screen and like last year run expecting
the absolute latest the most powerful
specs and hardware but two software
experience it just works really really
well that's probably good include a
snapdragon 800 processor 2 gigs of ram
and that's still a nice bump into the
Moto X I don't know much about a launch
window but we're poaching the one year
anniversary of the Moto X and really
just a few days in august so that seems
like the most likely month now Motorola
correct the super wrong you stop the
room is for a quick second thank our
friends and good peeps at GoDaddy want
to remind you you should put your
website to work while you go do other
things that are not work it's online so

whatever you're doing people can still
find you on the Internet start building
your site today with godaddy it starts
just a dollar ninety-nine cents per
domain at your promo code 199 techno
that's one word at checkout but check
out the website the sudden limitations
might apply now back to the reverse for
motorola let's jump to samsung they are
expected to unveil the galaxy note for
this September at the just mentioned IFA
trade show in berlin luck did it last
year before that year before that unlike
previous years though it looks like the
company might be trying to rush the
galaxy no Florence customers hands as
quick as humanly possible compared to
previous releases the rumor comes from
eTnews which despite what you think
isn't about the alien talking trying to
get Reese's Pieces Samsung is supposedly
responding to really disappointing sales
for the galaxy s5 earlier in the year
according to the best kind of sources
the unnamed ones that is poked into news
outlet the company is reaching out to
suppliers to speed up mass production
for the galaxy note 4 if all goes well
though the rumored phablet could launch
just days after its unveiled rather than
the usual two or three weeks of waiting
for the first units actually ship
landing the Galaxy Note 4 into stores as
quickly as possible could give Sammy a
pretty big engines competition
especially with a flick but unveil a
larger iPhone mid-september ish the
galaxy note 4 jari on sale before Apple
makes its announcement though Sampson
could see a big boost being early then
again though it's in the day it really
is going to matter is what each
smartphone has to offer LA Galaxy Note 4
is still shrouded in total mystery
recent leaks suggest it could offer
everything from a biometric I standard
ultrasound sensors the three-sided
display to also have a solution for
world peace the very least though it's
sure to pack pretty high in specs
including a big beastly battery super
fast processor probable 2k display I
want thing's for sure though Samsung
ain't gonna be holding back when it
avails this sucker in September and
again we're gonna be there to show you
what they have so what you guys think
