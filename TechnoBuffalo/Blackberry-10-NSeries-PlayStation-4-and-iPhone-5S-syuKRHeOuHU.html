to you by shutterstock.com what's going
on everybody welcome back to the episode
of rumor roundup I promise John Rangers
the show where we quite obviously round
up all the rumors from the week trash
compactor them down into one video of
rumor awesomeness up this week we're
going to talk phones and gaming we're
going to talk about rim's blackberry 10
is coming soon or talk about the iphone
5s it when it might be here we're gonna
go gaming and talk about the next Xbox
and Playstation and what the next ps4
might be priced at and when we might
actually see it this is rumor roundup
it's going to get started we're at the
dawn of blackberry 10 only a few weeks
away toward the end of January when rim
shows us everything that blackberry 10
can do and the leaks are coming fast and
furious as they tend to do a lot of them
come out of Vietnam so we had our first
glimpse it rims alleged first blackberry
10 device to support a full qwerty
keyboard back in December and I cannot
freaking wait a full keyboard
awesomeness the pictures are finally
leaked but the device which might launch
under the x10 moniker it's part of the
rumored n series of blackberry 10
devices rim is hanging on to the
beautiful keyboard design that we loved
from the awesome 9900 so I cannot
freaking wait it's almost here hopefully
they're gonna launch with the keyboard
we're hearing though that may be one
launch device might come with several
others coming a few months afterwards
I'm hopeful that we're gonna get both
some keyboard awesomeness also of course
the full touchscreen business that we've
seen elite like crazy so what part of
blackberry 10 you guys was excited about
the iphone 5s rumors are swirling that
productions are going to start in march
and the launch is going to be in june or
july the recently reported on a story
from The Wall Street Journal that
suggested Apple cut orders for the
iphone 5 was a huge story is all over
the news that caused the stock price
that close below 500 but why might not
be all bad I'm actually guessing that
demand is starting to cool following the
holiday buying rush obviously Apple
wears a lot of components to keep up
with the demand but maybe app was
already focused on lining up orders for
the next iPhone the iPhone 5s so don't
worry so much it makes perfect sense we
usually hear friends and family actually
I wait for the next one it's kind of
right around the corner this time though
it might actually be around the corner
we're just about six months without
which in the smartphone world is
SuperDuper quick next Xbox and
PlayStation could launch for 350 to 400
bucks which shows you guys that remember
the original PlayStation 3 launch which
marina now seems like a decade ago it
launched it a crazy high price point at
600 bucks and I took Sonia really long
time you get that price point down once
they got it down people started buying
them like hot cakes console does a ton
of stuff hopefully Sony learned from the
previous mistakes is going to get the
launch price just right and to compete
head-to-head with the xbox that wasn't I
know what you're saying analyst can make
up anything they want I can make up a
study it says the next xbox gonna sell
14 trillion dollars tickle handily
solved the u.s. debt but this was a bit
of a scientific study that went into it
although the results seem super obvious
all the word comes from Baird equity
research and a report done by gamer
industry biz aside from pricing analyst
also suggests the next Xbox will drop in
November of this year the PlayStation 4
release in October so super soon may
even be 43 so if you're thinking about
getting a new console you might want to
wait unless it's the Wii U they also
indicate that these consoles will
feature high end pc gaming components
the blend of physical and digital
distribution which no big surprise they
already do that now figure it'll be
higher end because they're newer and
digital distribution is something they
already have zoomed little step that up
a little bit i do believe those the last
generation of consoles ever gonna see
actually launch with physical media
you'll be able to put in a blu-ray or
DVD whatever they might use its consoles
gently of a 10 year lifespan so you know
10 years from now presumably people have
higher speed internet bill just download
all the games and content much quicker
it's always fun to cover these animals
predictions especially when it comes to
something is open-ended as a console
pricing is obviously no right answer to
this but guessing 350 to 400 range
sounds about right for next generation
systems from Sony and Microsoft again as
I mentioned PlayStation 3 here retail in
2006 with two SKUs of 499 model and a
599 dollar model even then gamers do 600
bucks for console was a bit ridiculous
hopefully Sony doesn't make the same
mistake this time around let's ditch the
Xbox forbidden talk about the ps4
karashi Sakamoto Sony's
Vice President may have gone to get
typical protocol for the major hard
manufacturers as he said at CES 2013
interview with email.com Sakamoto
suggested that he might be planning to
announce the PlayStation 4 before e3 the
quotes from Sakamoto were originally
published in Spanish so forgive the
loose language translations that comes
from google translate and I quote but
our friends are preparing PlayStation I
can only say that we are focused on the
e3 gaming event scheduled for June the
announced it might be that minute or
even earlier in May and that time we
expect to deliver great news but we must
wait until at least may at least so the
bolt emphasis is my own Sakamoto
indicates that Sony might do a pre three
announcement some companies have
recently taken to so that way they can
have the bulk of the conference to
enough everything else that their
consoles can do talk about games talk
about new features and not have to worry
about someone else planar Thunder a few
hours later with another press
conference I'm super excited for the
PlayStation 4 it does so much the
previous generation the ps3 it's great
as a streaming console it's one of the
world's best blu-ray players some really
curious to see what Sony does the next
generation I would love to see it coming
43 mostly because I just want to play
with it what do you guys think could
Sony really up and the Microsoft and get
their console out first I'll tear your
