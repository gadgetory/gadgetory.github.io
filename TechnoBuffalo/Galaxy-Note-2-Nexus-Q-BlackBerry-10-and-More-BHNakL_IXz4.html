you by jack threads welcome back to
another episode of ask the Buffalo I'm
your host John Rhett injure this is the
show where you could ask me any question
you've got from the world of technology
confused about what might be coming out
next don't know what tablet or phone to
get this is a place you can ask this
week on ask the Buffalo we're gonna talk
about the Galaxy Note 2 we're gonna talk
a little bit about blackberry 10 the
Nexus 7 and some tech in between let's
go ahead and get started so all the talk
the past couple of weeks in the tablet
world has been about the Nexus 7 kind of
going under the radar though was it
stable mate the Nexus Q Google's cloud
media streaming black bowling-ball
looking thing and that's something that
our next user wants to ask Nathan yelled
10 asks I placed an order for the Nexus
7 I thought about getting the Nexus Q
you think it's worth the money the short
answer is no it's absolutely not worth
$299 well it does do exactly as
advertised and does it kind of well that
price point you're better off getting a
Roku HD box and Apple TV or any other
myriad of devices there are so many
other opportunities out there for get
streaming on than spending 300 bucks for
the Nexus Q I love that it's made in the
US another way it looks I love the LED
lights the destro design is awesome but
for 300 bucks it's a really really hard
device to recommend we cover a lot of
phones on TechnoBuffalo and often times
I show you the phone that I'm carrying
with me previously it was an iPhone 4s
and now it is a Galaxy Nexus and the
next user wants to ask me a personal
question about my choice phones
so Ruby 44 asks hey Jon and all your
videos none of the devices have a screen
protector on them do you use them or
just not in the videos or do you not use
them at all so I like my phone the way I
sleep totally naked I didn't use a case
on the iPhone 4s the Galaxy Note the HTC
Titan or any phone that I've used prior
I prefer to go on natural I've been
pretty lucky haven't dropped anything
yet and shattered it I just like the way
a phone feels I think the engineers put
a lot of time at the industrial build of
these phones I liked the way they
actually feel in the hand the one
exception though on the iPhone 4 I
didn't use a bumper case because the
whole hold it like this thing and your
call drops
part I generally keep my phone totally
totally nude the way the engineers
intended I know I'm just waiting to drop
my phone and cursors I should have
bought a case but I have not yet done
that oh I'm probably gonna drop it right
now like who says David Halevy asks hey
John I want to buy a Samsung Galaxy
Notes I don't know if the notes to
rumors are really true should I wait for
the note to or die by tho note 1 now
first of all I'm realizing that saying
notes - over and over again is super
tongue twister but the note 2 i believe
is definitely coming and we're very
close to IFA 2012 or I think we're gonna
say its debut so absolutely wait it's
the end of August early September when
the IFA trade show is don't know what it
is it's sort of like CES for Europe it's
a huge gathering of the electronic world
takes place in Berlin each year I expect
we're gonna see a similar size but a
bigger screen certainly we're gonna see
a quad core Exynos processor and it may
actually be the first phone that's got
quad core support for LTE I think we'll
see Ice Cream Sandwich onboard with
hopefully planes for jellybean only a
few months away so I don't think
jellybean is gonna be ready in time to
get all touch whizzed up for the ball
we'll see a better camera I think we'll
see some wireless charging and we'll see
some elementary upgrades nothing giant
but certainly something that's worth
waiting I'd Ector a couple months see if
it comes out and if it does come out and
you don't like it you still want to get
the note 1 go to get it for discounted
price or whatever you decide I do think
the Galaxy Note is an awesome phone and
speaking of things that are awesome I
want to take a minute to thank our
friends and sponsors at Jackthreads only

threads.com slash techno you can get
instant access to all the killer
hook-ups go now so from things that are
awesome the things that maybe aren't so
awesome let's talk about blackberry and
their future that's what the next user
once asked about kaio-ken burton asks
you think blackberry 10 will save the
company even though it's one of the most
popular phone brands in the
UK part of me really wants to say yes
I'm rooting for rim as an underdog but
as a practical businessman I think rim
has about that big a chance into that
bigger world to actually make it work
delay after delay after delay is really
tight and rims hands
I think BlackBerry 10 is gonna be a very
solid operate system I think it's gonna
be well-received and I think it's going
to be welcomed by the press however much
like webOS which had sort of similar
reviews I may suffer the same fate it's
already been very saturated in the
mobile operating system world we've got
iOS we got Android Windows Phone and
Windows Phone 8 coming out is there room
for another modern operating system time
is only gonna tell this really is rims
last stand though this is our Alamo this
is their time to dig their feet in and
put everything they have with blackberry
today I think it's gonna work
probably not I've gone on record as
saying I don't think RIM as they exist
right now will exist in the same way 12
months from now perhaps will be acquired
it'll be running a different operating
system or perhaps they'll be scrapped
and sold for parts but I think that
their time has come and gone much as I
hate to say it I think that we're going
to see the end of remedy black break 10
will be the last major opera system
release we ever see from the folks at
research in motion hopefully you guys
enjoyed be sure to check back here every
Monday for a new episode I've asked the
Buffalo I'm your host John renter be

you guys in the next video

totally naked
