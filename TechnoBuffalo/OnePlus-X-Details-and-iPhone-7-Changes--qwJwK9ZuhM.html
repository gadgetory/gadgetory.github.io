to you by domain.com hey what's going on
guys a m√§rklin sang in from
TechnoBuffalo and on today's episode of
rumor roundup we'll be talking a bit
about the oneplus X Samsung's Galaxy s7
and apple's iphone 7 this is rumor on
let's go ahead and get started oneplus
hasn't been shy about its plans to
launch a cheaper handset later this year
now a new rumor claims the device will
arrive as soon as next month at an
extremely affordable price gizmo China
reports that the oneplus X is set to
launch this October site incredible
factory sources the device will
apparently feature less than
cutting-edge specs including a
Snapdragon 801 processor and a 5-inch
display as a result the price could be
as low as $249 even so the oneplus X may
still be a pretty impressive device the
Chinese upstart previously said its
focusing on design with this phone which
hopefully means a sleek new look based
on a recent leak render the upcoming
handset will also sport a fingerprint
reader in the back along with a dual
camera set up earlier this week a 1 +
executive confirmed plans for an
affordable handset launching this fall
however he also noted that the company
was hoping to launch in early November
so it seems unlikely we'll see the
device in veiled a month earlier in
October though it's possible one plus
could start teasing the new smartphone
within the next few weeks last month a
report out of Korea claimed Samson could
pack the Galaxy s7 with a pair of
cameras in the back now renew rumor
claims that this feature won't make the
cut though the company is apparently
still hard at work on a dual lens set up
according to eTnews samsung plans to
finish up its camera design before the
end of this year however it won't
actually release a smartphone with a new
feature until after the Galaxy s7 is
already in stores the report notes that
Samsung won't slap a dual lens camera
onto any of its smartphone until it
thinks the market is ready that time
could arrive pretty soon dual camera
setups are becoming increasingly popular
in new high-end phones HTC Huawei and
most recently LG have all tried
including the feature would varying
success Apple even acquired Ling's
computational startup working on its own
dual camera design earlier this year the
main advantage of these cameras is
typically the option to refocus and edit
your pictures after you take them LG's
new v10 also lets you take two different
elfies at once or swap between wide
angle and standard lenses thanks to a
pair of front facing shooters for now
we'll need to wait for samsung to join
the fray Apple knows how to make great
smartphones but there are a few areas
where the iPhone lags far behind its
competition wireless charging is still
missing in action as is water resistant
design even if the latest phones still
work after submersion in one test the
Apple may have a fixed or at least one
of those issues coming next year the new
feature is apparently still in early
testing though Cupertino may already
have a few working prototypes the same
tipster also says the iphone 7 won't
feature a metal design instead the
company will reportedly adopt an
entirely new material it's unclear if
this is a result of making the phone
water resistant or an unrelated change
either way it could mean the end of the
apples classic metal style the iphone 6s
and iPhone 6s plus just hit stores last
week so we're not expecting a new
handset from Apple and tool around this
time next year of course that hasn't
stopped fans from speculating over what
else the device could offer including
wireless charging a USBC port and a
sharper display Apple has plenty of time
to decide what new features it wants to
introduce with iphone 7 and it sounds
like the company is already testing out
