brought to you by jackthreads welcome
back to another episode of ask the
Buffalo I'm your host Jon wrenches to
show where you could ask me any question
you've got from the wide world of
technology and sometimes a little bit
outside of it that's what this week is
all about on last week's episode I vasta
buffo give you guys an office tour we
showed you around the TechnoBuffalo
offices where we spend almost all of our
days you met the staff that works out of
this office one of the things that I
showed in that video was a document up
on my office wall that was a court
document i mentioned the lawsuit that we
were involved in i said if you want to
know more information about it leave
comments down below and a lot of you did
leave a comments down below so in this
episode of ask the Buffalo I'm going to
explain to you what the lawsuit was all
about what we fought for the better part
of a year and what ended up happening
this is asked a buffalo let's go get
started
so about two years ago the Droid Bionic
was getting ready to come out I was
announced actually at CES we have
chanced even play with it and then
Motorola said you know what we're gonna
wait on the droid bionic and there was a
few months where we didn't know what was
gonna happen with it flash forward to
about the sep tember August time frame
and motor oil was getting ready to
announce a new updated droid bionic was
a totally different phone just had the
same name we got anonymous email via our
tips at TechnoBuffalo com saying hey
I've got some shots of a cloud of
material that's going to be included
with the droid bionic and it listed all
of the specs so they were sent over we
verify that they were indeed legitimate
I wrote and edited a post one of our
authors edited as well we gave the final
approval it went to editor in chief and
then it got published turns out we were
absolutely dead on with what did droid
bionic was going to be well the pretty
house wasn't very happy that and I'll
leave their name out of it you could
search for this court case though it's
everything's a matter of public record
now that it's over they were pretty much
upset about what had happened so one of
our other editors got an email a few
days later saying hey do you have a
reveal your sources and our response was
only with the court order I think
journalism is only as stable as a
foundation it's on and if sources don't
feel like they can come forward
anonymously and have that anonymity that
goes with it I think journalism as a
whole is going to fail not just in the
tech world a few days later pretty house
tried to send us a court order they
actually tried to find me at my home but
had a hard time finding that a
technobuffalo has a registered agent
that we use for all legal documents it
was sent to our registered agent
registered agent got it to me they
essentially filed suit against us
against Google because our email is
hosted with Google and they thought that
Google would share the information they
also filed suit against AT&amp;amp;T because the
pictures you could see a reflection a
little bit of a person or a phone then I
thought the pictures were taken with the
device that resembled the iphone and of
course a verizon iphone is already out
at this time and pretty much every other
device has that same shape and they
wanted the information they want to know
the sources name I countdown
our attorneys everybody knows attorneys
you pay them by the hour and they are
not cheap by the hour but I contact the
attorney and we were very quickly
informed that we had were protected by
federal shield laws this particular
printing house was in Illinois so we're
also protected by state she of laws in
the state of Illinois actually as some
of the strongest shield laws and also by
First Amendment rights the freedom of
speech and the protection of the press
it seemed pretty open and shut so we
don't obviously talk about politics
what's going on in the world but we do
talk about technology and that is
considered news as far as I was
concerned we're always on CNBC we're on
Fox News Wall Street Journal has a text
section where they covered exactly the
same stuff that we do USA Today has the
same thing in every major newspaper
covers technology so I figured you know
what we're good open-and-shut case
google essentially said a very nice
letter back which the gist of it was
we're google eep I don't want to piss us
off Google was dropped from it 18 t said
closely the same thing AT&amp;amp;T was dropped
from it so we filed a motion back saying
not a chance we are not going to tell
you our source you can take that
information and I'll see you in court
many many many lawyer hours and many
documents are put together essentially
the case that we said was we are
journalists we have journalistic
procedures we have steps we go through
before you publish we not just don't
just publish information without
checking and verifying sources and we
you send it to the judge and it seemed
pretty open-and-shut to us the judge
disagreed this particular judge is
located in Illinois and the judge said
no you have to reveal a source to which
I said nope not gonna be a source on a
personal note I was very prepared to
take this as far as I needed to not
reveal the source I would have probably
gone to prison for a short period of
time it's not reveal a source that's how
strongly I felt about this if we had
lost this case it would have been a huge
huge dent for nocturnal of them as a
whole but specifically the consumer
electronics journalism could you imagine
if sites didn't feel safe publishing
anonymous sources we would never know
what was coming whether you agree or
disagree with all that information
getting out there it's very important
that sites have the ability to do that
and do that free of persecution so for
our industry and my own livelihood I
could not let us lose this case the
judge disagreed without we're gas go to
appeal
and before you can go to appealed you
have to file something called a motion
for reconsideration we're essentially
asked the judge dude come on we filed
that motion we put in new information in
that time Huffington Post had won a
Pulitzer Prize we put in all kinds of
other information about blogs being
considered journalists and it's really
the first one of the first cases that
was had a ruling I have friends that run
other sites and they were getting emails
and cease and desist letters from other
companies that were stating
TechnoBuffalo versus you know this
company asked precedent so really was we
were treading very dangerous water story
was picked up in all the should main
Chicago papers at Tribune for example a
lot of national publications perhaps a
judge shot maybe didn't and on his
motion for reconsideration he actually
reconsidered I said okay technobuffalo
does qualify as journalists they did
follow journalistic steps if got
journalistic procedures in place and
they are totally protected you not have
to reveal their source this was a better
part of a year that it took to get to
this point I sort of condensed
everything and for a year we thought we
had a few options at that point I could
either counter sue the printing house to
recoup legal fees which would have been
a long long battle would have taken more
legal fees and who knows what would have
happened or it could just let it go
there so the printing out said okay we
fought this long enough it's been a year
we spent a lot of money we burned
through a good portion of our capital
trying to fend this that's how strongly
I felt about it eventually the printing
out said we're not going to file an
appeal we're not going to come after you
again have to defend this if you don't
come after us for legal fees seems
amicable enough and the case was settled
and over with it was a really long
hard-fought year I didn't share what was
going on sort of as it was happening
because in all honesty was too
overwhelming for me there were many many
sleepless nights I was worried that cops
were gonna show up my house to serve me
with more papers my wife was very
concerned it really affected in my life
and could have potentially affected my
livelihood in lobby hood of everybody at
TechnoBuffalo it was just it was very
nerve-racking gear for me it was very
tenuous and I'm really happy that we've
won so let me take a minute from talking
about legal stuff to thank our friends

my favorite things go ahead and check it
out at Jackthreads journalism is
changing it's moving away from printed
pressed online and if there aren't clear
definitions about what qualifies as
press or what doesn't I think gentlemen
as a whole is going to be doomed and
perhaps that's to macro and we're just a
very very tiny tiny little pea in a very
large journalism pod by oscilla felt
strongly enough i had a defendant if you
don't have principles if you don't feel
strongly about something in this world
and you're gonna stand for nothing and I
felt something that I had to defense so
that was a course of action that we took
that was a story behind that piece of
paper up on my wall if you want to
search for the case you're welcome to
