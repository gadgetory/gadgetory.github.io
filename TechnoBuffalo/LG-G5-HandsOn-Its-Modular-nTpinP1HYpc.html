technobuffalo and every year around this
time we hear about Mobile World Congress
and it happened in Barcelona Spain we go
every single year but this year instead
of just bringing you guys regular show
floor coverage and video footage of
phones and new tech I wanted to cover a
little bit more show our experience
behind the scenes as press and what it's
like to go to pre briefs press
conferences before the show floor
actually then the show floor itself and
a lot of the ins in the house that you
guys normally don't get to experience so
our first day we ended up going to the
LG pre-brief before the show this was on
Saturday and this was where LG announced
their brand new g5 a awesome awesome
looking phone Joe super hyped about but
to be honest I found myself more
interested in the doughnuts and pastries
the LG g5 has a 5.3 inch display a 28
hundred million Bauer battery 32 gigs of
memory four gigs of ram and a microSD
card expandable slot now that's all
traditional specs that's all normal
smartphone stuff but what is cool here
is that the phone is very google project
are inspired meaning it's modular the
base of the phone actually swaps out for
a camera and audio module that's the
chin and LG's already announced they're
going to be coming out with more
accessories in the future but the idea
is that you click a little button the
battery actually slides out so yes the
removable battery so you guys can go
back to stacking three or four batters
in your backpack is back up and you
slide in the camera module which has
dedicated shutter speed roller shutter
button which you can have to like to
autofocus all that awesome stuff now
with the camera module for example the
phone does get a little bit thick and a
little bit clunky but it gives you an
amazing ergonomic feel it literally
feels like you're using a normal camera
and I cannot tell you how refreshing and
amazing that is for such a long time
we've seen phone manufacturers improve
the megapixel count the optical quality
of their cameras it's very refreshing to
see LG improve that but also improve the
experience of taking pictures by adding
this camera module so on the back we're
looking at a 16 and eight megapixel
camera on the front we're looking at an
eight
pixel camera and yes I just named up for
two resolutions for the back because
there are two cameras one is a main the
second as a secondary obviously which is
actually a wider lens this allows the LG
g5 to get ultra wide-angle shots on the
rear they said during the conference
that most OEM s are chasing resolution
autofocus speeds and all that stuff but
they felt comfortable that all cameras
on phones at this point were good enough
so instead of chasing that they wanted
to go with a wider field of view the
example they gave was at the human field
of view is 122 124 degrees most
smartphone camera shoots 70 to 75
degrees the LG g5 suits 135 degree wide
angle these are all numbers in practice
it looks very cool it's hard for me to
say that this is all original because
Samsung did it with their front facing
camera a while back but credit where
credit's due because it looks really
good the rest of the phone seems really
good holding into the hand it feels
rounded but solid very well designed the
fingerprint reader on the back is now
also the power button which i think is a
very clever design on LG's part other
accessories like the audio modular being
called friends by LG according to LG
third parties will also be able to make
these accessories moving into the future
it's going to be really interesting to
see how the g5 does with customers but
at the moment I'm personally really
excited about it it's very refreshing to
see a phone manufacturer really try to
innovate again and bring project ara
type elements to the market let me know
what you guys think in the comments
below are you pumped about the g5 or you
not give us a thumbs up if you like the
style of video we would love to hear
from you in the comments below and
subscribe for more Mobile World Congress
coverage and more awesome videos because
that's all we make we make awesome stuff
thanks for watching
