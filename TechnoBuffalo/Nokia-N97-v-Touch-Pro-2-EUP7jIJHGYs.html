the millions watching all over the world
are you ready let's get ready to rumble
hey this is LP from TechnoBuffalo
today we have something a little
different 12 rounds of heavy weights
smartphone action welcome to our
smartphone Smackdown in the white corner
weighing in at 150 grams Nokia's new n
series device the n97
in the black corner HCC's very own
flagship device weighing in at 178 point
5 grams that is the touch pro2 ok let's
stop kidding around
I gotta mention I'm a fan of both HTC
and Nokia I've had at least a dozen
Nokia phones in the past and I'm going
on my 3rd HTC device right now so I have
absolutely no reason to play favorites
round 1 fight design is pretty much
always a factor when buying cell phones
because you definitely want to have a
flashy device to show off to your
business buddies and friends the n97 has
a very distinct Nokia quality about it
it's pretty much in line with the
previous nco devices the only gripe
about the device is that it resembles
the 5800 xpressmusic quite a lot you can
get the xpressmusic device for under 300
bucks while this device cost more than
double the Touch pro2 is also a very
good-looking device it's sleek and
streamlined but the times people have
confuses for an iPhone I've already lost
count but these are small complaints
because both devices are very
good-looking and when it comes down to
looks and design it's pretty much always
a matter of taste anyways some people
like coffee and some people prefer cocoa
that's the way it goes so this round is
a tie decide for yourself round 2 fight
when talking about device that are in
constant use build quality is definitely
important I mean it can get annoying to
wake up after a night on the town and
finding your cell phone in your pocket
and pieces it's happened to me a couple
of times
I wonder if tequila had anything to do
with it anyways both devices are made
out of titanium well not really but it
would be kind of cool to have a phone
that can handle an entry into the
Earth's atmosphere but these devices are
made out of plastic despite this they
both feel solid in the hand both have a
good slide-out mechanism but the tilting
screen on the touch pro2
has a slight jiggle to it while the
mechanism on the n97 is very solid
so the slight edge goes to nokia in this
round round three fight this round may
be a very important deciding factor for
most because this part relates to the
unique selling proposals of both devices
the QWERTY keyboards looking at the
keyboards it's quite obvious how this
Run will turn out the tilting screen on
the n97 is taking a hell a lot of space
away from the keyboard itself leaving
space for only the three rows of keys
even though I like typing with n97
the touch pro2 keyboard is definitely in
a league of its own the keys are bigger
more elevated and spaced out comfortably
and the rows are misaligned like on
regular keyboard and the touch pro2 also
sports a dedicated row of keys for the
numbers and I would say the typing is
about 30% faster on the touch pro2
the n97 gets owned pretty badly in this
round round for fight when comparing the
screen spec wise both have their
advantages the n97 has broader color
range but the screen on the touch pro2
has bigger resolution being the kenai
resolution whore that I am the advantage
in sharpness is somewhat noticeable on
the touch pro2 small text and details
look slightly sharper on the touch pro2
the touch pro2 seems also to have a
slight edge in brightness and contrast
looking at the devices side-by-side the
advantage in colours is not apparent as
you might think and I really can't see
the massive difference in color count on
the n97 better contrast in higher pixel
density gives the touch pro2
the points in this round round 5 fight
both devices have resistive touch
screens which react to physical pressure
while HTC has plenty of touchscreen
devices under its belt this is only the
second touch screen device for Nokia
while I think the firmware update
improved touch screen sensitivity on the
n97 it still can't compete with the
touch pro2 pressing buttons and icons
just needs a bit more pressure and I
would say that the sensitivity on the
n97 is somewhat similar to the last
generation of HTC devices the touch pro2
is a clear winner in this round round 6
fight if you watch my n97 review you
might remember that I wasn't too
impressed with the Symbian s60 5th
edition interface they could have
customized the interface for the N
series device because as it is now it's
not quite enough to justify the high
price tag the touch pro2 runs on windows
mobile 6.1 which can be a bit clunky at
times
luckily HTC has added their custom user
interface on top of the operating system
touchflo 3d 2 is very functional and
easy to use and you don't have to be
MacGyver to operate the main functions
although it would be kind of cool to be
MacGyver though anyways when comparing
the two you is the test for 22 stands
out it's look sleeker and run smoother
although the symbian has its pros as
well if you've used a Nokia device
before you'll probably find yourself at
home using the s60 5th edition interface
also a very good feature on the n97 is
the widget based home screen which can
be customized to suit your everyday
needs the nokia or Restore is a definite
advantage to the n97 user experience
it's definitely a good idea to have a
dedicated store for downloading new
features and products onto your device
there's not a massive amount of stuff in
the OE store yet but I did find this
cool ringtone which they use to the
newest Star Trek movie while Windows
Mobile devices may not have a dedicated
store yet the community support for
example at XDA forums is amazing
weighing in the two interfaces pros and
cons I have to reward this round to the
touch pro2 round 7 fight in this round
I'll be comparing the oppor mobile 9.5
on the HTC device against the Symbian
web browser on the n97 the two browsers
are very similar in use you can use your
finger to flick around on the page and
double tap to zoom in
although the touch pro2 also has a
dedicated zoom bar for zooming in and
out of pages the Symbian browser does
support some flash out of the box while
the browser on the touch pro2 does not
loading times on the browser's are about
the same the Opera browser loads some
pages faster than the Symbian and
vice-versa a very cool feature on the
touch pro2 is the push internet this
feature lets you set your favorite
internet pages to load at a
predetermined time so you won't have to
wait for your favorite sites to load the
Symbian browser has its pros as well
navigation between open tabs and
previous sites is done smartly render
quality is decent on both browsers I
noticed that when loading bigger sites
on the Symbian browser the kinetic
scrolling can get a bit choppy but the
Opera Mobile browser is not without
fault either
I had the browser actually crashing one
time while making this comparison both
brothers are decent but far from perfect
I call this one a draw round 8 I mean
round 8 fight the touch pro2 sports a
3.2 megapixel camera and no flash
now the n97 sports a 5 megapixel camera
with a dual LED flash the
on the n97 is one of the best I've seen
on a mobile device it has all the
functions you normally expect to see on
a dedicated pocket camera the n97 has
dedicated buttons for operating camera
which is always a good thing the camera
on the touch pro2 is okay but can't
compete against that camera on that 97
round 9 fight media playback is always
featured in marketing slogans for these
type of devices a rock concert in your
pocket or a movie theater in the palm of
your hand I watch a lot of movies off
the big screen and it's not exactly the
same as watching it from a 3.5 inch
screen surely enough both devices have
nice and big screens which are
well-suited for watching your favorite
content while commuting on a trainer
plane for example when it comes down to
media playback you definitely want a
device that can handle any format you
pull off the net neither of these
devices support DivX out of the box
but this isn't too big of a deal because
I would recommend getting a third party
player anyway
for example core player that handles
pretty much every format you throw at it
I said pretty much
unfortunately the Symbian s60 5th
edition does not support core player in
fact I could not find a working play for
the Symbian that can handle DivX a next
vid but the n97 handles the formats it
supports with ease and excels over the
touch pro2 with 3gb formats but since i
have 0 movies in 3gpp I have absolutely
no use for 3gb playback I mean I'm not
going to sit around for hours converting
files another issue I have with a 3gp
format is picture quality which can get
a big block even the n97 handles some
formats leaves the lack of codec and
third-party player support is the reason
this round goes to test boat 2 round 10
fight both devices have good music
playing capabilities the speakers on the
touch board too are better than their 97
speakers which also made speaker phone
calls better on the touch pro2
but the n97 has a feature that the touch
pro2 is dearly missing with 3.5
millimeter headphone jack
without the jack you won't be hooking
your device up to external speakers to
show off your boy George collection and
in my books that's a big enough reason
to give this round to the n97
round 11 fight ignore the battery life
promise on the spec sheets it ain't
gonna happen both devices have 1500
milli amp batteries and battery life is
about the same if you're a heavy user
you will be depleting your battery in
two days so keep your charger handy
round 12 fight when it comes down to it
price may become a deciding factor but
rest assured no matter what both devices
will be making a hole in your wallet the
size of a decent shotgun blast the 32
gigabyte internal storage and superior
camera justify the higher price tag on
the n97 so I would call this one a draw
so that's about it
the touch pro2 took down by in 97 with
the final score of 94 points I'm
probably gonna get some flak from Nokia
fans but that's okay I still consider
both devices to be good business smart
phones and I expect Nokia to be upping
the ante next time around the touch pro2
is now the defending champion and I'm
gonna need your help to choose the next
Challenger post your suggestions on the
comments thanks for watching LP signing
out finish it
