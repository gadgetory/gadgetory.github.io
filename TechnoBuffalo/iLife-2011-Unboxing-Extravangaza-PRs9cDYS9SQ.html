TechnoBuffalo here with an unboxing of
the new ilife suite that was just
announced today October 20th let's go
ahead and see what your hard-earned 4999
is gonna get you so I realize this is
just a software unboxing but we'll see
what's gonna come in here if anything
else is included oftentimes Apple throws
in a free trial of iwork or other
miscellaneous applications let's go
ahead and see what we got we'll bring an
old friend mr. stabby the big ol knife
to go ahead and do this unboxing here is
the new artwork for ilife 2011 it's got
my life on it price 499 give you a
little bit about it I photo 11 iMovie 11
garage man 11 it does photos it does
movies it plays music and edits your
music that is the gist of it alright so
let's bring in senior stabo and cut
through a plastic until I paid attention
during my Spanish class go ahead and rip
off the plastic we've got a sleeve
you'll go ahead and pull it out of the
sleeve I'm gonna give you guys the the
play-by-play here i'll use my announcer
voice pulling it out of the sleeve
alright designed by Apple in California
probably assembled somewhere overseas I
life install DVD and it looks like
that's going to be about it however we
have a book and we have apple stickers
so we'll make this a very short unboxing
this is more probably an introduction to
an overview i'll be doing of the ilab
2011 applications show you guys what's
new what's not new what's fun what's not
fun most importantly I'm excited to take
a look at the new imovie application
certainly the addition of the new audio
editing i think is going to be a huge
new feature so short of boxing I will
keep this brief like my underwear and
I'll see in the next video bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
