TechnoBuffalo here I've been wearing the
Moto 360s my only watch for the better
part of two weeks and I got a lot of
stuff to say about if you're interested
in picking up the latest and Android
wear have a watch so as I do with all my
reviews let me give my disclaimer I use
this as my only watch with a oneplus one
for two weeks and as you'll see in the
review the time we spent with the watch
was actually really really important if
you want to see a ton more should check
out our written review down below that
our own tot Hazleton robes got a few
different takes on some of the things
here so we just get the facts out of the
way 249 bucks it's got a 1.5 6-inch 320
by 229 display it's got a no map to chip
512 megabytes of RAM and a battery
that's ambiguously between 300 and 320
million dollars great that's done so
watch those specs don't really mean that
much so we reviewed the other Android
wear device is currently out Samsung's
gear live the LG G watch and came away
super unimpressed in fact they got some
of our lowest reviews in a really really
long time want to check those out though
links will be down below as well as
mostly just because Android wear it just
isn't there yet so enter this guy the
Moto 360 a really nice looking iteration
of Android wear but is the beauty just
skin deep the watch is undoubtedly
gorgeous it looks like an ordinary watch
which for me is huge I can count on one
normal fingered hand number of times
people ask me what was on my wrist
versus the dozens of times people ask
and I was wearing a typical square
designed alternatives watch by all
accounts is a piece of jewelry so much
more than a phone it's really got to
look good and here motorola really
really succeeds the round screen is
badass there's just no other way to say
it i know it's not a full 100 300 C
degrees because it censored at the
bottom but that Lee didn't bother me at
all on a side note though I forgot to
take it off before I gave my
one-year-old a bath and it got
absolutely drenched fortunately it's
ip67 but the whore weaned leather band
though definitely on some water spots on
it for a day or so they're gone now so I
really love how the single button looks
like a crown on a normal watch its
inconspicuous and just look slick with
really every other Android wear watch
out there you can't customize least not
yet
watch faces but motors got a companion
app called connect let's see tweak the
design it's a small touch but I really
appreciate it also lets you set a
personal health tracker that uses your
heart rate monitor other sensors a
feature that I really use but I really
like to be able to change the color the
second hand and other small tweaks in
there so hats off you motorola so i know
a lots been made about battery life is
it really a three hundred twenty
milliamp hour is it really three hundred
million powers a teardown revealed
honestly I don't know as a consumer I
really don't care this is where it
mattered though how long I use the
device my first week with it battery
life was really bad with the ambience
display off notifications coming in in
Google search using a handful of times
ah to get home would have about ten
percent or less of battery life the
second week though under the exact same
use cases it got we way better
I now have close to twenty five percent
left and that's taking it off the
charger at 7 a.m. and putting it back on
around 11 p.m. the first week with the
ambient sensor on it barely got me
through a full day but the second
ambient sensor on I can definitely get
through a full day now have you seen
other reviewers complain about battery
life be sure to ask them how long they
tested it because that time really
mattered I'm not ready to be conditions
or devices sort of had to learn how to
optimize itself but it definitely got
better just making a battery and
something I don't really talk about
charging this thing is absolutely
awesome the charging screen looks
ridiculously cool as its Qi enabled so
you can just drop it on the stand that
moto gave you or use any cheat charger
using the one that's included though
that only looks good it charged the
device crazy-fast like three or four
percent per minute it's awesome and
probably only do the smaller battery
dropping this thing on the charger for
10 minutes we'll get you another few
hours of use easily a big knock on other
Android wear devices have been how it
looks in direct sunlight
I will say it's not great in direct
sunlight but you can still read it in
direct sunlight which guess all you
really need software side though Android
wear is still Android wear if you tried
it and another device it's exactly the
same here just on a round screen it
works
I like having Google search that's
really handy everything else though is
kind of questionable utility Google said
there'd be a ton of updates coming we
spent a lot of time talking about
Android wear software is not overly
awesome but it does come in a pretty
nice-looking package so what's the final
verdict here on the Moto 360 it gets a
seven which is a
a better score than other Android wear
devices if you take one thing away from
this video and take this it is the
best-looking wearable out now but I
could change one to G watch our hits I
love using this I'm going to continue to
use this watch I like how it looks even
if I don't use any of the Android wear
features I love to watch faces looks
like a modern watch the horror wean
leather bands look great it's available
in silver black Patek moto really
knocked this one out of the park
if Android wear improves software gets
better gets bit more utility this could
easily jump from the seven two and eight
or nine so you guys watching hope you
