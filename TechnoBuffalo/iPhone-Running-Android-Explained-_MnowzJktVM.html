injure from TechnoBuffalo here and I've
got the privilege of being joined by
Nikoli and you might not know his face
yet but I'm willing to bet you know the
breadth of his work
most recently got a ton of attention
because of this guy which enables him to
run Android on his iPhone Nick thanks
for spending the time with us thanks for
having me so tell us a little bit about
this project and what it is a little bit
more about yourself and kind of what got
you to here sure um well I've been I've
been playing around with the iOS
platform in its various states pretty
much since before there was even an
official SDK and I you know I've always
kind of been a hacker in that regard
I've always been interested in getting
into the inner workings of things and
kind of the inspiration for this was was
just the the great animosity that exists
between the two the two mobile operating
system camps and I knew that kind of
mashing them together in a particularly
unattractive package would definitely
turn some heads and raise some eyebrows
so you mentioned hacking you got some
notoriety very early on your first app
that went to the App Store people might
still have it on their phone I built an
app called handy light for the iPhone
which was a flashlight app that had a
hidden hidden tethering feature so it
had some very strange sequence to get
that going you had to punch in the
colors in a certain order
like Simon right something like that
yeah if you if you picked them the right
order the screen returned purple and it
would turn on the built-in tethering and
and yeah kind of I emailed all the tech
blogs about it and it kind of blew up
overnight Apple pulled it and 5:00 a.m.
calls came in from Apple Eagle and it
was scary that's fun and you're also the
genius behind putting Windows 95 on an
Apple watch I wouldn't say genius I
would I would say insane person um but
but yeah that was uh that was a lot of
fun too basically my what I was going
for there was I was trying to figure out
if there were ways around Apple
limitations Apple puts on what you can
do with a watch
and that enabled me to actually
basically use the use the Apple watch as
an emulator because once I had you know
be able to use the screen for touch
input and be able to draw graphics on
the screen yeah everyone so tell us a
little bit about this so if people
haven't seen it this is running Android
on an iPhone mm-hmm yeah I mean a lot of
YouTube commenters may their opinions
may differ but um for all intents and
purposes yeah you can use the Android
operating system on your iPhone and you
can switch between the two operating
systems as if you were switching between
apps on your phone so how did you do it
what's in here is it emulation now you
remote accessing the closest the most
analogous thing to it is remote access
and I can crack it open here and I can
kind of give you a tour so 3d printed
Rome Kaiser feels the 3d printed it
never did 3d printing before took took
an uber to be an H about the cheapest 3d
printer I could find printed a lot of
really bad kind of screwed up cases
before I got to this one
and did you took inspiration from the
iPhone 6 battery case a little bit I was
really thinking my initial plan was to
gut a Mophie because they were you know
roughly the right thickness but yeah I
think it would have been really hard to
fit all the stuff in there so I ended up
just bringing my own so what's what's
inside ok so we basically have there's
not a lot of components in here most
obvious one is probably this battery
here it uses a lot of power because this
board isn't actually designed to run off
a battery so it doesn't have the same
kind of power management features that a
modern Android phone would have but
basically we have three of three boards
in here we have a battery charger which
is connected via the switch to a voltage
booster this battery is running at 3.7
volts and this board requires at least
eight volts to operate so when we flip
the switch the voltage booster gets
connected to the battery and it bumps
the voltage up from 3.7 volts 8 volts
which goes into this Android system on
module and the interesting thing about
this one it's called the Heike by a
company called LeMay Kerr the
interesting thing about this one is to
the best of my knowledge it's the only
development board that is officially
supported by Google's Android open
source project and what that means is
that there's documentation clear
documentation for how to get Android
running on this thing
there's a lot of other boards kind of
like this but the documentation is kind
of scattered between forums and random
github repositories them this way was
pretty easy to get up and running with
this one so once you had Android up and
running on the board how'd you get it on
the phone sure
so getting under it running on the board
was actually really easy you can the
absolute coolest thing about Android
that is a real benefit it has over iOS
is that the entire operating system with
the exception of googles apps meaning
the Play Store and that stuff is open
source and that means you can just
download it and you can build it on your
computer and you can you can make
modifications to the operating system
and install them on the phone so that's
actually where I started and I started
with a normal Android phone I didn't
have this board yet I had I think I used
a nexus 5 - there's two components the
first one is you need to figure out how
to communicate with the iPhone Apple's
protocol that they use for lightning is
proprietary and typically to use it you
have to you have to get what's called an
MFI license and I figured they probably
weren't gonna even though I have an MFI
account they probably were going to let
me keep it after doing something like
this so this actually this is just like
standard lightning it used it there's a
an open source project called USB MUX D
that allows you basically to send
network connections over lightning so
what i did is i ported that to android
which it wasn't particularly difficult
because Android uses a Linux kernel so
the facing optical like this sounds like
you just made a rocket ship excited
Jupiter it was more difficult than the
average kind of you know building her a
website but in in the grand scheme of
things modifying an operating system it
was surprisingly easy to get going the
second thing was actually figuring out
how to capture the screen on the Android
side of things because you have to it
has to be relatively performant if it's
going to try to get anywhere near kind
of the 60 frames per second magic
smooth number of frame rate so that's
that's another thing that runs on this
is a small process that captures the
screen in the background and just fires
it off out of the USB the USB port and
receives the touch events in and I
suppose the final component is the the
iPhone app which just listens for
incoming frames and sends touches out
the phone itself is not jailbroken not
jailbroken it's running the latest
version of iOS 9 or one of the one of
the most recent ones and yeah it's a
normal app honestly you could probably
ship this app through the App Store it
doesn't use any private API is there
anything see well long apple with the
yeah would allow that so what's the
what's the plan for this was just to
prove that you could yeah the the plan
was really to get people talking about
it it's like I said before the animosity
between the platforms is so great that
it was just it was low-hanging fruit as
somebody who's been on YouTube for a
while I can yeah as somebody who's read
the comments I'm video for this so train
this is a working proof-of-concept
yeah ha - right could be slimmed down to
ultimately be Android on your iPhone
Branka the purposes with the case for
sure yeah I could see this if we
actually wanted to go to like real
production with this I could see this
being about the size of the Apple
battery case in terms of the form factor
and once it's running is it fully
functioning Android yeah more or less um
there are certain things that don't work
there's no camera it but other than that
these lose limitations that could be
overcome probably yeah
there's no cellular modem in it either
but you don't really need that because
you can just use your phone yeah thank
you very much really appreciate it
that's what the thanks for having me now
that you guys know what went into this
assume you want to see it actually work
we've a whole video detailing this
actually running seeing Android running
on an iPhone is like seeing a cat with a
dog tail it is incredible to see and the
fact that it's actually working on an on
jailbroken iPhone is like magic you want
to see that link to it down below we'll
link it up here to check out Nick thank
you again for the time I really
appreciate it psychic</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
