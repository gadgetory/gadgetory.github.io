we are checking out the shield and one
of the things that has been a very
highly anticipated feature is the
ability to stream games from your
machine to your shield so we're going to
check that out today we're going to do a
quick little demo and we are excited to
be using it this is really cool that
you're able to do that so I have my
shield here and we are using a very
lovely Falcon Northwest Tiki so thanks
to Nvidia for providing us with both of
these devices so I'm going to go into
our Nvidia area here and we are going to
pick PC games now keep in mind that this
is in beta so if we run into any issues
I'm sure all of that will be smoothed
out but here it is we've connected to
the PC that we're using and we're going
to choose steam so it's already
highlighted let's choose that and you
can see on our main screen it's going to
change to a full screen steam and we can
actually navigate on that so we have the
exact same thing see mirrored right
there streaming to our device and really
smooth actually pretty good so if we
want to look at the store we can do that
and you can see the response time is
right on point
there's the brand-new DuckTales you can
go through this just like you would in
anything that you would use on your
desktop PC we're going to go into our
library and let's check out a little bit
of Skyrim we've got our regular library
filled with games we're going to open up
Skyrim so here we go so we're going to
continue a game here and continue our
level 1 game so that's going to load and
here we are so ok we are in game and we
are going to go do this I hope the up
it's in it's not inverted so I haven't
done that yet but I'm going to follow
him and hopefully I will not be killed
I'm an inverted axis kind of girl
let's go kill these dudes now / / / sly
some people in the face and just in case
anyone's wondering I this is actually
plugged in because we've been killing
the battery on this playing with it all
day long so you don't actually need this
it's just for charging we just been we
just been having a lot of fun with it so
bear with us as we recharge our shield
you don't actually need it it is
wireless if I unplug this it will not
shut off but yes as you can see we've
had quite a bit of quite a bit of fun
with it today in the office so that is a
little bit of what happens in Skyrim
when we're streaming it as you can see
again really really really quick so
you're able to really access everything
just about in real time I don't see any
lag and for beta that is pretty good
we're big fans of this feature if you
want to go right back to your Steam PC
games area you can do that it'll resume
it don't have to unload anything on your
desktop PC so if you're away from it you
can't reach your mouse that's okay if
you want to go back home to Android you
can just click on the home button right
there and there you are a really cool
feature I mean really exciting this is a
really awesome thing that you can do
with your shield and obviously one of
the big reasons that you would want to
get one of these if you are a huge Steam
gamer this is this is really for me the
reason you would get it so so that is
our quick demo of streaming Steam games
to your shield from your PC if you have
any questions we're going to be doing a
full review on the Nvidia shield feel

comments and we will make sure to try to
get to all of your stuff that is it for
