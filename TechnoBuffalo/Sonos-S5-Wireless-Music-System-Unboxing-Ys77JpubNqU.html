/ android let's find out what is
happening everybody I'm Noah from
TechnoBuffalo calm and a couple weeks
ago the folks from sonos reached out to
me and said hey to celebrate the launch
of our new android app for the sonos
player we want to send you a sonos
system so you can check out the android
app try out the system see what you
think and I said all right and so they
sent me the system here it is right here
the sonos s5 I was on the road last week
actually arrived last week but I here it
is now and basically what you get with
the s5 is it's a no wait a second
timeout timeout timeout full FTC
disclosure I was sent a t-shirt it's the
old I like the way they did that I
wonder if they had to pay maxell it's
the old Mac cell ad the sealed maxell ad
with the the dude being blown away by
the sound system but it's the android
robot that's pretty funny I like that
anyway so they sent me the system and
it's the sonos s5 which is a
self-contained system sonos the Sun us
has been out for a while now I once
actually saw Herbie Hancock the jazz
legend at the sonos booth at macworld
way back when outside with those guys so
no this is pretty cool have actually
played with the sonos a while ago and
it's it's a you know it's a high end me
not like super high end but for consumer
level high-end digital music system lets
you wirelessly you know play your music
off of an ass drive or something like
that or off the internet and you can
play your music you know around
different stations in the house you can
play different songs on different
stations or the same stuff synced up
across you know the different stations
that kind of thing now if the advent of
these um you know touchscreen devices
like ipad and iphone and now the ipod
touch and out the android devices you
don't have to buy the separate sonos
controller so you can get a lower costs
system so here's the s5 it's the the
sonos s5 here it's a an all-in-one
system it's got your speakers built-in
you can play your music again you have
to you know its internet connected so
you can play stuff off of the internet
but you have to and you want your own
music on here you have to supply it
somehow so with a network attached
storage drive apple time capsule
something like that but this device
right here this is the zone player s5
it's got the speakers built-in so it's a
full-on music system 5 driver speaker
system with five dedicated digital amps
two tweeters two mid-range drivers and
one bass driver everything's in there
you can play off of an iTunes library on
a computer you can play off the internet
at connecting to itunes like I said
these are last.fm Napster Pandora
Rhapsody serious all that stuff and
there it is you can get the sonos
controller or you can use the app and
now you know again the whole thing here
is the Android app so got in the box
I've got two of these s5s i'm going to
set up a two-room system and then we've
got this sonos bridge 100 here so we'll
get the system hooked up and the bridge
will let me connect to my router so I
can set the s5s up anywhere so I don't
have to have the router in the same room
as the s5 so that's cool so there you go
all I can play Wolfgang's Vault off this
too i love wolfing gangs vaults here so
I do ah so there you go I'm going to
check this out let's take it out of the
box will get this set up and then we
will show you how the Android app works
kind of hard to do the unboxing here
because this is up high on a table and
these things are so tall so I think
we're going to do this i'm just going to
pull this stuff out of the box to show
you so in the box you get your rock
congratulations you bought something and
you you just gotten all that stuff you
get your setup CD so you can get this
hooked up to your internet connection
and your network music and all that kind
of goodness here's the unit itself
smaller than even smaller than it then
it appeared from the box I'll show you
that in a second inside this box here
you also get there's your power cord and
an ethernet cable so you can hook
yourself up some electricity and to your
router just to get a three-and-a-half
millimeter chord the device the device
the system comes in black and white so
this was nice enough to give me a choice
I opted for any black so thank you I'm
don't you say black outfit for the white
Wow I'm staring at I'm staring at this
thing it's white and I said black go
figure you can't pay attention to
yourself you can pay attention to so
take us out of the bag here
ragas seal at the top how did I do that
have a seal bags crazy now obviously the
size of this thing it doesn't matter if
it doesn't perform well and sound good
but I'm impressed at how you know how
small this is how unobtrusive for
reference you know size-wise here's a
here's a computer keyboard little apple
keyboard mean literally it's not that
much bigger you know then the epic you
mean it is bigger but not that much
bigger Oh what else for size comparison
here's a pair of scissors not all that
much taller than a pair of scissors here
is a ping-pong paddle so you know it's
really not all that big depth wise you
know it's it's not even as deep as a
ping pong paddle is wide to give you an
idea on the top you've got volume and
mute controls a little LED indicator
light on the front obviously nothing
just your speakers on your base on the
back you've got headphone jack looks
like an audio in jack there's your AC
adapter connection and then there are
two ports for Ethernet in and out and
again you know I think you have to
connect one of these to your router to
get things happening but then you can
connect separately you know what you for
wireless mesh network between the sonos
devices or you can use that bridge that
they sent to get the setup so I'm going
to get this thing set up and get the
android app happening maybe do a little
comparison between the android app and
the itune or the apple app as well and
then also you know me personally a very
I'm very curious the difference between
using this and using something like
Apple TV which i already have set up
apple tv2 the current generation is 99
bucks the old Apple TV I bought used I
actually bought one because it had
add a hard drive in and I could use it
as a music server and then the apple
remote app is free I've been using that
in my house for a while now and it's a
little bit walking when it works it
works great but sometimes they're delays
in it you know queuing up the music
delays and you know from playing music
and then I the app has gone to sleep and
I open the app back up on a phone or on
the iPad to change the music sometimes
they're delays there you know it's a
little bit it's a little bit wonky I
keep using the word wonky so I know for
99 bucks a pop with the iTunes the apple
TV unit rather versus four hundred
dollars a pop for these s5s now granted
you know with the s5 you got the
speakers all built in everything you
don't have to hook it up to an external
speaker source but still you know
wondering how much better is the sonos
has this perform by itself you know as a
one box music system all that kind of
stuff we're going to find out thanks
again to sona's for sending this our way
and we'll have much more coverage of the
sonos s5 the android app all that stuff
on techna Buffalo com so next time me
and my big head my name is Noah see you
later
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
