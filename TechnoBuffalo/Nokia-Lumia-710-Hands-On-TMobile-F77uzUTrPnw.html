technobuffalo reporting here live from
the t-mobile nokia press event and this
is the nokia lumia 710 available through
t-mobile it's going on sale in stores on
january 11th of next year like you said
this device is running windows mobile
7.5 sometimes better known as mango so
it's got the trademark live tiles here
but actually update in real time as your
content is updating so you can see on my
people page here my little photos are
loading that are coming in from facebook
as we speak a simple swipe to the side
shows you your full list of applications
and also takes you easily to the
settings page or you can do things like
turn Wi-Fi and bluetooth on and just one
tap so going back to the home page
there's a few applications that are
specific to nokia that you can't get
with any other manufacturer even if
they're running Windows Phone so the
first one is nokia drive which is a
voice guided turn-by-turn gps
application which is pretty cool it
comes free preloaded on every nokia
lumia 710 we also have an ESPN
application and now other devices have a
sports application but none of them have
the breadth and depth that this one here
does it's got a qualcomm 1.4 gigahertz
snapdragon processor you can see it's
super responsive the screen here is a
clear back AMOLED display it's going to
work great in bright sunlight and the
back covers are interchangeable you can
have a white or a black cover on a white
or black finish
right so you say it was a 1.4 gigahertz
single core Snapdragon processor it's a
512 megabytes of RAM i believe and
5-megapixel camera that correct that's
right in addition to the 512 megabytes
on device storage the device also comes
with 25 gigabytes of cloud storage
through Microsoft SkyDrive offering some
and this phone is going to sell for 4999
with a two-year contract that's right
after fifty dollar mail-in rebate colors
are pretty good oh definitely say a man
the light right behind me as well I'm
not feeling any wash out at all black
really is clear black technology
yeah scrolling actions very very very
nice I'm not feeling any bit of lag
whatsoever I mean it might be a single
core processor cpu at one point 4
gigahertz but it doesn't feel any less
snappy than it some of the dual cores
that I've tried
it's pretty pretty good they're very
responsive
let's just tap on a
the legs yep and all populates pretty
quickly
hey have you seen investors for your
blackberry 10 delay research in motion
future uncertain you should
alright this is audreanna from
technobuffalo Anna thanks for watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
