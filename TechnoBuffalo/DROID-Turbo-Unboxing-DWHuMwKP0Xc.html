TechnoBuffalo here the droid is back
let's go ahead and take a look at the
Droid turbo from would roll and Verizon
and see I'm sorry I can't out myself
this is the Droid you're looking for
alright so here is the box for the Droid
turbo the Droid logo is back nothing
else on the front Verizon on the side
and if you thought like hey I'm on
another carrier I want to use this
Verizon's like no it is a device
exclusive this is a big box in the world
of teeny thin and eco-friendly packaging
the drug turbo is like get you I'm big
I'm brash and I am loud and that is
really a good message for this device so
go ahead and pull off the sleeve here if
I can do it elegantly we're just I did
not do it elegantly there we go here's
the box I got the droid turbo emboss
some Verizon 4G LTE branding on there X
LTE actually take that out and there is
the droid turbo looking ready to rock
we'll talk a lot about the back and the
device let's see what else are going to
have inside of this giant box I'm
expecting a lot of things like maybe
like a puppy the bean here it's so big
we've got books case you're sitting on
the toilet and want to learn about your
new phone get to know your phone in
different languages product safety all
that kind of stuff we've got not just
your average wall work this is the turbo
charger which we will talk about and
I've got a micro USB cable which we're
probably not going to talk much about
and that is it so push all of this
business off to the side let's take a
look at the piece there is this Don's
the Droid turbo I'm gonna go ahead and
get my whooshing noise do it come here
whooshing noise peel you off wasn't a
satisfying it usually is but still
pretty good going power this sucker on
I'm sure we will get a very loud droid
boot up take bets if it goes droid and
looks like the Terminator I or maybe
they toned that down a little bit so we
got this sucker all booted up here what
you're looking at is a 5.2 inches it's
weird to say this but now it's almost
standard
HD display that means you're going to
have 2560 this way by 1440 that way and
real fast
what's that PPI if you said by 165 your
math teacher would be super duper proud
of you it is an AMOLED display in case
really hey John what technology are
using these with pentile it's powered by
android 4.4.4 at launch powering this
guy is pretty much every next-gen spec
you could have it's a 2.7 gigahertz
Snapdragon 805 processor which is a lot
of horsepower I'm guessing that this
processor could probably run like
Windows or OS 10 with pretty relative
ease also has three gigs of ram in here
which is more than my 2011 MacBook Pro
had storage options are gonna be
available you get 32 or 64 if you're
saying oh that's alright I can just add
an external SD card to you I say I'm out
of luck you cannot add external storage
on this guy camera it has one obviously
it is a 21 megapixel camera that can
shoot video in this many k's which is a
lot of k's if you want to shoot video in
that it's got a 2 megapixel sensor
living right there on the front smack in
the middle for taking your duck lip
selfies all the latest Wi-Fi tech is
here as well as you'd expect a 211 a BGN
and AC bluetooth 4.0 NFC let's talk
about the battery so it is a beastly 39
hundred million power battery and if a
question is hey John how long is that
gonna last motorola verizon say this
thing is gonna last you 48 hours which
is insane but let's say you need to
charge it you can use this here turbo
charger and in 15 minutes into a wall
you can get up to 8 hours of battery
life which is absolutely ridiculous
also my favorite features you might not
think is on this phone just crazy back
it does have qi wireless charging this
back is actually ballistic nylon it kind
of feels like pants but it looks pretty
awesome i'm guessing it could save your
life you just had a whole bunch of these
and made a vest out of it you'd probably
be safe and probably be up but don't try
that don't say jon said I'm gonna be
okay I just don't it's a bad idea it's
also got a water-resistant nano coating
so you know if you're in a rainstorm or
something you'll be alright and all the
cool moto stuff that we love with the
motox is on here as well including modal
voice moto assist motor display and moto
action so all kinds of cool stuff here
on board one of the best things least in
my mind with the Motorola phones is they
pretty much let Android be Android with
a few tweaks you I think are really nice
I'll take a quick look around the device
you've got two capacitive buttons here
I've got back home and your multitasking
button on the left hand side usually we
might find a volume rocker you're not
gonna find said volume rocker so we go
like this you're just gonna being
counted to beat on the right-hand sides
where are they actually gonna take place
there's your power and lock button and
there is that volume button up or down
and sort of one big buttons here to
figure out whether you're on the top of
the bottom at the back there is that
sort of military creating nylon which is
your calling ballistic nylon don't have
big verizon logo anywhere on the back
you just have a really nice and
pronounced a droid logo which as I
learned from the back of this box and
they're telling me is a trademark of
Lucasfilm so a little bit of Disney
magic I guess went into this phone go
take a look at the stuff that's here any
sort of extra stuff you see a lot of it
is Verizon something to the Verizon
exclusives here including the pretty
awesome NFL mobile you can watch game
forever you are will go into settings
scroll down to the bottom will go to
about phone I'll see that it's got four
point four point four but we should see
lollipop on here relatively assuming a
Motorola device hopefully we'll get it
sooner rather than later go ahead and I
go back there again as is running on
Verizon's 4G LTE network pretty beastly
phone available in red and a couple
other colors on the back depending what
storage size you get looks to be a
really nice device I'll put it through a
full round of paces at which you know
what we think there's a lot of great
phones up there Verizon's getting a
pretty awesome phone line up this is one
of many killer device in their portfolio
and the in particular you guys when they
see about the phone let us know we will
cover it for you until next time I am
