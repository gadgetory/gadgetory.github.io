from TechnoBuffalo here yesterday I was
walking around invest by as I like to do
and just look at all electronics and I
wandered into the video game section and
there was a mother there with probably
her seven or eight year old son and all
this kid was asking for was for an xbox
he kept saying mom was kind of an xbox
please kind of an xbox please can I have
an xbox and she just kept saying no I
know the sound sort of like a contrived
story but it really did happen so I
forgot to thinking do video games need a
defense you know what were the mothers
reasons for saying no to playing video
games as opposed to kid asking for a
movie or a Lego set or any other hobby
why isn't that video games have become
so stigmatized we've all heard it since
we were little and if you're growing up
now you've probably hear this on a
regular basis video games rot your mind
video games will make you violent or
violent video games will make you
violent video games will make you dumb
do something better with your time and a
lot of people out there game the gaming
industry is growing on a daily basis and
video games are having almost feature
film like premieres so the industry is
experiencing growth despite this stigma
associated with it so once I talk to you
guys a little bit about it and sort of
ask your opinions I hear what you have
to stay so what do you think Duke video
games need a defense if I had a long day
at work or I'm tired I want to sit down
and play some halo wars with a buddy do
I need to justify that to myself or to
anybody if someone asked what I did
today and I spend four hours playing
video games do I need to have a defense
for that what if i had spent four hours
watching a movie or what if I it spends
two hours building Lego blocks right
spend two hours building a birdhouse or
two hours writing or doing some other
endeavor why didn't video games I need
that special defense why do you have to
justify it so I played video games today
but I got all my work done before I did
you know why do you think that happened
video games have evolved from sort of
the real real rudimentary graphics of
pong to some of the real hardcore 3d
rendering and now you find
the xbox and playstation and the motion
controls like you'll find it in the wii
and in the playstation 3 it's very
interesting to see the evolution but
that stigma still hasn't changed so what
do you guys think do video games need a
defense do you feel the need to justify
playing video games to your friends
family significant other so that Styles
a girlfriend or whatever you know do you
feel the need to do that I thought that
I would ask you personally I think that
video games don't need a defense I think
it's a worthwhile endeavor I think it
can as a hobby at least and done in a
timely and appropriate fashion certainly
spending all day every day playing a
video game it's not going to benefit you
or anyone but using it in moderation
like you would any hobby I think it's
particularly reasonable then you can
improve hand-eye coordination I think
it'd give you an appreciation to for
some of the graphic work that goes into
it I play a game even if I don't like
the game I appreciate the hours and
months and probably years that went into
developing a game and the industry
employs so many people that it's very
interesting to hear a against an
industry be so stigmatized so guys what
do you think in defense of video games
do they need it or don't need it leave
your comments or a video response to
this I'm really curious to hear what you
have to say if you're the mother of that
kid nikhil is a good kid not in trouble
or anything bad would you have bought
him an xbox i probably would have anyway
