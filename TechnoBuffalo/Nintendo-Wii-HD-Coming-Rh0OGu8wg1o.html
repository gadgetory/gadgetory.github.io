technobuffalo here and i am in a new
location it's friday the sun is out in
southern california and it's beautiful I
came downstairs so that's where I'm
filming this as you can probably tell by
my super tan complexion I don't see much
someone generally sequestered all day
typing on the computer so let me see
here i got sun coming in from there i
got some coming in from there and it
will make me feel better to have direct
sunlight on my face so the topic of this
video is to discuss the rumors of an
upcoming we HD or we too will give some
details and talk about what I think you
guys can expect from Nintendo's
next-generation console let's go ahead
and get started
so you guys can't see if I'm totally
reclined sitting on my couch this is a
super comfortable wait film all right so
let's talk we too and what we can expect
from this upcoming console there have
been rumors about a new way for probably
the past year and a half in picking up
steam more recently with rumors of a
price cut coming to the Nintendo Wii
supposedly a way to reduce inventory get
them out to the retail channels in
preparation for the new console which we
will allegedly see at e3 2011 slated for
a q3 q4 2012 released probably safe to
say in time for the holidays next year
so what we're expecting to see in this
console is current generation console
graphics and by current generation I'm
talking about xbox 360 and ps3 which
means we are finally going to have HD
capabilities on a Nintendo console and
maybe if we're lucky fingers crossed we
are going to actually have DVD playback
at a time when how many people even care
about DVD and maybe just maybe we will
have hdmi connection which is about time
for Nintendo to jump on the HD bandwagon
now I don't want to take away from what
the wii is done then we really occurred
in a new era of motion-controlled gaming
I think that if we didn't have the
nintendo wii in a marketplace we
wouldn't have things like the kinect
playstation move and the emphasis behind
the motion gay
handhelds like the touch android devices
iphone whatever else in my fee i think
nintendo really helped pave the way
however competitors have in my opinion
more than caught up to the emotion
controlled gaming and tend those kind of
lost its edge a nintendo has gone on
record as saying with the
next-generation console with all
consoles in general they want to do a
better job ticing third-party developers
so when you think about the xbox 360 and
ps3 at least if your meanness what I
think of I think of Call of Duty I think
of the mad and sports games I think of
halo for the Xbox kill zone for the ps3
so though the first part of games some
of them are third-party games some of
them are console exclusive some not what
I think about Nintendo I generally think
about Mario and Zelda and that's really
been one in ten those problems they make
great fantastic some of the best
actually first party games what the
third party support is not been there so
hopefully with this we HD we will see
better third-party support and I'm
calling it the wii HD there's been no
indication either down it's going to
have an HD or two in its title I would
assume however that smart marketing
would say will not be called owe me to
at all the xbox 360 weeks current
generation has already have three in the
title PlayStation already has a three of
the title calling something to already
makes it seem outdated especially when
we might be looking at the dawn of the
PlayStation 4 and Xbox who know they're
going to call it for twenty weird you're
probably have a lot of fun reaction from
the crowd so I just want to know what
you guys think about the wii HD really
no indication is what the specs might be
but we'll definitely see some HD grabs
be quite nice of presumed possibly in 10
days given conflicting statements and
maybe we'll see 3d gaming on board i'm
not convinced about the 3d craze and
home entertainment never really did much
for me whether it's handheld or whether
it's on my TV which I'm pointing at but
you can't see them really excited me
hurt my eyes but that's probably unique
to me so when you guys think you excited
not excited you care not care is it
going to make you want to pick up a new
Nintendo or you want to wait to see what
Microsoft and Sony come up with I also
want to thank technobuffalo zone junk
watch made nomas waffle John for sending
me this guy this is an angry birds
plushie and I wearing green because I am
like an angry birds pig and it's going
to come and crush me a kind of fun so
John thank you for this I'm already
thinking of fun video idea this to do
with it i'm jon rettinger from
technobuffalo and i'll see you next
