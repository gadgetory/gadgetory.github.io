technobuffalo it might look like they're
just looking at the samsung galaxy s5
but actually under it it just goes to
show and you can squeeze a 5.5 inch
screen into a larger or smaller farm
form factor is its LG g3 here so you got
the 5.1 inch display of the galaxy s5 vs
55 right here I want to show this for
another reason because this has 1080p
display and this one has the quad HD
display so it should be much sharper but
side-by-side honestly right now I'm not
seeing a huge difference between the two
I think maybe we'll see that more with
text and videos coming down the road but
i'll show you an example of the video
running here you can see just how sharp
the screen really does look if you have
the resolution in the content of it to
run it but otherwise we'll show you the
device sizes you can see there rather
close in fitness or thickness if you
will on the bottom charging corks on
both phones 3.5 millimeter headphone
jack though it's on the bottom of the g3
while it's on the top so the galaxy s5
but we do have the IR blaster here and
end right here on the galaxy s5 the
backs kind of very different you've got
a 13 megapixel on the gap the LG g3 here
while you have a 16 megapixel I look on
the galaxy a spot and then the volume
controls and the power button ports on
the back assess the heart rate sensor
but LG toss us in the laser focus for a
quicker autofocus when you're taking
pictures any case just want to give you
a quick size up comparison of the two
phones and again you can see just
slightly larger form factor than the
galaxy s5 but it packs a 5.5 inch screen
now he was able to do that
a really edge to edge on that and having
very little vessels on the top and
bottom any case quick look at the two
phones is Scott Hazleton with techno
