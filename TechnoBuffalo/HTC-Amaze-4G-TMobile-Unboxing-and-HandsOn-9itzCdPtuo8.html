TechnoBuffalo calm and the nice folks at
t-mobile USA we're kind enough to send
us not one but two of their newest
android cell phones the galaxy s2 from
Samsung and the amaze 4g from HTC we're
going to start on the left
all rights the amaze 4g from t-mobile
and HTC they launched this phone back at
mobilized in San Francisco emily price
was on hand check the phone out and it
will be available for pre-order online
october 10th hit retail stores on
october 12 to 59 99 on contract after
rebate so a very high-end high tier
price tag now that's still the expected
price i suppose that could change by the
12th i'm filming this on the 7th but
that's what they're saying to 59 99 on
contract after rebate thanks to the
folks at t-mobile PR for lending us this
phone all right thanks to many for
getting that thing open device itself
power up while we check out what else is
in the box there we go it's like these
phones have so many features now that
the stickers instead of these to be
blank stickers or some of them used to
say like you know don't text a driver
ever now they have like all the
different things like this buttons for
this and that buttons for that and this
thing over here is where the sound comes
out you know you gotta educate people
whenever you can in the box start guide
recycling voucher or label recycle your
old phones all your old gadgets we've
done them don't throw them in the
garbage where they wind up in a landfill
recycle them so that they're disposed of
properly and so that certain of the bits
and parts can be reused you also get a
USB cable and you're charging adapter
your AC adapter some no headphones I'm
getting all kinds of messages though no
headphones or anything like that with
this phone not like the HTC rhyme that
came out recently where you get like the
tangle-free earbuds in the charm and the
docking station and now you buy a
superphone you get a superphone that's
it it's a nice nice nice feeling device
and it reminds me a little bit of the
sensation x
which I just happen to have of course
Teemo will already carries the sensation
would like the sensation XE this is not
a us-bound phone this is a lot Wow a lot
of spam blowing me up no interesting
anyway alright the phone itself 4.3 inch
qhd super LED display and we use all
this stuff yes set up accounts later 4.3
inch qhd super LCD display so 960 x 540
you got a front-facing camera as well as
a rear 8-megapixel camera autofocus dual
LED flash all the new HTC camera
software the zero shutter lag they call
it for fast reloading of your of your
camera and the veil different things
smart shot and perfect pics and clear
shot a share all the stuff that we said
they viewed in the US on the the mytouch
4g slide also the front camera
2-megapixel i forgot to mention that
also full 1080p video recording it's a
4g phone of course and it's one of the
first devices to support t-mobile usa's
hspa+ 42 network so theoretical maximum
speeds of 40 2 megabits per second is
that where the boats on fire maybe
because comes the best I don't know
you're not going to get 42 but you can
get bursts I've I've been hearing I
think up to around twice we'll have to
try that out you also on this phone get
the latest versions of Android
Gingerbread and HTC Sense will go into
the settings here go about phone
software so 2 dot 3 up for an HTC HTC
Sense the readout oh so almost the the
newest version you're not the exactness
work almost the newest versions you can
see the 4g indicators lit up there of
course you have Wi-Fi on the device as
well and we'll go back for a second take
a look at the apps here and
get this t mobile apps specialty mobile
features or bloatware whatever you want
to call tmobile male name ID t bubble TV
HD quick is pre-installed Zinio readers
pre-installed i saw slacker radio
pre-installed as well let's check out
mobile HD here take a little tour around
the phone what's going on of course the
display we talked about 4.3 inches
multi-touch what's not multi-touch these
days for capacitive touch menu buttons
on the bottom on the left spine you've
got your micro USB charging or syncing
and charging port on the top three nine
millimeter audio jack the power lock
switch on the right spine you've got a
rocker switch for volume and whatnot
then you've got two additional buttons
presumably for the camera will check
those out in a second on the bottom
nothing going on is your battery cover
latch which I will stay away from left
something terrible happens and on the
back your camera again 8 megapixel
autofocus dual LED flash all those
features that I talked about a second
ago alright let's check out a tmobile TV
here let's see what's going on on ESPN
mobile right now 30 day trial sure you
pay extra for everything I wanted ESPN
mobile
alright well talk about the TV chef I
mentioned the phone supports DLNA and
HDMI mirroring you have to get an
optional adapter but so you cannot send
the content from this device out to a
big screen TV set or monitor via HDMI
it's got a 16 gigs of internal memory
and a microSD card slot so officially
supports up to forty eight gigs and
they've mentioned this the processor
today Qualcomm s3 they renamed the
Snapdragon line this year's this is an
s3 it's a 1.5 gig dual-core CPU and then
you get your Wi-Fi your Bluetooth all
that stuff and it's a world phone
quadband gsm and like i said 4g via the
hspa+ 42 which maybe i should have
turned off me Hector to Wi-Fi before I
checked the load up the TV here I give
this a minute though see if it comes on
phone feels really nice in the hand I've
been in oh I've always been impressed by
HTC's build quality of the hardware and
now this phone it's a nice mix of you
know it's plastic bits here but it feels
solid I don't know if I would call this
HD exactly rather pixelated yeah so this
is live only this is live TV and a
little bit pixelated for sure let's try
something else or its dress Saturday
morning to you want to that home run now
it can saturday morning TV actually be
live on a Friday afternoon yeah
also a little pixelated but you know I
don't know kind of cool I guess depends
on Shane oh yeah they charge then uses
go on demand I would assume these would
be slightly better quality is it on
demand and that's feeling i watch the
full episode of 30 rock
I'm cornered so see what happens if i
watch a full episode of 30 rock here
remember when these things used to just
be phones and then they had some of them
had cameras and that was like whoa now
i'm watching on demand episodes of 30
rock doctors the chairman meanwhile my
spam is blown up in the background you
thought you were just getting an
unboxing you didn't know we were going
to sit around waiting for old TV shows
to rerun rerun makes me think of that
show what's happening anybody out there
no Roger no rerun no rent yeah anyway
that's a great show but I was saying the
build quality of the HTC phones you know
I've always liked that I like their
current design language there's that one
device recently the the radar I got to
check out that isn't out yet I wasn't so
thrilled with the design language in
that one have kind of like a double chin
but this phone the sensation XE I just
showed you the Titan certainly I'll
really digging um the look and feel of
those devices you know what I don't
really want to wait for this anymore so
when we go back to the home screen and
we're going to see what these buttons do
on top let's i'm guessing camera and
camcorder but let's see the first one is
bigger but has no red stripe on it so
let's press it and it's the camera learn
more about the advanced camera features
now right now say button does nothing oh
yes did it launched the camcorder I got
a little vibrational feedback law
haptics but took a while so it's not a
zero lag camcorder it's a well it's not
early shutter lag which I with overtime
a launch time so let's test out this
your leg go go that's I mean yeah that's
fast that's great
okay I mean I'm taking the same picture
over and over again so my pictures are
going to be worth a dime but that is
really fast that's terrific well there
you go I'm sold it's the HTC amaze 4g I
better be sold quick because it's two
hundred sixty bucks which is a lot for a
cell phone but you know you get a lot of
cell phone here the qhd display of the
4g the dual-core Snapdragon s3 they
megapixel camera that reloads so fast
all that stuff although apparently I've
dropped down to 2g now anyway aha
t-mobile HTC the Amaze available for
pre-order online October 10th in stores
October twelfth will have much much more
on this phone maybe I'll send this one
to Mike since he's are at imaging expert
get him one of these these new HTC
