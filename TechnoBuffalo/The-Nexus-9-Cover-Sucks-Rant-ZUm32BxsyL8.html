to you by lynda.com what's up everyone
John Ranger from TechnoBuffalo here last
week I filmed a video saying I was
switching from my iPad Mini to my Nexus
neither that was met with a lot of stuff
in the comments but a lot of you were
saying that you agreed with my reasons
if you want to see that video link to it
will be right down below i figured betty
new tablet I needed a case for it so I
went over to Google Play and I just
picked up the official Google cover for
the Nexus 9 is built in conjunction with
HTC it's called a whole bunch of
different things it varies on where you
buy it it's 40 bucks comes in different
colors I got the blue version here and I
figured I was gonna be good to go this
is where the story gets a little bit
squirrely
and we get a little more Retton Jers
ranty than we've been in the past few
episodes so this is what came I didn't
do any research on cases I figured this
one was gonna be good and that was
definitely my bad so I get it I'm the
jerk here what you're gonna get for 40
bucks is this it's not a case what you
get is this and what I expected was this
and this is definitely not what ended up
showing up essentially it just sits
right on top of your device that's it
like it that it's got a microfiber
kind of soft mint tree on the bottom now
presumably clean your tablet you can
arrange it in different ways if you want
to prop your device up assuming you can
get it to do that without the magnets
breaking and if oftentimes it just falls
off completely the idea is when you're
not using it you can just stick it to
the back protect the back of your tablet
when you want to use it again you just
put it right on the front here's the
deal this thing slides off so easily I
put it in my bag I pulled my tablet out
it was like this I might as well have
not have had it I don't want something
that's gonna just protect my screen I
wants it it's gonna stay on and protect
my tablet this is the most ridiculous
case I have ever purchased again I'm the
jerk I've been in research I just bought
it but forgot you're looking to get a
nexus 9 at least I can save you
40 bucks if you're looking at this
tablet and you're thinking I would like
to make things for this out of the folks
at lynda.com have you covered you can
learn all kinds of new skills that you
need to make yourself a better person
web design programming design
application development everything in
between
let me ship it's just twenty-five bucks
per month it's online so 24/7 access try
lynda.com free for seven days by
visiting
calm / TechnoBuffalo that's ly NDA calm
/ TechnoBuffalo so you know be more
useful than this in save me 40 bucks let
me show you a little microfiber cloth
goes on top boom good to go a little bit
of scotch tape take this tape it right
to the tab but hey look at that not only
is it gonna stay on it's also gonna
protect the back of my tablet at the
same time and look at that I save 40
bucks moral being do your research don't
be a John before you go and get a case
look at what's available this is a joke
that either HDC or Google would put this
out and make it available they've got
the keyboard case which is gonna give
you a little bit more coverage it's
gotta support a keyboard go to Amazon go
anywhere else to buy a case this one is
just an absolute waste of money so I
figured my mistake you guys can maybe
benefit from it don't do the same thing
I didn't if you're looking to make a
product if you're a manufacturer watch
this video don't do this this is the
most ridiculous saying doesn't stay on
it falls off it slides off it just makes
no sense I can't there we go that's how
well this thing works don't buy this in
the previous episode of ask the buffalo
we asked you guys to tell me what
feature you wanted in your upcoming
super phone and overwhelmingly in the
comments you said battery life battery
life battery life so battery life is the
winner I want to do another question it
will feature the next episode of
TechnoBuffalo what do you guys look for
in a case for your tablet or phone am I
just crazy this should be fine for me or
you want something's actually gonna stay
on how your tablet protected you want
something that wraps around the back or
not I love to hear your guys stop sign
up leave in the comments or right down
below give the video a thumbs up because
I feel silly that I made a mistake and I
could use something to feel good and if
