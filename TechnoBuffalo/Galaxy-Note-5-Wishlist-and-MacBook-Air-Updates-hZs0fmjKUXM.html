to you by the all new G flex 2 from LG
life's good hello internet welcome back
the episode of ask the Buffaloes to show
rested here on this couch dog hair on it
and I answer your questions about
technology and sometimes very very very
far outside the world of technology
let's jump right into it a first
question comes from our friend Taylor
Allen 50 52 s at John for lakers if you
could change one aspect of the tech
community what would it be comments
leaks fanboys or just something else
hashtag ask the bead this is a question
that asked myself quite a bit there are
times and I get and I so I'm pretty
thick skin after all these years of
doing this but still when the negative
comments do still get to me so you know
that would be something I would probably
want to change but that also helps sort
of drive me to be better and to have a
thicker skin not just professionally but
in life and it gets really helpful my
first gut wasn't say the fanboys but and
I'll honestly the fanboys enemy this
sort of discussion of fun thing to say I
wish it the fanboy miss could keep
things civil and not just start throwing
around like horrible hateful words that
would probably be the thing i would
change people are really brave at a
computer think what I would change is
this don't type anything that you
wouldn't say to somebody's face if you
take somebody's face by all means type
it you wouldn't say it don't put it on
screen next one comes from i am j 88 who
asked at john for lakers so in the
retina display for the macbook air do
you think the new macbook will slightly
replace the air yeah i don't know where
the air slots into the apple lineup
anymore the new macbook is all about
fitness and lightness which used to be
with the air was all about it's now got
a Retina display whereas the air has a
lower resolution display it's got big
chunky bezels it's a little bit more
powerful with the court I chips and
certainly reports but i'm not sure where
it slides into the lineup at all i hate
to say it but would be surprised through
the whole macbook air line up going
eventually just become the macbook air
line up maybe in a year or so when those
get upgraded with presumably more ports
it's tough time to be a macbook air fat
i don't have the new taptic engine
touchpad they got those big-ass bezels
like i mentioned if you want to buy
macbook air this might be the last gen
you get a chance to do so and last but
not least rats review the best
ass at john for lakers which are you
anticipating most of the next
generations the iphone 6 plus or then of
five here's I'm expecting for both
phones 6 plus it's going to have a force
touchscreen meeting available to detect
whether you do a soft tap or a physical
tap on it I think we're going to see
sapphire around there that will say
improve camera probably shooting 4k I
think the resolutions are going to
change it out I don't think the way the
phone books it going to change at all
this is what I've been saying for the
past three generations of phones gonna
have wireless charging if I stand
outside every day and I tell you it's
gonna rain one day I'm going to be right
it's going to write em look like a
genius so I'm going to say wireless
charging is going to be in there and
probably an improved touch ID module as
well obviously the usual stuff you
expect I'm see we're going to see a
faster processor and probably more RAM
in there but other than that it's
probably gonna be it for the note 5 I
think say goodbye to the note 4 is the
last of a generation of removable
battery of expandable storage and if
kind of plastic e backs think that are
gonna go totally in the direction of
what we see with the galaxy s6 and six
edge with the glass front glass back the
higher bills quality but not a removable
storage but wireless charging and
probably pretty sweet snazzy looks thank
you guys for watching I hope you enjoyed
