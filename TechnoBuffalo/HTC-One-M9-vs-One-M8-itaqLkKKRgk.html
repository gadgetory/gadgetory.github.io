Hazleton from TechnoBuffalo I'm here at
Mobile World Congress HTC just wrapped
up a press conference where it announced
the 109 we brought you the hands-on with
that but we want to bring you something
a little bit more here's a comparison
between the one m9 in my right hand and
the m8 in my left hand and part in the
scratches it was a daily driver for a
long time here so a lot of design
changes but still a very familiar
looking device so let's just go we'll go
along the right-hand side here you can
see it now has individual power buttons
as well as the I'm sorry volume buttons
the power buttons just below it and then
I believe it's either the simmer micro
SD card slot I can't pop it open and
check up on the top there front-facing
camera this time the ultra pixels there
instead of on the back where you had the
floral 4 pixel camera last year it's up
front now so more light getting let in
and then the camera on the back has been
switched to a 20 megapixel camera same
dual LED flash you see there a similar
design and when it comes to the banding
and the brushed metal look and then
let's see here on the left-hand side of
the phone again one of the port's here
it's either the SIM card or micro SD
card slot nothing else and again similar
antenna band looks than the bottom you
have the 3.5 millimeter headphone jack
and the micro USB charging same as
before up top really similar again but
the power buttons have moved to the side
but you have this IR blaster area right
there so in terms of other features that
have changed here under the hood you
have a Snapdragon 810 processor there
nice bump there and then you also have
new boom sound speakers and again it
looks the same and you still have that
black bar which HTC says it's actually
required to fit the space for the
speakers so fair trade-off I suppose but
these also support Dolby 5.1 surround
sound so when you're listening to music
it should come out at you and feel like
you're being surrounded otherwise on
here you have sense 7 which is actually
going to be updated to the m8 at some
point
HTC didn't say win but it's coming and
new options here so like this is a tap
to personalise it says but it actually
lets you and it's not set up but it lets
you set work and home modes and then
away so it'll show you different apps
depending on where you are so homework
and out here we go I just set it up so
at work it'll show those apps and then
if you go here click home it's a little
hard to see with the background the apps
actually change to what you want and so
themes this is part of sense 7 again
will let you apply all kinds of
different themes and that changes the
icons it changes the layout here of the
home buttons and the look of those and
everything else you can actually add a
photo and the theme will actually
generate itself then you can share these
with friends and stuff like that so a
lot of cool stuff in son 7 and we'll
show you that a bit later but wanted to
show you comparison between the m8 and
the m9 right here this is a quick look
