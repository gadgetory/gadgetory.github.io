to you by full sail what's going on guys
a mark on second from TechnoBuffalo and
in today's episode of rumor roundup
we'll be talking about what we can
expect from apples October 16 event
Apple on Wednesday sent out an invite
for a special event being held on it's
Cupertino campus on October 16 as is
normal with Apple invites are no clues
to what Apple will talk about or
introduced at the event given the huge
event in September were they in veiled
two new iPhones and the Apple watch I
suspect this event will focus more on
existing products like updated iPads
macs and OS 10 Yosemite apple is
expected to introduce an updated ipad
air and possibly a new iPad Mini with
Retina both which are expected to come
with updated processor and support for
touch ID which could either be for Apple
pay or just an extra layer of security
who knows though it would be a little
funny seeing someone at a store paying
with their iPad the new iPad air may
also come with 2 gigabytes of RAM a new
anti-reflective laminated display and
possibly a newer retina HD display which
was incident in latest iOS 8.1 beta
we're expecting Apple to talk a little
bit about iOS 8.1 which could also
possibly introduce new features to iPads
one which could be split-screen
multitasking and also give us an update
to Apple pay we're also expecting Apple
to release new Macs alongside OSN
Yosemite which is in its gold master
build a lot of the more recent rumors
are saying that the 27-inch imac will be
getting a Retina Display that could
possibly output a resolution of 50 120
by 2880 which i think is absolutely
insane and layman's terms that's 5k
Apple is saying forget 4k I'm going to
add one more k and make it a 5k screen
it does seem a little overkill for a
display to have a 5k resolution but a
lot of professionals could definitely
benefit from this now majority of the
shows and commercials and movies that we
watch are actually shot in either 6k
and/or 5k and just downscaled to either
1080p or 4k take a quick break from this
video and thank our friends over at full
sail as some of you may or may not know
virtually every industry relies on
software technology and full sail
university offers bachelor's degree /
Ram that addresses the need for skilled
tech professionals through curriculum
that blends code in theory would
real-world experience whether you're
into web design making apps and or
software in general Full Sail will teach
you the fundamentals in all these
courses on campus or online if you want
to learn more about full sales web and
Technology programs visit Full Sail edu
slash technobuffalo and again that's
Full Sail edu slash technobuffalo now
the new iMacs will most likely be
equipped with a high end Haswell
processor with new AMD graphics card
which could possibly be the same ones on
the current mac pro models which i think
are great and i think apple won't
completely replace its current 27-inch
imac models but instead just add a new
set of 5k imax alongside the current
generation imax for those who don't
really need a 5k display alongside the
retina imac there's also the Mac Mini
which was last updated nearly two years
ago and I think we'll see the new
Haswell processor inside and it's
integrated IRS graphics card which
myself personally am impressed with the
performance of the iris pro graphics on
my retina MacBook is really good I've
used it before to edit a few premiere
projects and I think the graphics card
alone is a good enough reason upgrade
from the current generation mac mini
design-wise I don't think Apple is going
to change anything too drastic I think
they're keeping the same design as the
current generation Mac minis and just
upgrade the specs to the more current
Intel processor I was hoping to see a
mini mac pro in the making but I don't
think we're gonna see that anytime soon
now there are also rumors going around
there will be a new 12 inch macbook air
with a high resolution screen in the
making that's supposed to boast a
portability of an 11-inch MacBook Air
and the power of a 13-inch macbook air
but we haven't really seen any leaks nor
heard a lot of rumors regarding a
12-inch MacBook Air so we're not holding
our breaths on that anyways that's it
