TechnoBuffalo here we've got a very
old-school unboxing you've been
following the channel for a while I've
gone to the brand the new second
generation Moto X here hot off the
presses from Chicago let's go and get to
the unboxing and the hands-on it's a
little bit of a redesigned box here
you've got the Moto X in blazoned on the
bottom the Motorola logo and we should
be able to slide this out this is the 18
t model which will be compatible with
their moto maker software so you can
customize that ever you want we'll talk
about the details mount of options
you now have with this open it up here
is the phone I'm go ahead and power that
sucker on and then we'll get to the
specs in just a second push it off to
the side inside we've got a little bit
of a booklets that's god's booklet type
things in it just a little bit of a
QuickStart guide for obviously getting
turned quickly that's not exciting we've
got a wall work with two USB ports I
think you don't see very often
a micro USB cable and a sim removal tool
but that is not why you were here we're
here to take a look at the new Moto X
and go ahead and see if I can get that
satisfying whooshing noise it wasn't
overly satisfying but here is the brand
new Moto X and they run through the
specs for you first it is running
Android 4.4 KitKat and Motorola has said
that is sort of a blanket Android
experience it'll get support for the new
OSS as they come out so when Android L
is released you looking at probably days
not weeks and month they do that because
it's essentially just a completely
vanilla version Andrew but the moto
editions on it are actually just apt
based so they can just update the apps
separately we will talk about the
editions here in just a second again
4.4.4 kitkat at launch it weighs 144
grams you were looking at a much bigger
way better looking screen here it's a
5.2 inch screen that's full 1080p
meaning if she could do math quickly
it's got a 423 PPI and it is coated in
Corning Gorilla Glass they're not
skipping out the processor anymore
either here it's got a Snapdragon 801 C
2.5 gigahertz quad-core strip with the
audrina 330 onboard as well so we loved
original Moto X actually it was one of
our phones of the
but the camera sucked on it now I've got
a 13 megapixel sensor up from the 10 on
the previous version on it which is a
really nice addition here else we've got
four mics around it from a design
standpoint motorboats spent a lot of
time on the design now has a full
aluminum band all the way around it
motorola claim they really want to focus
on through the feel of the phone on the
hanoks love that dimple on the back but
it's much more pronounced now it's got
kind of a rounded feel as well so it
fits really really nicely in the hand
interestingly enough Motorola's claiming
there's 10% more display area than the
Galaxy s5 even though they are the same
width because it is almost really edge
to edge display at out any bezels here's
a galaxy s5 just for for fun and you can
see what those two look like
side-by-side so mold maker is gonna be
available for this guy they got a ton of
options here they've got wood which they
are saying is environmentally sourced
certified by the Forest Stewardship
Council
they got leathers too from the Horine
leather company so those are smartly
farms let's go ahead and jump at the
settings real quickly scroll down to the
bottom I'll go to about phone I can see
it's Android 4.4.4 here fun action hey
it's good cat just in case you forgot
what was on here one really cool thing I
should have is well instead of just
saying okay Google on a device you can
actually set it say it everyone be like
subdued and it'll go ahead and use that
as whatever you want it to be so
whatever you want to call your phone you
can go ahead and do so just really neat
so a few interesting things here as well
I flicked at the camera it's got sort of
a ring flash drives which leads getting
way better pictures that was a huge
knock on the device gonna keep this guy
juiced up is a 2300 million power
battery it's up 100 million hours from
the original Moto X as also are crazy
gestures in here as well so you've got
the active display if you can turn off
there we go you can touch here you can
see what it does this moto display see
what's going on without it to drag your
finger up to learn more you can go ahead
and sort of learn more about what's
going on it's a really quick way to see
information but now you can suppose you
access it to start waving your hand over
it because they're sensors all around
the screen and answer calls but I just
wave and handover and all kinds of other
sort of familiar things and so that's
just a camera by doing a little twisty
action
and it's pretty stock camera experience
ton of other things in here we'll cover
