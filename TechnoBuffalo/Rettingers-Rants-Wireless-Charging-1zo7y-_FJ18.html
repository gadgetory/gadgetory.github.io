to you by full sail university what is
up everyone welcome back the episode of
rettinger rant i'm here jon rettinger
and it's the first episode i'm filming
back in the office after taking two
excited to be with my little man feels
good to be back here up this week though
i gotta top and some you might agree
with me about some of you might not but
it is pissing me off wireless charging
this is regulars rants let's get started
I've always loved the idea of wireless
charging you just put your phone down on
tab whatever it's got the wireless
charging able and I charged your phone
to worry about fiddling with plugs at
night i oftentimes turn off the light to
fried go to bed i try and find the cord
to plug in at hand always working just a
small annoyance it's not a giant thing
at all it's the first word problem but i
did find annoying and then wireless
charging came around and that was pretty
sweet then wireless charging got
standardized under the cheese standard
and it was even better cuz everything
worked with everything else could use
this Samsung wireless charging with a
nokia doc and everything was happy and
roads in the world samsung came out with
the pretty awesome galaxy s4 jose k I
like that phone I would like to use why
they're charging with that phone because
his where the features they were touting
that it has then doesn't come with
wireless charging you gotta buy a
totally separate accessory which can
cost as much as forty fifty bucks anyone
where you get it to get one of these
guys looking at one of these guys I
can't imagine that expensive to make but
I bit the bullet and I bought one still
want the wireless charging that was
happy again and then galaxy note 3 came
around all the gay these heads got
wireless charging awesome i put on my
wireless charger no dice me see where
I'm going with this why not just include
wireless charging in the damn box why
make you buy adapters add-ons and back
cases for all cog things like that I
don't want to buy a back case I Naples
wife I don't why I buy a back case that
enables GPS why don't have to buy a back
case that enables wireless charging it
seems absolutely silly ridiculous to me
charge me an extra four bucks whenever
it might be just included in the Box
don't if you go extra and then wait and
in case of the galaxy note 3 don't say
it's wireless charging you know you've
got wireless charging they're not
release wireless charging back it's not
even
out yet while the galaxy note 3 already
is and i find it freaking annoying it
seems silly it's like the physical
version of in-app purchases i bought
your phone i want all the features of
your phone on to pay extra to buy it
charge me a little bit more upfront and
include everything in the box kind of
reminds me of blackberry back in the day
where you can pick a black bread either
had GPS or a blackberry that had Wi-Fi
couldn't have both and this time I feel
like you just can't have both unless you
pay for it and you kind of get that
thing at getting gouged a little bit I
know it's silly it's a little thing like
wireless charging and when we have first
word problems olc guys want to say but
he's spending that much money for
premium device I want all the premium
features that come with it and has been
pissing me off I find it annoying I
still got love for my galaxy note 3 I
wish I could have more love for it and
charge it wirelessly my way off your
guys do not care about where the
charging at all I don't maybe I'm in the
crazy minority but I want to hear your
thoughts on leave it in the comments
