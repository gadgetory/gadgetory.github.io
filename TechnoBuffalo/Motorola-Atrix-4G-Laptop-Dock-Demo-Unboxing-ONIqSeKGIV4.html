TechnoBuffalo here it's an unboxing for
you of the Motorola Atrix 4G laptop dock
this is a laptop SP accessory for your
Atrix 4G that adds a lot of computer s
functionality to what's already a pretty
robust smartphone so without further ado
let's go ahead and dig in do a hands-on
so we had a chance to take a look at
this at CES 2011 it was pre-production
hardware at the time so I'm excited to
see if there's any sort of improvements
that were made from January early
January until now the end of February so
the box this comes in is quite
presumably a little bit on the large
side it houses an 11.6 inch laptop
accessory in there so we've got a
picture of it on the front only nothing
on the side on the back is where all the
specs and information here live and I'll
run through all this as we go here's
what it includes but we'll see sort of
all that a laptop dock 30 watt wall
charger power charger carrying case and
Quick Start Guide I think what's most
important to know it's a see is actually
this diagram right here which is sort of
a simple way of showing what the Atrix
can do aside from just making phone
calls so here is the Atrix it's got a
vehicle dock for it this is the laptop
dock you can have a standard dock for
just normal docking things for syncing
HD multimedia dock connect it to your TV
or even a wireless keyboard there's a
lot of accessories for this guy so let's
go ahead and open her up there's a lot
of pricing differences here if you buy
it together with the smartphone from
AT&amp;amp;T at least it's going to set you back
about $500 that'll give you the dock and
the phone although there are other
bearing deals from Radio Shack and
Amazon so your best to check your local
retailer off for pricing so we will a
little bit tape right there we got a
hack through and of course never we see
tape bust out the unnecessarily large
knife if you don't have a FedEx pack to
cut through here so there's very little
danger of losing a finger
all right so we've got a little bit a
tab to lift up some cardboard and here
is the Atrix laptop dock itself hidden
under there well I do a hands-on in just
a moment push that right off to the side
let's see what else we are going to get
inside of this box so you've got a
user's guide it's funny it's pretty
small you just guide almost like you get
for the phone got some start connecting
information more fun to play with it on
your own and figure it out and then we
have a microfiber cleaning cloth and the
other compartment here is probably a
wall charger and case you've got there's
the wall charger pretty small power
brick there's the part that plugs into
the power brick alright so let's put all
this stuff off to the side and let's
take a look at the laptop dock itself
and talk a little bit about what this
thing is and what some of the
differences are and how this is unique
or similar to a laptop alright so first
from a spec standpoint it does have an
eleven point five inch screen and I'll
open it up as as I talk about it you can
see the screen right there you also see
a bit of a reflection of me
so that is a eleven point five inch
screen with a resolution of 1366 by 768
weighs two point four pounds so it's
relatively light pretty much the whole
bottom here is just battery and it's
gonna get you eight to ten hours of use
and it also will charge your Atrix while
it's in there so if a trick says zero
charge and this thing has a full charge
you plug it in you can use it for eight
to ten hours and your Atrus will be
fully charged by the time you take it
out
so again eleven point five inch screen
wastes 2.4 pounds we've got a nice size
that chiclet style keyboard here it is a
full quarter you've got a separate row
four numbers tab caps lock shift control
function keys we've got one through F
12 and you've got your full four-way
directional navigation so if we pull
this off on the trackpad this is some
more interesting stuff happening here as
well if I can get my fingernail under
there so tap twice on led to turn
trackpad on and off kinda neat there's
an LED in the upper left hand corner
right there
press button in front of device to check
battery level you got a left click and a
right click this is a very heavily
skinned version Linux so if you've ever
used the Linux you know there should be
a pretty familiar experience even if
you've never used Linux there should be
a pretty familiar experience as well
very large trackpad there's reach app if
you want to turn this thing on I've got
a left and a right click there's been
conflicting reports or whether or not
this supports multi-touch but we will
check that out in the hands-on video so
let me close it up and we move on right
along to the back there's a lot of other
stuff going on here so this flips up and
that's where your Atrix 4G is going to
fit in and we'll check a look at that
again during the hands-on you've got
your micro USB port and your HDMI out
right then fold that right back in we've
got two USB ports which is kind of neat
I've got a power port right there
appears to be speakers on the left and
right science of stereo speakers nothing
really going on there on the bottom on
the top it's got a magnetic latch and
there you have the screen so if I
comparison so you can get a sense of the
size of this an 11.6 inch MacBook Air is
going to have the same resolution
actually of the 1366 by 768 this weighs
2.4 pounds the MacBook Air weighs 2.3
pounds so almost the same and here is a
size comparison we have the 11 inch
MacBook Air here and go ahead and see
what the differences are on both so this
is a very thin accessory I'm kind of
curious to fire it up and experience it
hands-on so let's go ahead and check it
out alright so this is going to be a
very brief
hands-on tour of the laptop dock I'll be
doing a full overview and review in an
upcoming video but I want to give you
guys least a very brief sense of how
this looks and what it does so the Atrix
4G just plugs right in and you get a
very quick boot up sort of in typical
Linux fashion of what's called your web
top and you get a lot of additional
functionality here so what you get is
icons across the bottom portraying a
dock so you've got a representation here
of your phone it looks just like your
phone to look see I've got lunch or my
launcher pro icons here icons across the
bottom and I could do whatever I would
want to do on my phone right here but if
you can do that on your phone why do you
want to do that on a laptop extenders
let's go ahead and minimize that you do
get still the same phone functionality I
can access my dialer right here I can
dial a phone number whatever I'd like it
does have speakers and microphones
built-in I can access all of my contacts
all of my messages and email will show
up here so text messages or the Gmail
account that I've got set up and there
are all of my Android buttons on the
bottom the menu of the home back and
search go ahead and minimize that there
is an HD entertainment center here and
all again I'll demo this in an upcoming
video but this lets you view pictures
video and sort of some additional media
stuff and go ahead and scroll right
through exit out of here you do also
have a full file management there isn't
storage on the laptop dock itself but it
gives you file management of the device
or the memory card that you have in
there so go ahead and close it see what
it looks like this just takes you to
Motorola's web top zone essentially just
a web page age actually interestingly
enough despite being a Google built
operating system being Android they
include a Mozilla's browser not a mobile
or Linux version of Chrome here we've
got Firefox so I go ahead and open this
up and show you what the browser looks
like and while that's queuing up you can
see the top here we've got sort of some
standard icons
we've got your settings it's gonna be
access to the general stuff
including mouths and prayers I've got
your Wi-Fi signal this does have
bluetooth so you can use a bluetooth
mouse if you like there's my signal
strength battery for both the Atrix and
a laptop dock and my volume like control
right there so this looks very browser
II you know looks like you'd see on any
other laptop let's go ahead and try
TechnoBuffalo and I will say that typing
on it there's TechnoBuffalo the keys
have very nice throw it feels really
high-quality but the keys seem shrunk
they seem almost smaller than normal
keys that you'd see on an eleven point
six eleven point five inch laptop
definitely not a full-size keyboard the
touchpad seems to work very well you can
scroll you do not have to finger
scrolling though if you want to scroll
down either have to use the arrows or
drag the little indicator here so let's
go and take a look at the Atrix unboxing
video web page and web viewing is pretty
quick you can go ahead and view most web
pages any way that you'd like so let's
go ahead and take a look at a video and
because the Motorola Atrix does have ten
flash 10.1 support this will of course
play flash content here we've got a
video of boxing can be Atrix and we'll
see the quite a bit like just sort of
very briefly and this is playing at 360
P playing a little bit on the choppy
side let's go ahead and make it
fullscreen see how it looks and you can
hear me hear me chat in the background
and this is over Wi-Fi not HSPA+ here by
the way I'm connected to my home Wi-Fi
network so it actually looks pretty
decent here on fullscreen it's a tad bit
choppy but it's really looks as good as
some of the older Atom netbook
performance that I've seen playing
YouTube videos you know it works pretty
well you're gonna get the same
limitations that you'll have with the
phone commuting out to be able to get
Hulu but sort of general stuff that you
can do on your phone tend to work very
well on here
the utility of this sort of yet to be
seen but I didn't want you guys give you
guys just a bit of
a hands-on tour and as I get to use this
a little bit more and get a sense of
what it can do and not do I'll give a
more in-depth overview of the device so
if anything in particular that you guys
want to see I'll go ahead and leave your
comments down below and ask anything
including even the ability to
right-click and what that's going to do
for you so copy select all or view
selection source it's kind of
interesting what this device is capable
of and whether or not it's worth the
money is probably going to come down to
what you would use it for so guys I am
John R Ettinger if we TechnoBuffalo and
this has been an unboxing and first look
at the motorola atrix laptop dock see
you guys the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
