of curvature jokes but I'm a father of
two now I'm amateur were individual so
I'm gonna try and get through this jokes
without any innuendos try it it's about
the iPhone 8 lacking the curve and I'm
not talking about the iPhone 7s and the
iPhone 7s plus it also might come in
September talk about the Big Daddy
iPhone 8 5.8 inch OLED crazy thin
rocking a ton of new features so now
according to KGI security isn't backed
up by the folks at MacRumors we're going
to have a flat iphone but as the iPhone
gets longer suppose I'm fighting the
urge as it gets longer we should have a
different aspect ratio some of what we
saw with the g6 not sure if it's going
to be 18 by 9 or 2 by one is I like to
call it as it probably should be called
the aspect ratio will change this got
Americans back to previous iPhone rumors
where it gets built up to be this was
amazing phone ever it's going to change
the world that ends up being announced
and it's just like another iPhones at
the home button removed or you can force
touch the screen I'm hoping that the
iPhone 8 is going to break that model
and that mold that we've seen in the
past four years and bring something
awesome to the table
Apple says millions of phones or iPhone
models from the best selling in the
world but at some point at some point
people are gonna start looking elsewhere
those folks that still buy iPhones and
dros and I'd be looking at the
competition looking at what the SAS A+
are gonna be looking at the g6 but look
at the competition and see something
awesome that they're going to want to
have so the good grace is the good will
of Apple I think that's potentially
fading other rumors you've heard that
could make the phone a big reason to buy
it the home button is going to be gone
the whole screen should in fact be the
home button well it's gonna be the
synaptics technology you've seen or
something different that could be a
killer feature it helps Apple reinvent
themselves other things we expect
wireless charging built-in better optics
and a thinner lighter design with
hopefully improved battery life and
quick charging I'm not trying to bash
Apple here people like to think I'm Pro
Apple or I hate Apple I'm Pro technology
I like to call a company and a product
out kind of as I see it regardless of
how I feel about them I kind of a TV
news format I want to just to talk about
it tell you guys maybe I'll expect the
curved display and also open discussion
you what's the killer feature you want
to have in the iPhone eight and the
eight by the way as a model expose it
gonna cost about a thousand dollars so
bear that in mind is not having a curved
screen like a galaxy s edge whatever
model number it's going to be is that
enough to deter you from from not buying
one or like the LG G six doesn't have to
be curved to look sexy trying to lose
some weight so I can say the same thing
let me know down below what's the killer
feature you want to have either stick
with the iPhone or to go back to the
iPhone or go to the iPhone for the first
time and for the comment of the day
after eating countless comments about
whether or not I look fat whether or not
I look tired whether or not where my
hairline is running to I'm picking a
good one make me feel good about myself
it's for missing light and water just as
your hot exclamation point I'm gonna
take it it's probably a spam account is
that to everybody but I'm still I'm
still gonna take it cuz I can feel good
about myself somedays thank you guys for
