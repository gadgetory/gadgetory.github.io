sang in from technobuffalo and today
we'll be checking out some of the new
changes in iOS 9 beta for now we've done
several videos showcasing some of the
newer features in Iowa sign so if you
guys haven't seen those yet make sure to
check that out over here with iOS 9
Apple is adding a bunch of new features
to build on iOS 8 with the addition of a
smarter Siri an all new news app and
true multitasking for the ipad iOS 9
brings a lot of cool features that
promise a more enjoyable experience
overall so let's go ahead and take a
look at what's change in iOS 9 beta for
one of the things that was missing in
the latest public version of iOS iOS 8.4
was apple's home sharing feature which
essentially allows you to share your
iTunes media library to your computers
in your house and iOS 9 beta for this
feature is now available just as Apple
promised in iOS 9 beta 3 we noticed that
there was a bug that prevented us from
using the volume buttons as a camera
shutter but thankfully that's been fixed
in beta for moving on inside of Apple
music pulling up information on a song
or an album you're now greeted with it
larger artwork additionally you can
easily heart a specific song or album
create a station and share moving on
apple's podcast app now supports a
picture-in-picture feature when playing
a video and multitasking on an ipad a
nice touch and makes a stronger case for
the ipad as a main productivity device
in iOS 9 apple also updated handoffs you
I instead of displaying a card along
with your other apps in the app switcher
there's now a banner that will pop up in
a bottom which you can either slide up
or tap to activate handoff now moving on
to the smaller changes in iOS 9 beta for
the notifications icon inside a Settings
app change from gray to read and I think
that looks nicer in my opinion now if we
go ahead and go into the spotlight
search settings there's now an option to
disable Bing web results moving on to
the Notification Center there are new
icons for the iPhone and Apple watch on
the battery widget now last but not
least Apple now allows users to turn off
quick access to Apple pay now when your
device is locked in iOS 9 there was a
feature that allowed users to get cards
or passes ready from the lock screen by
double clicking the home button now you
can revoke access completely when your
device is locked and that's about it if
there are any major changes in iOS 9
beta is we'll be sure to keep you guys
in a loop over at TechnoBuffalo calm and
if you guys enjoyed this video make
to give it a thumbs up and we will see
you guys in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
