TechnoBuffalo here in a previous video
we unbox this guy the world's first
curved phone the galaxy round spectra
spec it's almost identical to the Galaxy
Note 3 so I figured it made sense put
these two suckers head-to-head I'm not
gonna run through the usual head-to-head
stuff rant talk about app speed or
quadrant score this one's all about the
design and how this curve display either
improves hinders or just sort of neutral
for the overall experience of the phone
it's gonna get started alright so do
want to give a disclaimer out of the way
we just got the galaxy around it in the
office today so this obviously isn't a
full review or speed comparison this is
just focus on the design I always like
to give full disclosure so before we
talk about this crazy curved screen and
what it does or doesn't do let's start
with the back of the phones so Samsung
made a bit of a move from the previous
generation devices including the s4 of
having those flat plastic backs to give
it more of a textured fake leather feel
and it feels still very plastic and it's
very clearly still plastics or the fake
leather is nothing more than you know
facade I've got sort of the same thing
here on the galaxy round at least from
appearances it looks to be exactly the
same however you feel it feels very
different obviously hard to convey on
video since you don't have fuelie
YouTube videos yet
and I imagine what you guys would do if
we had them but it really feels much
better it's a more tactile type feel to
it and the material itself and pull off
the back is bit thicker it doesn't have
that easy Bend to it
and while I've got this back off see
that nice segue there we've got this
battery it's a flat battery it's a 2800
milliamp hour battery versus a 32
hundred million power battery and the
Galaxy Note 3 despite both of them
having 5.7 inch 1080p screens so what
Samsung did they pretty much
acknowledged battery life is not gonna
be overly awesome by shipping to
batteries in the box an external battery
charger so that should make life a bit
easier but because the battery has to be
flat the curve on the screen is really
really subtle if you look at the phone
straight on you can't even tell that
skirt withold to the side and you can
start to see it and you can feel it with
your finger as you go back and forth so
what does that curved screen give you
well first when you put it flat down on
a table you get a lot of flex and wrote
so you got to forget if you like that or
don't like that it I've not the curve
display it's worth it
the one thing the curve display does do
that samsung has really been touting is
quick notifications turn the phone on
its side if you hold this down and then
you go grab a cup of coffee and wait a
while I create notifications here that
they're gonna get gonna pop up you can
see what you've got for email or
messages missed phone calls and battery
life they're not interactive you can't
launch the applications that's right
there to let you know they exist
I do it on either side if you notice so
it doesn't happen instantaneously it
takes quite a while for us to queue up
to get it to finally show and sometimes
like right there doesn't always do it
try that one more time and then it'll
finally start to show what you have
right there so it is very neat it's very
helpful but the time it takes for it to
actually show up I wonder how much
quicker it beaters going this and see
what you've got but it is new and it's
there so you can decide whether or not
something that you want to use of course
the note 3 doesn't have any of that but
it does stay pretty stable on a flat
surface who else can hit the side
corners get a little bit of bounce but
no notifications when you go ahead and
do that the note 3 is also a very big
phones to put it in your pocket you know
it's usually pretty visible it's got a
really really big footprint without any
curves or it sticks out to the side
against the curvature of your leg with
the galaxy round though you've got that
curved display so it does sort of
contour to your thigh very very nicely
no matter how big or small your thighs
are there's no doubt this absolutely
feels better in your pocket so take
that's for what it's worth after
experience of the phone seem to be
exactly the same it's the same TouchWiz
with Android 4.3 that we've seen on
previous devices it's fast it's got a
Snapdragon 800 chip nothing really has
changed from the experience just it's
cool to hold a curved display it doesn't
feel much difference in your hand either
it does sort of contour to it on the
back but not by much so let me show you
what the contour looks like if you go
ahead it's probably the best way to show
it
take the phone and stack the Galaxy Note
3 right on top you come down right below
you can really start to see what that
curve looks like in hell that it's a
very very subtle and I probably would
say that's because of that flat battery
I'd assume now that Samsung has
technology to make curved batteries that
will see a much more pronounced curve on
a phone whether that's more useful or
not you know that is yet to be seen
other than that that is really
that much difference between the galaxy
round and the Galaxy Note 3 aside for
the fact that the round comes with 30
gigs of internal storage and is
significantly more expensive to buy but
if you guys are interested in the phone
or you want to see what it looks like
you know certainly check out our friends
at Negri electronics they're the ones
that got us the device they have
everything unlocked and they have pretty
much every phone you could think of them
it's a really good source to get
everything that you need from the world
of electronics over all over for such
impressions the Galaxy rounder it's
really cool and it's sort of a novelty
to see I've never seen a phone looks
like this doesn't add anything more very
useful doesn't take away from the phone
you the dough so that's something there
it's you want something that's new
that's sort of no one else is going to
have the galaxy around is definitely
gonna be that for you because it's
probably on eight of these in the US but
if you live in South Korea have a chance
to actually pick it up from SK Telecom
yeah that might be different it's nice
when I rush out to go use it probably
not I don't know if the trade-off in
battery is worse or that cool factor but
you're not determine that for yourself
and Reax let me know you think I'd love
to hear your comments on the galaxy
round leave them right down below until
