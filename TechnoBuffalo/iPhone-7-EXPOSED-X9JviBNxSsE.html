more leaks rumors and alleged name
changes and we've seen in any years past
we've seen the iphone 7 iphone 7 plus
iphone 7 pro rumors leaked we've even
seen the iphone 6s ii but looks like
we're finally getting a sense of what
Apple's going to unveil allegedly at a
sep tember 16th event phone leaker
efflux has been on a tear with iPhone
news recently and what we're looking at
is supposedly codenamed Sonora or what
we're gonna know it as the iphone 7 the
iphone 7 plus is going to be codenamed
dos palos which loosely translates the
two sticks or a city and merced two
sticks probably referring to the two
camera set up we're going to see on the
iphone 7 plus sent to us allegedly from
one of apple's factories in Shenzhen
China we have a dummy unit of the iphone
7 and it looks about what we'd expect
from recent models so they walk you
through everything about the phone what
we know what we don't know what this
dummy units going to tell us
dimensionally this is almost identical
to the iphone 6s meeting same with same
4.7 inch screen size same resolution at
13 34 x 750 what's different though is
on the back the other see antenna bands
have now moved to almost be hidden along
the top and the bottom if you tilt the
phone you can still clearly see them the
cameras where we're going to see a lot
of changes currently sits at a 12
megapixel sensor we've heard rumors of a
16 megapixel sony made sensor can be
nestled into that camera hump bigger
pixels gonna mean better pictures and of
course better low-light visibility we're
also expecting storage to increase up to
256 gig so a lot of storage on the phone
was interesting the width is exactly the
same as the outgoing model but according
to on leaks we should see about a
fourteen percent battery bump from the
outgoing 6s that should go from 1715
million powers to 1960 well there been a
ton of varying rumors about the next
generation iphones one thing's been
consistent and that is the lack of a 3.5
millimeter headset jack and this dummy
units certainly confirms that in its
place we now have stereo speakers and
presumably in the box you're going to be
getting a 3.5 millimeter to lightning
adapter zinc reflecting reports whether
or not it's going to include with
lightning headphones in the box or even
wireless headphones in the box my bet
though is gonna get the same year
cause we've seen for generations on end
to the Apple wants you to plug into an
adapter other rumors look to be debunked
with this dummy unit the profiles which
is still here not going away anytime
soon and we also still have a physical
depressive Oh home button doesn't look
to be flush at least for this generation
it looks like a lot of the bigger
upgrades are going to be reserved for
the iphone 7 plus that's where the dual
cameras are going to live that's where
we might see a smart connector if there
is a flush home button that presumably
be where it's going to be we've heard
all those rumors were going to be on an
iphone 7 pro it looks like we're only
gonna have two models again everything
that was reserved for the pro is going
to go to the plus line early in the year
we had a look at an iphone 7 case and
this phone fits perfectly into that as
well so i think what we're looking at is
a final design for the iphone 7 you guys
want to see more on the iphone 7 get the
video a thumbs up that'll let us know
that you want to see it until next time
i'm jon rettinger from techno Buffalo
Calf you guys next video and I want to
give a big shout out to the folks at
beefs town for sending us to physical
dummy unit linked down below check them
