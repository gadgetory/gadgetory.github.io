here I want to give you a head-to-head
comparison of the iPhone 3GS versus the
iPhone 3G both are running the most
updated versions of OS 3.0 I'm going to
show you calendar speed SMS feed stock
speed screen rotation browser speed on
both 3G and Wi-Fi I'm going to show you
what you get with the 3GS that you don't
get with the 3G so you can decide which
device is right for you or if it's
worthwhile to upgrade so the application
I use quite a bit sock so let me go
ahead and open up both of these soft
applications and will see the speed in
which both of them load so put stocks
right there and right there going to at
the same time iPhone 3GS loaded much
quicker and these are both over the
exact same Wi-Fi network you can see
that the 3GS pulled it up much much much
much quicker and they're still both
receiving the data tick them a little
bit a long time to receive the data but
this is the first time the 3GS and the
3G have actually used this so we will go
to the next application inside the 3GS
certainly one there let's go ahead and
look to calendar another application
that I use quite a bit so I'll open up
both at the same time once again the 3GS
was noticeably quicker nothing drastic
maybe half a second to a second but it
still was much quicker so let's try
screen rotation next and let's try
screen rotation on let's go to notepad
for example so let me go ahead and open
up a new note and let me open up a new
note here as well okay so we both have
new notes open on each and let's check
out the screen rotation zoom out just a
bit so you can get the full effect there
we go and again 3GS 3G
3gs was noticeably quicker there let's
try it going into portrait mode that was
little bit closer for the 3GS still one
let's try it one more time once again
the 3GS is still quicker okay so next
let's load Google Maps something I use
quite a bit let's see which one is
quicker with these two as well it
certainly seems to be a trend that the
3GS is living up to the s in its name
and that loaded much faster and there
goes the 3G and close both of those now
one of the big things people are
wondering about are internet speeds
now both phones are running on the same
ATT's HSDPA 3G network and both are now
currently using the same Wi-Fi network
let's compare browser speed using the
same Wi-Fi let's see if the increase in
processor speed actually results in real
world speed so I'm going to go ahead and
load the exact same website on each okay
so both devices have full Wi-Fi strength
and I've got a website queued up on each
ready to go so let's go ahead and hit go
at exactly the same time or as close as
I can get and we'll see which one wins
we are loading at pocketnow.com on each
and it appears at 3GS is noticeably
quicker on Wi-Fi I'm gonna have that
results in just processor speed and the
3GS is already done both over the same
Wi-Fi network while the 3G is still I
wouldn't say struggling to load but it's
definitely a little bit slower to load
and there it goes just finishes up so
there really was a very noticeable
difference and one thing that I love
about the iPhone is the browser but one
thing I also noticed that when I scroll
down very quickly sometimes I get the
black and white checkered bars right
there it takes longer to scroll down
let's see if that's the same case on the
iPhone 3G if I can scroll faster than it
can load the page nope I screw it all
the way down all the way back up and
it's data right with it it's like that
is a direct result of the increased
processor
and RAM so now let's try running the
same test both times now over 3G so I'm
going to turn Wi-Fi off on each phone
okay so Wi-Fi is turned off on each so
we've got full five bars on both phones
same network strengths on each of 3G
we're going to load exactly the same
webpage so it's got exactly the same
files in memory and let's see if it's
any faster over 3G and you would expect
that maybe we'll get the same results
even though we're running on the same
network
perhaps the faucet faster processor will
result in increased load times
go ahead go at the same time again and
we're off let's see if the s in 3G s
lives up to its name and again this is
3G speed and we are already seeing a
noticeable difference with the 3G s
already finishing loading the page and
the 3G is still loading and we're done
on the 3G s the 3G is still loading the
page there comes a side bar still going
so there really is a very very
noticeable difference on 3G let's see if
that same scrolling issue occurs if I
can scroll faster than it shows up you
can see it's blue there and the 3G s is
loaded in no problem which was quite
interesting actually so let's try this
test at least over 3G on one more web
page and we'll load engadget.com on each
okay so one more test over 3G and
certainly your 3G network strength and
signal is going to vary from location to
location but you can't see in the exact
same place on the exact same network
what the speed difference is and maybe
that pocket now as we just did was a
fluke so let's try it again on a
different website let go at the same
time and we're off
and once again the 3GS is noticeably
quicker pulling up engadget.com
you can already scroll through and start
reading the page on each this is a
pretty graphic intensive or relatively
graphic intensive a lot of pictures on
it decent amount of text
looks like the 3G caught up that's taken
a little bit of a lead the 3GS is sold a
little bit and in that this test it
looks like a 3G actually one which is
quite interesting the 3GS is still
loading looks like it's getting close to
finishing up so that was very
interesting the 3GS took a really early
lien load the image is much quicker but
the 3G caught up that's like something
to keep in mind although I will say that
in my experience since I've had the
phone for a couple hours now the 3GS
does load pages notice a bit quicker
perhaps a few exceptions and this is
definitely one of them so I don't
fairness I'm glad you guys got a chance
to see that so let me show you some of
the things that you get with the 3GS
that you don't get with 3G plug it back
to the homescreen and the first in one
of the most notable things other than
the speed and allegedly increase battery
life is the addition of a magnetic
compass so let me show you guys what
that looks like where did I put the
compass there we go
compass you can see that as I move
around it tells me what direction I'm
facing and just have a lot of uses for
things like Google Maps so that is quite
nice the next thing that you're going to
get with the 3GS over the 3G is the
voice option so let me show you what
that looks like and I'll do further
demos of each of these in subsequent
videos this is voice commands you hold
down the home button and you've got just
a ton of voice control actually the
controls that you can say are scrolling
by you can say dial pause the music
control already music right from here
and like I said I will do more videos
demoing voice control and the next and
perhaps most important I would say is
the camera and now camcorder options so
this uses a three megapixel autofocus
camera so I pull this up let's say I
want to take a picture of the 3G right
there if I tap the screen it will auto
focus right on the screen if I move a
little bit closer and I want to focus on
it tap the screen and it'll auto focus
and picture
do look noticeably better than they do
on a 3G the Apple really optimized the 3
megapixel sensor put this down here you
notice on the right hand side I've got a
little switch now where I can switch
over to camcorder mode and this morning
I put up a sample of what video
recording looks like on the iPhone 3GS
you can check that if you want to see
the quality but here is the interface
it's very least you can turn it from
portrait to landscape and a lot of
adjust and it's relatively simple you
hit the record button and you just
record and you hit stop and you're done
and it keeps all of your video and I'll
show you really archived right as it
would with all your pictures which is
quite neat so here's my camera roll with
some pictures and if I go let's say
there's a screencap idea of a game I was
playing and I scroll over here I am now
at the video and you got to play and
then go ahead and just hit slow and I
will say that video quality and you can
check out the sample that I did is very
nice or any rivals I would say the flip
minnow not the flip Mino HD with the
regular minnow as far as quality goes
and audio fidelity was actually really
good so one thing that I've noticed
about the 3GS I will also say this may
just be me that speaker seems a little
bit louder on the 3GS as well and it
guys wanted to give you a head Ted
comparison of the iPhone 3GS versus the
3G if you want to upgrade you are going
to get increased speed and really going
to see it in web time web load times and
application load times although there
will certainly be exceptions to that
like we saw with engadget.com
but overall if you're due for an upgrade
I think the 3GS is a great way to go
although if I wasn't due for an upgrade
now it's thinking about it you know you
might have to think twice about paying
the really steep price for the 3GS hope
you enjoy it for exclusive content be
sure to follow me on twitter twitter.com
slash jon for lakers you can ask me all
kinds of iphone questions over there
I'll put a link in the sidebar hope you
guys enjoyed and I'll see you in the
next video bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
