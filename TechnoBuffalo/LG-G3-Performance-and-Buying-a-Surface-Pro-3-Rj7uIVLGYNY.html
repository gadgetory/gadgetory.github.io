to you by Dollar Shave Club well it's up
everyone jon rettinger from
TechnoBuffalo here and i wish i had a
dollar for every time I've said that
welcome to that purse owed of ask the
Buffalo this to show you can ask me any
question you've got from technology
outside technology personal questions
family questions whatever it might be
i'll do my best to answer them as
honestly as I know how to up this week
though it's all question tough to about
tech we're going to talk about the
surface pro 3 we're going to talk about
these crazy new prime devices coming
from Samsung and HTC from galaxy note 4
sprinkled in for flavor and we're going
to wrap it all together with a delicious
LG g3 is that's the Buffalo let's start
asking the Buffalo so our first question
comes from I guess the entire country
croatia hey john vink the surface pro 3
could be considered a great laptop for
college maybe even professional use
thanks yes absolutely it's got a core i7
chip it does some integrated graphics so
don't that you're going to do some
hardcore 3d rendering or can wait a long
time for video editing but yes
absolutely it can serve as a complete
laptop replacement it's fast scalable
it's light I'm not gonna say inexpensive
but it is a very capable machine now
I've got the touch panel on it it's 12
inches it's got that new type cover it's
got the new trackpad yes one hundred
percent yes I do we've got in the office
we're testing it right now I'm so far i
really liked what I've seen I was a big
fan of surface pro 2 but smaller screen
size on that guy I think you'll be very
happy with the surface pro 3 our next
question comes from Eric T who asks hey
John the battery life and performance
will be ok on the LG g3 even with the
qhd screen so first Eric if the rumors
are true it does have a qhd screen
rumors also say it's going to have a
three thousand million power battery and
I really doubt HTC to these phone that
has a battery left to last like six
minutes so I would say yes you will have
least a day's battery life baby end of
the day you'll be kicking around 10-20 I
would wager they're gonna make a big
deal about power
saving mode because probably going to
eat it but I think you'd be able to get
through one day which is really what
most people do is plug in at night I
think it should be interesting to see
though what effect that qhd actually has
and screens really take up the most
juice from the phone me they got battery
saving things put in it I don't know
where I would wager that you're gonna
have plenty of juice in there next
question comes from peace Ellie's 8 who
asks at John for lakers I think about
development of prime devices and what
does this mean for the regular flagship
hashtag asked the bee I go back and
forth nice prime devices man I love that
they're pushing the envelope that
they're these crazy high end phones what
these awesome specs but as far as I can
tell is that what flash chips are
supposed to be and why go through and
make such a big deal about you know the
galaxy s5 is the best phone ever the HTC
One m8 the greatest thing ever while
like clearly knowing that a few months
later going to be something that's way
better I think its consumer I think it's
confusing to the consumer it's confusing
to us and I don't understand it if you
want released a flagship device your
Lisa flagship device with your best
specs then release under that
subsequently that's what's worked in the
past I don't know but maybe I'm wrong
maybe I'm outdated perhaps this new
prime model would be sort of the new
paradigm going forward I haven't seen
you have bunted yet I'd assume that
Samsung going to see a be the first one
to release their prime devices but I'm
personally not a fan before I jump to
next question look at his face you're
probably thinking you sir are very pale
and your face looks very engrossed these
that's when I think my wife thinks it
does i hate to shave you guys watch my
videos for years you know that it is
true i don't not go to like the look i
just really don't like to shave i think
buying razors did gigantic pain in the
butt you and it sounds with me sound
lazy but it's true Evans get in the car
you go to the store you gotta find the
kid in high schools working there and
get the key and you got a shell out just
a stupid amount of money for some
unnecessary razor tech a member I for
started to shave it worked fine before
it started to vibrate and then I'm
worried I'm just going to cut myself
anyway especially around in this region
fortunately the home there's a company
of doing away with all that ridiculous
silliness and asinine baloney and it's
cold Dollar Shave Club on it really
couldn't be any easier for just a few
bucks a month
shave club ships pretty awesome razors
and other bathroom miscellaneous
sundries right to your door and their
blades are just as good as those big
expensive shaved companies at a fraction
of the price they've got all the shaving
things you need including dr. Carver
it's easy shea butter to make your shave
even more buttery smooth get rid of this
you go from like this to like this this
to this this is what you want smooth and
silky or like my 8 month old babies face
it's so soft you could have that to save
time save money join now at Dollar Shave
Club calm / check the Buffalo again
that's Dollar Shave Club coms by shaking
the Buffalo it's really really good
product and you have to go anywhere to
get it which is even more awesome check
them out our next question comes from no
ngr n16 on twitter who asked at john for
lakers i currently own a galaxy s3 is
worth upgrading to the note 3 at this
time of the year so deftly worth
upgrading you've skipped a generation
you skip the s4 it is definitely good
time to upgrade but not to the note 3
note for room is already starting to hit
if your phone still working are gonna be
best to do to wait until august when
traditionally we've seen the next
iteration of the notes launch even got
announced a few years back so if you
want to wait i would wait for the note 4
if you need to phone right away maybe
yours diet or something i might want to
consider investing in like a moto e or
moto x one of the lower expensive phones
sort of hold over for a few months to
sell that and pick up a note for if
that's feasible for you I mean that's
gonna be your best bet obviously the
note 3 though will certainly get a big
discount as well come August so if you
have your heart set on that note 3 wait
a few more months probably get a nice
flash off that price pull it up into
your question if you won't have a
question feature an upcoming episode of
ask the Buffalo we make it stupid easy
every Tuesday I technobuffalo calm this
article that says ask the Buffalo call
