California it's like steppin tradeshow
close by and I'm really excited for this
year's show because I'm actually looking
to get a new console i sat out buying
one last year I wanted to see what
public Scorpio was going to end up being
I moved the past few months I bought my
first 4k TV so I was really paying close
attention to which one was going to be
right for me and I start doing research
on which one I wanted to buy as I
watched so need to Microsoft keynotes I
realized that maybe I'm not alone maybe
you guys want to buy a new console - I'm
not really a hardcore gamer I casually
like to play games I use my console a
lot for media streaming so maybe you're
like me maybe you're more hardcore
gaming but either way this I made my
decision for which console to buy let me
run through everything so price
determining factor ps4 Pro it's 399 you
can walk into a store right now pick one
up put in your bag go home start playing
tonight or or maybe like an hour from
now depending on where you live I don't
know product scorpio is now called Xbox
one x-x-x bunks gonna set you back just
shy a $500 which was I believe the
original Xbox one launch price but I
won't be available until November so you
got to wait and even then I'll probably
be in short supply you're gonna have to
fight some fights and parents for
Christmas gift
it's not gonna be available until later
on the year which is a big thing it's
not a game now November is very far away
I know for a lot of you guys game
exclusives are the big determining
factor for which console you buy you
don't care which one it is long it's got
the games you want of course both offer
the typical cross-platform things like
Madden NBA 2k Call of Duty battlefield
so a ton of exclusives especially on the
Sony side it's a ps4 Pro was announced
last year we've spent a lot of time
there keynote focusing on games they
also announced some exclusives earlier
in the year you got things like des
stranding got a Ford Gran Turismo Last
of Us is a privately badass looking
spider-man game and new DLC for
Uncharted
Microsoft's less exclusive games at
least right now things like for the
crackdown in a new state of decay of
course other games like new Halo
presumably coming Halo Wars - and I
loved original Halo Wars I think I might
have been the only one but those sort of
Microsoft staples of course will be
there as well so both our offer of
course
arcade gaming and HDR support the xbox
1x the ps4 beat though in most of the
spec department specially raw spectra
kind of guess you would expect because
it's almost a year newer both consoles
feature octa-core processor the Xbox one
is clocked a little bit higher at 2.3 vs
2.1 on the ps4 pro nominal but it is
there so it comes to membrane that's a
big deal for games on it certainly now
but sort of later on in the compost life
span the Xbox one 1x has 12 gigs of DDR
5 the ps4 pro has 8 gigs of that same
ddr5 both consoles shipped at least
right now with one terabyte of internal
storage but if you just plug in a lot of
external hard drive options expand that
if you need so physical media I don't
know where you guys fall on it whether
it's dead to you where you still collect
them I've got some older blu-rays my
wedding movies on blu-ray so I like to
have it but it's not a deciding factor
and so Sara Lee but oddly the ps4 pro
can't support any of the new generation
blu-ray so the 4k and HDR blu-ray will
not play on the ps4 pro even though Sony
is one of the heads of the blu-ray
consortium the Xbox one X in their hands
can play any blu-ray you can find put it
in 4k gr and it'll play so that may
factor into your decision so if you're
coming from a legacy console you've got
a Xbox 360 or ps3 or older backwards
compatibility might be something you
want to consider so putting a physical
disk in the ps4 Pro from any other
generation console is not going to work
Xbox 1x different story support some
Xbox 360 games even going to support our
original Xbox games that list should be
growing but you don't know the full list
right now so we are interesting one to
talk about maybe your team sells bar I
think VR is the future or maybe you're
like Richard Hendricks you think it's a
fad I'm not sure where you guys are on
that but a VR is what you guys are
looking for
but edition floor is going to be your
only choice it offers a really
well-rounded VR experience games are
already available it works well it's
pretty immersive and you can pick it up
today we know Microsoft's going to do
for VR assumably it'll be something but
as of right now
they don't have anything and not an
option what I want to get to a
conclusion take its way decided because
I'm I'm excited so the Xbox one X
certainly works done so 100 bucks is not
anything to scoff at like I said on bit
more of a casual gamer than a hardcore
gamer most of what I use my console
stores as a media streamer so I like the
ability to play any type of blu-ray so
that it's active by 4k blu-rays or not
in the Xbox one I also have a lot of
Xbox one accessories from my original
Xbox want to use those same controllers
with it fact I prefer the way the
controller feels of the Xbox one and now
the Xbox one X so for me I'm going to
wait I'm gonna wait until November I'm
going to pick up an Xbox one X and be
pretty damn excited about it what do you
guys think maybe I'm in minority of sort
of being a casual gamer announcer as
hardcore I know maybe you guys are PC
master-race I want to know tell me why
hope you guys enjoy a three coverage I
love this time of year just fun sort of
season your stuff coming out it makes me
happy and I enjoy it anyway again
comment down below if you guys enjoy to
III coverage I'm John reading your
