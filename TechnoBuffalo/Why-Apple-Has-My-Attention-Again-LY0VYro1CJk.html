the world's online leading password
manager so as we come up to the iPhone 8
announcement I feel like it's time to
talk a little bit about Apple before you
groan again I want to give a bit of a
history so I actually owe my career to
Apple all my early videos were Apple
focus whether it was my first video
talking about the Santa Rosa MacBook Pro
or spending way more time that I should
talk about the little nipple scroll ball
on the former Mighty Mouse apples what
got me started in industry I love the
products the innovation that went along
with it the fact there was a forefront
of new technologies I loved what Apple
was doing around with the iPhone 6 I
started to kind of lose interest in what
Apple was doing despite you guys say in
the comments I like what I like at a
time I don't really have much of a brand
Allegiance my phone time since the
iPhone 6 and split between Samsung
splits between LG HTC s and one plus is
that Google made devices and sometimes
back to Apple but I don't have a brand
that I have to choose or I feel legions
to and I need to use I kind of just like
what's good for me at the time the past
few years that hasn't been abom other
than lacking things I think other
manufacturers have had things like
wireless charging which is very
important to me quick charging
previously water resistance and a high
resolution screen to name a few you look
now it's er the flagship Pantheon it's
very design a style centric you've got a
device like the galaxy s 8 which is
mostly all screen when you look at what
the iPhone has it's got that giant chin
it's got a big button to reminiscent as
for the pixel design which to my eye
does not look that good it is actually
important for me when I pick a phone so
it's kind of gravitated away from apples
but enter the iPhone 8 at least the
rumours of the iPhone 8 is supposed to
be and that passion love and excitement
is kind of being rekindled the first
design I love that Apple is finally
moving forward with that screen to body
ratio of close to 90% it looks
absolutely gorgeous I don't mind if they
have to serve the cutout on top for the
earpiece make it looks really good the
touch ID when it came out I think was
pretty revolutionary and how fast and
well it worked but it's held back
without particular design because it had
to be on the front so some mock-ups and
renders
touch ID on the back I've had it going
away using faith in the screens I'm of
the mindset the touch ID is going to
migrate to the back of the phone for
argument's sake on a pursuing that's
going to be gone an applicant relying on
Anastasia recognition system allegedly
going to be called space ID if Apple is
relying on face ID enough to take away
touch ID it better be damn good I think
it's going to be it's got to work in all
different conditions gotta work in
direct sunlight it's got to work in
low-light with sunglasses on with
glasses on ones legs flat on a table if
it can do that if it can do that really
well
Apple will be revolutionary again as a
new technology you know we've seen iris
scanning we've seen other facial
recognition systems they never worked
that well it worked desc flawlessly if
Apple is so confident they're going to
remove touch ID for face ID that says a
lot
no it doesn't work going to be a huge
disappointment probably a big still
disappointment for Apple I'm starting to
get jazzed about what Apple is going to
do to design such exponent Apple going
back to their roots I think it's gonna
be a really cool device and one that
might actually bring me back to Apple
I'm not cool I do miss IMS its kind of
fixing that always have got me back to
Apple in previous years
I think if Apple pulls off this phone if
it's got an OLED screen it's going to
out Samsung in a display front which is
not easy to do if it ups the resolution
to qHD it should look gorgeous it's got
the rich true tone display pictures are
going to pop text is going to look great
I'm starting so you can see them trying
to get excited about it you're probably
wondering great John like I don't care
what you gotta say about this but
instead of conversations we have around
the office I want to know if I'm alone I
know a lot of folks have left Apple me a
lot of folks have come back to Apple you
guys in the same boat are you waiting on
your phone sister so you're waiting on a
galaxy update and reading out a note 8
to see what Apple does it already made
up your mind you're going to leave or
made up your mind or you're going to
stick with Apple leave a comments down
below before we end this video I want to
thank LastPass for sponsoring it and
making it possible I'm incredibly
forgetful a multiply one that's been
hacked in the past
so having laptop man in my password
relieves all that anxiety I've got a lot
of log in for stuff a LastPass
automatically filled in with web browser
extensions there's a desktop app there's
a mobile app stores have my past
with me for example I was the first one
in the opposite of the day it's got my
key card with me and I used my key to
unlock our door and the alarm is armed
never going to put my password was able
to open up black cat find my password
and put it into the alarm system before
the alarm went off all in about 25
seconds so if you got a hard time
remembering passwords or use the same
password for everything like a lot of
you guys do the last task will help it
can create passwords for you to generate
passwords with some parameters that you
want
it's cross-platform we're fun everything
that you want to be on whether you're on
Windows whether you're on Mac or Android
or iOS there's an extension or a
dedicated app it's going to work for you
you want to keep yourself secure and
you're just worried about your passwords
or you wanted a versified sort of what
you use to keep yourself to cure
LastPass is a really great way to go I
trust my information to them and you
guys should give it a shot as well I
want to learn more we'll link to them
down below so iPhone 8 what do you guys
think again I want to hear your thoughts
on it thank you again to LastPass for
sponsoring this video even the comments
down below let me know if you're excited
again for the IFO day if you're coming
back to Apple's camp until next time
John rende you're from TechnoBuffalo
