technobuffalo here i am just back from
the google event they took the wraps off
their latest phones the really not very
surprising 5 x + 6 piece and so suckers
have been leaked and rumored for many
many many moons I've been getting a ton
of questions about things from build
quality to camera at a fingerprint
sensor it's not as making videos giving
my thoughts and impressions on both
devices let's jump right in let's start
with the Big Daddy the 6p so here my
general thoughts and again I only had a
few minutes employer that will give more
thoughts and impressions will actually
get them in our offices to test first
all three colors look awesome if I was
ordered one myself I would just close my
eyes and just like pick one and order
they all look great no color I don't
think look better or worse other than
the other they all looked and felt
awesome picking up how they felt the
metal body feels really good I had kind
of an HTC esque feel to it it was
incredibly thin but just waited enough
surprised me with that camera hump I
didn't feel the very top heavy eaters
I'm gonna complain that I've got I was
devices in the leaks of the 6p it looked
like that camera hump was huge and in
the pictures the device look very ugly
in person though it's a totally
different story the slope of the camera
is very gradual tongue like an angle
where it's a big right angle at the
giant hump I'd gradually hardly even
notice it and I was actually really
surprised I was not a fan of how I
thought it was going to look from the
leaks seeing in person was totally
different you could appreciate how thin
and tiny it is while still having a
giant battery and a qhd screen it was
all very impressive and speaking of the
screen it looked really good out there
stood a few fly away phones but the
major manufacturers I've tested their
phones the least it's really just four
players in the US market over the past
few years so I know it's expected their
screens I looked really nice I played
video I browse websites the whites like
really white the colors looks true and
things look very very bright I'm the
kind of guy you'd like to turn my
brightness up almost all the way I did
it on the 6p turned down a little bit
because it was almost too bright the
fingerprint sensor on the back I don't
know how big a fan of I am I tried it
and I used it and it worked really well
it worked as fast as
Google was advertising they're calling
it Nexus imprint but the fingerprint
sensor so it worked very well I'm just
not sure how I feel about the placement
on back for a few reasons first cases i
know that google selling some cases up
on the google store but how is that
going to work the case is going to have
it obviously the cases has a thickness
in it you have to push down almost
through that case to get your finger on
it so that is to be determined but it
did work well and it works very fast as
fast as a new touch ID on the 6s and 6s
plus in case you're wondering what you
want to measure it measure from I do
think the fingerprint sensors on the
current crop of Samsung devices so the
note 5 and the s6 edge+ are very fast as
well these new ones 0 wer we're
definitely faster one thing I couldn't
test while i was there was a camera so I
couldn't get the pictures off the phone
onto a computer it's only had just a few
minutes there so I don't know the answer
to that yet I got a ton of questions
about camera two point three megapixel
sensor certainly high enough in the
megapixel apartment we're disappointed
about no oh is Allah cugel was really
hot to trot about the size those pixels
like gigantic pixels would supposedly
alleviate the knee throw is but we'll
see when we get it in the offices I
think pricing is really good like
they're going up to 128 this boy looks
almost edge-to-edge you're getting a 5.7
inch display looks like a 5.5 inch
package so yeah that was really nice
they showed a diagram next to an iphone
6s plus you can certainly see the
difference so you're getting a bigger
screen size and it looked really nice
for me if I was gonna order 1 i'd go 6p
and I was pretty sure I was going to do
a 5x when I went into the event so hats
off to fall away and Google for creating
a really nice phone one last bit that I
want to mention about the six kids and
some rumors no wireless charging no
wireless charging as of now you can't do
wireless charging through meadow at
least on a consumer release technology
does supposedly exist but that's not on
the consumer phone yet so that's not
there a USBC is nice it does have USBC
fast charging a lot of people were
asking about that so fast charging is
there a know if it's Qualcomm standard
or something new because it is running
the a-10 but it's there
wireless chardy on the 5x front I would
make family original Nexus 5 like pretty
much everybody was the 1080p screen
looks really good in person it looks
really good in person didn't look qhd
it's sort of a sharpeners crisp but
looked as good as some of the best 1080p
screens that are at out there right now
so don't worry you know how the screens
gonna look LG does a really nice job the
phones felt really nice they'll feel
very familiar if you use the original
Nexus 5 it feels almost like that
there's a bit more of a soft touch
texture to the plastic Baxter's posted
the smoothness they had on the original
Nexus 5 that's the only Reno real
difference I like the batteries a little
bit bigger I think that should certainly
help marshmallows doze mode is certainly
going to help improve battery life USBC
is nice it's a fast charging I could not
get confirmation on wireless charging
though but I'm led to believe it is not
there so again bear that in mind total
point three megapixel sensor and
fortunate I couldn't test on the Nexus 5
I saw with colors I was not a fan of
that mint cream color in person it's a
new color for a phone but walking to
order one I would probably not look at
the at that one so any bear that in mind
as you guys decide which phone you want
to get I did not get much time though to
test marshmallow unfortunately safer to
sing what the Easter egg was but was
there it looked good look quick i'm
excited for doze which actually will
sort of almost shut down sure go into
low power mode we're not using apps when
you're sleeping or phone to just from
sitting idle he should get a big
improved battery life one other software
tweak that i saw on the 6p also that i
couldn't confirm on the 5x it almost has
Motorola's ambient display so if you
wave your hand over to shake the phone
it will sort of give notifications and
time and stuff on it so I was kind of a
cool addition that Google and hallway
added some weight those are my thoughts
on the phones there are really nice
improvements easier to hold then the
curtain X is six if you want a bigger
phone on the 6p side the 5x if you like
the Nexus 5 you know exact oh you're
going to get same fingerprint sensor it
worked fast as well just like the 6p and
it's a little bit newer version of the
neck
five I wish there's more than two gigs
of ram and our two gigs is plenty for
right now if you can use a phone for two
years you know I think that's two gigs
is going to be the lowest that's
acceptable so I'd like to pad at least
three and like you've also had four gigs
in the 6p but did not happen and I
hopefully this will help you guys
decided with not you want to upgrade or
not upgrade there's a lot of other
options out there especially for those
price points i know people looking at
the Moto X and cross shopping that with
16 you get expandable storage with the
Moto X so bear that in mind decide
what's most important for you guys and I
think you're watching hope you enjoyed
your finest your hands on with both the
phones I will link to them i will put
annotations up so you guys can click
right over to them anyway the next time
