from TechnoBuffalo here and I want to
give you a demonstration of the new HDR
functionality built into iOS 4.1 for the
iPhone 4 if you might remember HDR
stands for a high dynamic range
essentially it takes three pictures one
underexposed one overexposed and one
normal and combines them into one
supposedly better looking image this is
not going to be present on the iPod
Touch unfortunately no matter what
version of software you have HDR is not
present there but let's go ahead and see
if it even makes a difference alright so
for our test subject I am dog-sitting so
please meet Betsy she is a sleeping
sleeping beagle who is going to be our
subject so first you do have some new
settings here if you jump on into
settings and go to photos you'll see
where it talks about the high dynamic
range pictures tell us a little bit
about what it does blends the best part
of three separate exposures into a
single photo awesome or not awesome
we'll see you can choose to either keep
the normal photo and the HDR or just
keep the HTR for this test we're gonna
go ahead and keep the normal so we'll go
ahead and hop on into camera you're
gonna get a new option at the top that's
going to say HDR on that's letting you
know that HDR is on that doesn't mean
turn it on sort of confusing
alright so there is Betsy I'm going to
go ahead and snap a picture I'm pretty
normal light it's gonna take a bit
longer than usual to take the image so
it's saving HDR let's go ahead and see
if it made any sort of difference
whatsoever so there is the HDR image
that's not actually watermark on the
picture itself if we're to print it just
on your iPhone so you can tell which one
is the HDR there's HDR image and there's
a regular image looks a little bit
better
not necessarily that much better let's
try taking one more so go back to camera
I'm gonna get up nice and close to Betsy
and see if that's gonna make a
difference
Betsy
okay so that's saved it let's go ahead
and see you Thursday me should have
difference there so there is the HDR
image it actually looks pretty good
and there's a regular image this one you
can actually see a difference in I can
see the different colorations on our fur
on her nose pretty clearly and seems
sort of the granular hairs on our head
on the regular image you can still see a
difference in the color on our muzzle
but it's not quite as vibrant and you
lose some of the resolution on top of
her head kind of interesting I love both
of these pictures up after the video so
you can take a look and you guys can
decide about whether or not you think
the HDR technology is going to be worth
it for you or not
by comparison purposes you saw how
quickly the pictures how long it took to
take the pictures with HDR it's much
much quicker to each year I've turned
off you want to snap a quick image
you're gonna want to turn that off so I
just turned it off take a picture Betsy
much much faster and your guys stay
tuned to see all those full images I'm
John render from TechnoBuffalo and say
hi to Betsy because you may see her in a
few more videos bye bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
