fleet of cars so the s and the X aside
from just an insane amount of instant
torque is there essentially giant
gadgets and like your phone or tablet
get software updates over the air that
will enable new features the folks at
electric co of the scoop on Tesla's
latest software update 8-point oh it's
bringing a ton of new features as well
as a UI overhaul let's start with one of
the best I think the test last offer and
that is autopilot not familiar with
autopilot it's kind of like level 3
autonomous driving means you got to stay
alert but if you just driving on the
freeway the car can pretty much do all
the driving for you if you want to
change lanes put the signal up or down
and will change one lane / left or right
a limitation though the current hardware
was that it could not exit freeways for
you worry not a lipstick with software
eight point Oh put your signal on and
the car will know there's an exit coming
I will actually take that exit for you
how it's going to stop I don't know they
cannot currently recognize stop lights
or stop signs hopefully it's got a
follow car so it'll know to stop
otherwise those exits for you let's put
your foot on the brake to come to a stop
on the UI side as well autopilot getting
some updates currently the UI for
autopilot you can only see the back of
the cars that are near you with the
update 8 point 0 allegedly you be able
to see the full degree of the car
depending on where you are so if you're
next to a car it'll look like you're
next to a car for cars behind you you
will see the front of it and so forth we
shall see improvements how autopilot
works Tesla uses fleet learning so the
more people use it the better it's going
to get mosley it will hover more the
middle of the road is supposed to
hugging the current right side of lane
which it does right now we should also
see big UI improvements as well as a
Tesla the current gen seven point O is a
dca overhaul but it wasn't giant this
updates make things look completely
different the biggest one should be in
math and navigation that's what's moving
a lot of updates to navigation let you
re route to avoid toll road or different
supercharger locations it should also
give you much more on the go planning
for charging and destination charging
while Tesla users in Europe if it access
to a Spotify app for quite a while folks
in the u.s. still won't get that with
eight point 0 unfortunately we should
see though is complete you I change for
the music interface so that's nice voice
control should also be drastically
improved currently we've got a hold down
a voice control button and speak your
command you shouldn't have to hold that
button down anymore
to work very much like Syria google now
you'll push it down speak what you want
to speak and the action will happen all
you should see a visual representation
of what you're saying show up on the
dashboard now I'm still hoping no for a
button that automatically call up serial
google now pending on with phone you've
got paired so big updates coming we
don't know when these are going to hit
supposedly just a few users using them
right now it could be as soon as a few
weeks could be a few months or even
could be holding out until 2017 so what
you guys think about Teslas 8.9 software
update it's incredible to think about a
car getting better will be a software
something that Tesla can do and it's
kind of unique in the marketplace for
that a few guys thoughts on it you
excited not excited you drive an S or an
X you know someone that does i'm curious
to try these features out myself so next
time John render can TechnoBuffalo see
you guys the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
