phone is a brand new offering from
Garmin and it's built on an operating
system no one's seen before it was built
off of a Linux kernel but it's
completely new interface so I wanted to
give you guys a tour of it so you can
decide if the newly phone g60 is an
option for you or not so let's go ahead
and unlock the device you push the
button at the top double tap to unlock
and this is a resistive screen so as you
go through navigate you'll notice you've
got a row of three icons call search and
view map I'll do a separate video going
into the navigation functions on the
phone since that's really as one of its
primary jobs but for now let's talk
about the operates with some of the
phone itself so call takes you to a
pretty simple and relatively
elegant-looking caller interface to call
your contacts that will show up here
you've got a dial pad and a call history
you can add a contact very easily and
these scrolling is relatively smooth you
can add emails at addresses and add a
ton of different contact information and
to go back since there is not a home
button you have to rely on those keys of
arrows search takes you to the GPS and
this is what you'll see if you're
familiar with any sort of garment
standalone gps unit this is going to
look exactly the same but again it'll be
a separate video focusing just on
navigation and the view map takes you to
the map which again opens up the GPS
functionality so the main sort of crux
the operating system is done from this
right-hand row of icons and you can
scroll through them and as I'll show you
in a minute you can rearrange them any
way you like but for now let me show you
what they are so you've got contacts
text messages emails open one up go back
I opened up the map by accident text
messages email web browser camera
weather tools settings ciao so i'll talk
about media player and calendar let me
walk you through each of these contacts
you just saw text messaging is a pretty
standard text messaging interface go
ahead and hit new
message and you can type 2 or start
typing the message and it relies of
course on a full virtual keyboard this
does have an accelerometer so when you
turn the device you do get a landscape
keyboard I will say the landscape
keyboard is actually pretty good you get
sort of the same ability that you got on
the iPhone you can move letters around
let me do a test here and i'll type
something out on the keyboard this is a
test so only one little error but you
can get used to this keyboard very fast
if you're worried about the keyboard all
the g6 you don't it's actually quite
good you go ahead hit done or send
whatever you'd like we'll go back to
standard view here we will exit out and
we'll go back it's having a little bit
trouble oops upside down there we open
so let's go back to our tour of the
device so moving right along you've got
email this is a very standard email
functionality you're going to get pop
and you're going to get IMAP access but
at least right now you are not going to
be getting any sort of exchange service
unfortunately it's a very simple email
application i'll show you what it looks
like if you want to set one up add a
camel and you just put in the simple
information it's relatively simplistic
sort of what you would find on a feature
phone you're not going to get a
blackberry email experience you not be
even get an iphone email experience but
you will be able to get email so if
email is a secondary concern queue but
you still want to get it the nuvifone
should be something to consider so
moving a lil ride along we've got the
web browser and this does have a full
HTML capable web browser with 3g right
now i'm connected over Wi-Fi so let's do
a test of a web page here and i'll show
you sort of these speed what just loads
over a relatively fast Wi-Fi connection
so we turn this into landscape mode
again and we will go to ww there's
TechnoBuffalo com so we will get done
and we'll launch at and see how quickly
it loads and
show you a little bit about what the
browser looks like so this is not the
fastest of web browsers on most phones
so the iphone blackberry storm t-mobile
g1 or really a host of other devices we
have already had the page load by now so
the load times on this are not very
quick however once the page is loaded
you can get a very nice view of the
Internet although as you can see it
definitely takes some time so I'm going
to cut the camera here and fast forward
to when the page is loaded okay so here
we are in the landing page of
TechnoBuffalo this isn't a web browser
speed test I cut the camera not to bore
you but it took about 25 seconds for the
page to load now once you're here you do
not get flash capable of video so you're
not gonna be able to play youtube videos
but you do get relatively smooth flick
scrolling however there is not any
multi-touch and there isn't double tap
to zoom in most your controls and
zooming in and done by these two buttons
down here so you can zoom in with the
positive the amount with the negative
and the text does clear itself and it's
very legible it is a decent browser it's
not the best that's out there but it's
certainly not the worst if you want to
do web browsing this is a capable
browser and all your navigation is done
from this bar on the side so let's go
back and let's continue our overview of
the device if you turn it upside down so
you got web browser next thing we have
is a camera and this has a 3 megapixel
autofocus camera right now it's asking
me follow on a disabled screenshot mode
and what that means you can actually
hold down the camera button it'll take a
screenshot of whatever is on your screen
it's actually a very nice feature so
we're not going to disable that right
now but we are going to go into the
camera so there goes a picture of my
desk it's a keeping true with the
operating system itself it's a very
simplistic interface I don't have any
controls or options where they take
advantage of the button at the top to
snap my picture so we can step one of
some papers on my desk
and it takes a pitcher and so let me
have the screenshot utility is still on
these pop-ups can get a little bit on
the annoying side but the camera
pictures are clear way to expect from a
3 megapixel sensor on a on a phone
definitely on par with the camera
quality that you get onto the iphone
although there is not any video
recording capabilities as Viet so
continuing will keep moving down now
weather is interesting whether it's on
your home screen we actually don't get
access to the weather unless you
subscribe to an additional AT&amp;amp;T plan
which is quite interesting so if you hit
weather and in this doesn't make that
much sense you can just go to weather
com on the browser and check your local
weather we will see here this is going
to ask me to activate data connection
and it's checking if you have got the
required server subscriptions this is an
extra cost from AT&amp;amp;T I believe it comes
in at around four or five dollars so if
I want to get the premium access I can
get the first 30 days for free otherwise
at the end I'm going to be charged 599
and you don't just get whether that 599
you also actually get real-time traffic
updates on the GPS so you're getting a
lot with it but it's another six-dollar
chargement tnt it's not required at all
though to use the navigation functions
on the device all those maps are
built-in and don't require any sort of a
network connectivity so I can't really
show you whether let's take a look at
tools and I would make a joke there
about well we'll keep going so you've
got where am I ll pull up the map you've
got a calculator clock you can
synchronize this with your pc I've not
been able to get synchronized with a mac
though well you can't access mass
storage and drag things over to its four
megabytes of internal storage or you can
up that via the expansion card slot
flight status turns off the data you get
a unit converter some help traffic
search notes and a checklist free
standard feature phone functionality
settings settings was much more
simplistic than I expected system
settings general Wi-Fi Bluetooth let's
just go into general and here really
just on off on
for a lot of things you don't have the
ability to tweak a lot of your settings
it's really very cut and dry with what
you want so distance units temperature
units GPS simulator play not that many
options that you get and that sort of
slimmed down approach is taken
throughout the entire menu system so
audio controls radio here vibrate sounds
and mixer proximity points and phone
navigation you get some very simple
navigation options whether you want it
to be have a treat you as in a car or
they're not you're just walking
pedestrian directions are quite nice so
if you're in a metropolitan city we
realize on walking quite a bit like New
York City or DC for example and display
you just get some very simple display
options now application you might be
thinking wow this has an app store you
are going to be disappointed this does
not have an app store at least not yet
and hopefully that garment has announced
one this just shows you the applications
settings that you have on a phone email
browser and main menu order so you can
reorder that icons that robe icons on
the right hand side so keep going back
now here's something called chow and
chow is essentially geo-tagging your
pictures it's similar to HTC's footsteps
like you've seen on other devices it put
them some information on every picture
you take to let you know where you were
you can add some notes into it and so
you can always remember where your
pictures were taken or sent up
difference so that's all ciao is it does
have a rudimentary music player simple
play things simple a lot play back
forward functionality can add a track
you're not going to get the most elegant
of music interfaces but it does work and
it is functional and you can drag tracks
on there just by plugging in via your
mini USB does have full calendar
functionality so you can sort of view
your dates you go ahead an appointment
it's got the days today's date circled
so obviously the second and you can go
ahead and add things yet if you'd like
and that is the last icon choice that we
have on the nuvi phone
this phone and the operating system
itself was first shown about 20 months
ago by garmin really not much has
changed since then so that's either
positive or negative depending on how
you look at it overall device does quite
a lot it doesn't do anything other than
navigation particularly well but it does
do a lot of things so if you're looking
for a device that sort of kin can handle
a lot maybe not have the most elegant of
interface newbie phone is a very good
option I'll be doing a full review of it
and i'll be doing a full demonstration
of the navigation functionality so you
can help the side phones right for you
