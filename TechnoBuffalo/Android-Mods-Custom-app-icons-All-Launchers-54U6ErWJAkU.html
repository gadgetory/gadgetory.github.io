sand from TechnoBuffalo and we know how
much you guys love customizing your
Android devices and we've done several
videos showcasing different icon packs
and launchers but today we have
something really special for you guys
when installing a third-party icon pack
it's either All or Nothing there's
really no way to mix and match the icons
on your homescreen however there's a
neat little trick to mix and match icons
with any Android launcher even Google's
own Google now launcher the first thing
you need to do is download awesome icons
from the Google Play Store and it's free
second thing we need to do is download
custom icon packs now I personally like
the moonshine Elune and Minn icon pack
but you can download any icon pack of
your choice from the Google Play Store
when you first open up awesome icons
you'll see all the apps you have
installed on your device it also shows
you what custom icon packs you have
installed on your device and there's
another tab with some recommendations to
get you started you can use what it
recommends but I'd rather just choose my
own to add a custom app icon shortcut to
your launcher just press any of the app
icons on this screen and it'll create a
shortcut with the icon of your choice
here you'll be able to change the apps
name or delete it and you also have the
option for a protect icon which
essentially forces an app to change its
icon if it refuses to change once you
press ok you'll see the new app icon
appear automatically on your homescreen
and this is basically the entire process
while also my cons will allow you to add
custom icons to your homescreen it takes
a lot of time since you have to go
through your icons one by one now
another cool feature is the ability to
pick any image from your gallery or take
a new picture and set it as your own
custom icon awesome icons will also
allow you to mix and match any custom
icon packs and allow you to use
different styles on each home screen
page so far we haven't noticed an impact
on performance or battery life while
using awesome icons and we've been using
it for a few weeks now also my cons is
completely free there are no paid
versions or trials and it works with any
launcher root isn't required either
which is great if you guys want to check
out some of the icon packs we've covered
in the past you can check that out over
here and if you guys want to try it
awesome icons for yourselves check out
the links in the description below
anyways thank you guys so much for
watching and if you guys enjoy this
video make sure to give this video a
thumbs up and we will see you guys in
the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
