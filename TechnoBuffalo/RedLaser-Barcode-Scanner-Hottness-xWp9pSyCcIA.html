ago I showed you a barcoding application
for Android called shopsavvy at the time
there wasn't anything out for the iphone
and that has been rectified there is an
application out now it's 199 it's called
red laser you can see the icon right
there and my first question when I first
think about these barcoding scanning
applications is how useful is going to
be is it really going to help me in any
way and where I thought about it
actually the more uses I found for this
application let's say you're out
shopping at bestbuy or any other
electronic store you want to know if
what you're about to purchase is a good
deal well you can scan the barcode this
single search amazon for you in a pull
up a list of prizes you can see if
you're getting a good deal on whatever
it is you're buying so it gives you a
little bit of a peace of mind so I
picked some pretty popular products and
I'm going to give them a scan for the
first time see how accurate this is and
how well it works let's go ahead and get
started the first thing we're going to
scan is a case for the iphone by a new
form there's a bar code on the bottom go
ahead and open up red laser and you get
a very simple interface I'll show you a
list of your scam products mine is clear
right now you go and hit the lightning
bolt right there opens up your camera
application and you have to align the
barcode between those two arrows so let
me go ahead and do that it gets a beep
tells you that it's searching amazon i
found the product and it's listing them
for a ton of prizes here anywhere from
15 I guy and 1399 any $20 so you can see
if you're getting a good deal if you
want to see more so the like the 1399
was the cheapest you can go ahead and
hit the arrow and they'll open up the
link to the site of where that product
is sold actually is pretty useful so
i'll go back gives you some information
about the product that you scanned lets
you know that it's a case and who makes
it let's try a few other products and
see if this thing is still accurate one
of the problems I found with shopsavvy
was a lot of the things i scanned didn't
always register as products it just
didn't know what they existed let's see
if this can be fixed so now we're going
to scan a pair of Sonic's three
headphones these have a built-in
microphone actually a pretty nice pair
of headset go ahead and give that a skin
again put it right in the middle gives
it a scan searching amazon and found it
and these prices are ranging from
website it's pretty constant just about
seventy dollars so if you were buying
these from online or in the store you
know you were paying 6999 that you were
getting a fair price let's scan a few
other things and see how it works so
right now I've got something that is
certainly available on Amazon here is
ilife 09 there's the barcode in my life
09 let's see if this scans I know a lot
of times these applications have trouble
with software scoop us a whirl use your
beep and it found it so overall I think
this is a very useful application for
for two dollars it can very easily save
you many times over that if you're just
out shopping even for one product so
wherever you might be this is good for
things that aren't electronic space if
your your grocery shopping you want to
prepare cans of soup or anything with
the barcode that they sell on amazon
this is going to be a fantastic tool for
you if you're out clothing shopping and
you want to scan things this is going to
be a great tool limitation is you're
stuck with served just what amazon has
but they have a very very broad catalog
so i think you guys will find it useful
so what do you think is something that
you're going to use not use is it a
wasted two bucks let me know what you
think good comments or video response
and I will see you guys in the next
