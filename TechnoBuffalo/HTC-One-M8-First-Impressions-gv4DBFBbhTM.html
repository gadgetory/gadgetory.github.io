to you by Auto what's up everyone John
render from TechnoBuffalo here I've had
the privilege of using the all new HTC
One for the better part of three days I
want to give you guys a first
impressions what I thought about it well
I didn't think about it's not quite a
for review yet but definitely I've got
sort of a sense of how the phones are
going to work now I think it might end
up working in the future anyway it's
going to get started so as I start all
of my videos that have to do with
products want to give it a screamer I
use this as my daily driver for three
days not nearly enough time if me be
comfortable doing it full review and
putting my name on it but plenty of time
to do a first impression this is going
to be super top-level I'll go over into
more detail when I do the full review so
let's go ahead and jump runnin so it
sorta looks the device so I saw all the
leaks to it looked like an evolutionary
phone but it's much more revolutionary
and new than you think the duo camera i
think is probably the flagship there we
did a whole video demonstrating the duo
camera can do but slice to say it is
really awesome it works very well thanks
to me down below if you want to check
that out the shutter speed also on the
camera is crazy fast I've got a six
month old kid who very fast-moving able
to snap pictures very very quickly
that's probably when the fastest
shutters that I've seen on any camera
that really goes a long way with me also
the UI for the camera is now super easy
to navigate so you just jump into camera
and get a little for circles and you can
pick very easily what you want to jump
to it's very clear and it makes absolute
sense which is kind of nice to have the
quality at least on the first blush look
stellar but I'm still testing what the
pictures are going to look like we'll
have more of that on the full review it
also has smart flash does something
similar in the iphone 5s it'll adjust
the brightness or the hue automatically
depending on weight try and take a
picture of so all kinds of camera
business here seems to be really really
nice with the all new HTC One so on to
the phone now it's ninety percent metal
as opposed to seventy percent the
original HTC One and it looks and feels
awesome big issue I had their first HTC
owns the power button was a huge pain in
the butt to phenomenally fine but
so press this one is now plastically
surrounded by plastic and it has a
better feel to it if that even makes
sense just easier to find easier to
click and button you push all the time
it's really nice one of the gripes I had
with the original HTC One was with these
buttons out here i usually like
capacitive buttons but the layout was
weird they were staggered on the left
and the right of the HTC logo and HTC
logo wasn't a button I just didn't like
it we now have full on-screen buttons
here so if you're a fan of those her
reign you get real buttons which is nice
you have to deal with those sort of kind
of finke capacitive buttons and i thinkI
i just made that word up means didn't
work that well another flagship features
HTC one is boomsound supposedly its
twenty percent louder I don't know if it
is or not but the boom sat on the first
day to see one is awesome and these
sound even louder sounds really really
good and again we'll go into way more
peaceful olives when you look for review
their just sort of general impressions
another feature they're touting is
motion launch I haven't really tested
all much to be honest but tapped unlock
is super nice we won't call it knocks
I'm sure LG he'll get pissed but if you
did double tap and go ahead and get you
can't edit do it you want I've got it
set to go to lock screen they just
unlock your phone which is really a nice
feature but like anything it's not
perfect we should wireless charging
please please give me wireless charging
the microSD card it's nice it's got it
now but it's built into a tray like with
the same carriage is just very weird
it's not a bad thing I just I couldn't
figure out my why does it have two sim
cards i get a dual sim probably sure
about the directions but to say no
that's where the microsd card is going
to go 2600 milliamp hour battery and a
pretty beastly stamp dragon 801 chip i
would have thought might not be so good
but my first few days bagger life has
been really awesome i used the phone
pretty heavily especially while testing
it early on small he's like look at this
this can do in addition to pulling down
to email accounts and doing social media
and watching video by end of the day and
usually i pull off the charger around
630-7 but my two days of testing out of
my three were were the weekends so it
didn't come off you know as early as it
would have but i had around fifty to
sixty percent end of the day which was
pretty awesome since six years pretty
nice it gets out of its own way you can
now not have blinkfeed usually you had
to hide it on the left hand side if you
don't want to use it now you can just
pretty much get rid of it which is
quite nice it looked relatively similar
to sense 5 that we see in the past what
I like what HTC does and I think Sam's
one takes different approach with their
skins or their custom you guys ever you
want to call it I think they throw a lot
of features at you I hope you're going
to find one or two that you like and
want to use a lot HTC dick is a very
different approach here I think they
really put special attention to features
they add and make them hopefully ones
you're going to use I really like
everything that's on here in fact it's
given the choice to choose between an
HTC One with sense or the google play
edition I think the one with sense and I
said the same thing last generation I
really enjoy what they're doing I think
they've done just a really really nice
job with not only the hardware design
but also the UI I think they improved on
Android as the phone I'm really excited
to use I can't wait to test it for
probably another five or six eight if I
were comfortable doing it full review
you guys want to say anything particular
that I talked about be sure to let me
know I'll make sure I go into more
detail when i do that for you of course
will cover things like the camera and
have picture demonstrations and how that
works i'll show you again how the duo
cameras going to properly function will
walk through a screen and go to
performance but suffice to say it feels
