techno buffoon other smartphone
Smackdown this time we've got a carrier
war we've got a team cheese iPhone for
squaring up against Verizon's droid 2
we're gonna put these two head-to-head
in a grueling nine round test and
declare a winner let's get started so we
are going to put these two head-to-head
in a nine round series of tests and
grounds are going to include cult
quality battery browser speed signal
text entry screen specs and a new
category called value obviously there's
a lot more we could cover but the
interest of brevity we're going to
eliminate to just those nine rounds so
let's jump right in let's talk about
call quality these are cell phones and
no matter what else they do they don't
make the phone calls they're not going
to work for you what call quality on
each was very strong on the iPhone 4 I
had no white noise or popping on my end
or the collars other end in the same
thing on the jury to very crisp very
clear however on a 10 called test
driving in different areas I had to drop
calls on the iPhone 4 compared to a 1
dropped call on the jury to its pre
representative of the drop college dude
nothing about the antennas I have met
any antenna issues really with the
iPhone 4 since I had it covered and
protected but I have noticed that the
Droid 2 does drop about 10% less phone
calls than the iPhone 4 does so because
of that round one call quality is going
to the Droid 2 now these phones
obviously do a lot of things email texts
web browsing it's going to take a lot of
battery life so these things need to be
able to last at least a full day so you
can get to your charger so battery wise
the iPhone 4 is gonna give you 14 hours
to talktime and 300 hours of standby and
the Droid 2 has been evening 9.5 byte
average of talktime and 315 hours of
standby
that's just what Motorola and Apple
claimed real-world usage is actually
very different I'm a very heavy you can
imagine a very heavy smartphone user I'm
on the phone for a few hours a day I'm
doing a ton of browsing and I always
have push email on getting a
emails with the iPhone 4 on heavy usage
I generally have around 40% of battery
left for the end of the day with the
Droid 2 is around 20 to 10 percent value
at the end of the day so real-world
usage I'm getting much better battery
life out of the iPhone 4 using them both
in the same way at the same times so
battery life is going to go to the
iPhone 4 next let's talk about the
browser I mentioned I use the browser
quite a bit on my phones this is
something where the iPhone used to have
a very clear edge from Android first
launched Android didn't have multi-touch
it really didn't have the best browsing
experience though it was decent
well Android once it got to the twos
really took care of that so 2.0 2.1 2.2
and the rest really brought the Android
Browser
up to par with what you can expect on
the iPhone 4 let me go ahead and jump in
and show you what the browser's look
like on each well you probably are
familiar with both of them so you got
TechnoBuffalo you're queued up on both
it's very smooth browsing on the iPhone
4 really one of the smoothest browsing
Sprint's that I've seen I can scroll
without really experiencing any sort of
checkerboard pattern the multi-touch is
really pretty smooth no delay or lag at
all the iPhone does support html5 but
does not support any type of Flash
content now that's really been a problem
for me but I understand that I am not
everyone out there a lot of people rely
on Flash content for their phones and
the iPhone is not going to deliver that
febrile enjoy to maybe more what you're
looking for notice that the scrolling
experience is not nearly as smooth as is
on the iPhone 4 if you go back and forth
you can see that it's a little bit
choppier
here on the Droid 2 and the mochi touch
as well is a little bit choppy on the
joy too but it does work and it does
work actually pretty well you can double
tap to resize and those sort of things
that we're used to with browsing however
the addition of flash is really what
gives Dubrow you're on the joy to this
watch 10.1 a little bit of an edge those
that follow my channel you know I just
got him very recently and I wanted to
view my wedding pictures and show them
to my family online well site that they
were on I was unfortunately a
flash-based site and I couldn't show it
to them on my iPhone but I had to draw
it to me that I was testing I was able
to show nice and easily so I could live
with the less smooth scrolling be able
to view the Internet as
was intended and be able to have full
flash support so Ralph the rig is going
to swing back the way of the Droid 2 and
then take this round so next let's talk
very quickly about speed and we'll talk
about processor and such when we get to
the specs round but speed is very
important as well and I want to
demonstrate speed actually on the
browser let me go and make sure he is
close on each so we're getting a apples
to Android comparison here so I've got a
app killer go ahead and kill everything
so everything is now killed on the Droid
2 let me go ahead and do the same thing
here we'll go ahead just if the browser
opens that's what we're going to be
working with so open the browser here
I'll go ahead open the browser here as
well and we're gonna do a simple on page
refresh a TechnoBuffalo which is pretty
image have either some videos embedded
in there a pretty representative I think
of a typical web browsing experience now
again in just a brevity or nearly out
test three or four different webpages
once the test is done I'll give you sort
of my experiences about what it's doing
when I tested other websites it's going
to go ahead and refresh TechnoBuffalo go
ahead and open it up here do the same
thing here on the droid to go and hit go
on both alright and we are off hit them
both at the same time and we'll see
which one is going to come out on top
these are both connect to the same Wi-Fi
network so you should have pretty
similar speeds please it's a fair test
and it looks like the Droid 2 finished
just a second before the iPhone 4 in
testing many other websites I found the
iPhone 4 it generally finishes about 1
to 2 seconds earlier then the Droid 2
does but fro intensive purposes let's go
ahead and load one more website on each
let's go ahead and try ESPN these are
sites that have been loaded on both
before they'll be representative of
sites you visit on a regular basis go
and try ESPN it should probably pull up
the mobile page I would assume and
there's ESPN so we'll go ahead and load
up both of these and we'll see which one
comes out on top so buckle up the mobile
page the iPhone 4 in just a second
before but there's not much you have the
mobile page let's go and load up the
real
ESPN which is extremely image and text
heaviness I'll go ahead and select it
down there and I'll select it down here
and I'll hit open at the same time open
and open I will let both of those go and
we'll see which one is faster iPhone 4
showing the content a little bit earlier
like the Droid 2 caught up pretty
quickly it's now showing a bit more
content iPhone 4 is almost done so is it
dry - and the joy - finished just a
second before the iPhone 4 so it comes
to browsing despite these tests live to
be very even droid 2 than we're taking a
bit of an edge on these tests and
earlier tests it was the iPhone 4 so
browser to browser relatively close
you're gonna get a pretty good
experience on each so go ahead and close
out of this and let's talk about speed
of the operates assuming speed of the
devices as a whole I've tested a lot of
Android devices and a lot of Snapdragon
Android devices and I found the
processor that this is running we'll
talk about this more in the specs at TI
OMAP clocked in about a gigahertz to be
a bit laggy and really just laggy on the
joy - it's much quicker on something
like the Droid X for example when I want
to unlock the screen it's a bit slow
takes a second to sort of react to my
finger and then even a second later you
get that haptic feedback when I go ahead
and launch things up in the application
tray doesn't launch them quickly as I've
seen on other Android devices they're
just a bit disappointing they go and
open a calendar it seemed to be a bit of
a delay just not as snappy as other
devices I've seen on the iPhone for
example I think things are loading very
quickly and it's optimized just for the
processor I know it's probably gonna be
a bit of feedback about this round and
whether or not it was this bias or not
but I can't show you everything that
I've done with both devices here at
inter skin of just brevity but using the
phone's speeds to speed wise the iPhone
4 just feels a bit snappier so speed is
going to the iPhone 4 so this is sort of
a new test as well we're gonna talk
about signal strength I took a few 18t
phones I took a few varieties of phones
and I brought it back to the same area
to see how the radios are going to react
with the iPhone 4 so in Apple's case or
any icons case we use this
some captivate and AT&amp;amp;T Palm Pre one the
variety side we used a Droid X in
comparison with the Droid 2 as well as a
Verizon Palm Pre and I was actually very
very very impressed to the signal
strength on the drawer to Motorola
putting a fantastic radio actually where
I was getting maybe three bars of e
video grab a service the Droid 2 was
pulling in four bars the iPhone 4 was
not quite as strong so many other AT&amp;amp;T
device that I tested even when I went
into sort of some debugging and testing
mode actually see the number the radio
wasn't quite what I would expect from a
high-end phone so signal strength is
you're in a friend area you're gonna be
doing very well with the Droid 2 if
you're on AT&amp;amp;T the iPhone might not be
the best way to go so the signal
strength I think that's really important
is going to go to the Droid 2 alright
next let's talk about text entry sort of
very different stories for each text
entry on the iPhone is really something
you've seen probably quite a bit I'm
gonna go and open up a new message here
and you've got a portrait keyboard and a
landscape keyboard and it's got a pretty
decent spellcheck and auto correction
feature and it works very well I really
enjoyed using the iPhone 4s on-screen
keyboard let's go ahead and jump in and
look at the keyboard on the droid 2 and
you've seen what this looks like on the
iPhone do a quick demonstration actually
to show you a little bit about what
things look like so I'm gonna open up a
new note I'll go ahead and type but you
can see the keyboard sort of responds
well it's multi-touch you can move your
letters around as you type it's very
quick you guys have seen be test is
probably on multiple devices all right
go ahead and jump into the Droid 2 and
open up a new text message and it will
see sort of what this one looks like so
you have quite a few ways to input text
here on the joy - I've got the same
thing ways you have on the iPhone 4
you've got a landscape or a sorry a
portrait or a landscape keyboard right
there which will come up you go ahead
and type now I am a big fan of the
Android on-screen keyboard especially
Motorola's take on it on the Droid X I'm
not the biggest fan of it actually on
the Droid 2 it seems a little bit
cramped on the 3.7 inch screen
when typing it works mostly the same way
we saw on the iPhone 4 you go ahead
and type now one thing that I really
like about Android is that you actually
have the voice to text see that little
microphone right there I could go ahead
and tap that and I can tap that and I
can say what I wanted all really with a
great degree of accuracy type it right
and for me which is very very nice
now the Droid 2 also has another way to
input text it's got a full slide-out
QWERTY keyboard almost has a full layer
on top and each key sort of bubble out a
little bit I was not the biggest fan of
the keyboard on the droid 1 and that's
sort of true here with the Droid 2 I
don't find be the very easiest full
QWERTY keyboard to type on so if you
need to have a full QWERTY keyboard try
the Droid 2 first so in the keyboard
round there are just many many many more
waist input text here on Android you
don't have to use the on-screen keyboard
you can use the physical keyboard if you
want you can use the on-screen keyboard
if use the voice of text there are so
many options to find one way that's
going to work best for you so the text
entry route it's got to go to the Droid
2 to go ahead and close out of this and
now let's talk about screens since both
of these rely primarily on their screens
to be very important that you've got a
nice screen to look at it's going to
show your images show your text or your
videos very nicely the screen on the
iPhone 4 is 3.5 inches with a resolution
of 640 by 960 and of course it's too
passive and multi-touch the Droid 2 is a
little bit bigger at 3.7 inches but a
lower resolution of 480 by 854 and it's
definitely capacitive and multi-touch as
well the screens are really really
really very important to me and there's
a screen that this cannot be beat as on
the iPhone 4 it just looks absolutely
gorgeous it's got a higher resolution
despite being a smaller screen pictures
images and video really do just pop
screen has definitely got to go to the
iPhone 4 alright let's talk about specs
a little bit here the iPhone 4 is
running iOS that goes current version
now is 4.1 scott apple is 8 for 1
gigahertz chip 512 megabytes of ram 5
megapixel camera with LED flash and now
it can take HDR pictures the Droid 2 has
Android 2.2 onboard t-i-is OMAP
processor clocked in and gigahertz with
512 megabytes of RAM as well and a 5
megapixel camera
with dual LED flash now if I hadn't
worked time I would do a camera test the
both pictures are pretty good the HDR
images on the iPhone 4 tend to look a
little bit better but you take your own
digital pictures they both look pretty
nice the big difference here is Apple's
a4 chip versus Texas Instruments OMAP 1
gigahertz it just performs better it's
optimized just for the iPhone here -
processors use on a myriad of other
devices while it does work well on the
joy - doesn't work as well the operating
system wasn't made for the processor
like we're seeing with the iPhone 4
that's something I've come for it just
tend to move it a little bit quicker so
from the full specs standpoint that
round is going to go back to the iPhone
4 now let's talk about value this is a
round that I just added for the first
time due to popular demand people want
to know what these things are going to
cost them and this is going to be
accurate served as of right now which is
the middle of September so let's talk
about the iPhone 4 these you can get a
16 gigabyte model for $1.99 on a
two-year contract
alright 32 gigabyte model for $2.99
alright now let's focus on the 16 gig
for $1.99 do not forget you sort of
expandable storage on there you sucked
at either 16 or 32 with AT&amp;amp;T if you want
900 minutes to talk it's gonna cost
about $60 if you want a limited plan
I'll set it cost an extra $10 for 70
bucks so you can get all the talk in it
you want for text message think you can
get 1,500 texts for 15 bucks 200 text
for $5 or a limited for $20 so pretty
decent value there for tech messaging
and for data then you have this new data
plus point you get two gigabytes of data
for $25 and if you want to add tethering
and got a talk on there 20 bucks for $45
so essentially all in with a brand new
16 gigabyte iPhone 4 gonna be paying a
balance three hundred and ten bucks
before taxes out of pocket you're gonna
be putting in about $100 per month
this is dooming that you took the
unlimited plan and you went for 1,500
texts and 2 gigabytes of data without
tethering let's go ahead and jump on
over to the drawer into I comes with 8
gigabytes already installed on the phone
you can also comes with a gigabyte
microSD cards you get the same 60
megabytes of storage but you can up that
up to 32 if you like by buying an extra
card but consider your pair
16 gig iPhone 4 to sit with 16 gigs here
as well you can get 900 minutes for $60
or in limited for 70 bucks so the same
crisis 18 t text messaging plan is not
quite as good and get 500 texts for
about $10 or 5,000 for 20 as opposed to
be unlimited between that you got with
AT&amp;amp;T you have to pay for visual
voicemail another $3.00 per month but
you do get unlimited web access for a
$29.99 per month which is pretty nice if
you want to add the 3G hotspot
capabilities so you can actually use
your Droid 2 as a Wi-Fi hotspot then it
cost you another $20 per month so again
assuming the same unlimited plan now
only 500 texts the unlimited web visual
voicemail is gonna see about a little
more than 300 bucks a month so the same
price about $100 per month so it's not
the same price wise to get either phone
however you are going to get more value
for your money if you're a heavy
internet user with the Droid to me I can
be unrestricted to that so you go by cap
however I would assume that to go but
cap is probably coming very soon seems
like most hair you're gonna be doing it
but for right now you are getting what
they're calling unlimited however if you
use a lot of tech messaging the iPhone 4
so you'd be a bit of a better value for
the plan but overall I think that
Verizon is offering a little bit better
value for the money just based on data
usage alone so isn't a value standpoint
it's got to go to Verizon's droid to
hoping that people a lot of people have
been asking for it so we had a nine
round test so this is ever keeping track
at home let's go ahead and recap the
round call quality went to the Droid to
battery life went to the iPhone browser
went to the Droid 2 because a flash
speed went to the iPhone 4 signal
strength
went back to the Droid 2 text entry
stuck with the Droid 2 screen went to
the iPhone 4 spectrum to the iPhone 4
and I can't got the bids high breaking
around value went to the Droid 2 which
gives us a total of five to four in
favor of the Droid 2 so in the
head-to-head battle with value really
came out on top and the jury too is
going to be the winner iPhone 4 it's a
fantastic phone certainly has a lot
of people that love it use it the iPhone
4 is actually my daily driver when you
put these two heads ahead and test that
I ran the joy too appears to be is a
better choice if you're in a fringe area
we don't get the best Verizon service
you can't go wrong with the iPhone 4
these are two fantastic phones but there
can only be one winner and the joy too
is that so you agree disagree it really
