to you by harry's what's up everyone
welcome back to episode of ask the
Buffalo I sit here in this chair as a
humble Buffalo and I've got questions
that I'm gonna try answer for you up
this week we're going to talk about
self-driving cars no I'm doing this
because you're not going to be doing
that we're gonna talk about blackberry
the surface pro 3 and a lg g3 Google
Play edition
I call them gp's GP this is that's a
buffalo let's start asking the Buffalo
first question comes from our good
friends at Tech Mob reviews who asked at
John 4 Lakers hey John hi what are your
thoughts on Google's self-driving cars
so I've got a couple thoughts on it
first
it is super ugly but really really ugly
I mean we're not talking like some
original Mini Cooper kind of styling
we're just talking like just ugly cars
so here's the deal with the self-driving
car we've seen self-driving cars from
Google that are based on the Prius based
on the Lexus RX this one is totally new
and the weird thing about it it does not
have a steering wheel and it doesn't
have a gas and brake pedal which is
really weird so taking the human totally
out of the equation previous
self-driving cars you take control of
the wheel if you saw doing something
strange like no car
don't hit the pedestrians but now that
is not there anymore so before you freak
out you know that's kind of top speed at
25 miles per hour so you're not gonna be
going on the freeway with it it's got a
200 degree range of view that it can see
and it's relying totally on sensors and
I get it I know this is coming I know
the future of driving whether we like it
or not so I'm not gonna be like the old
cadre guy was like no we're dropping
cars we can't have them back in my day
we had to put our hands on the steering
wheel and push a gas pedal
so listen I know it's coming but it
still freaks me out that I don't have
the option to turn the wheel if I see
something wrong happening this is for
the people like just want to hop in
their car take a nap and wake up at work
which is very weird but I know what
paradigm shifts are as many people are
gonna resist it so we're looking at the
future like it or not this is the future
of cars
and I guess some days when I'm tired I'm
excited about it but some days it makes
me really really nervous but the plus
side of this and this is a giant plus
side something like this becomes
standard you can say goodbye to traffic
if you think about it traffic does it
make any sense
there's a set amount of Road of cars
keep moving on it and going off and
getting off the freeway and changing
lanes forever traffic should always be
moving it's the people that cause
problems people that slow down that look
left or right so if you get through
traffic I'm willing to let go of the
steering wheel to just you ever had a
drive from LA or driving like traffic or
traffic whatever big city you live in it
is really bad
and it sucks so those before it upset it
again
don't be Ron Ron sits in traffic so if
you are for self-driving cars you cannot
be iran and it's coming what do you guys
think are you for it not for it I love
to hear your thoughts on it let's talk
about a subjects been around for quite a
while the folks at blackberry this comes
from Twitter ads me Akal 94s at jump for
linkers what do you think the future for
blackberry is listen blackberry fans are
gonna jump down my throat for this and
I'm sorry for saying in but I gotta be
honest I think the future for blackberry
is gonna be two parts I think they're
going to spin off bbm to its own company
which I certainly makes a lot of sense
for them there's a lot of value behind
messaging programs I think bbm is
actually really really good but the
hardware side of it is sucking money out
of that company so from a business
standpoint you take all of your emotions
about like loving blackberry and loving
bb10 and the new bb10 could write
Android apps I know all that stuff it is
a losing proposition for blackberry
they're just missed a market I would say
that they are parts that makes it hard
was gonna be sold off for patents and
parts and it's sort of a very sad thing
to say I was a big blackberry fan and I
still AM but I would say the only thing
we're gonna have left is going to just
be bbm and that's sort of where the
black my name is going to live on I know
it's gonna make you guys mad but after
your thoughts I'll leave the comments
down below
talked a little bit about the surface
this comes from at ms leaks you asked at
John for Lakers hey John you think I
should upgrade my surface pro 20 50 60
gigabytes the new surface pro 3 i7 I use
it for avid and Visual Studio ask the
bees so first if we're using the surface
pro tube for that and you're not
have to really use a dedicated video
card I went absolutely without a shadow
of a doubt upgrade the surface pro 3
usually I recommend store skipping each
upgrade imagine go every other one sews
original surface pro surface pro 3 be
the way to go there's such a big
difference between the 2 and the 3
it's like knifing day you'll see in our
review of the surface pro 3 it's a
pretty incredible device and I think
it's the best that Windows 8 has to
offer so I would wholeheartedly say
upgrade ago you might want to skip the
i7 version and go for the i-5 seem to be
a nice middle ground you're not gonna
get that much performance difference
these in my opinion but yes absolutely
make sense do the upgrade stop the
questions for just one second you guys
have got to know me over the years a lot
of things I like I enjoy candy I enjoy
long walks on the beach and they're
things I don't enjoy and if you look at
my face you can probably guess what one
of them is I really really don't like
shaving it's a pain go to the store you
shout out a ton of money you get like
razors that barely last make your face
hurt red and just don't enjoy it but
there might be an answer to that razor
low and it is Harry's so what Harry's
are gonna do it's kind of a new take on
getting razors first they're shipped to
your don't worry if I'm too worried
about leaving the house which sometimes
I like you can do it in your robe you
can't go to the store in your robe
people are gonna look at you crazy eyes
like this so it's got the look and feel
of a really quality product because it
is a quality product
so Harry is this brand new it's less
than one year old and it's already
disrupting the shaving industry offering
a better shaving experience a better
value than the giant behemoths like
chicken Gillette the company makes
amazing German engineered blades and
they care so much about the quality of
the shave they just purchased the 93
year old German factory that freaking
makes them so if you want to check out
Harry's and make your life easier for
you and save a ton of money go to
harrys.com use promo code techno and
save five dollars off your first
purchase 15 bucks gets you a set that
includes a handle three blades shave
cream and shipped right to your door
even gonna offer a custom engraving off
and can grieve your initials on your
razor so everybody's gonna know it's
gonna be yours so if your wife or
girlfriend wants to use your razor in
the shower to shave things and maybe you
don't want it using the rage that goes
on your face for you can big no it's got
my initials on it
don't use that so go ahead and check out
the folks at Harry's next question comes
from a boy ello who asks at jump four
Lakers any rumors of an LG g3 Google
Play edition nope no rumors at socks
I love GP devices but software so
ensconced in the g3 that I don't think
we're ever gonna see it if you want a GP
e advice you're gonna be stuck gonna
stay stuck like it's a bad situation
with either Galaxy s5 or an HTC One m8
both of good options but I would not
hold your breath at all for a g3 which
you might hold your breath for though as
a Nexus 6 perhaps based on the LG g3
which should be a pretty sweet phone but
I do not think we're going to see any
GPE edition so sorry for that thank you
