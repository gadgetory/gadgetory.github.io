go further what's up everyone John
Wrentham TechnoBuffalo here live from
CES 2013 what you got behind me looks
like any other TV but this TVs got a
secret up its sleeve let's go ahead and
take a first look at this glasses-free
3d television so the past several years
at CES three technologies been all the
rage primarily it's been active three
meeting you gotta wear special glasses
that are powered essentially take each
frame in the eye and go back and forth
back and forth to simulate a 3d effect
I've got a Samsung television at home
personally it's got active 3d glasses
it's fun to watch a movie every now and
then but honestly over a couple hours it
gives me a headache the other option for
comedians passive 3d which you got to
where essentially polarized glasses some
of what you get when you go to a regular
3d movie theater LG for example uses
passive 3d what Dobies got behind us is
completely glasses-free 3d now it's just
a prototype it's a dual venture between
Dolby and Philips so use something
called stereoscopic technology if you
guys remember the old baseball cards or
as you move them you saw the batter
swing it's kind of the same idea here
we've seen stereoscopic 3d in the past
on televisions but we've always had to
sit in a sweet spot he had to sit in
just the right spot to make sure you
could see the 3d right here then you can
actually stand anywhere and completely
say the 3d effect now it's not as
impressive a 3d as you do get with those
active glasses or even those passive
glasses but you do see a 3d effect and
you don't have any of the potential side
effects you could have with those other
two options no etics no silly glasses
and you could sit absolutely anywhere
you want to see it so this is a complete
end-to-end solution and Dobby was
telling us that they're trying to get
this out for multiple screen sizes so
not just television it could work on
tablets ik work on phones and
technologies not just in the screen the
content providers have to be on board at
this and it's got to be sort of from end
to end completely vertically integrated
let's get the technology to come to the
mainstream for now those a proof of
concept and it's one that works and is
very cool took a lot I look at it on
some tablets which we've seen a little
bit before and
worked very well you know we see looks
like he's dancing or coming right at us
so glass is free 3d this is the kind of
3d I hope to have in my home my romp to
look silly to give myself a headache and
I can have friends sitting anywhere and
still get the same 3d effect I'm John
rent from TechnoBuffalo I'll see you
next video thanks again to Ford
