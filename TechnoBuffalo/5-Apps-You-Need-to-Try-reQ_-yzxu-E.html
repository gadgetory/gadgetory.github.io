TechnoBuffalo and I wanted to make a
quick fun little video for you guys
today sharing five apps that I've been
using lately that I'm loving that I
think should be on your radar if they
are not already let's go ahead and get
started so first let's start off with
fitness now this isn't just one app it's
multiple but some are paid some are not
paid it's called seven-minute workout so
there's a lot of options out there but
it pretty much is what it sounds like
it's a seven-minute workout from jumping
jacks to push-ups to wall sets all sorts
of simple exercises you can do without
too much gear some with no gear just
natural bodyweight there's a quick easy
way to fit some exercise into your day I
really like it because I spend a lot of
time sitting at a desk and sometimes I
can't go to the gym or take out a couple
hours to go stretch workout or even want
to spend the money on a gym membership
so this is a great alternative to sort
of easier way into a healthier lifestyle
next we have anchor which is a social
media app but it's a little bit
different it's basically like Twitter
for voice if you will a lot of people
have been using it for almost micro
podcasting little daily updates there's
not that big of a user base right now
but it could be really cool in the
future I suggest you keep an eye on it I
really like the app design itself it
works really well you can like you can
respond to little anchor Clips with your
own anchor Clips you can obviously
record by holding down the record button
but my favorite thing is you can
actually just put the phone up to your a
year and it automatically begins
recording so it's a very intuitive
simple not socially awkward way of
creating content next we're gonna hop
back into the health and wellness space
with an app called headspace now it is
basically what it sounds like it gives
you headspace through guided meditation
so if you're already into meditation you
might not need this but if it's
something that's been interesting you a
way to sort of calm your mind down break
up your day come back to work or workout
or whatever with a fresh mind a calm
mind I recommend you check it out it'll
help you get through 10-minute intervals
of meditation with a very soothing calm
voice and there's an intro video that
explains everything much better than I'm
doing right now so just go download it
it's free we're getting closer to the
end we're at number four and so here
comes the good stuff the real good stuff
first off we have vrse which is a VR app
it is very very cool and it completely
changed my perspective on VR reason
being it is story based there are
documentaries they're sort
films and experiencing a story in VR
context for me was a complete
game-changer
I've been cynical about VR for a while
now in gaming with the HTC vive that
really changed my perspective and being
someone who creates video content
getting to watch documentaries in VR
changed my perspective completely and I
am on board now just go try the app out
there's so much good content that
they've uploaded I didn't get a chance
to use it with something like Google
cardboard which I'm sure to make the
experience much better so go give that a
shot if that's an option but even if
it's just your phone and you're waving
it around like a fool still go try it
out it's still very very immersive and
pretty awesome and last but not least
the App of the moment that you probably
haven't heard of unless you're 13 or
under musically now if you have heard of
it in your over 13 don't feel bad I'm
not judging but what I mean by that is
musically is in a place now where
snapchat was about a year ago where it
has a younger demographic but it has a
huge huge huge user base in short it's
lip synching you pick a song you can use
either the front-facing camera or the
rear facing camera you can sing along
yourself you can speed the song up you
can slow it down and so you can do all
sorts of fun funky stuff it's something
we've seen people love with snapchat
from the mast and it's sort of along
those lines but it's very very music
oriented so the user base is huge the
attention is there and I'm sure it's
gonna start aging up as things move
along and if by some chance you think
you're too cool for this app I suggest
you go try it out first I tried it out
it was super super fun I was looking
like a fool in the middle of a coffee
shop for about thirty minutes straight
trying to make this demonstration for
the video that's my excuse at least it
was a blast
and so that's really it those are five
apps that I've used recently that I
wanted to share with you guys that I am
loving let me know what you think in the
