you by domain.com
it's way too late at night horses up
high hello everybody oh my god it's
almost one in the morning it is uh what
is it almost one in the morning yet 881
so yeah so like we told you guys um we
don't they we had set out to build a pc
and a lot of you guys in the comments
very rude and you said we didn't know
what we were doing which was true but no
no no i would like to inform everybody
that we nailed it on our first try we
have built a pc yeah it's fine it's the
Wi-Fi card no it's my mouse it's fine
okay first walk us through what we got
first of all I would like to say I
probably look at the LED course very
difficulties the court barely reach to
the motherboard but I managed I think
we're in deep red that is the thirstiest
a man has ever been yes Ron did Ron did
an excellent job we all directed enough
so Niven is here as well in the case
we're not in the morning click thank you
didn't even in the comments he deserves
we've been doing this since 730 um p.m.
p.m. so we've got a corsair hx850 I
power supply which has an excellent
amount weight of outwits with
technobuffalo blue text technobuffalo
blue text ya which was entirely
intentional um I highly doubt you gotta
buy no I'm in frame now yes I'll sit
down baby I'll sit down also I'm Papa's
got beautiful so build okay so so origin
was amazing origin sent us this
ridiculously huge case this is actually
a full case this right here is a mid
case they sent us a full case down here
on the bottom you can either put they
asked us if we wanted parts for a
radiator or parts for hard drives and I
of course at hard drives so we can fit
another like 20 or so hard drives in
here so we're gonna have like me tired
idea created forty two terabytes install
space sorted Johnson bit crazy down here
and if we really want you know at the
moment we only have one hard drive and
though correct yeah we only have 15
drive bay by dre in the front yes and
then we've ruined one more for the front
as well though right another five we can
stick into the five drive back here or
we can say something else up there if we
want to whatever some sort of an audio
interface whatever you want to do so I
think caffeinated 9am Ron and Mark can
take over from one am delirious no sleep
runnin mark
we were making too much sense that those
guys were annoying I agree so in
addition to the case that origin sent us
they also sent us their liquid cooling
system and we hooked that madman majama
up I think we did it correctly but we
were I think missing some screws so we
wound up with it there's no fan
basically with well we had two fans and
we were gonna mount one of the fans
obviously with the radiator at the top
of the of the pc but we didn't have the
right screw so we temporarily come back
yet over again through both of the fans
on the back of the pc and then put the
radiator at the top because heat rises
what and so this has been our real
temporary solution but we are gonna be
getting a third fan right to hook up
with the radiator very soon just to make
sure this pc is extra cold the
super-cold ice is cold and staying cool
is actually pretty important because
that graphics card in there is a monster
it has its own fans it has its own fans
it has its own many many things that is
a geforce 980 TI and we went with that
over a tight next for a number of
reasons primarily it performs a little
bit better than the tight necks does
when you go in there with 2-way SLI and
that's because a double precision
computing I don't fully understand this
but it's super interesting basically
it's not actually doubling its just
adding another in it's basically like
going to 64-bit right so it can handle
double precision computing better than
the Titan X cancel when you have to 980
TI s vs too tight Nexus they actually
outperform to tighten X's plus they're
cheaper but on the night of our actual
build we did run into some issues with
the graphics card we forgot or just
weren't intelligent enough at the time
to power it I'd forgot to look at it we
just forgot to put it is that simple the
graphics card was great and later the
next day we went in we were getting a 62
code error from the motherboard we went
in plug plug drain and yeah I was super
confused because that usually means like
bad ram or something but it did boot at
one point and so we did get it to boot
on our first tribe without the graphics
card that's the only caveat
yes I can't believe ever got to plug it
in new moves new moves the motherboard
that's in here too is also ridiculously
spect out like it's just got everything
on it bluetooth it's got like three
channel AC Wi-Fi comes with two separate
antenna plus a full on sound card with
like a ton of great audio out all right
I think we can let delirious runnin mark
take it from here yes ddr4 ram coarser
with the fan with it with technobuffalo
blue banner Buffalo blue we like we
should stop the LED blinking the cameras
folly annoying its we just wanted to
record I'm just nervous yeah you
explained it very well in the beginning
you said it was very much like building
a puzzle which yeah really has been much
yeah like that once you figure out what
parts you want right because these are
inherently modular um you know this
video isn't really intended for those of
you who build your own pcs all time you
don't necessarily need to help but if
you have never built a pc before you can
do this to you can do it man when he's
literally about to fall over so i think
we write this at home cut the video no
seriously seriously tried it all home
you can totally totally do it all right
yeah the piece on violence never this
about Duvall oh you already dude you're
like exhaling hard you okay first one to
a mad read let's do am a breed are you
angry I'm so angry what are you angry
about it's cuz we built a computer I
think we need to domain name for it yeah
yeah you know where I could get one
domain com you guys can also check out a
domain if you'd like a domain com yeah I
moco TechnoBuffalo and how much can you
save you save at least at least a ruble
what's a ruble it's a currency but
you're gonna save at least one ruble at
least AKA twenty percent sure if you
want to put it one of those many words i
think i think that's important i think
language is key check out domain com use
promo code technobuffalo save some money
get a domain only after you build a pc
when you're thinking domains think
domain com when your domain com think
about domains
I'm sure they already do our macs are
just not keeping up with what we need
the reason we're here is because we want
to build a pc bossest baddest status you
can see that we can yeah and we thought
it would be super fun to involve you
guys in the process so</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
