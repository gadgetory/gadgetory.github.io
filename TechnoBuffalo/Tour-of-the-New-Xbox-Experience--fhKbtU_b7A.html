California day and I'm inside because
I'm a little bit sick mostly physically
mentally but either way I'm ill so I
thought it could be sort of productive
and walk you guys through the new Xbox
experience on the Xbox 360 actually was
the driving force behind me repurchasing
an Xbox I really like the Netflix
streaming and I like the ability to
download the games right to the hard
drive so I'm gonna walk you guys through
all the cool new things about it to
share the interface the new avatars and
just give you my overall impressions on
it so I hope you enjoy stay tuned to the
channel for more Xbox videos and some
Xbox vs PlayStation videos and some all
kinds of other electronic content hope
you guys enjoy and I'll see you in the
next video bye alright guys go ahead and
turn the Xbox on here give you guys a
nice demonstration and walkthrough of
the new Xbox experience or NX II as
Microsoft's comment
to get your Xbox flash screen with the
circle logo so instead of the blades the
way the old Xbox used to be greeted with
kind of a new and unique experience so
lets you know you're signed on to Xbox
Live which I am alright so here you are
we move the camera over just a little
bit alright so again no more blades are
greeted by the spotlight my xbox game
marketplace video marketplace friends
inside Xbox events and back to spotlight
so let's start here with spotlight and
really this is just a way to blast you
with advertising season's greetings
you've got some movies music and
freebies you can click on any one of
these panels so I'll click on this first
one here you get the a bottom of the
green but on the remote opens it up kind
of get a whole bunch of other stuff you
can do here free premium themes can
dress up your avatars it gets in a
little bit just more advertising I'm
Lesley so I'll go back here anyway you
can see all kinds of different stuff and
spotlight sorry for my voice to I got a
little bit of a cold but that's coming
back gradually all kinds of other stuff
Christmastime in south park news for
Gears of War some stuff you may be
interested in some stuff you know maybe
not but regardless or better or worse
there it is and there's no way to turn
it off my xbox this is where you have
all of your games all the games you've
downloaded so right now I've got Call of
Duty gears at war here and one thing to
know about this and one thing that's
very cool about it and you can put in a
game it can actually copy the entire
contents of the DVD onto the hard drive
meaning when you play it it's totally
quiet no load times everything's being
loaded directly from the hard drive
instead of the DVD being being read one
of the knocks I had on the older Xboxes
was that the DVD spinning was so loud it
would often hear it over the gameplay
but now with this it's very
quiet stiff the option here to play from
your hard drive view your downloads for
the game delete it from your hard drive
it lists your achievements for the game
you can see I don't have many because I
just started playing so feature
downloads for the game descriptions of
the game and some game details and when
you're playing it off the hard drive you
actually have to have the physical disk
in the Xbox just to verify it but once
it verifies the first time disc is no
longer needed then every time you want
to play it again it has to verify the
disk again so you can't give it to a
buddy and let them copy it and they'll
be able to play it but I really do like
this new part of the new Xbox experience
here so I'll go back so here are some of
the games you have and some of your
achievements open this up for you and
show you see the ultimately old games
from Guitar Hero to rock bands Call of
Duty 4 man kind of lists all your
achievements for all your old games
here's some of the achievements for the
games I downloaded from the Xbox
Marketplace like contra of pac-man
there's Gears of War Call of Duty 3 I
really can go back in time and see all
the stuff you've done for all your games
and a really cool visually represented
way you can see my little avatar dude
chilling out there and I'll get to him
in a minute
I'll go back your video library if you
have videos in here oops sorry keep
pushing the wrong button here alright
my xbox there we go so your music
library your picture library if you have
pictures in there Windows Media Center
if you happen to use a PC you want to
hook it up and all your system settings
so I have the xbox 360 elite which came
with 120 gigabyte hard drive with my
user settings new Xbox experience and
one game download on to the hard drive
I have 90s not ninety six point five
gigabytes free space each game takes
about leave only 20 ish gigabytes for
storage space so definitely be aware of
that so we'll go go up here and game
marketplace you can download you know
new games and new updates or something
you're most
video games push the wrong button there
we good okay so it's kind of nice and
simple all very graphically represented
the next walked you through the actual
overtime here and it takes you back to
your game library there's a video
marketplace and this is where you can
explore video content you can download
movies from here you can view new
arrivals our most popular movies and TV
shows actually so I'll go ahead and go
into browse I'll show you what this
looks like so let's go ahead and view
all movies it's thinking about queuing
up a list here here you go that starts
right at the top and some of them are in
HD some of them are not but the quality
is very good one thing to know though
these are not streaming movies meaning
as soon as you hit play it won't start
playing like it does on the Apple TV
actually has to download the whole movie
that can depend on your internet
connection for me it takes about an hour
an hour and a half to download a whole
movie you may vary for you and see you
notice that it says HD right down below
the movie poster
so it says Alexander 2004 175 minutes
rated R and HD and the cost really
varies per movie and same thing for TV
shows and different collections that
they have so I'll go back out of here
back out one more time so one cool thing
is actually one of the big reasons I got
the new Xbox is for Netflix and for
those of you outside of the US or just
don't know what Netflix is it is a movie
rental service lets you go online and
fill out a list of movies that you want
and they mail them to you in the mail in
DVD or blu-ray format and as soon as you
finish watching it you put it back to
the mail the next one on your list shows
up now you manage a list online called a
queue and a lot of these movies in your
queue are actually able to be viewed
online from your computer PC or Mac and
what this does lets you watch those
movies that you can watch in your
computer on your xbox so I'll give you
an example here I'll open up Netflix
you guys can see me stand-in there in
the reflection
it actually has to log you out of Xbox
Live in order to do this and then
immediately connects you to your Netflix
queue just like we're connecting an
Apple TV to your television or comparing
an iPhone remote to your Mac it gives
you a little bit of a code you go onto
Netflix comm and type in that code and
you're good to go so here's some movies
that I have in my queue that are
available to be streamed online so let's
pick the first one here Pan's Labyrinth
I'll open it up and show you guys what
it looks like so I'll go ahead and push
the a green button here puts around give
that a push tells you everything about
the movie we'll go ahead and restart it
time watched it earlier determinate my
video quality so essentially checking
out your internet connection
making sure it's capable of streaming
video and if it is whether it can be
streamed in high quality or low quality
and if it can be streamed in high
quality it will do it by default it's
not full HD I believe it can stream at
720 it does look very good though takes
a little while to determine the video
quality but I want you guys to see this
in real time so I'm going to leave the
camera on
all right see now it's telling you it's
being presented in HD which is nice I've
got a pretty nice internet fidelity here
get in the movie ready to go
being able to watch movies online
through Netflix really is a nice
addition to the Xbox it really takes it
away from a gaming center console
it's more of a Media Console it happens
to be something that does play games
which is nice
and something the PlayStation you know
tries to do as well they don't have a
Netflix streaming right now PlayStation
just has a PlayStation Network where you
can just download some TVs and movies
and in games as well so it's still
letting me know it's been presented in
HD and still thinking about playing it
all right let's all ready to go see a
little status bar on the bottom they're
letting you know when it's getting close
with the big Xbox Live branding with the
Netflix branding on top so status bar is
halfway there pull it along nicely
all in all it's not a three to
five-minute process to get a movie
queued ready to go which is actually not
bad considering you're streaming an HD
quality movie or close to HD quality
movie right over the interwebs so let's
get in there
still thinking about it hauling along
okay and now it's done and the movie
will just start playing I can't tell you
the quality does look fantastic if I
won't be able to see on the video but it
does look really good so let me get out
of here and let's get back to walking
through the dashboard okay so here we
are back on the dashboard so go back to
where we were video marketplace and
we'll continue along this there was
Netflix got a chance to see that in
action Christmastime in south park all
kinds of other choices and just another
way for them to blast you with
advertising again just another way from
to advertise to you and it ends with
your video library so friends if you
hold list of your friends oops
thank you push the wrong button here
hold it of all your friends you can see
whether they're awake or sleeping I
don't have that many friends on here yet
I've done requests I have to sort
through them inside Xbox so that stuff
might be interested in and there's these
change kind of on an hourly basis here
gamer spotlight you're in the movies and
some free videos some events you can
view Xbox sponsored events and we're
right back where we started at spotlight
so under my xbox here you don't upstairs
a little avatar John for Lakers guy tips
you have the ability to go through and
customize your avatar so I'm going to
show you that right now
customized avatar first time you load up
the new Xbox experience you're greeted
with just a myriad of add Vitara options
you can change feed exchange features
here you can see you can change your
hair your eyes eyebrows
I have bushy eyebrows let's give myself
a goatee now give myself a 70s mustache
and I here's black so we'll make it dark
nice and easy you can change your
clothes and everything um I would not
look good with a mustache why don't you
get a whole bunch of avatar changing
options nearly it's time a nice feature
and it's very reminiscent of the me
feature on being attend elite he does a
little wee-wee avatar like dance and
he'll show up in some of the smaller
games you can download from Xbox Live so
I just want to give you a real quick
demonstration the new Xbox experience
overall I've been really happy with it
I like being able to download games to
the hard drive that's the biggest thing
for me and Netflix or the two must-have
features that I wanted in the Xbox and I
was very happy that they did it actually
they were the two big pushes to get me
to purchase an Xbox again hours I had
sold mine probably about a year ago so
just a real quick tour through this guys
hope you enjoyed I'll do some more in
depth Xbox videos coming soon
including some comparison videos of the
Xbox vs the PlayStation 3 and talked
about pros and cons of each console
anyway guys hope you enjoyed see you in
