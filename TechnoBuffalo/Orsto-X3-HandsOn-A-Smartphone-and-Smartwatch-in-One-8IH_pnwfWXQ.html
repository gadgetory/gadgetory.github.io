from TechnoBuffalo and today we have a
very cool hands-on for you guys there's
been a lot of interest in the SmartWatch
market recently and we've seen a lot of
devices from pebble LG Samsung and many
of us but there's one thing to all these
wearables have in common and that's that
they rely on a smartphone now with the
ortho x3 you get a smartphone and a
SmartWatch in a single device so you
don't really need to connect it to an
external handset what's different about
the x3 is that you can insert any micro
sim card and be on your way that means
you can get up and running on a lot of
mobile networks across the globe and we
actually tried it on t-mobile and it
actually worked fairly well and in terms
of call quality that extra sounds
surprisingly good and the speakers are
loud enough to hear someone on the other
line and the mic is great too so people
were able to hear me even out in busier
areas such as the beach and when it
comes to performance is expected for
what it is a lot is packed into such a
small wearable the x3 has a 1.5 4 inch
LCD display with a resolution of 240 x
240 a 1.2 gigahertz dual-core processor
500 megabytes of ram 4 gigabytes of
internal storage a 5 megapixel camera
and an OS based on android 4.0 called or
stow which to us strangely looks a lot
like windows phone aside from its
ability to act as a standalone
smartphone the extra performs pretty
much every function you'd expect from a
SmartWatch it'll feed you notifications
give you information and of course tells
you the time and a pretty cool thing is
that you can actually type directly on a
screen too though things obviously get
cramp on the 1.5 4 inch screen it's
doable but very difficult for longer
conversations from a design standpoint
or so is pretty decent the watchband
definitely gives it a high-end look
though the watch itself is huge that's
expected of a watch with this kind of
functionality but it's still much larger
than the devices like the G watch and
you're live and when it comes to the
battery the xrays battery life isn't the
greatest so far we've been able to get
through a full workday but you
definitely have to charge it overnight
which is the same kind of problem we've
seen with other Android wear devices
unless you have something like the
pebble steel which can go for about a
week or so says it because of x3 is
based on android 4.0 you can actually
use thousands of apps from social media
to fitness to games and puzzles but
unfortunately the watch won't connect to
our Wi-Fi so we couldn't really download
anything to show you guys now when it
comes to the camera
it's pretty awful it's only there for
video calls and selfies but the lens
itself isn't particularly wide which
means it's right up in your grill but
you can also use the camera to take
normal pictures but the results aren't
that great especially compared to a
phone compared to something like the
pebble steel or Google's Android where
the x-ray definitely stands out but
stuffing an entire phone into a wearable
definitely has its limitation it's not
nearly powerful enough to replace the
phone you have now and it's 1.5 inch
screen means you can't comfortably
browse the web or look at pictures the
ability to make and receive phone calls
is pretty impressive though and this
would be a neat gadget to travel with if
you were concerned about losing your
phone but I wouldn't recommend this is a
replacement for something like the
galaxy s5 especially for the price
actually will cost you almost six
hundred dollars when you can buy
something like the one plus one for
three hundred dollars or a nexus 5 for
three hundred fifty dollars or says X 3
is a gadget that embraces the 21st
century but unfortunately you fall short
in a lot of areas this is definitely a
luxury item if you have the money and it
might be a fun device to try out but
otherwise it needs a lot of work before
we can challenge the current crop
smartwatches anyways that's it for this
video guys is just a quick hands-on and
look at the or so x3 SmartWatch if you
guys have any questions let us know in
the comments down below and as always a
marklin sanger from technobuffalo i'll
see you guys in the next video thank you
