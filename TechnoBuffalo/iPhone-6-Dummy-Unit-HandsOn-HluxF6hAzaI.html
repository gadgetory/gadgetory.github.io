to you by gamefly what's up everyone
john wrench from TechnoBuffalo heerd
I've got in my very eager your sweater
than it should be hand a mock-up of
potentially could be the iphone 6 let's
go ahead just check out every minut
detail this guy and see what Apple might
unveil in august or September let me
give thee let me give the disclaimers
Before we jump into this guy this is not
from Apple this is not sort of leak that
came out of apples factory this is just
built based on the renders and schematic
so it's a potentially a look at what the
iphone 6 could look like you want to get
that totally out of the way we'll bring
other devices for comparison but i want
to run through this real quickly so
first you'll notice pretty chunky bezels
on the side i wouldn't assume that when
the phone gets released the bezels
aren't going to look like this at all so
we've got the gold model here you can
see it's got that sort of a 5s gold ring
around the home button so home button is
going to stay around the left hand side
of the Vice you've got the volume up and
down that we've seen and of course your
profiles which are my favorite features
of iPhones on the right hand side
something new so nano SIM tray it's been
there before that's where your power and
lock buttons going to be removed from
the top really because it phones bigger
it's harder to get your finger at the
top so that is now going to live on the
right hand side on the bottom things
going to look pretty similar what we've
seen before we got your lightning
connector 3.5 millimeter headset jack
and speakers which clearly not all cut
out things get a little bit different
now i hear on the back so the first
thing you notice it's missing and i know
this is right away dual LED flash I'm
hoping that's just in a mission on this
dummy unit now of course and make it to
the production it'd be weird to have it
go away unless there's some crazy single
bulb flash I can do awesome things
here's the camera module presumably it's
going to be upgraded to about a 16
megapixel unit but if you can see it's
got a bit of a raise to it doesnt sit
flush with a mile itself hopefully again
that's a peculiarity of this device that
I've got in front of me but we have for
rumors that this is indeed going to be
the case with the production model so
I'm hopeful that's not going to happen
so the big story
he recited from the design and design
through looks reminiscent I think of an
HTC One m8 with the bands I'll be the
apple logo such in the middle but this
is going to be the look of the iphone 6
I got the gold one out here as well so
the screen it is bigger now 4.7 inches
diagonal and it's also getting an
upgrade in the pixel department of the
rumors hold true you'll be looking at
960 x 1700 for mean it's going to have a
416 ppi if the 5.5 inch one does come it
should have the same resolution it'll
just lower the PPI down to about 356 we
take a quick break check it out this
iphone 6 to thank our friends at gamefly

playing for comparison here is an iphone
5s you can really see the difference
here in size this is 640 x 1136 with 326
ppi so if the resolutions hold with the
next generation models even the 5.5 inch
will have a higher ppi then we've got on
the iphone 5 so that 960 x 1704 should
mean all the apps application should
just sort of grow i'm not going to be
able to see any extra rows or columns
will just be bigger i think a lot of
people might want to have now presumably
could change that and they could start
shrink things down a little bit and give
you a whole extra row of icons it could
open up api's for developers to be able
to show more on the screen but as it
stands right now i'd wager these
down long two things are just going to
be a little bit larger on the iphone 6
it doesn't have the weight that it's
going to ship we don't anything about
battering that kind of stuff presumably
it would be an a8 chip probably have
more ram 64 bit we know i don't imagine
i'm going to go to 128 but it feels
really nice in the hand this is sort of
a screen size it's becoming more
commonplace with phones the iphone 5s
which in itself was a bigger screen then
we saw on the iphone 4 the 4 s still a
net was paltry by comparison to what
androids offering and what Windows Phone
is offering so here are the two
side-by-side ixora see the difference
there this is noticeably thinner as well
than the iphone 5s you can sort of see
that if I make a phone sandwich you can
see how thin this really is especially
see the thinnest if I bring in an iphone
5c you can see how thin both of those
look and wilshire show a presumably will
be the whole family tree right out here
it's a really nice looking device think
it's obviously gonna be a big seller for
Apple I think a lot of people left iOS
going to end it because they wanted a
bigger screen so this hopefully will get
people back and then the 5.5 inch phone
I should continue the migration status
apples hope but people left went to
Android they might find that they've
liked it enjoyed it if no reason to
leave so it should be interesting to see
what this larger screen actually does
and how Apple serve rectifies now
they've got diversified screen sizes are
going to be fragmentations or not it's
gonna be the same experience just bigger
you know really curious what they're
going to do with that overall though I
like to look of it it certainly is a
evolutionary design nothing
revolutionary but a bigger screen and a
revamped iOS 8 you're just hopefully
will bring a slew of new features should
be enough ok papo competitive and end
excel into 2014 and then into the later
part of 2015 what you guys think of this
is something that you would like to see
not want to see it love to hear your
thoughts on it please leave it all in

see more you want to see coverage versus
other devices HTC One galaxy s5s let us
know as well we'll do a whole bunch of
calories on those as well until next
