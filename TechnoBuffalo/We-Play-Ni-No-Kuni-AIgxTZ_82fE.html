editor at technobuffalo calm and I'm
here with a look at me no kuni wrath of
the white bitch for the PlayStation 3
alright I just wanted to apologize right
off the bat if you watch we play
regularly then you probably have noticed
that I have a little bit of a nasally
voice right now my wife brought home
some sort of terrible infection I've
been trying to recover from this is like
I said Nina Cooney and I wanted to
clarify right now that I'm about five
hours into this game with this safe
state that I loaded up to play through
for you guys I tried to pick a moment
where there was really nothing
story-wise happening just so that I
could kind of show you the mechanics of
the combat system and the visuals that
are blown up by Studio Ghibli in level
five those two things are really
important but the story is crazy
important to this game in my opinion and
I really hate it when creamy videos room
story elements so I'm doing my best to
completely ignore that I will say this
your name is Oliver and for one reason
or another you have journey to another
world knee no kuni literally means
another world or the second country in
Japanese and you're here to do something
don't want to give it away
alright so if you didn't notice the
combat mechanics here kind of a really
interesting blend of what JRPG fans
might be familiar with the tale series
and that's that real-time 3d combat
system alongside Pokemon believe it or
not but the familiar is those things
does that I was tossing out in battle
those guys can be caught and raised a
lot like your Pokemon system you don't
have to dive into the tall grass in
order to find them but they do come up
in the real world or in the game world I
should say and basically familiars are
your fighting friends you can fight with
Oliver which you're seeing here but then
when the enemies maybe call for a
different tactic or a different
alignment you might want to toss how too
familiar or you should toss out a
familiar in order to deal with them and
each familiar comes with different
traits different abilities different I
mean equipment possibilities as well so
they're all totally unique and I'm gonna
say this right now if you do play the
Pokemon franchise you might have this
strange desire to stick with your
starting familiars I know I did and I
shouldn't attack I know I did but as you
get down into the game your starters
really aren't that awesome so just don't
worry about using your starter
selectively you can try other familiars
no one will be mad at you I but it's a
really any combat system and it's one
that that the game kind of explains
fairly well there's this really weird
problem with JRPGs where you have some
that over teach and some that under
teach and if you've ever tried to get
into like an 80-hour JRPG for instance
where they over teach the combat system
it's really hard to get excited about
the opening hours of the game because
you're so bogged down with tutorial they
pretty much throw all sorts of
ridiculous mechanics at you at once and
then kind of say go and you're just left
to your own just go figure this out
you're gonna fight and die alot good
luck and enjoy Nina Cooney is guilty a
little bit of the opposite I will say
that it kind of doles out new combat
features that a slow
it's not until five or six hours in the
game that you start to experience the
lion share of combat but as the game
advances the combat tactics should
change the emphasis moves from offense
in my opinion at least the emphasis
moves from offense and evasion to
defense you're going to want to focus so
hard on defense towards the latter
levels of this game at a lot of areas
the boss fights are so tough that not
focusing on defense will be your
downfall but the game doesn't really
tell you this in so many words it shows
you once or twice that defense is key in
order to open up critical spots and
maybe get your enemies beaten down
enough to go into what are called
miracle moves you won't see that in this
video so I'm not really going to explain
it too hard but the game sort of allies
on you to figure out the combat system
for some that's awesome for me I liked
it actually I mean it was a nice
challenging affair towards the middle
portion of the game I started to get a
little bit frustrated I had to back up
and reevaluate the way I was playing and
it was there that I kind of realized you
know it's time to slow down it's time to
do some psychic was a while I'm on it do
some side quests do not ignore the side
quest in this game you have merit stamps
and merit cards that you fill up and
trade in and order to unlock abilities
some of these abilities basically are
key to combat and you really won't be
able to fight very well without them so
just take my advice focus on defense and
do the side quests
on
alright by now you should have
recognized really two major things that
I was going to hit on with the remainder
of this we play episode first of all the
art style it's studio G blade if you're
a fan of Japanese anime at all or you've
ever seen any animated features like
really famous ones like spirited away or
my neighbor totoro or Nausicaa valley of
the wind or Howl's Moving Castle
probably Princess Mononoke is one of the
most famous those are all done by Studio
G bleep their art style is really
simplistic really straightforward but
it's also one that is very very easy to
recognize Studio G we worked with level
5 in order to bring the art style of
Nina community wrath of the White Witch
to life the game looks and feels like a
studio ghibli movie and for fans of
those movies that's an amazing
compliment and it's really an amazing
feat as well it comes together so nicely
and you could probably argue that this
game wouldn't be as good if it wasn't
for that studio G Blue Magic and touch I
mean it really the to kind of go hand in
hand at making some Japanese entertainer
properties fantastic other thing is the
music the battle music is ok you know I
like it but the overworld music that's
the stuff that you hear when you're
outside of battle I think sounds
wonderful and it's performed live by the
Tokyo Philharmonic Orchestra is it
Philharmonic it's an orchestra from
Tokyo and it was written by the same
fellow that wrote that writes most of
the music for the studio GP things
himself so even the music carries this
air of G bleah if you're a fan of those
flicks you're familiar with them you're
going to feel right at home in this game
I'm a big fan of studio G bleah and that
was probably one of the major attracting
points for me when it comes to Nino
Cooney and they delivered on that the
story feels like it was ripped from a
studio cheaply flicked and that's so
awesome I really can't emphasize that
enough
all right I'll leave it here with a
quick dialogue bitching to the voice
acting Oliver is ok but trippy your
sidekick is great this really awesome
Welsh accent appears when you use the
English version of the audio file you
can use the Japanese as well both are
great so thank you guys for watching and
we'll have on more on me no kuni on
technobuffalo com here we are I'll buy
