checking out iOS 7 the gold master seed
so one of the first things we want to
cover is the folder behavior if you
haven't seen iOS 7 now you have these
sort of animations that kind of come up
which is you know pretty nice it's a
little it's smooth it's not too bad when
you touch the home button if you're in a
nap let's say you're in yelp you will
actually end up going back out to that
folder and then tapping the home button
again brings you back out we have what's
new control center is new so now you
have these quick access buttons also a
brightness toggle your iTunes playlist
if you're playing anything on iTunes or
even in songs are do things like that of
course airdrop is new airplay has been
there and then quick toggles for
flashlights you got your clock you can
jump into your alarm or a timer
stopwatch calculator and your camera so
I'm some quick access tools there a much
better setup and layout than iOS 6 in my
opinion if we double tap the home button
you can see the multitasking is new you
can check out all the different things
that you've been doing apps that you've
been in and if you would like to get rid
of any of them you can swipe right up
and sorry you can swipe right up and
it'll go away so let's get back out of
there and let's check out search so
search now no longer on the side of the
phone we've gone over some of this in
our original iOS 7 tour but just wanted
to recap just in case you forgot about
it so now search is up there and you can
search your whole iphone for anything
that you've been looking for and of
course your notification shade it comes
right down comes right down from the top
of your screen and you don't have to
worry about about having a like swipe
over other screens things like that so
pretty basic stuff all most of the
things that we've kind of come to know
and love and iOS are still here in iOS 7
just slightly modified of course one of
the things that is different is your
photo albums so they're now doing
collections so if we open up our
collections you can see i have monday
through today and then my trip to berlin
is here but if i wanted to look back on
anywhere in particular i was taking
pictures you can see you've got all
these great little icons and you can go
all the way back two years so here's my
last few years using iOS when the gold
master seed came out they actually
unleashed a whole bunch of different
wallpapers on us so let's check out the
different wallpapers shall we so now I
in your stills there are some new
pictures here these are these are kind
of new there's some colorful stuff
happening and then of course your
gradients different pictures in nature
which Apple always likes to have I am
pretty fond of that it's very brightly
colored matches the outside of my phone
if I wanted to look at the dynamic ones
before they're only used to be two there
used to be this one right here this blue
and this sort of gray down here and now
they have ones to match the iphone 5c so
if you wanted to have these sort of
dynamic wallpapers and wow that is
extremely right in yellow you could do
that if you wanted to and you can see of
course these actually move based on your
your movement so if you wanted to just
check out those that's kind of fun I
prefer still wallpapers let's check out
some of the ringtones and alert tones
that have been added in this gold master
if we let's just check out ringtones
actually they've moved all of the
classic ringtones into its own folder so
if you ever wanted to go back you can
you can get those old-school iphone
ringtones like your old timey phone and
things like that but now we've got some
new stuff starting right there so here's
very kind of news like
it's a lot of new a lot of new ringtones
you can i'm sure you guys will have fun
going through those there's also new
alerts as well so if we wanted to check
out some of those that's what they sound
like again they have a classic folder so
you can access anything that you might
want or that you're used to from your
previous build of iOS but new stuff in
here which is like kind of fun I always
like looking all the new ways to
customize your phone which is always
cool and as Android lovers know it's
always fun to customize your phone so um
so let's check out some more stuff one
of the things that is very interesting
is when the beta came out in Safari and
your options you had you you had the
option of using keychain which is
Apple's sort of new kind of password
LastPass one password password manager
that's actually not here anymore you
can't use that however when you go to
change your pass code for your device it
actually tells you do you want to change
your pass code for keychain so it's
definitely still there in the
architecture but it's not present in the
front you know and what you're seeing on
the user interface well now onto some
things that I was surprised did not get
changed one of the things is there's a
couple of apps that are native first
party apps for Apple like I books that
were not changed I mean these are this
is the same skeuomorphic design that
we've seen before really shocked that
they did not change this almost makes me
wonder if they're working on a larger
change for ibooks and the newsstand in
general and in case you were wondering
one of the nice things speaking of
newsstand is yes you can in fact throw
it into a folder now so if you've ever
wanted to get rid of that newsstand now
you can if you want to look at music of
course here is your very lovely iTunes
music interface here's iTunes radio you
can start listening of course that's
available to you your genius playlists
your regular playlists and of course
your albums so here's the new keyboard
this is the iOS 7 keyboard which is a
little flatter it's a little bit
different obviously something that is
not too different from the previous
version but definitely a design change
so we're looking at this in Safari so
they have changed it for their native
apps but it looks like it's up to the
developer to implement because if you go
into something like Google Plus it's
actually going to end up being the
regular keyboard so here it is so that's
the old iOS 6 keyboard so it's
definitely going to be up to the app
developer I know a lot of talk has been
on the internet about having to buy apps
that have been previously purchased
because of the new 64-bit architecture
and am I going to have to purchase a new
version of the app that remains to be
seen it's likely that some apps will do
that it's likely that some apps will not
do that so hopefully won't be too many
but that is a really brief tour of the
things that are a little bit different
and some things that like I said have
not changed since the beginning of the
beta which we're surprising to me like
find my friends and the iBooks the
iBooks design but that's it for iOS 7 a
gold master seed if you guys are picking
this up next week if you're buying a new
iphone let me know in the comments if
