from TechnoBuffalo and today we'll be
checking out mobile robo for the pc it's
a free Android PC management tool to
help you manage your Android device on
your PC much easier so let's go ahead
and see what mobile Robo is all about
more often than none when you plug in
your Android device on your PC you're
greeted with a folder view to manage
your files and that's not really an
elegant way to access your photos your
videos and music folders on your PC but
we Robo is a cross-platform software
that helps you move your information
between Android and iOS devices now this
essentially eliminates the frustration
of losing your calendars contacts photos
and other information stored on your
device when you want to make the switch
to a different platform think of this as
an iTunes alternative for your Android
device so taking a closer look at the
app it's a beautifully designed app you
can either connect your Android
smartphone via USB or by scanning a QR
code to start a wireless connection to
your phone however you would have to
download the mobile market app first in
order for you to connect via Wi-Fi now
once you connect your device or sync
your device through Wi-Fi you're greeted
with an overview of your phone now I
have my Nexus 5 plugged in via USB and
is showing me a picture of my Nexus 5 on
the left hand side and I could take a
screenshot of what's on my screen and
export it automatically to my desktop
which can be pretty handy at times
especially if you want to be able to see
that screenshot on your computer right
away
and at the bottom it's showing me how
much space I have on my device and to
the right side of that is my battery
percentage and an overview of how many
apps photos videos or contacts I have
currently on my device so if we click on
the apps for example it'll take us to
the app section and from here you can
see all of the apps you have installed
on your device and you can even update
an app directly from your PC so you
don't need to go to the Google Play
Store on your device to download it now
if we go down to web resources and under
applications we can see some apps that
you can download and install directly
onto your device now there's also mobile
market for Android which is an
alternative to the Google Play Store you
can download mobile market directly from
mobile robos website and what's awesome
about mobile market are the various
categories you can choose from like the
best apps of January or the most
searched apps which can give you a good
idea of content to load up on your phone
but not just that within the mobile
market app there are various of tools to
help you clean out your phone and
improve performance basically a scans
your phone and removes residual files
that it believes are junk to make your
device
happier now moving back to the mobile
robo app there's a tab on here for music
where you can transfer your own music
from your PC or add ringing tones or
notification tones now the cool thing
about this section though is if you have
a certain song you want to make your
ringtone and don't want to spend money
again for a song you already bought this
app will let you do that and you can
transfer that ringtone you just made
directly to your phone which makes
everything so much easier now moving on
to images this is where you can see
what's on your device and what's on your
PC you can export or backup all your
photos with one click which is super
helpful but just like the app section
you can check out their wallpaper Center
to browse through different backgrounds
you might want to download and install
now there's a bunch of categories to
choose from whether you're into cars
space or plants they have it all there's
also videos tab which you can see what
videos you have on your device just like
the images you can back them up to your
PC and delete it off your device etc etc
and there's also a video Center under
web resources which were assuming you
can download short clips but it's
currently under construction so we can't
really tell you more about it now moving
on there's also a theme section inside
MOBA Robo which lets you browse and
download thousands of popular themes
that includes both custom icons widgets
and wallpapers although you have to use
their own custom mobile launcher in
order for you to apply the theme now
moving on to the last tab which is a
toolbox section this is probably where
mobile Robo shines the most you can
manage your contacts check your SMS look
at your call logs use their built in
file manager to see what you have on
your device and probably the coolest
feature is the ability to send SMS
messages from your PC it works but not
as well as I'd hope it would give me an
error saying my SMS didn't send when it
actually sent and I tried it several
times but I wasn't able to send messages
properly without the error message
popping up and Todd actually got a
similar message when he was trying out
this feature and it said that his
Android 4.4 device isn't supported so he
was only able to view messages and not
reply nonetheless having this feature on
a single application that could do other
tasks as well worth a try now other
features in this section is ability to
backup or restore your device you can
backup your contacts your SMS your call
logs your pictures your apps and many
many more by pressing one single button
and you can even restore all of that
with a single press of a button - which
is super convenient now there are tons
of third-party applications out there
that
allow you to manage texts phone calls
content your phone and more but Moberg
who puts all of this together into one
easy to use application that keeps
everything in sync so considering all
these features mobile robot offers it's
gotta cost money right actually it's
free so you just have to download the
app to your phone install the PC client
and you're all set you can back up your
device make ringtones and send messages
from your PC and you can download the
mobile robo app on the company's site
