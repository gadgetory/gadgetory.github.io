TechnoBuffalo here with another
smartphone Smackdown this time we've got
the iPhone 4 and the Challenger the new
kid on the block
the Samsung built Nexus S we're gonna
put these two head-to-head into five
round tests and see who's gathering so
there are obviously a ton of topics that
we can cover I'm gonna try and cover the
most important and most salient and try
and get through all of this in an under
six minute comparison so we're going to
talk about speed text entry screen
browser and some extras and see if we
can declare a winner at the end both of
these phones manage memory very
differently but let me show you that all
the applications have been cleared
iPhone nothing open there with
Gingerbread on the Nexus S you can
actually manage your running
applications right from the menu so I'll
go ahead and jump right into manage apps
and show what's running and all I've got
there is a keyboard and settings live
wallpapers have been turned off alright
so for speed both these are running on
the same Wi-Fi network let's try and
load the same web right to both of these
pages would obviously be loaded before
so it's a test of websites that you
visit on a regular basis we'll go ahead
and do a refresh on each go ahead and do
the same thing here as well I hadn't at
the same time again on the same Wi-Fi
networks so we've got go right there I'm
go right there and they are both off I
should mention from a processor
standpoint both are running a very
similar processors 1 gigahertz
hummingbird here in the Nexus S and the
system-on-a-chip the a4 in the iPhone
well it looks like that was almost
identical let's try running that test
one more time and see if there's any
sort of speed difference here cuz that
was pretty much too close to call
we've got them both loading if the Nexus
S is showing a bit more content first
Nexus S is done iPhone is still loading
so you'll give this round finally had
sort of definitive answer to the Nexus S
and I will say it's representatives or
some other side
I visited nexus s has been a little bit
faster alright so let's go ahead and
talk about some applications and show
the speed here we'll load some like
applications I've got Angry Birds here
on both I'll go ahead and launch both of
these and once again it looks like the
Nexus S loaded things just a little bit
faster we'll go ahead and go back home
and all these things are still going to
stay running it's go ahead take a look
at calendar one of the things that can
often be a bit slow to load would go
ahead do that both here as well calendar
loaded a little bit faster on the Nexus
S let's go ahead and try camera loaded
just a second later on the iPhone still
took longer to load on the iPhone so we
still add a quicker lo despite my
inaccurate fingers on the Nexus S so
from a speed standpoint the Nexus S
really is a screamer it optimizes the
hummingbird process or chipset that
we've seen in all of the galaxy s
devices and the phone is just very fast
not to say the iPhone 4 the speed slouch
but the hardware and the software a
really done a nice job of being
optimized together on the Nexus S so
this rounds going Nexus s alright now
let's talk about text entry both of
these are slab phones that don't have
physical keywords so you've got input
text using the screens the Nexus S
features a new keyboard it's unique to
Gingerbread C it's a little better laid
out it's got some spaces between the
keys you couldn't protect normally as
you would just type in and you also have
the voice to text feature down there
which works very well you can do it in
landscape or portrait the iPhone has a
very similar keyboard layout you could
type in portrait or landscape and
there's no sort of alternative entry for
text entry so either it's vertical or
horizontal but either way you're stuck
with the key word there is no voice
option here now with Android go ahead
and add swipe or its ton of other
third-party keyboards so from a text
entry into raw keyword standpoint this
really is a very close draw if you're
just comparing this to this however when
you look at that little icon right there
and is very accurate
text-entry not to mention third-party
support the Nexus S is going to once
again take the text entry round alright
so let's talk about screen a lot has
been made about this contour display
here on the Nexus X it's a little bit
round and practical use you don't really
notice it it's kind of cool to see it so
to sit better on your face the Nexus S
does feature a four inch Super AMOLED
display essentially means that the touch
mechanism used to touch the screen is
integrated into the glass as opposed to
sitting on top like traditional touch
screens I didn't have a resolution of
800 by 480 and with all sort of Super
AMOLED screen if you've ever seen a
Galaxy S series phone knows that there's
a little bit of a twinge of color to it
almost looks a little grey or blue
that's definitely the case here with the
Nexus S as well I will say the screens
on both do look beautiful they show
great images the iPhones got a 3.5 inch
screen with the display of 960 by 640
and a lots been made about the Retina
display now this is really a Super
AMOLED darker colors richer colors
versus a higher resolution so that's
gonna come down to really what looks
better for your eyes however my eyes I
prefer the higher resolution while
watching video on the iPhone
unfortunately showing that on YouTube
recording it's definitely able to see
the video fidelity but I will say that I
personally preferred the screen on the
iPhone versus a Super AMOLED screen on
the Nexus S so screen is going to go to
be Nexus S I'm sorry it's gonna go to
the iPhone rather going to the iPhone
screen going to the iPhone all right
let's talk very quickly about browsers
both of these feature multi-touch
browsers based on WebKit standards that
can do all kinds of goodness pinch and
zoom works pretty well
you've got integrated just played a
YouTube video there we've got YouTube
that can sort of integrate to each of
these pinch to zoom is not as smooth on
Android as it is on the iPhone 4 however
Android can play flash content slash
10.1 which is not necessarily the most
important thing to me personally but I
know a lot of you rely very heavily on
being able to view
slash content it is a battery drain you
can turn it on or off if you want to
make that battery sacrifice but with
most browsers or videos and browser
comparisons that I've done the addition
of flash and the opening up of content
that that gives you gives this round
right back to the Nexus S alright so
let's talk about some extras and little
things that the operating systems are
going to come with one of the things
that Android is really getting known for
very quickly is its navigation and it's
Google Maps Navigation which is a free
turn-by-turn navigation option on the
iPhone you've got a ton of navigation
choices but you have to pay for them
either in a one lump-sum it'll store the
maps on your phone or a subscription
things like AT&amp;amp;T TeleNav service which
relies on the network I having to pay
for features like that not necessarily
the biggest fan of especially when there
are three options available on a myriad
of Android devices I do like the ease
and simplicity of the iPhone the iPhone
is actually my daily driver I've gotten
used to it I really don't like the
built-in mail client that comes on the
iPhone and Android gives you a bit more
options with their native Gmail client
so when it comes to sort of intangibles
there's something to be said about
having an iPhone the way it looks in the
way it feels it's a very seamless
process it's a very added walled garden
integration so you serve stuck within
apples limitations Android is very open
you customize it any way you want to
make it sort of feel and look the way
you most prefer this one is really a
personal preference and my personal
preference is I prefer the iPhone
operating system over Android but
objectively Android definitely brings
more to the table than iOS does so from
an extra is anything you can do with
Android all the customizations you can
make if you choose to sir the stock
Android the way it looks say your
grandmother were to buy the phone is
still a very elegant interface so the
extras has to go to Android so this one
was very very very much a blowout with
the Nexus S taking speed taking text
entry the iPhone taking screen and the
Nexus S grabbing back browser and extras
this was an absolute smack
of the Nexus S vs the iPhone we've got a
new king ladies and gentlemen the Nexus
S video what a little longer that I
wanted I was trying to make it as
concise as possible if any other
questions or things that you want to see
brought head-to-head in future rounds of
iPhone versus Nexus axes go ahead and
let me know and leave your comments down
below I'll see you guys the next video
bye-bye
so one last point that I want to bring
up while doing these phone comparisons
heads ahead it's really important to try
and leave your personal opinions aside
and look very objectively at the
operating systems so despite the fact
that I am an iPhone user and that's what
I use this daily device I can appreciate
Android what it brings the table there's
a lot of customizations a lot of
elegance and a lot of power in this
operating system so whether you have
preconceived notions about which phone
you're going to like if you're in the
market for a new phone you owe it
yourself to look at both operand systems
because you might find Apple might sway
in one way and Droid might sway another
and they really are two fantastic
choices and you can't go wrong with
either now I really will see in the next
video goodbye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
