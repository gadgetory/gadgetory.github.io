size yeah you've seen dazed the confused
I love that movie Matthew McConaughey
stand outside the rec center is kind of
you know old man in a young man's body I
kind of lecherous character and he says
that about you know I get older they
stay the same age for some reason that
that's the first thing that came to mind
when I opened up the box today from
sprint it's the epic 4g touch sprints
take on the galaxy s2 it's got a 4.5
inch display and I just keep thinking
man these phones get bigger I stay the
same size I'm getting older too
alright so here's the epic 4g touch it's
going to be the first galaxy s2 phone to
hit the u.s. from sprint and Samsung
this one will be officially available
September 16th for 1 99 99 on contract
from sprint although some other places
wirefly and Walmart already offering it
at a discount Walmart are reportedly
9999 for new customers and 154 99 with a
two-year extension of if you're a
current customer that's what I've heard
I haven't gone to walmart and tried to
buy one but anyway it's the first galaxy
s2 variant to ship on the US carrier and
they certainly want epic with this one a
4.5 2 inch Super AMOLED display 480 x
800 it is a thin thin phone it's got the
8 megapixel camera full 1080p video
recording and the whole deal from was
kind enough to send the whole deal you
know all that other stuff we'll get to
that in a minute sperm was kind enough
to send us a review loaner ahead of
launch here it is firing it up for the
first time as it boots up we'll show you
what else will put this up here so you
can see the boot sequence if you're into
that kind of stuff it's a 4g phone
obviously we'll see what else is in the
box here's all your manuals and your
micro USB to USB cable and your charger
and that's basically it you get the
phone you get the charger you're good to
go it's got the super amoled plus
display on thing I said plus before but
super amoled plus android 23 gingerbread
you've also got a 1.2 gigahertz Samsung
dual-core processor backed by a full gig
of ram mention the 8 megapixel rear
camera LED flash 1080p full HD video
recording and a 2 megapixel front facing
camera for video chat self-portraits all
that good stuff you've got the wimax
you've got an 1800 milliamp hour
you've got bluetooth of course mobile
hotspot Wi-Fi b/g/n the whole thing
little tour on the phone just incredibly
thin and light didn't mean to launch
that but I did it's kind of like
Samsung's take does it actually it does
it's like Samsung's take on HTC Sense
with the pinch to pinch to that is I'll
tell you why I any when the left side of
the phone left spine you get your rocker
switch on the bottom of the phone your
micro USB port and your microphone for
speaking into that's what microphones
are force being into on the right side
of the phone your power lock switch on
the top you've got a 3 FM your headphone
jack a little Qualcomm sticker and then
that spot where you stick your thumb
nail into probably back cover off or if
you're me you to struggle with it not
get the cover off and rip your thumbnail
apart on the back again the 8 megapixel
camera flash 1080p video capture cetera
et cetera the requisite branding you've
got kind of this what feels good when
you're of your fingers over it's kind of
a pebbled surface there on the back kind
of that fo carbon fiber pebbled thing a
little bit of a little bit of lip there
a little bit of a chin on the bottom and
then for capacitive touch buttons on the
front standard android buttons menu home
back search then you're a big bad 4.5 2
inch display haptic feedback going I
have not actually used the TouchWiz and
it's full incarnation here so
interesting to see what sprint has done
with it get your AP mobile now if we add
widgets here just click and hold and add
some widgets what we get so there's the
agenda AP mobile bookmark but he's now
month another agenda classic level
all those clocks I like the
implementation here of having the the
ability to add widgets be a little bit a
little bit less confusing to the
layperson and then also kind of easy to
drag you know move around decide which
screen you want to have your widget on
so if I wanted to
put my email widget here there you go
and fun to go back here and put on my
buddies now and today cool all right ap
mobile I suppose you at ap mobile does
go into apps here and see what it's
loaded with you've got the samsung stuff
all share the google stuff you know
gallery gmail google search all that
stuff Kies Air Samsung app then you've
got some of the Sprint stuff Nova to HD
pre-installed the sprint NASCAR app
sprint hotspot it's free music plus for
an ID pack all that kind of stuff so
kind of combination of the Samsung and
sprint apps or bloatware or you know
whatever you want to call it video maker
app shoot a video very lightweight phone
very very lightweight feels a little bit
plasticky the you know it's a while ago
now but the galaxy 2 s that I saw when
it was launched in Barcelona felt a
little more solid than this this one
there's a little bit plasticky but
that's not you know necessarily a good a
bad thing it's just a matter of personal
preference let's choose the home video
preview theme here and can I shoot some
video no not photo video normal self
recording here we go hi I'm nowhere from
TechnoBuffalo that's my light that's my
video camera that's my face those are my
eyebrows they're not as big as Peter
Gallagher's but they are rather
prominent that's all for now see ya all
right save and let's shoot another one
normal it's good
here's the box that comes with the
samsung sprint epic 4g touch galaxy s2
that's a mouthful well you don't get in
the phone in the box is an actual I
don't know what I was going to say
anyway here's the box there's my kinect
sensor there's my TV set there's the box
all right we'll save that and done now
how do we edit how's this work oh I can
put it there in a little transition and
what's that magic wand grayscale can i
embossed with some boss oh okay and then
split oh I didn't mean to split oops i
wanted to trim this at the end I got a
little carried away whoa crazy alright
so you can edit your videos right on the
phone there you go samsung male their
own app so there you go it's you know
swipe pre-installed let's go back
actually and before I say there you go
let's go back to the let's go back to
the camera
and just see what they've done with the
camera app here
now 48 picking 8-megapixel you can shoot
wide six and a half or 2.4 is 0.4 in
wide mode 69 or you can go 83.2 etc I've
got your ISO controls metering I mean
it's just crazy get this you know get
Mike's opinion here because he's our
resident imaging expert but just boggles
my mind what these things you can do
these days all these settings so then if
we go into the camcorder oops it's not
meant to do you even more controls now
over the camcorder mode so yeah so
recording mode I guess you're just
shooting 1080p is normal they don't put
the actual settings on there but you can
use the flash I mean I'll put the econo
resolution separate resolution okay go
full 1080p and you can set your white
balance can I actually manually adjust
the white balance now I can just choose
there's not a custom white balance still
though that's crazy more and more
capable all the time Wow alright well
again you know to me the big news is the
4.5 2 inch display and you know the the
speed of the processor as well I'm just
kind of a meandering about here in this
unboxing I know but I'm just kind of
fascinated with this thing cuz it's been
so long since I saw the first version I
want to go to which I want to type the
wide way
I mean that is a huge screen for typing
that the haptic feedback definitely
feels pingy you know the phone feels
very kind of plastic and lightweight and
you can feel the whole thing kind of
vibrate but you know pinch-to-zoom very
responsive tap and hold two points and
tilt device back and forth to reduce
were in large screen really whoa look at
that bow chicka bow bow bow chicka bow
bow this reminds me of the episode of
Saturday Night Live Well Jimmy Carter
was talking somebody threw a bad drug
trip on Nightline but that's another
story I'll tell you what very very
impressive first look out of the box
samsung not messing around with the
galaxy has two lines too bad took it so
long to get to the US but at least it's
finally here the first galaxy s2 to I
say to s the first galaxy s2 phone to
ship on the US carrier is from sprint
it's the epic 4g touch one 9999 on
contract direct from sprint September
16th but already up for pre-order
cheaper than that hunt around and you
will find a deal I'm sure but I am
looking forward to putting this one
through its paces over the coming days
and weeks and reporting back to you via
our website technobuffalo calm in the
meantime if you pick one of these up
definitely go to the site let us know
what you think until next time my name
is Noah thanks for watching thanks to
the folks at sprint for lending us this
one we'll see you next time
