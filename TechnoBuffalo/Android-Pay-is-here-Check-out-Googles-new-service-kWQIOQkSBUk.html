sanghun from TechnoBuffalo and google
last week started rolling out android
pay here in the US it's essentially a
direct competitor to Apple pay which was
introduced at the end of last year
Google said in a blog post that Android
pay is the most simple and secure way to
pay with your Android phone we use it to
see if that's really true Android pay
works with all NFC enabled Android
devices running Android 4.4 and above on
any carrier and at every tap in ready
locations across the u.s. it'll support
credit and debit cards from the four
major payment networks American Express
Discover MasterCard and Visa at the time
of making this video Google temporarily
allows unsupported wallet cards with
Android pay but banks won't be able to
properly track your spending for these
unsupported cards also if your card
happens to expire or needs to get
replaced you won't be able to add it on
to Android pay setting up Android pay is
fairly easy if you've used Google Wallet
before your card should show up in your
account once you hit the plus sign
choose a card enter the expiration date
and three-digit code and you should be
all set if you want to add a new card
you'll be able to do so by scanning your
card or if the camera can't quite pick
up your cards number you'll be able to
enter your information manually to the
interface for Android pay is quite
similar to Apple's own Apple pay which
displays a wallet with virtual versions
of all your cards if you have gift cards
loyalty programs and membership cards
you be able to add those cards as well
which will sit along with your credit
and debit cards we tried Android pay
with a vending machine that supports tap
and pay payments and authenticated to
payment fairly quick we also tried
android pay in mcdonalds and again it
worked just as advertised what a device
like the Nexus 6 which doesn't have a
fingerprint scanner you'll have to use a
pin code or pattern to authenticate the
payment it's not as quick or elegant as
having a fingerprint scanner but it does
get the job done
Android marshmallow is going to support
fingerprint technology natively so that
shouldn't be a problem when devices like
the new Nexus phones hit Google is also
working with some developers to
integrate Android pay with their own
apps to speed through mobile checkout
and Google said this feature will be out
later this year so far we haven't run
into any issues authenticating payments
and it works exactly as advertised it's
a pretty seamless experience to set up
and should only get better as time goes
on with Android pay now in the picture
what's going to happen a Google Wallet
well Google Wallet received a new update
which refocus is a lot
on person-to-person payments similar to
services like venmo and square cash
Google said to Android pay should be
available for download on Google Play in
the next few days and will come
pre-installed on new NFC enabled Android
phones from all four major US carriers
anyways thank you guys so much for
watching and if you guys enjoyed this
video make sure to give it a thumbs up
and we will see you guys in the next one
