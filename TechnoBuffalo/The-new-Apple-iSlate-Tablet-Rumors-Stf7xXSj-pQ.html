TechnoBuffalo here we got a new angle
going on behind me it's Christmas Day
honestly I just woke up three hours ago
haven't even showered but you guys won't
be able to tell through the camera
anyway he can't smell me but I just
wanted to share with you guys some of
the apple tablet rumors that are coming
they're coming fast and furious thought
this would be a great time to share them
with you first I want to win everybody a
happy holiday hope you're celebrating
with with your family if you don't
celebrate christmas hope you got to
spend some time with those that are most
important to you since that is obviously
the the biggest reason for the season
for all that sentimental stuff aside
let's talk about the apple tablet if you
guys remember back when the iphone came
out there was just a bevy of rumors
leading up to its launched about what it
was going to be but it was going to do
sort of hit a fever pitch and r at that
same point now with the tablet seems
like every day the new reputable sources
coming out with with a new rumor so on a
recap sort of where we stand on all the
apple tablet rumors what we've heard and
i think what we can expect so let's
start with an announcement allegedly
according to MacRumors Apple has a
January 26 date set aside for a tablet
announcement the reserved one of the
large conference centers they've used in
the past for for other events has it
been confirmed by apple it just been
reserved by a large technology
conglomerate so I would assume that
would probably be Apple I think we're
going to actually see this tablet
sometime in early 2010 so hooray for
that let's assume that that one is true
we know when we're going to see it what
is it going to be called well again
according to MacRumors those guys did
just a tremendous job doing some
research they found that the domain I
slate.com is registered to a certain
company in cupertino on infinite loop
now this supposed to have been hidden
Apple body through an intermediary
parties that name was going to come up
but I Bentley fer up about one week a
little while ago that was the hiddenness
of it became public and able to see that
a plot she bought the domain and
macrumors able to go back and track the
history be able to see that which is
pretty impressive so will the tablet
all the isolate I don't know but I can
see myself going into an apple store
saying hey let me check out the new
slate it's kind of a cool name a little
bit catchy I don't know if the I worked
in front of it but I guess that's the
Apple way also with the tab that we've
heard rumors of a 10 inch screen 12 inch
screen 7 inch screen now sources are
reporting that it's going to come in a 7
inch size of course capacitive screen so
you know bigger than the iphone but not
giant big enough you can carry around I
throw in your bag certainly not small
enough you can just toss in your pocket
probably a really nice size one of my
concerns at the tablet is how you're
going to interact with it how are you
going to type on a tablet if it's
running some custom version of the
iphone operating system then you still
think we could type a lot of website
centric stuff you know how is it going
to work well again folks the macrumors
shot out some really cool patent
information that Apple patented a little
while back for tactile feedback on a
mobile device now this is not just
haptic feedback where you push a button
and vibrates this is actually the screen
changing so I've gotten my iphone right
now I'm going to try and sort of show
you what I mean so pretend this is a
7-inch tablet of course it's just an
iphone 3gs when you are typing or
swiping you've got a very smooth surface
and on a smaller device you can see
where the keys are on the keyboard it's
nice and easy on a larger screen you
can't really hold it and move your thumb
it's gonna be little bit difficult so
supposedly what Apple has patented is
they sort of tactile feedback so the
screen will actually change depending on
what you're going to do little raised
ridges will show up on the device as
you're typing answer give you almost a
keyboard like fuel which is really cool
and super transformer II not sure it's
actually going to come to fruition on
the tablet but is one of the big rumors
as picking up a lot of steam is the
screen actually changing depending on
what you want to do which is really neat
for for swiping a flat surface is really
great those you have used an iphone or
any other capacitive touchscreen like
the droid or any other Android devices
well know what I'm talking about it's
very nice and very smooth and fluid but
I comes to typing and certainly would be
nice to have actual keys that you can
type either without looking or be able
to feel a little more where your thumbs
or fingers are going especially the
device is big enough that you can't just
touch type with your thumbs yeah
you have to use fingers I can get a
little cumbersome on a touch only device
that would be really really cool to to
see so again this is supposedly going to
be running a custom version of the
iphone operating system which I'm not
quite sure how that'll work allegedly
Apple has already contacted a few of the
big iphone developers asked them to
create apps on a larger resolution
screen supposedly all the apps that are
in the answer right now will be able to
be played on this new tablet I think the
company just have to remove their screen
resolution caps that they have on their
most people have programming put in
sizes for the iphone so that's the only
device out there and those are removed
it a lot of math a upscale to whatever
size device you're looking for or you're
playing on hopefully that will off lay
some of the fears people have had about
the tablet personally the itat was going
to be a great device if it even does
come to fruition for for magazines for
ebooks you know there's a great book
platform for the iPhone but you can't
read on something that small and just
hurt your eyes if you think about what
you can do want to tap it with magazines
I think that's really maybe where things
are going certainly print media is a
dying breed we look at physical
newspapers or magazines certainly their
subscription rates are going down people
are turning to mostly online to get
their information so I think sort of
this one encompass a device that you can
read everything on a larger screen
because for me it's too hard to do on
the iphone would be really nice of
course was sort of an apple flare on the
UI could be really cool there's been
talk about apple also working on
television deals with some of the major
networks to get sort of content on the
tablet so imagino in addition to just
being your magazine newspaper an
e-reader this tablet can also be what
you watch TV on and sort of have all
your content automatically either pushed
or downloaded through some I assume
version of itunes right on your device
would be really cool so you can tell I'm
excited about the tablet certainly maybe
a little silly to be getting this
excited about advice that hasn't been
announced or may not even exist but it's
something that I'm really looking
forward to and I think 2010 is going to
start off with a UH a big bang from from
Apple so what do you guys think about
this tablet news are you excited you're
not excited do you not care at all too
busy opening presents you know let me
know in the comments are a video
response I love to hear
you guys anyway jon rettinger from
technobuffalo and i'll see you the next
video goodbye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
