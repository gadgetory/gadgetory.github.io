technobuffalo here this past March was
the five-year anniversary technobuffalo
and throughout the past five years I've
shared little bits of the story that
went into how TechnoBuffalo came to be
but I've never told the entire story
what happened its beginning when tapped
at the end and how we got to where we
are now and how we're going to get to
where I hope we're gonna be so you've
ever been interested in starting you on
a website or starting a business anyone
here the pitfalls and sort of what
happened you can learn the actual people
that helped us grow and got to where we
are sit back relax grab some popcorn we
might have to cut this vid into two
parts because I got a lot of story to
tell let's go and get started the
beginning of this story I was in
marketing long before TechnoBuffalo ever
started I loved technology i love just
get it i used to go walk around best buy
to relax myself after a long day i just
always had a passion for technology i
remember being at work this software
development company running their
marketing dept member sitting there
reading and gadget and cnet and gizmodo
i'm just having them just constantly
reading i probably spent more time
reading those than i did anything else
and this was probably around 2007 2008 i
just loved technology so this is how
does the youtube channel started I'll
sort of give this story very briefly I
wanted to get a mac us using a giant
about 15 inch HP computer at the time I
never used a mac i didn't know how to
use a mac and i figured you know what
it'll teach me how to use a computer if
I force myself to make videos on it I
tried to find videos on youtube on how
to use the computer there weren't any so
it's a good excuse this time YouTube was
just cat videos and guys getting kicked
in the balls so you know it's pretty
easy to get recognized and notified on
there so I did that and it grew and got
sort of more successful a couple
thousand people started to watch the
videos and I couldn't believe that
people actually cared what I had to say
it was just incredible i responded to
every comment and i was really really
happy about it but again back 2008
youtube Naughton people knew about it
was sort of a fringe kind of thing i was
a little bit embarrassed I didn't even
tell my girlfriend became my fiance my
wife at the time you know for a while
that I was that was doing it and then
the YouTube Partner Program came around
that's where partners and creators are
able to share in the revenue from the
videos and this is
something that we all take for granted
now but didn't exist back then so I
remember finding the gentleman's name
who starred the partner program I had
about eight thousand subscribers at the
time and I wrote him about a two-page
letter for I thought I should be
accepted and I surprised I got a
personal letter back I was accepted into
the partner program so the job I was at
this marking department and it's a
reason for the story I hated it it was a
good company good people but I hated the
job to the point where i hope i get like
a minor car accident so we have to go in
like not nothing where anybody got hurt
but like maybe hit a stop sign so
partner program started i was able to
make money from YouTube videos which is
absolutely incredible I mean I couldn't
even believe that was a thing I still
have a hard time believing that I can
make a living from talking about
technology but sort of long story short
very soon how is that almost in compared
with a job I hated and making videos for
a living so it became a very clear
choice that I was going to do and this
now was about 2008 2009 sort of the
really the height of the downturn of the
economy I remember telling my future
wife and my future mother-in-law that I
was leaving my job and a really bad
economy to make videos for a living and
my wife he's so supportive said I'll
never forget I believe anything you can
do it try it and I wouldn't have done it
if it wasn't for her saying that and
believing in me so you know that was
kind of kind of cool so I left my job
and I wrote a business plan protecting
on Buffalo's reading all these tech
websites there wasn't any emphasis on
video at all and I figured you know what
I've got a you know decent-sized
following on video I've always kind of
liked the idea working for myself I
always had a bit of a problem with
authority companies that I worked for in
the past so that's a whole other story
so I wrote a business plan where venture
was going to become TechnoBuffalo so the
plan that i wrote had three parts
Seconal Buffalo some of you that around
originally you might recognize this the
first was a social network built in to
TechnoBuffalo it was called buffalo net
where people could talk about gadgets
and what they liked second part was sub
blogs you could sign up for your own
subside TechnoBuffalo calm / whatever
user name was and you've got sort of a
wordpress formatted site you could put
in your adsense code and you can
actually you know make money from that
guy having to worry about hosting your
own site and the third part was the
regular sort of blogroll that we have
right now so I hired a developer from
the software development company that
was working with I raised
initially I raised forty thousand
dollars it was bootstrap from friends
and family i think i remember i
initially sold i think it was one
percent of the company for five thousand
dollars i think was what i ended up
doing and then I started TechnoBuffalo
with Brandon minimun from formerly from
pocket now and we each put in five
thousand of our own money and we serve
raised the other 13 that was all the
money that we had so we hired developer
from the company I was working for I
could see him I could talk to him I know
anything about starting a website I knew
nothing about coding I knew very very
very little about any of this at all so
we started sort of working to put
together this website Wallace is all
going on I went back to school to get my
MBA to sort of learn how the best run a
company did that at night which is also
a side story where ended up meeting our
managing editor right Troy there who's
my my friend and classmate so I working
on this website developer is is coding
it he put in on a Windows machine I
don't know what that meant and we're
getting ready to launch we're going to
launch in September of 2009 and we had
burned through about thirty thousand
dollars of our 40s we didn't have much
money left at all I wasn't taking a
salary i was using the money I was
making from the videos to live on and I
think when Brandon wasn't taking any
sort of salary there either and I
remember hyping up TechnoBuffalo I used
every outlet I had social media video
just to be like check this site out it's
a voice of the consumer you can create
your own website we've got a social
network built in like check it out we
did a little bit of a closed beta we had
100 users in there everything was super
smooth and then launch day came
September of 2009 and we unleash
technobuffalo to the world and the site
crashed epically within about thirty
five seconds and it wasn't because we
had so much traffic coming to it it was
just the code was so awful and so bad
the server was set up so horribly that
the site completely crashed and I was
devastated I had no backup plan Ivan it
was I left my job I was without a net I
was mortified and I was scared I just be
able to sleep I was in college I would
sleep through my 2 p.m. class I could
sleep like a champ it was during this
time I developed a really bad
insomnia I couldn't sleep at night I was
I aged 10 years during this time we had
no money left either you know we had ten
thousand dollars so we invested every
last that we had to try and redo the
site essentially Greek coat it from
essentially scratch and it was
frightening and you know I had lost so
much in the way of reputation decided
lost so much to waive reputation so I
talked about and then it wasn't there
and it wasn't until about middle of
december two thousand nine so three
months later that we finally got the
site up and launched and live for more
than you know a minute it was really
really bad three months the videos
talking about TechnoBuffalo launching
and TechnoBuffalo not working or still
up on the youtube channel you can go
back and check him out they are still
there and you can see the worry in in my
eyes i remember thinking to myself like
what am i doing why am I doing this it
would been so much easier just to work
my job I was at and collect a paycheck I
kept getting promoted at it and it was
fine you know was a stable job what am I
thinking trying to make a living making
videos and trying to start a website
from scratch and those thoughts and
doubts you know creeped in a lot and
they crept in a lot through the earlier
and sometimes you know they still creep
in so technobuffalo launched brandon was
running pocket now at the time he
realized he couldn't split his time
between pocket out TechnoBuffalo and
sort of give both the attention he
thought they deserved so he left and I
sort of took over a hundred percent of
technobuffalo and we had barely enough
money from ads to hire one writer and
that one writer was Sean Adi whose name
you might recognize who's now our
editor-in-chief I remember when Brandon
left I talked to Sean I'm like we don't
have neden chief now Brandon was it's
like we can't hire anybody else when do
you want the job Sean had a pretty
impressive resume at the time and still
obviously does and it's that little that
that thing sort of started what became a
really great friendship with sean &amp;amp;
shawn has been incredible under in chief
and still is to to this day so we had
all those other parts of TechnoBuffalo
the social network side and the sub
blogs and it was killing us development
wise it was absolutely we're spending so
much time and so much money to try and
keep him aboard
it wasn't doing anything for us so we
had a really tough decision to totally
ax him like just ax him completely and
the currency just become a blog like
like we are now it was a really tough
decision to make you know but we did and
the site itself was probably making on a
good month are we good month maybe we
had a hundred thousand page views if
even that and we were probably making
five hundred dollars a month so and I so
wasn't taking any salary Brandon wasn't
we used every cent we were making it
essentially pay Sean you know that
number went up certainly John had other
job he's working at the time and we're
just trying to get by and it was really
really scary and I remember looking at
her bank account one day this is sort of
right after Brandon allowed to me like I
don't know forget to keep the lights on
you know I can still make videos but I
don't know if the sites going to last
and it was really really frightening for
me and for my girlfriend again who
became my wife I'd I was having such so
filled with regret and I didn't know
what was going to happen what's up
