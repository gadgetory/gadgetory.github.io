Xbox 180 so Microsoft went in a total
u-turn and said okay guys you win no DRM
we're gonna change everything we're
gonna go back we're back pedaling so
hard that we might hurt ourselves we're
not gonna have any more drm so now when
you setup your xbox one you only have to
check in online one time for initial
setup and then when you use a game you
can sell it loan it trade it do whatever
you want with the disc and that's how
you're gonna play your game so no more
of this digital download to your hard
drive and then 10 friends that you can
share games with it seems like they're
not going to be doing that anymore now
that is a really great thing I think for
this round of console wars it's a huge
deal obviously Sony's lack of DRM really
put the pressure on Microsoft to change
their policies and I think a lot of
gamers out there today have spoken if
they are very very happy people however
at some point we're going to have to
move forward in terms of non disc based
game distribution so whether it's this
version of the xbox or the next version
of the xbox in five to seven years we're
gonna have to find some kind of
compromise on downloading your games
directly from the internet and then
playing them and finding a way to either
have a used game market or share them
with friends and family so maybe 24
hours as an authentication checkpoint
isn't the best way to do it may be the
better way to do it is every 90 days
like Steam does for single-player games
but I'm really curious as to what you
guys think about that and how we can
move forward in the future when we get
rid of disk based technology and
entertainment we've already kind of done
it with music obviously everybody pretty
much downloads their music from their
favorite music retailer we're starting
to get rid of it with movies with things
like ultraviolet which aren't great but
do offer some manner of diskless
entertain
uh but I'm really curious as to how
gaming is gonna go because really that's
one of the things that you don't often
keep to yourself like we share games all
the time I love to borrow games for my
brother and he will borrow games for me
so how can we as a gaming community move
forward and come to a compromise with
media lists gaming so download only
gaming I Ralph here at the office was
saying he feels like maybe the Refresh
of the xbox one in a couple of years
might not have a disk drive maybe it's
download only at that point and at that
point what's the policy then can xbox
and microsoft change this policy midway
through can they change horses midstream
it's really really interesting to think
about the ramifications of this and what
it means for gamers everywhere but I
want to hear from you what do you guys
think let me know in the comments see
you next time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
