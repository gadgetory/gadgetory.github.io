TechnoBuffalo here I've had the
Microsoft service with Windows RT for a
few days not enough time for me to
comfortably call it a review but I do
want to share some overview of the
operating system how it works what you
can expect when you pick up Microsoft
servers you test a Microsoft Surface or
you just use a Windows 8 device in
general let's get started alright so
let's take a look at the Microsoft
Surface I'm going to try and keep my
editorializing and opinions to a minimum
and throw all those giant opinions that
you know I got a lot of them into the
full review in a couple days but mostly
what I want to show is how the operon
system works and how it interacts with
the surface hardware so we're going to
talk a lot about gestures this big bezel
area serves as a giant role with how you
use the device so let's start with
swiping up you go ahead and swipe up you
get menus and that really is true
without mostly applications so here in
the OS if I go and swipe up I get that
sort of menu where I can pin to desktop
I can refresh I can go back and with
really in all applications swiping up is
going to give you that menu swiping down
when you're an application is going to
close it here when you're in the Start
screens can open up the same
applications but for example if we are
looking at this since I'm done
I could swipe down and close that I just
kind of interesting way to close
applications app switching is pretty
cool here as well you swipe from the
left hand side and swipe on in and I'll
scroll through all the applications that
you have open but what if you want to
multitask well you do that same motion
but then you go right back to where you
started go out come back in and there
you've got all your applications you can
see where you want to jump to so I want
to jump back and explore I can do that
if I want to go back to the Start menu I
can easily do that as well and at any
point if you want to go back to the
Start menu and that's what this is now
the modern UI is the Start menu you
could also hit that capacitive home
button right there as well that's
conveniently disguised as a Windows logo
settings if you want to get to this one
for some reason took me a while to
figure out when I first charted using
Windows 8 is swiped from the right hand
side there you've got settings it's also
where you want to turn off the screen
for example there's power notification
settings and screen brightness
we'll live there as well and you can
adjust that up or down and you get some
tile settings that live there as well so
here we are in the browser let's talk
about Windows Explorer
let's take any preconceived notions you
have that Windows Explorer what the
Internet has led you to believe throw
them out the window
Windows Explorer is actually really good
here on the Microsoft Surface it's
really fluid pinch-to-zoom it's buttery
smooth like doing it whoo coming at you
good Ballmer coming at you let's see ah
yeah is he like steel very very smooth
here uh and works extremely well
Microsoft did include flash here you can
show you what flash looks like I'll go
ahead and go to YouTube for example and
here's my unboxing of the Microsoft
Surface and we'll hit play and then you
can can hear it I will turn the volume
down though it does get a little jittery
but it's smooth enough to watch I would
necessarily want to watch a full full
length movie on it there definitely are
some frames being skipped but it does
work and it is serviceable and with the
YouTube application you download from
the store you can't log in and manage
your videos you can see it skipped a
little bit right there so doing it
through the web is really gonna be the
best way to do it so we'll go ahead and
go home and so you know flash of course
will play there obviously let's talk a
little bit about the desktop that you
can option here and the applications
that come with it so we'll go ahead and
hit test op and we get what looks like
essentially Windows 7 and with Windows
RT as opposed to Windows Pro this is
really all you can do in this interface
there are some built-in applications
I'll show you in just a minute
but if you want to install older
applications that you have when you're
Windows 7 this derp XP machine it's not
gonna be able to do that on Windows RT
you can't install minecraft Photoshop or
any other Windows applications here only
what Microsoft has given you and there
aren't that many if you want to install
full applications you're going to want
to either wait for the pro version on
the surface or pick up a pro version on
the market right now what Microsoft does
give you is pretty decent so you've got
Explorer that's going to be like a
regular int Explorer it's going to be
different than what we just saw looks
just like a regular browse
and you go ahead and plate it any way
you want with your finger or if you have
the touch cover you can use it as a
mouse and type in the URL that way and
clothing applications is the same way to
go ahead and hit the X but they did give
us a full version Microsoft Office which
is kind of neat something show you what
that looks like you may not have seen
what office 13 looks like so here's word
2013 10 different templates to choose
from going to take a look at a blank
document and it looks kind of familiar
there's a lot of new things under the
hood here but speed is really good so
you can input stuff a few ways you can
either just tap the screen a keyboard in
theory will show up there it is show up
then you can type that way we'll go
ahead and hide the keyboard if you've
got a touch color for example typing
works really quickly and is really once
one as soon as you touch it one of the
best things about the surface for me
really is the touch cover I'll talk a
little bit about that in the review but
I've absolutely loved it and again I
promise to keep my editorial izing down
touch cover though is really awesome the
mouse and the clicking everything works
very well so if you're looking to take
notes in class you want something you
can carry with you a very good option so
there's what word looks like I will jump
into excel I'm not closing any
applications I'm opening them up as we
go
and there is Excel and it looks pretty
much like Excel I don't like we've seen
anywhere else you're probably saying
okay so we multitasks in the modern UI
by swiping this way can you still do
that the answer is nope if you swipe
back you are going to be brought back to
the Start screen so I'll go ahead and go
back home
and here we are back at the modern UI so
another cool thing is multitasking this
thing does multitasking pretty well so
go ahead and find something that's a
good demonstration of this let's go
ahead and check out the store and I'll
give you guys a toilet store in a minute
but say I also want to check out
Internet Explorer so I'll go ahead and
do that so now I'm an explorer but you
know what I realize I want to go back to
the store I want to check whether ever
it might be go ahead and drag it halfway
you can go ahead and view what any other
application that you wanting to the
video still playing I can make you like
this just as I would as its own app I
want to make it bigger I can make it
bigger and I can sort of share the
screen great if you want to browse the
web
and check your email on one of the side
screens it's just a very cool way that
Microsoft has integrated multitasking
we'll go ahead and go home I'm gonna go
and show you the App Store here as well
not that populated right now but
certainly expect that to change let's
sort of the standard stuff it expects no
dedicated Facebook app as of yet we do
have some of the important ones of
course you've got Skype Hulu Netflix you
can see it's broken out by categories
spotlights some games Angry Birds Space
Rory is a Twitter application how stuff
works most of the applications that you
would use the core applications you'll
find either them or equivalents here but
there are a lot of choice in is a very
pretty UI as really is everything with
Windows 8 it's very pretty it's very
visually appealing I'm going to again
save my opinion for the full review look
for that later on in the week anything
you guys want to make sure I cover be
sure to leave your comments down below
of who you guys think about the surface
