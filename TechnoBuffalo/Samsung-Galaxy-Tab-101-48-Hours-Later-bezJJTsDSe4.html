nowhere from technobuffalo calm and this
is my samsung galaxy tab 10.1 limited
edition google i/o 2011 edition tablet
I've had it for almost two days now and
really have had about a day to play with
it because i was at google i/o you know
i got it at i/o two days ago there an
unboxing and then i've had a couple days
the senator senator i'll tell you what
hardware was this thing is killer
software wise it's really pretty good
it's got some hiccups and then obviously
there's a whole thing of what platform
you want to use but hardware wise this
thing is pretty sweet let's take a
little more of an in depth look 48 hours
with the galaxy tab 10 dot 10 androids
alright so right off the bat I'll tell
you that John is sending up our sous
transformer are you pad transformer eat
transformer pad transformer review unit
so i can check it out and go
head-to-head because as of now the tab
10 1 may be my favorite android tablet
to date and john is really high on the
transformer so i am excited to get my
hands on that one I haven't yet tried it
myself and check it out but what I
really like about the tab which is also
what I really like about my other
favorite android tablet the LG G slate
for tmobile or optimus pad is the
hardware the form factor this thing is
incredibly thin incredibly lightweight
it's about a third of an inch thick it
weighs one point three pounds i believe
and it's just my criticisms about the
motorola xoom software aside but
hardware wise my tuba criticism is where
the screen was kind of washed out and it
was bulky heavy it's kind of thick and
kind of heavy and just for one-handed
use there was no way it was going to
happen for me but this thing is not a
problem to hold one handed and what was
really cool actually was at the show at
Google i/o people got these on the first
day after the opening keynote and there
was a long line to wait and then
everybody got one for free and I saw
lots of people walking around the rest
of that day and especially on day two
using this with the the official app
from the show to figure out where to go
you know what sessions were happening
when where they were located all that
kind of stuff so really very cool one of
the other things that i want to say very
cool i mean to fold i mean very cool
that they were able to use that instead
of you know having a whole bunch of
paper printed up but it's cool
especially the tech conference to see
people using the tech instead of you
know old tech like paper that's not
reusable but then the second thing is
just that people were walking around
with them because it's so lightweight
and easy enough to hold the I'm still
going to say that I think the widescreen
form factor is superior for a tablet to
the route that ipad went ipad went with
the 43 aspect ratio and look to
everybody out there who's already saying
why are you comparing this to to ipad
why
talk about apple all the time it's
because it's the market leader it's not
this is not getting into you know which
is better right now it's just that's the
market leader the other thing and I'm
just going to mention the strip because
it's obvious it's not digging it Sam
science not digging at Android or Google
it's just saying this straight up
everybody who's seen this who is not a
geek so that's about five people so far
has said oh that your iPad because it
looks like an iPad it really does I mean
the form factor is different and like I
said that's a big plus for me the
widescreen form factor but you know the
black bezel with the chrome band around
it I mean it's very iPad looking granted
any tablet is going to look like any
other tablet to an extent but if you
look even at the zoom you know the zoom
looks a little bit different so so
definitely there is something to the
samsung's recent hardware designs being
reminiscent of some vapis anyway that
being said to get off of that trade
let's load up slowed up some music in
the background here this is the this is
the new music beta by Google which works
very well we'll do a separate hands-on
video on that one no I don't want to
hear that song I want to hear this song
there we go but this works on this works
on Android devices it works on on the
web and it works very well streaming
your music from the cloud rotate that
into a portrait mode so we'll get to a
separate video on that but anyway to get
back to the the tab 10 1 the fact that
it's lightweight enough and it's you can
use it one-handed you can hold it you
know the long way left to back the
camera up here so you can get a better
better view of this but you can hold it
the long way no problem because it's
light enough weight and then it's narrow
enough with the widescreen form factor
that you can do things on it with one
hand and you can do to two thumbs typing
in this mode will stop the music even
though the isley brothers have much
better voices than I do we'll get back
to the home screen there so if i go into
let's go to the browser and i want to
type in a URL
it's not a problem at all to go to you
handy you can see there's a custom
samsung keyboard on here which so far i
really like actually think it's a minor
improvement over the stock android
keyboard just because things are a
little more clearly labeled the caps
lock button things like that just little
minor things that I like more than I
like the the stock android keyboard and
then obviously you know it's andres you
can install all kinds of stuff on it
will go to customizations widgets you
know custom keyboard replacements all
that kind of business so here's
TechnoBuffalo in the mobile theme mode
I've had a few crashes I had the camera
crashed on me actually started this
video in the camera crash dummy yeah for
some reason Android browsers seem to
have a problem switching into mobile
theme Oh with our website every time I
do a review video it's like that I don't
know why one site that always works for
me is ESPN's true hoop so let's go there
but it's speedy performance it's got the
dual core processor inside it's Wi-Fi
only one thing about this galaxy tab
which is a little disappointing but i
understand it doesn't come with
Samsung's new TouchWiz panel for
honeycomb that I saw at Mobile World
Congress the rumors all point to that
being unveiled on May twenty-fourth and
an event Samsung's having in New York
City which everybody and their cousin is
betting is going to be the official
release of the galaxy tab 10 one on a
carrier in the US etc etc so I'm kind of
excited cuz I actually thought that
touch was looked pretty good and pretty
useful I'm kind of psyched to see that
but lots of people don't like the
TouchWiz or just don't want anything you
know besides sake Android so this is
android 301 kind of weird they announced
three dot one yesterday and it was
available to Motorola Xoom customers
although as adryana reported change on
both having problems getting it
downloaded their devices but then they
hand it out to developers you know this
this really slick top-of-the-line tablet
with only three dot 0 dot one on it
three dot one is coming on the coming
weeks apparently for us but it's the
same screen size as the zoom 10.1 inches
1280 by 800 to me the screen on the
galaxy tab
just crisper brighter looks nicer than
the screen on the zoom did the
performance is zippy with the dual core
1 gigahertz processor it's got 32 gigs
of RAM for internal storage it's got a
front facing camera like we showed in
the intro and then the rear facing
camera it's a 3 megapixel camera with a
flash and then on the the front facing
cameras 2 megapixels you can see this is
this is just kind of fun that they did
this the limited edition google i/o the
developers edition with the cool custom
backplate they're kind of a neat touch
on the side you've got the stereo
speakers actually sound quite good
considering off smallest devices and
then you've got a 3 NF millimeter
headphone jack on the top it came with
earbuds then obviously you can you know
send your music or your audio out to you
know better speaker system and so on
it's got a rocker switch for volume it's
got a power locks which as well and then
again I'm just pointing out this you
know interesting that instead of a USB
port in a mini HDMI port samsung one
went with a proprietary connector that
I'll get the cable here it is kind of
you know it is ipad esque that's all I'm
saying Apple not the only company to
ever use a proprietary dock connector so
yeah that being said but again just
mentioning interesting they went with a
proprietary connector and then it's
modular hooks up to the AC adapter via
USB or you can take the adapter off and
use it for syncing with your computer
obviously you can see the accelerometer
built-in again nothing custom as for our
samsung goes except there's a link to
samsung apps which in the u.s. you have
to set your language and from the US
doesn't really do much you know if there
are 10 apps here now and they're all
just like these tests so not really much
going on there we'll see by the 24th
what samsung has in store for the
official launch but again so far really
enjoying it you know i am not going to
get in right now to a whole Android
versus other platforms debate but you
to say that as Android tablets go for a
kind of a full on let's go to youtube
and watch little video for a full on
honeycomb I don't know what's going on
so watch this one for full on honeycomb
experience I mean this is just great and
a lot of that has to do with the form
factor because all these devices now you
know the honeycomb devices have the dual
core processor and the performance is
generally pretty good there are some
bugs still like I said some crashes but
you know that that happens on any
platform you're going to get some
crashes and whatnot unfortunately it's
just kind of the way it is these days
but really they nailed it on the form
factor haven't had a chest chance chance
to really run down the battery yet so
I'll have to get back with some battery
battery performance info and like I said
it's Wi-Fi only there's no cellular data
on this device so it's just going over
Wi-Fi but so far so good really really
impressed I think Samsung nailed it on
the hardware I think the hardware you
know for my money is probably the best
tablet hardware out there I mean
performance wise you know you can
compare it to what whatever you want but
but form factor wise i prefer this to
ipad 2 i prefer it to the other android
tablets that i've used maybe with the
exception of the g slate just because i
like the smaller size but this is so
lightweight that it you know it makes me
not care so much about the size because
i can use a one-handed which for me you
know i think is really key so there you
go a quick kind of i've had it for two
days i've used it for about a day first
impression review of the samsung galaxy
tab 10 dot one limited edition google
i/o developer edition Wi-Fi only etc etc
it's a big thumbs up for me so far if
you're looking for an Android tablet and
in general you know as tablets go really
really digging it so far excited to use
it more for sure try out the integrated
google video chat do some you know some
ereading on it because that's that's a
big thing you know what the one-handed
use and all that kind of stuff and also
play
more with the google music beta and like
i said gonna do a separate hands-on
walkthrough of how that works you can't
buy music through it but if you want
somewhere to stick all your music in the
cloud and access it from any computer
through a web browser or via any Android
device i guess to dot 2 and higher so
far it works pretty well as long as your
cellular carrier works well I'll get
into that more in the other video so
next time I name is Noah thanks again to
google and samsung for providing these
to all the attendees at the show and
like I said May twenty-fourth big event
Samsung in New York City looking like
we're going to see the official launch
of this thing with the with the TouchWiz
panel which I at least I'm kind of
interested to see some of you out there
like what are you talking about TouchWiz
hate it others do you like TouchWiz like
it let's get the camera fired up one
more time so i can say goodbye properly
there we go until next time my name is
Noah much much more on TechnoBuffalo com
we'll see you later bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
