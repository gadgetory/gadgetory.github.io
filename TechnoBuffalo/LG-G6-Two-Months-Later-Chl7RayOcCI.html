six been about too much since its
release and I'm using the phone on and
off throughout that time and I really
liked it and I figured it's a good
opportunity to go back visit the g6 with
fresh eyes having more experience and
used it longer it into five to seven
days we typically do before we do our
reviews and stay tuned stay into this
video cuz we're giving you a chance to
win a brand-new LG g6 before I jump in
talk more about the g6 I wanted to
revisit the g5 for just like a hot
second I promise I'm not going to dwell
the g5 was like a huge risk for LG to
try something modular try something new
didn't work so I want to give LG credit
from not like doubling down a design in
sort of a new way forward that wasn't
going to work for the company they came
with a fresh slate and the fresh slate
ended up being the g6 I think every
phone kind of has it has a big story and
I think with the g6 the big story is
that 5.7 inch qHD plus screen and we've
seen 5.7 inch phones before like John we
know what that looks like but this is
like a weird aspect ratio it's 18 by 9
you're getting a lot of screen in a very
tall package so what that means is it's
going to be an arrow in your hands a
hole you can hold the phone that I think
you feel like gie enormous sort of Nexus
6 style type device that new aspect
ratio lends its way to a really new
unique way to use the device I could
have two squares on either side of the
screen running side by side that have to
sort of shrink we want to quarter the
way and make one the main screen that
could be equally sized and it's really
productive for me there's a lot of
software's LG put a tour take advantage
that newest aspect ratio the more you
use the phone where you can appreciate
it the big things out the screen is
certainly video you want make sure your
video is going to going to look good and
it's going to look good the screen ism'
awesome scree is beautiful it's vibrant
when you turn the brightness up colors
absolutely gorgeous and pop if when you
go outdoors you're still going to get a
nice beautiful screen I'll be it a
little more washed out than I would have
liked also new to the phone is HDR which
is something a technology it's going to
become ubiquitous I think in the next
probably next generation of phones
you're going to expect them to have HDR
so I read the comments and I've
contributed to this discussion the
process is a Snapdragon 820 one with 40
and I know it's not the latest from
Qualcomm McCarthy 35 like maybe another
phone you're considering might have four
usual productivity infer four games and
for watching video there's very little
distance for most people 821 is a plenty
powerful really battery friendly chick
and speaking of battery when I went to
the briefing for the g6 LG spent a
really long time talking about how they
test their battery should I give the
batteries room essentially everything
they could say without saying really
don't want these phones to blow up so
there's a little smaller than what maybe
we would have had if it wasn't for the
note 733 hundred million power battery
LG's got a nice reputation especially
for their you know the line of phones
with high quality audio it ain't here on
the US version which is weird you got to
buy the Korean version if you want that
so bear that in mind
LG skin hasn't changed that much since
like the g5 and it be 20 I'm not the
biggest fan it seems a little too cold
and a little cartoony for me and I also
didn't like some of the apps that all
these bundling into place Google Apps so
there are two 13 megapixel cameras but
they're not the same one sort of a
standard camera the other ones a
wide-angle camera catch 125 degrees I
really like the option of having both in
fact when I didn't have both when I was
using something like my si+ I kind of
missed it the wide-angle lens doesn't
have like auto stabilization or anything
like that when you want to take those
wide-angle shots it's really kind of
cool and the pictures do come out really
nice using sure the standard 71 degree
of normal lens rounding up list of stuff
I guess you'd expect now in flagship
phone ip68 is here so water resistance
so you could you could take this thing
in a shower but we didn't just want to
take LG's word for it Andrew readily
volunteered to hop in a shower with the
phone strip down I don't know why I want
to do it but it did to test the phone if
it worked and strangely we have b-roll
of that if you guys want to see it
thumbs up the video and let us know so
we had two months with the LG G 6 if
this phone existed in a vacuum without
like another say flagship competitor
maybe a killer phone even the phone I'd
be like yeah dude
dudette go buy it you're not going to
regret it it doesn't exist in a vacuum
there's a lot of really good options
there but at least you one of the
options you consider and because we we
like you guys and want you to have a
good phone we decided to give away a g6
it is a international giveaway so please
do not yell at me about that it is a key
mobile locked unit so know that going in
if you live outside the US and you win
but you can pick up an unlock code and
use it anywhere I'll put all the
information up on the screen essentially
hit the link down below article on
TechnoBuffalo comm and that's where
you'll do all of your your entering and
let me end with a comment of the day
from a colleague and a gentleman that I
admire from our blackberry key one video
mister mobile himself Michael Fisher he
said that's what Android is all about
giving you options to find the phone you
want word so mr. Fisher I salute you and
I agree
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
