lakers calm here one of the most common
questions I've been getting about the
new macbook is in regards to the
trackpad so I'm going to walk you
through the trackpad and what it can do
and give you my review on it and also
show you the options that are in the
control panel for it right guys see you
at the end bye alright guys look here is
the new macbook it's a 2.4 gigahertz and
there is a topic of the video the
trackpad as you guys can see it's it's
relatively flush to the computer and it
is the biggest track that Apple has ever
used to give you guys a size comparison
here here is a wireless mighty mouse you
can see it's just a little bit smaller
and here is an iphone 3g for size
comparisons now the most glaring thing
you'll notice about the trackpad other
than its monster size is the omission of
any recognizable mouse buttons and Apple
solve this by actually making the whole
track pad itself a button and the
concept seems like it'd be very
difficult to get used to and hard to
adapt but in fact it's actually very
quick and took me about five minutes get
used to it now I don't notice any
difference at all the whole trackpad
like I said is actually a button you
click anywhere you'd like and just like
a simple left click the trackpad is
coated with all right it's actually made
of glass and it's coated with a plastic
a material actually makes it feel
similar to the old version but there's
much less friction on your finger which
actually makes for nice and easy
scrolling if you'd like to right click
which most people do like to do you can
just use two fingers and click and you
get your right click options I'll show
you guys that looks like so I'm tapping
two fingers on the trackpad and there's
my right click nice and easy like that
go away here trackpad is very nice I
haven't had any issues with it as you're
typing it really does become second
nature you just tap your thumb right
we're used to where the old mouse
buttons or as you're scrolling it's a
simple tap I really noticed no
difference whatsoever you get a lot of
options for customizing found in the
system preferences and I'll walk you
guys
all that and show you what that looks
like but the multi-touch works
fantastically scrolling is nice and easy
two finger scrolling flows very quickly
across the track pad with the new
reduced friction it's so big you can
scroll down or left or right with pages
much easier so guys the trackpad really
is a non-issue for me it works just as
well as all the previous other versions
but now you get a lot more customization
options so I think the trackpad has been
a big winner for Apple I'm going to walk
you guys through the Preferences here
that you have alright guys so I'm going
to go ahead and open up the system
preferences and the system preferences
here looks very similar to most other
macs and what we have here is a trackpad
button so go ahead and click that and
I'll walk you through some of the
options here so here you're one finger
options as you can see one finger tap
the click turn that on and off and i'll
still give you a demonstration what that
does tap and clicks you can see in the
video playing right there dragging you
can click double click actually and you
can drag your finger around drag lock
you can select a folder or an image and
move it around secondary click you can
use the right corner to secondary click
or you can just tap it with two fingers
here are some to thinker options two
finger scrolling as you've seen on the
other multi-touch capable trackpads to
figure rotating just like you would
anticipate and just was found on the old
macbook airs and the outgoing MacBook
Pros pitch open and closed similar to
the iphone the other multi touch devices
screen zoom actually hold down the
control key plays two fingers up scroll
down and it zooms the entire content of
your desktop secondary tap like I
mentioned earlier two fingers right
click three finger navigation swagg
three fingers across
so you can scroll through images or
documents and the four fingers are
actually one of the things that I've
been finding most useful surprisingly
swipe down for expose just very useful
swipe left to right and you actually get
an application switcher and you can
close them right from there so let's go
back swipe down for expose and if you
swipe up it will close expose if you
swipe up again as you can see right
there it clears your desktop which is a
very handy feature so these are the
options that you have here in the
trackpad in addition you can control
your your tracking speed your
double-click speed and the scrolling
speed but these are the multi-touch
options found on the new macbooks and
the new macbook airs so guys in
conclusion I think the trackpad is
really welcome addition to the new line
of macbook and macbook pros it takes
what the old ones did well and really
adds upon it with some new multi-touch
gestures and the lack of a button I
really don't notice any difference one
way or another whether it would be there
or not so surprisingly it's a nice
non-issue you guys please feel free to
