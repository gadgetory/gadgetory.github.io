from TechnoBuffalo dot-com here with a
review for you of the 150 watt hour
hyper map external battery for your
MacBook MacBook Pro or MacBook Air you
don't see really any or at all external
batteries for the MacBook line that's
mostly because Apple doesn't license out
their max if it's after but somehow
there is a Mac safe adapter that is
included with the hyper Mac and I'm not
entirely sure how or why that is perhaps
they just bought a magazine fadap derp
and sliced it up but it is here and it
does function so like I mentioned I've
got the 150 watt hour model it does come
in four different sizes and this
particular one is going to run you 399
just about 400 bucks so what I gotta say
is this thing is actually fantastic it
works completely as advertised I got and
this is no joke 20 hours of battery life
with this sucker fully charged in a full
charge on my macbook unibody 20 hours I
had to fight to get the battery to die
to drain it I left it online brightness
all the way up and I went to bed came
back and I still had 60% of the battery
left this thing is absolutely fantastic
if you're a road warrior or you're away
from your home or away from a charger
for very long this almost becomes a
must-have accessory so let me walk you
through it and show you what it is so it
is encased in aluminum just have a very
similar feel to the MacBook and the
MacBook family on the side of the device
you've got your charging port so it just
plugs in with an AC adapter charge
you've got an button that gives you an
LED indicator I'll let you know how much
power you have in it so as you charge
all the way up those lights the light up
does have a USB port which is pretty
cool you can use it to charge really
anything with USB so your iPhone
whatever it might be and here is your a
DC out port really is nothing else got
some white accents on it and other than
that it's just straight aluminum but it
does come with a cigarette or airplane
and charger for it
of course you are MagSafe with the
charging port on the end there's not
that much I can say about this other
than you really just works and it works
very well if you're not scoffing at the
$400 price point it's because you need
something like this and if you need
something like this you can get it
worryfree and take my assurance that it
functions absolutely as advertised and
it is quite small you can get smaller
sizes if you like certainly it'll get
less battery life but it fits very
nicely into a bag let me give you a size
comparison with the device you guys
probably know the iPhone it's not that
thick and size-wise it's not that big it
definitely fits nicely lengthwise right
into a bag I've been thrilled with that
it's become a must-have accessory for me
if I want to go out and blog or want to
edit a video when I'm not at home it's
just been fantastic to have so I can
definitely recommend it I'll put a link
to the website where you can purchase is
