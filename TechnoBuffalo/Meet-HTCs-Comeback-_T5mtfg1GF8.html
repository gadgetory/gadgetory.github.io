phone the media and us include has been
dominated by Samsung LG but HTC's got a
new phone also called the HTC u ultra
and this one definitely deserves some
attention so we just got in the office I
just unboxed it so it look like I've
been playing with it for the better part
of 30 45 minutes this is by no means a
review but more of a first impressions
and having to set it up and tried some
of the cool stuff HTC u ultra does let's
start the way the phone looks we got the
blue version it's also available in
white and black crazy shiny you probably
think to yourself
hashtag finger prick Megan that's what I
thought too but like surprisingly it's
it's not the blue version looks awesome
let me just get this out of the way this
is not an inexpensive phone it's gonna
cost you 750 bucks if you want to buy it
so you got two screens the first one is
five points of interest of course it
sits qHD as is the custom of flagship
phones right now it's 513 ppi and
protected with Gorilla Glass 5 but that
friendos is not the only screen it's got
another screen on top a la LG v 20 the
second screen is a little bit bigger
than 2 inches it's 2.05 and it's 160 by
1040 and you can customize that a lot of
what you do with it what its gonna show
whether or not it's always on it's kind
of cool to have and it kind of fades
into the top that so big cameras got
crazy high megapixel edge it's 16
megapixel and it's got auto HDR built-in
speaking of cameras there's one on the
back so with a 12 megapixel HTC
ultrapixel 2 it's covered in sapphire so
it's gonna be safe from scratches it's
got things like face detection auto HDR
and of course it should 4k video but it
does 3d audio it's got 4 omnidirectional
microphones on here which is kind of a
cool thing so in record audio you
playback it almost sounds like you are
there the rest the specs are things that
you kind of expect from a flagship and
nowadays it's got 4 gigs of ram it's
Snapdragon 820 164 gigs of internal
storage expandable up to two gigs
assuming storage cards ever get to that
size Android 7.0 onboard here as well
and that Google assistance also here the
HTC Sense software which has been really
refined and pared
to create I think it's probably one of
the best custom UI is out that you can't
really call them skins much anymore I
talked a lot about what's here what's
not here is a 3.5 millimeter headset
jack so however you feel about that's
how you feel about that HTC does include
a pretty awesome pair of earbuds that
are USB C and they also have HTC's use
sonic in here so pop those suckers in
your ears and software settings like
your customise the audio experience /
like your ear canals one thing I have
had a chance to test quite yet and sort
of it gets better than when you use it
as HTC Sense companion it's their own
custom AI they built into the phone as
you use the phone as you travel with the
phone and to learn what you do make
recommendations talk to it controller
device that's something I really want to
test for the review quick charts 3.0 is
here it's gonna charge a 3000 milliamp
hour battery
I'm a bit nervous about battery life
it's a smaller battery or nearly I would
like and a phone with a qHD giant
display and then a secondary display on
top of that but I'll test battery life
the more I use it that you guys know how
it performs well see the guys is a quick
overview of the HTC u ultra and we did a
video about six weeks ago makes you see
announced that the first time I've
actually held it in my hand and I've
been pretty impressed with it on first
blush but as I've learned anything from
my dating days first impressions do not
always hold true when you get all the
way to marriage so we'll see what
happens
hopefully HTC ultra lives up to
expectations and you know anything that
you guys want to see again leave in the
comments down below and let me know and
for the comments of the day it's from
our essays biggest problem that's a
buffalo video we did it's bring back
retinas rants I want to see you pissed
off if I get pissed off about something
I'll bring it back but generally I'm
pretty happy something's got to piss me
off soon maybe it will be you but if you
want to be in a comment to the day
believe a comment will link to your
channel down below click on it you
become rich or famous and retire like
dan Bilzerian and have like planes and
stuff now that would be pretty awesome
thank you guys for watching hope you
enjoyed so next time I'm John Wright
injured from TechnoBuffalo I'm gonna go
play with my shine if known
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
