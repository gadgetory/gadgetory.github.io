to you by hostgator what a sports cars
and smartphones have in common what kind
of bliss is HTC going to runnymede all
over you on September 20th now that one
was kind of a stretch but you get the
idea and is the Razorback the razor
might be back I can't believe it the
razors back it's the return of the razor
I'm not talking about the WWF star Razor
Ramon I'm talking about the motorola
cell phone it's techno buffalos rumor
roundup
what is going on everybody and welcome
to techna buffalos room around up here
on revision3 this is the roundup for the
week ending today Friday September 16
2011 my name is Noah Kravitz and I have
the good good fortune of being
editor-at-large for TechnoBuffalo and
your host for this week's look at the
latest in tech world rumors happy fall
everybody autumn said another word for
fall I don't know but labor days passed
you can still wear your white pants I
don't really care I'm just glad you're
here let's get right to it first up what
a Porsche Porsche and smartphones have
in common apparently something rim just
introduced a whole bunch of blackberries
the bold two torches they're rumors
about another bold coming then there's
the cult coming next year all this stuff
and then we get this this leaked this
picture of a black board looks like no
other blackberry it's a metallic-looking
blackberry was very you know very modern
but to me very sort of retro angular
buttons a different look it's kind of
like a bold if I don't know an automaton
robot from the high fashion future
designed it codename the r-47 also
codename the night there's a picture on
TechnoBuffalo I bet John Key is going to
load up a picture of it right now so you
can see what I'm talking about anyway
the latest rumors about this phone have
it source to Porsche apparently Porsche
was involved or reportedly purportedly
Porsche involved in the design of the
blackberry night aka the r-47 which
might be a concept phone or might
actually be a limited edition run to go
with blackberries latest line of BB OS 7
powered smartphones at any rate this
blackberry looks like no other it's very
very silver it's very metallic the
buttons are very angular it's a little
bit polarizing I don't know are you into
it look at the pictures I don't know at
any rate there's no official word on if
this thing even exists although
obviously it does or if Porsha was
officially involved in the design of it
or if it's going to come out if it does
come out our best bet is it's a limited
edition run it's going to cost a pretty
penny and it'll do zero to text
messaging and somewhere around 3.8
seconds not quite as fast
is in 911 gt3 RS but a little bit faster
than a torch if she sees throwing a
party and we're invited if we're invited
that means you're invited even though
you probably can't make it to New York
but we'll cover it for you Tuesday
September 20th New York City HTC's
throwing a shindig if you recall they
throw a shindig in London back on
September first we were there killing
was there they introduced their two new
windows phone seven mango phones this
shindig looks to be all about android
except it might be about Windows Phone
nobody's really sure HTC sent out
invites the invites have to do with
style have to do with high fashion makes
everybody think they're going to
introduce the phone that's been
codenamed the Bliss which you know if
you want to use these kind of words and
I don't I'm just reporting what other
people have said it's a chick phone I
don't know what chick phone means all i
know is that apparently the new VW
beetle is less of a chick car and more
of a guy car I whatever they're
introducing a phone code name the bliss
Android 3.7 inch display dual cameras
hspa+ Wi-Fi Bluetooth all that good
stuff 720p video capture 5 megapixel
camera on the main camera and then a
front facing camera for video chats all
that stuff but then here's the kicker
that makes everybody say chick phone I'm
going to use these air quotes as much as
I can apparently included in the box
according to leaked spec sheets is a
charm indicator so this is some kind of
a light up your thingamabob a bauble
whatever a bauble is actually I know
what a bauble is a bauble that you know
apparently can like hang out of your
pocket or hang out of your purse or I
don't know hang out of your football
helmet because who's to say that a
football player guy or girl couldn't use
this thing but it's a thing that hangs
out externally from the phone and lights
up to let you know when you've got a
call coming in or I would imagine you
know maybe a new email or text message
or Facebook update or you know chick
status alert whatever anyway HTC
expected to unveil the Bliss at their
shindig in New York on Tuesday September
20th and they might also introduce any
one of a number of new phones kicking
around the rumor mill the most likely is
what's been called the runnymede now the
running knee
it has been said to be basically an
android-powered version of the windows
phone 7 powered tightened that was
recently released over at that party in
London this thing if it's true is going
to have a 4.7 inch display although it's
just wvga so 800 480 stretch across 4.7
inches we'll have to see how that pans
out it's going to have a ton of internal
storage and a run window run Android
rather I'm getting confused already but
the big kicker here is that the
runnymede is said to incorporate beats
technology and may also ship with Beats
headphones in the box now there may be
multiple skus of the runnymede whatever
it's called not going to be called
running mate but that's code name and
some will include the beats headphones
some wall but as you know HTC entered
into a partnership they purchased 51% of
Beats Audio for three hundred million
dollars so they got to start kicking out
some beats right so stay tuned it's just
a couple days away from now Tuesday
September 20th in New York City HTC

but certainly not least the razor might
be making a comeback once upon a time in
a land far far away long long ago but
really not that far were that long ago
there was no
I phone there was no Android razors
ruled the roost seriously way back when
before smartphones became mainstream and
the whole iOS android fanboy war thing
was just a twinkle and an engineer's I
somewhere in Silicon Valley the motorola
razr was king of the cellphone world at
least in the United States but really it
was king the razor was hot I personally
never had one I immediately made the
leap from a very basic nokia to a
japanese import sony walkman phone that
like barely got reception but if i plug
9 dongles into it i could listen to big
country on my earphones but pretty much
everybody else had a razor well the
brand name is still iconic and it might
be making a comeback apparently there
was a photo posted on the internet and
the exif data the exif data that
identifies what kind of a camera took
the photo you know the f-stop and the
aperture and the resolution all that
metadata associated with the photo the
exif data said this was taken by a
motorola droid razr now that sort of
data can be faked it's faked all the
time there have been reports of the new
iphone 5 photos from the iphone 5 of the
exif data nobody knows if they're real
and ride it can be faked that being said
it's rumor roundup this kind of a fun
rumor droid razr would make a lot of
sense from a marketing perspective razor
was a big deal Google just bought
Motorola why not resurrect the brand
name Google's never frankly been all
that good at marketing stuff to a
mainstream audience so now that they
have a cell phone company in house it
might be a little premature for this but
you know it just it makes lessons even
without Google make a lesson to
resurrect the droid the razor name
rather and throw out an android phone
that's slim that's about style I would
guess it's going to be kind of a
mid-range phone it's not going to
compete with the droid bionic or
something like that maybe it's a flip
phone maybe it's a candy bar who knows
droid razr it's kind of got a good name
to it good ring to it and like I said
you know it's a piece of cell phone
history a piece of consumer history I
don't know I like it but I'm getting a
little old and gray well if I had hair a
little bit here on the side there be
getting low gray anyway stay tuned for
more on this what if they rocked like
the first ice cream sandwich home was
the droid
room that's not going to happen that'd
be kind of cool stay tuned from horn
this over on technobuffalo but chalk it
up to just a fun rumor for now alright
that's all the time we have for the
roundup this week again next Tuesday
September 20th whatever HTC unveils in
New York we will bring you the details
as soon as they're hot off the presses
bliss runnymede beats I don't know 50
cent apparently has his own head phone
line now everybody's getting ahead phone
line somebody on Twitter told me I
should get a headphone line I think I'm
going to be called crabby cans that's
terrible name will come with some better
