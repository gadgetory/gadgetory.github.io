TechnoBuffalo here's an unboxing of the
oppo n3 I haven't been this excited for
an oppo since Gangnam style
this is advice that's got the motorized
camera so your front-facing camera is
also your back camera it's got a lot of
really cool specs and a really nice
looking design let's go ahead and open
up this box that looks strange like an
old-school
airport extreme so here is the box for
the oppo n3 let me turn it around you
might think you're boxing and odo
nothing overly exciting your pre plane Y
packaging specs on the back but we're
watching the video so you don't have to
worry about that I will tell you what
they are and I will bring in my old
friend Senor stabby the obligatory
unboxing knife to cut this plastic open
go ahead and open this guy up push all
that aside so this guy's got a few
tricks up its sleeve primarily in the
camera Department I've only seen this in
pictures I've not seen this in person so
I am excited to take a look at it for
first time with you guys go ahead and
slide off the lid and there is the n3
that's actually not cardboard it is a
hard plastic it's kind of neat made that
noise when I put it down take the phone
out looking cool actually very just a
neat looking device push that off the
side for a quick sec what else you're
going to have inside of the box we've
got a sand removal tool we've got a
pretty large power brick here with a
single USB port and we've got some
headphones bundled into the box which is
kind of nice with microphone we've got
the new version of the okhla for doing
some remote controlling of your camera
and a little button cell battery to go
with that push all that off to the side
let's take a look at the end three eye
picking this thing up really feels
premium the phone just feels really nice
I'm going to peel this sucker off power
it on and we can run through all the
specs on it so we've got the n3 all
booted up and you look at it you're like
hey this looks like the n1 but we
more wieldy so this has a 5.5 inch
screen 1920 by 1080 so math whizzes if
you said 401 PPI you sir would be
correct
powering this guy is a Snapdragon 801
the quad-core 2.3 gigahertz keeping
everything coming along and running side
by side as two gigs of ram 32 gigs of
storage come on board that is expandable
the camera usually I say rear facing
camera and front facing camera but here
it's the same that is a 16 megapixel
camera that can shoot 4k at 30 frames
per second hello and if you notice
that's one of the coolest features that
camera features I believe 260 degree
rotation so it's the same camera for
selfies and taking little pictures it's
utilizing Schneider optics and to make
it work
it's simply slide your finger up on the
camera app and it rotates really quickly
you can see how fast that works we'll
take a look at that UI in just a minute
keeping this guy running is a 3000
milliamp hour battery and in looking at
this being like that vaguely looks like
Android it is running what oboe is
calling color OS which is based on
Android 4.4 and it weighs 192 grams I'll
talk about design because this thing
brings a lot to the design table I'm
gonna ignore the top and the bottom for
just like a second because there's a lot
of other stuff to talk about first
you've got a protruding steel frame
along the device is a protruding frame
is kind of unique you might think it
sounds a little odd but it actually
makes the phone feel really nice the
hand gives you a spot to kind of rest
your fingers on the left-hand side of
the device that is where your power and
lock buttons going to live on the bottom
is your micro USB charging ancing port
on the right volume up and down at 3.5
millimeter headset jack and probably
saying to yourself self that's weird so
on the right hand side
well can't really be on the top because
that rotating camera and the bottom
whatever to talk about can't be there
either so bear that in mind on the back
there's your front and rear-facing
camera and this guy which is a
fingerprint sensor and you're probably
also thinking those are gimmicky this
one works really well I'll show you how
that works in just a moment and then
some noise cancelling microphones and I
promised I would talk about the top and
bottom so let's go ahead and talk a
little bit more about the camera so I
mentioned
rotates itself if you want to say it
enough to do it manually like your head
- with previous versions
just a quick rotate we'll go ahead and
do that for you when using the front
facing version you get some let's just
call them interesting filters natural
memory one called Japanese Valencia
experts rainbow mano and a few other
ones built in there and you wanna take a
picture you can just beautify yourself
so high and now OPO software's
beautified me and made me not look
awkward at all now on the bottom you can
hardly see them are your Android buttons
you've got a menu button a home button
and a back button those are capacitive
buttons on the bottom is a bit of a just
weird design choice that metal frame
extends out if you can want to put it
almost puts a charm on the end of it it
just seems a little bit strange how that
works I believe it also hides some
notification lights as well so in case
you want to subtract of what's going on
those lights will show you some cool
things here with color OS first saying
no app drawer all the apps we have are
going to live on your home screen or in
folders that live on your home screen
but things on the OS do look very pretty
you want to go and just move your little
record player and started playing a lot
of little attention to detail like that
I will start to work on the audio player
will start playing but we shall pause
that for a moment pull down menu though
looks very typical Android future weeks
it almost looks like a cross between
what Amazon's done with fire OS and then
what Google sort of gives you natively
so bear that in mind we do a little bit
of that action I can see your multiple
windows if you want them so you want to
add some widgets to do a long press you
can check out some exclusive space
they've got or live whether those are
widget wallpapers they got effects and
themes they also have a theme store as
well if you want a theme your device and
of course you get access to all through
the Google Play stuff you would expect
from a modern Android smartphone I
control that little remote do click you
can go ahead and do the settings right
there for it as well I mentioned I would
talk about that guy on the back so first
time I show you how well it works I've
already set it up I want to unlock my
phone my finger right on the back
and it's a lot really quick and really
easy setup this is probably one of the
best fingerprint sensors that I have
ever used so I'll show you what the
setup looks like it's really elegant if
you want to add a fingerprint it's super
easy to go ahead and put your finger on
the back pick it up six times and you
are going to get two going again this
works really really well I can set it to
do a few different things application
encryption unlock and the like so it's
it'd be a pretty nice addition to a
posed lineup they've got a really nice
variety of phones what I really like
about this certainly is the front-facing
camera and the rear facing camera you
can now use them as one in the same with
a really kind of cool elegant look to
them so if you want really high quality
selfies with really high Snyder optics
this is a really nice phone to a look at
pricings get a very five to six hundred
dollar range depending on where you look
but of course that could change it I'm
almost Notice so be sure to check
pricing if you want to pick this guy up
unlocked the you guys for watching hope
