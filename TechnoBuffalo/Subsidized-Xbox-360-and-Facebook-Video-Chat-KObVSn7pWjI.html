to you by goto meeting is a $99 xbox 360
coming with a two-year contract is
Facebook prepping to add video chat
capabilities to their messenger app for
iOS and speaking of Facebook are they
hitting the road in preparation for the
long awaited IPO which might be coming
in just a couple of weeks let's find out
or at least you know make stuff up about
all this stuff it's techno Buffalo's
rumor roundup run them up hey what is
going on everybody and welcome to the
roundup it's rumor roundup TechnoBuffalo
on revision3 my name is Noah Kravitz and
I'm editor large with TechnoBuffalo and
this is your roundup of the week's tech
rumors for the week ending today Friday
May fourth 2012 could contract
subsidized pricing beheaded from the
cell phone world to the video game world
could be as crazy as it sounds our own
senior video game editor joey davidson
reported earlier this week that
microsoft may be gearing up to launch a
new xbox 360 bundle as early as next
week the bundle would include an xbox
360 and it connect and sell for
ninety-nine dollars if and here's the
big if you also sign up for two years
worth of xbox live gold service at
fifteen bucks a month though there are a
bunch of reports kicking around as
relates to this story and most of them
speculate that in addition to the
standard xbox live gold service
customers purchasing this bundle in the
two-year contract would get access to
some additional services possibly
streaming media an xbox live now you can
already watch content from netflix or
espn3 or all kinds of providers as long
as you subscribe to their services so it
could be that Microsoft has some kind of
deals for video content in the works
video you can buy direct through Xbox
Live and then of course there's the
speculation that Microsoft is gearing up
to launch a new version a new iteration
of their zune music service code named
Woodstock which would reside almost
entirely on xbox live or at least the
center it would be Xbox Live and
would also have multiple apps for mobile
and desktop platforms so maybe there's
some kind of bundle involving Woodstock
I don't know maybe something involving
Snoopy peppermint patty Linus that's a
bad pun whatever the case is in Joey's
reporting he was quick to point out
although he also was quick to give
credit because he didn't do the math
himself that polygon did the cocktail
napkin math and figured out that if you
were to walk into a store and buy the
xbox kinect bundle plus plunked down for
two years of xbox live gold service you
would be spending about four hundred and
twenty dollars american if you add up
the cost of ninety nine dollars plus
fifteen dollars a month x 24 months you
were paying about four hundred sixty
dollars again we don't know what might
be happening and that's why this is a
rumor show because we speculate about
stuff i think what they're going to do
is they're going to buy amazon except
that apple's going to buy both amazon
and microsoft and so when you sign up
for this thing not only do you get xbox
live gold but you also get two years of
amazon prime but you can only use the
service to buy Apple products that's
what right here that's my new rumor you
can see my head so big full of ideas
we'll be back in a moment with some news
on facebook or you know some rumor news

Noah alright we're back with some
speculation newsroom or speculation
whatever we're going to round it up as
pertains to Facebook we've got some
reports about the future of Facebook
Skype powered video chat service in
particular it may be coming to a mobile
device near you very soon reports that
stemmed from nine to five mac.com say
that Facebook is readying a new version
of its iOS client for iphone and ipod
touch that will include the first-ever
mobile application of facebook's video
chat apparently somebody from nine to
five max said that they've been testing
the apps out they got hold of them
somehow and that they run very well very
smooth again this is not the facebook
app at the facebook Messenger app which
currently is a separate app from the
main facebook app apparently once that's
out Facebook will turn to Android and
ready a video chat compatible version of
facebook for android or facebook
messenger for Android as well reports
starting with the Wall Street Journal
have made 18 pegged as the date that
Facebook will go public and begin
trading on the nasdaq under the stock
ticker symbol FB apparently head face
Mark Zuckerberg and a few of his cronies
are hitting the road are getting ready
to hit the road to do their IPO roadshow
the target is to raise somewhere in the
neighborhood of five billion dollars
with the IPO Facebook is reportedly
shooting for a 100 billion dollar
valuation on the heels of the IPO the
company has been doing about three
billion dollars a year in ad revenue
business with earnings up quite a bit
somewhere in the neighborhood of 850
billion dollars or so of ad revenue for
the quarter stay tuned and watch from
the sidelines because if you're watching
this show odds are you don't have the
kind of coin that's necessary a little
on the clout to get in on the IPO action
but if you do you don't want to call me
so next week my name is Noah crowds will
be back with another installment of
technobuffalo room around up next week
till then remember no matter how
frustrated you are don't punch a fire
extinguisher with your hand it's not
going to end well and as always when you
see a rumor round it up see you next
