Hazleton with TechnoBuffalo I'm quickly
checking out here the Samsung Galaxy
Note 8 it's finally here it's real it's
the 8 inch screen as the name implies
move around it real quick but it's got a
1.6 gigahertz processor dual core that's
a 5 megapixel camera on the back you
have the 3.5 millimeter headphone jack
up top power button on the right hand
side there volume buttons and then
there's the IR blaster that we've seen
another couple of tablets and that
actually allows you to control your TV
and the channels using a peel app that's
where the stylist goes there's a stylist
I'll show you that just a second micro
USB charging which is nice as opposed to
the proprietary they've used in the past
and a micro SD card slot for expanding
storage that's nice because actually I'm
sorry that's a sim card here's micro SD
and that's nice because it comes with
either 16 or 32 gigs of storage but then
you can bump that up a little bit sorry
I'm doing this with one hand it's
running jellybean a few or they've got
the same sort of features that you have
on other tablets are the note tablets
and let's see if we can do this with as
you enter where you can sort of split
the screen out though so right there you
can take notes and use the calendar at
the same time the video players say you
want to watch a movie or something while
you're working on your calendar so
really cool features
like that so i can stop the video and
now real quick in just a few minutes i'm
going to show you a comparison between
this and the ipad mini which I also
brought with me this is Todd hazleton
technobuffalo it's a first look at the
Galaxy Note 8 or from Samsung</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
