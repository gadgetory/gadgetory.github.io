go further what's up everyone jon
rettinger from TechnoBuffalo here live
from CES 2013 yesterday we had the
pleasure of going to invidious press
conference where amongst a slew of other
announcements they took the wraps off
the extremely well kept secret of
project shield on to give my thoughts
and impressions on project shield on
Tegra 4 that's powering it and all kinds
of other stuff that goes into that crazy
handheld gaming controller platform go
and get start project shield Fuji as it
might not know is essentially a
reference platform for tegra 4 of course
the follow-up to tagra 3 still has the
same four main cpu cores with the fifth
low power course or can do most
background tasks the big deal though is
of course with LTE connectivity and a 72
core GPU can also output 4k video which
is really incredible so what project
shield is essentially it's an entire
tablet in a controller I think of your
typical controller for an xbox 360 it
looks very similar to that it's got
console ask buttons and console quality
grade buttons and it's got a built-in
5-inch screen you can play all of your
games from the TegraZone these have to
be Tegra optimized game it's really get
the full experience right on your device
of course you can wirelessly fling it
right to a television of course you can
use a wired connection as well and push
that right off to the TV so we saw a few
examples of games that were made just
for the tablet android games at least
they looked very impressive they were
showing on a 4k TV and of course we
couldn't show you what the 4k TV looked
like cuz you know just over twitter or
youtube not to do any justice but it
looked absolutely beautiful but some of
the cool secret sauce is actually
constrain games right from your pc to
your shield device so if you play a game
on steam let's say you play left 4 dead
2 for example you could play that right
on your handheld no matter where you go
so it's pretty cool you're always
bringing your pc games with you mobile
as opposed to bring your mobile games
onto your pc it's a really cool new
thing other than invidious trying to do
so one thing they didn't announce was
price or release date sure lends me to
believe that maybe it's going to be more
of a reference platform
maybe it won't hit the market they
seemed very jazzed about it though and
really what it's going to do but I'm
still not sure that it's going to have
an itch I was checking out the comments
on TechnoBuffalo Kerry Wood is calling
it the xperia play 2 point 0 and a lot
of ways yeah it's true it is the xperia
play but i guess you could say the same
thing for the ps3 and xbox 360 being the
new version of the Atari Jaguar yeah
they're both consoles but seriously way
above the competition we're trying to
figure out what to categorize it under
we're writing it up should go into our
products pages a tablet is it something
else is a gaming console really weren't
sure it's sort of a hybrid I do love a
few things of videos done first they
made it totally open it is running
completely unskilled on stock Android
with one push that shield button you go
from the TegraZone store right to
unskinny an adulterated unmess with
android which is very nice you get that
same Android experience you can fling
that right to your TV and use that as
well also they use completely
unpretentious tree standard stuff so
hdmi micro USB for charging batteries
already built in so you get 5 to 10
hours don't have to lug around that
extra power brick I'm not sure what
pricing again is going to be if there's
gonna be a huge market for it but this
is an example of what Tegra 4 can do
really very cool to see what do you guys
think excited about project sealed
you're not excited Tegra 4 you super
jazz about it I love to hear what you
guys have to think of course check out
all the CES 2013 coverage at
