headset unboxing this one is the metal
contour sent to me by the good folks at
my gear store calm so before we dig into
it let's take a look at the box we've
got the headset right on front contour
design let you know that it's made of
metal on the side just contour design
and it tells you that there are couple
ear loops and six speaker covers on the
back lets you know that you've got a USB
cable USB car charger adapter belt clip
all the stuff that we'll see probably in
the box and with some little
descriptions on the headset there and up
to seven days standby time which is
actually pretty impressive for up to 5
hours talktime so that just a longer
battery than the jawbone but it doesn't
have the noise canceling features let's
go ahead and dig in and see what we got
looks like it's a bunch of easier box to
open up and if you guys are interested
in this or any other products that i've
reviewed from my gear store i'll put a
link in the sidebar for 10% off of their
online store actually pretty nice them
so on top we've got USB adapter just
handy for a lot of things actually it's
always good to have an extra one of
these
that's for your car then slide this out
and here is the headset just in a little
piece of flimsy plastic this headsets
gotten a lot of good reviews so i'm
really curious to use it for myself and
see it pulled off the little your jelly
goes with it let's put that back on well
this is a small headset really thin go
ahead and put that to the side for just
a minute and see what else you have in
the box
really dig your finger in there to pull
it out there it is okay and the rest of
the stuff got your loop so I'm not the
biggest fan of your loops usually I try
and just to fit in my ear if I can so we
got some more little ear gels six of
them little belt holster that's funny
let's take a look at the belt holster
but you guys ever put a bluetooth
headset on your belt
maybe my dad would maybe but I don't
know who else would do that let's see
what it looks like in the holster that's
such a silly little accessory and then
you just clip it onto your belt I guess
and slide it out that will never ever
ever get used if you guys happen to see
me in the street and I've got a
Bluetooth built holster on need to yell
at me then we've got a little well look
at that it's a USB extender cable one if
it charges just via USB hmm have to see
how this charges but just a USB extender
cable which is very handy let's go and
take a look at the headset and there's
some instructions and stuff here - so
here's the headset itself it really is
very very very thin you can see on the
side not much the profile doesn't weigh
very much at all and actually looks like
it's gonna be relatively comfortable so
let's take a look at it compared with
the one that I just unboxed the other
day the job won't - we'll definitely see
size difference now the jawbone has more
features than the metal contour but you
pay for it with a little bit of a size
difference so much much much thinner and
there's a review coming up of the
jawbone - as well so stay tuned for that
so this looks to be a very nice headset
certainly light and curious how it's
gonna fit in the ear and how the sound
quality is but so far it looks you know
it looks pretty nice on the back here
looks like they're three buttons
probably volume up volume down and a
call and button some metal contour
Bluetooth alright this has been John
