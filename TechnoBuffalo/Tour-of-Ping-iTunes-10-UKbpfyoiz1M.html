technobuffalo here and i want to give
you a first look at the just-released
and just announced itunes 10 let's go
ahead and get started the first thing
you're gonna notice about itunes 10 is
it's got a new icon gone is the CD in
the background and got the music note
with that little glowy blue circle let's
go ahead and open it up and take a look
at what itunes 10 looks like alright so
here is itunes 10 accessing the itunes
store let's go ahead and take a look at
music first this is where you're gonna
get the new hybrid view previously with
older versions of itunes when you are
looking at your music and you had a
bunch of songs in the same album it
would just list them all straight down
with the album name now if you have five
or more songs in the same album you're
going to get this album artwork still
got some ACDC right here doesn't take up
any more space you can choose whether or
not you want to have it and how you want
to view it I just sort of a nice new way
to visually look at your music and
scroll through albums but that's not the
big thing here that's not the main
attraction what people want to see when
people want to see lives off here to the
left and it is paying apple's new social
media music experiment I guess let's go
ahead and open it up and take a real
quick first look so here is paying it
gives you a welcome to ping screen I
went through and set up my profile on
the right hand side you can see where it
says profile my reviews people feature
let's go ahead and take a look at
profile and here's I just set this up
very quickly you can see what a profile
looks like so it's got my name I put a
picture about me recent activity I don't
have any yet let me show you what it
looks like when you set up a profile go
off here to the right and here you can
put in your information you can put in
your name you can put in your gender
photo where you live about you genres of
music that you like choose how you want
music can be displayed in your profile
either automatically to manually don't
display music at all privacy settings
you can't allow people to follow you
which really can be open to anyone you
can have people require the approval to
follow you so they can't just follow you
blindly actually
prove them and they'll see all your
information or don't allow people to
follow you at all and there's only
enough you've got Facebook Connect here
as well let's go ahead and close this
take a look a little bit closer at pain
so here's your profile go ahead and look
for people at shirts for people if you
like go ahead and let's say look at
featured so here we got some featured
artists go ahead and look at let's say
Katy Perry go ahead and view the artist
page and see these people were already
ready to go all the albums by Katy Perry
you can see on the right you got
listeners also bought so it's like
another way to probably sell you in
music Katy Perry music videos and it
looks to be the extent of em you can go
ahead and fall over let's go in so you
can get her profile and here is a key
Perry's profile it's a little bit about
her a California girl artists all that
business recent activity people are
talking to Katy Perry you can see what
she posted her music here there's your
single talking already about it's like
her profile is pretty active you can see
what an active profile is gonna look
like very similar to Facebook you can
put pictures up there you can leave
comments on peoples will all on star
talk to them directly and here's people
that are following Katy Perry here often
the left you got 767 followers you can
already see it right there pretty sure
it forward and pretty simple this has
been just a quick look at penguin take a
closer look later i'm curious what you
guys have to think about it whether you
agree or disagree with apple jumping
into the social media field I'm sort of
reserving my judgment so I have a chance
to use it a little bit more anyway I am
jon rettinger for technobuffalo and i'll
see you the next video bye bye
you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
