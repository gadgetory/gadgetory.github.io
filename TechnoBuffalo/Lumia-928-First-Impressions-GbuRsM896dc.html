TechnoBuffalo i am here checking out the
Lumia 928 the verizon version of the
nokia or nokia lumia 920 I'm gonna be
checking it out let's take a look at
what makes this a little bit different
from the 920 okay so here it is the
nokia or nokia depending on where you
live in the world Lumia 928 this is the
special version that was created for
verizon and as you can see we have the
verizon red theme happening here wanted
to make sure that we were serving up
verizon realness we have the branding of
course and it's also 4G LTE right there
on the back you can see it's a little
bit different design here so on the 920
which is here it's not as rounded
obviously we have some flatter edges
which is a little bit different and then
on the back we have a xenon flash
instead of two LEDs which that's also in
addition that is pretty exciting for a
camera enthusiasts and we know that
Nokia is traditionally also very
enthusiastic about their camera
technology Carl Zeiss PureView lenses
this one has the same f-stop so they're
they're running on very similar camera
technology the 928 has a slightly
different camera algorithm but other
than that they're almost identical the
Nokia Lumia 928 has an AMOLED screen
which is a little different than the 920
the 920 has an IPS LCD but they do have
the same PPI it's 3 30 to 4 and a half
inch screens and the same resolution so
pretty similar in terms of looks
honestly this screen is really beautiful
of course with AMOLED the blacks are
super deep and rich and you know really
does the windows phone 8 UI justice very
brightly colored UI that we're all
familiar with so let's check out a
couple of different things happening on
the on the phone here one of the things
that a lot of people haven't quite
noticed is on the 920 the screen starts
at about right here
and the bezel on the top is actually a
little bit shorter than the bezel at the
bottom actually it's quite a bit shorter
I want to say it's about half the size
of the bezel on the 928 nokia has
actually fixed that so now instead of
having to kind of reach a little farther
with your right thumb you don't have to
do that the screen is pretty well
centered which is kind of a nice thing
if you enjoy typing in landscape mode we
have 32 gigabytes of non-expandable
storage on board no removable battery
but we've pretty much seen that from
Nokia up until this point so it's not a
huge surprise but for some of you that
might be a problem honestly with Windows
Phone 8 optimization getting a full days
where the battery should not be a
problem but I will run through those in
my tests and make sure that you're going
to get a full day's worth of battery out
of the 928 other than that it's pretty
similar to the 920 and the 925 in terms
of specs they're pretty much identical
they're using 1.5 gigahertz Snapdragon
s4 plus dual core processor it's got one
gig of ram they also both have 8.7
megapixel cameras on the back so you're
looking at pretty similar pretty similar
cell phones here really it's just a
matter of design if you were hoping for
colorful phones on the 928 on verizon
i'm sorry you're in for some
disappointment because if you wanted a
beautiful cyan 928 you're not gonna get
one the 928 only comes in black and
white my friends so if you want any kind
of personality you're gonna have to do
it with tiles a lot of people are always
curious about the apps available for
Windows Phone 8 one of the big arguments
that I tend to hear from people who are
hesitant or on the fence about picking
up a Lumia device is that they're not
sure that all the apps are quite there
so let's let's go to the marketplace and
check out what's happening with apps
generally speaking I got to be honest if
there isn't an official app for it like
Instagram there's usually some kind of
third-party developer who is kind of
picked up the slack on that which is a
really nice thing so if we go to the top
free apps you can see far post not
google has made a youtube app it has a
lot of really good ratings facebook
pandora skype ESPN of course Nokia's
proprietary
city lens music driving apps which is
which are actually quite good we also
have weather highlights cinemagraph
which is a really cool camera feature we
have netflix SkyDrive I mean pretty much
the things that you're looking for are
gonna be here on the phone and I know
that google is not planning on having
native apps but generally speaking nokia
it tends to pick up the slack in terms
of mapping i don't think that you would
be desperately missing anything in
particular unless you had some very
specific app that was exclusive to
either iOS or android that you would be
missing this is instance so that's the
instagram app very popular and and and
also well reviewed a lot of people
really like this love being able to post
photos on instagram so it's definitely
getting better i would say getting
better so if you're on the fence give it
a shot because honestly windows phone is
it's a good operating system as with all
of them they have their own pros and
cons there are some things that i don't
care for in Windows Phone but there are
some things I also really like a live
tiles is really fun it's a great way to
sort of see all of your information at a
glance I do like the Xbox integration
and it's always really fun to be able to
have that available to you obviously
SmartGlass a really really cool feature
that I'm a big fan of especially with
Game of Thrones sue me but yeah that's
not that's the basics generally speaking
it's the same Windows Phone 8 experience
that you're used to getting there's
obviously no custom skins like an
Android and it really does have
extremely similar specs and everything
to the 920 and the 925 it's just a
matter of really taking a look at it
deciding if you want to grab this on
verizon obviously verizon traditionally
hasn't really supported Windows Phone as
much as say AT&amp;amp;T has so this is a really
exciting thing for anybody on big red
who's been waiting for the Lumia 928
I'll have a full review up in maybe a
week or so but please feel free to drop
in any questions in the comments and
tell me what features you might want to
see me cover and I'd be happy to go over
to them in the full review until next
time
