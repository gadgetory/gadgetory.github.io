while I guess it's not all doom and
gloom and tech there's a huge silver
lining in Silicon Valley the tech Mecca
is in the middle of an epic hiring spree
Moody's predict some 150,000 new tech
jobs will be added to the economy this
year alone so who's hiring and what jobs
I think it's a Scott melon CEO of online
recruiting from dice holdings and jon
rettinger president of technobuffalo
okay good to have both of you with us
let me talk with you John first when
moody says 150,000 tech jobs are going
to be added in this year and there as of
right now or actually last month 6.1
million tech jobs were available in the
United States how does that compare to
every other industry does it really
stand out it absolutely stands out that
6.1 million jobs is actually up
two-point-four percent from last year
it's time to start having faith in the
American economy again in tech is really
one of the sector's leading that charge
google added 1900 jobs on the first
quarter alone they are on and its really
really impressive hiring spree college
recruitment is way up Google's competing
with Microsoft is competing with
Facebook we haven't seen perks like this
since the dot-com boom of the early
2000s Facebook has voted one of the top
places to work Google's offering
expresso bars bars shuttles at doctors
appointments and it's hun of perks that
make working for the tech giant really
appealing Scott what about you I mean
you're out there hiring people walk us
through how hard is it to find people
are you having to pay them more what
kind of perks you giving them oh well
you're right we're hiring people around
our company and we're finding that it is
much more difficult to find people you
know if you look at the site that we run
dice com we've seen a surge in
recruiting for technology people really
across all the major metropolitan areas
in the US and all the skill sets and in
some of the major tech centers in the US
so Silicon Valley New York Seattle
Austin Texas if there are those are very
tight labor markets today and companies
are going to have to react to that and
so are you do you find the people that
you need here Scott I mean are you
you're forced to look overseas do people
have the right degrees we always hear
this fight right especially when it
comes to tech and hot and
tech engineering sure sure we well there
is a wonderful talent pool here in the
US it because of some of the visa
restrictions that have been in place
since nine eleven many companies have
been forced to go offshore to find
people but there's a terrific labor pool
here it's getting a little tight in
those major tech centers though where do
you think John is this all still really
in a couple of metropolitan areas
whether that be Austin or or San
Francisco you know it's certainly
focused where a lot of these major
companies are Northern California is
always a hotbed for tech and the other
areas that were mentioned Austin Texas
and New York it is a great time to be
out there looking for a job if you're a
college students and you're figuring out
which career you want to pursue
technology is really going to offer
tremendous advantages if you're
considering a midlife career change
there are going to be tremendous
opportunities for talented people in the
text field and what's the overall
average salary Scott would you say well
on our site overall salaries just about
eighty thousand dollars a year but
there's really a lot of upside to that
we're seeing salaries in Silicon Valley
well over a hundred thousand hundred
fifty thousand and up to get the key
skills all right thanks very much Scott
John appreciate it thank you Kurt the
beer well Apple came under fire last
week after the revelation that the
iphone and ipad tracks users now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
