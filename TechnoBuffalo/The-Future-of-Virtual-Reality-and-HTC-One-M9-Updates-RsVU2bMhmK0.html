to you by domain.com what's up everyone
welcome back their pursuit of Aston
Buffalo I am John Breton just to show he
could ask me any question you've got
from the technology and very often times
just way way way outside of it jump into
the first question
at guy named Mitch so Mitch I'm assuming
that's your name at John for Lakers with
the wave Eri where is going do you think
they may replace our smartphones hashtag
at the buffalo hashtag ask the B no no I
do not think the replace with
smartphones because wearing virtual
reality headset is not going to be
practical even if it's less obtrusive
than what we see with microsoft hololens
or something in long lines of Google
glass that is not gonna replace pulling
something out of your pocket it might
ought meant it certainly in the very
near future break do not think it's
gonna replace it and if you want to know
more about hololens stick around next
one comes from Sean the man 34 who s at
Java for Lakers well Apple do another
keynote for the Apple watch just release
it they'll they'll just release it fun
story though about the Apple watch when
I was at the last Apple Keynote for the
iPads I was in the second row of the
event sitting behind some Apple execs
and I'm not gonna mention names but one
of the big execs when the guys you see
on stage all the time was talking to a
colleague about the Apple watch and he
said and I quote or at least paraphrase
as best I can remember if you could have
announced it
this being the Apple watch and an event
like this but those Hollywood guys just
would've leaked it anyway so celebrities
were involved the Apple launch perhaps
that's why it was announced way early so
I do not think it's gonna be another
Kino just a fun story to fun fact next
one comes from at easy Dollaz who asks
at John for licorice I upgrade to the m9
from my m8 I also had the m7 man I loves
me some HTC phones bar you we don't know
much about the HTC m9 quite yet I would
wait like three weeks to see if
something comes out at Mobile World
Congress there's been a ton of leaked
shots with the m9 could look like we're
also hearing rumors that those are just
cases for the hardware underneath that's
not what the phone's gonna actually look
like so I would wait and see if that
helps answer your question let me do
what y'all love for just one quick hot
second and thank the peeps at dome

TechnoBuffalo it's one word
TechnoBuffalo at domain.com check out
that back to the questions last one
comes from ho trippin or who asked at
John for Lakers what do you see coming
the next 10 years in terms of Holograms
after the abilities of microsoft
hololens this is super exciting in a
world that I didn't think was even gonna
happen up until last week the Microsoft
is like look friggin Holograms I think
the big change we're gonna sees
interactivity with Holograms so much
like I take a picture of yourself raking
video chat with yourself I think you're
gonna be camera to let you serve
hologram interact to be able to do video
conferencing with full hologram I'm
talking like Star Wars help me obi-wan
you're our only hope
type holograms which should be really
incredible to see also this is some pipe
dream but we're talking about 10-years
down-the-road smartphones and smart
devices being able to have holographic
projectors so you said of just FaceTime
you can actually see that person in
front of you perhaps you were glasses
and you're only when I can see the
hologram so no one else can sort of see
what you're doing I know what you're
doing with it I would probably be my
guesses and I thank you guys for
watching it was a short condensed
episode of ask the Buffalo I'm trying to
cut out all my rambling rambles and just
talk about the good stuff hope you guys
