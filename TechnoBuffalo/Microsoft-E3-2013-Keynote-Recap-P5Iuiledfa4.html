to you by State Farm helping you get to
a better State hey guys Ashley scandal
with technobuffalo giving you the too
long didn't watch recap of the Microsoft
keynote from e3 today now 20 games were
shown at the keynote so you might not
have time to watch that full to our
piece of video so we're going to tell
you our five favorite games are the ones
that piqued our interest at the
conference today metal gear solid 5 the
phantom pain taking place during what's
rumored to be the soviet-afghan war in
the 1970s the game boasts new stealth
mechanics and the much-hyped Fox engine
powering it also Kiefer Sutherland of 24
Fame will be taking over the voice
duties for snake which might be a tough
pill to swallow for longtime fans of the
franchise then there's rise son of Rome
which looks like it will combine the
intense combat of the call of duty
franchise with the timeline of the Roman
Empire microsoft says rise will have
some deep connect compatibility which
will give gladiator fans something to
look forward to while they yell are you
not entertained in their living rooms
Microsoft's flagship racer forza 5 took
the stage today with the McLaren p1 on
stage and a new concept called drivatar
basically forza 5 learns your driving
style and then races against other
drivers when you're not playing you'll
be playing against other people's
drivatar when you race too weird but
kind of cool technology quantum break
also caught our eye with a story about a
man named Jack Joyce who survives an
experiment gone horribly wrong involving
the space-time continuum the demo shows
him pulling a woman out of a frozen in
time state and it was one of the more
interesting games we saw today on the
xbox one and lastly the fighter is back
with a huge franchise revival killer
instinct has been resurrected from the
90s for the Xbox one and it looks like
it will bring the same huge
entertainment value stylized characters
and hopefully the same ability to play
as a velociraptor fingers crossed
everybody so those are our five favorite
games that we saw today at the press
conference
now they didn't talk a lot about new
media or entertainment because they
already kind of did that at the unveil
event a few weeks back the other thing
that they announced was a new xbox 360
it's a little slimmer full of cooler
more modern brings it in line with the
xbox one design that is actually for
sale right now so if you want to get an
xbox 360 but why would you the Xbox one
is coming you can pick one up on Amazon
or any of your favorite retailers right
this second so get one if you if you're
looking for it the other thing is they
also gave us a launch window and a price
so the xbox one will be coming to 21
countries in November of this year for
499 US dollars now that's quite a bit of
money but when you think you're getting
the Kinect as well and all of that extra
connectivity and functionality with all
the voice actions with Kinect and the TV
stuff that they have the integration
it's not a bad deal but there are a lot
of skeptics out there and people who
distrust Microsoft after they've been
saying that they are kind of killing the
used games market on xbox one and that
buying a game means you're just
licensing it so I'm wondering how you
guys feel about the xbox one are you
getting one are you piggy went up did
you preorder one today let us know in
the comments and we will be checking out
all kinds of things from the show floor
so stay tuned and if there's any game
you want us to go check out at the
microsoft booth let us know in the
comments I want to thank our friends at
state farm for powering our e3 coverage

schedule offering 24 7 access to an
agent on your schedule not theirs let
them help you get to a better State
