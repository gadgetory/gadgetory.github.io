the table better cameras new colors ip67
water resistance but as Apple giveth
Apple taketh away on the bottom no
headphone jack on the sandwiches piston
a lot of people off including me and
jolteon here so enter a tiny little $10
solution there's a lot of these options
popping up this particular ones by the
folks at il doc go ahead and plug it in
it does what you know that all the way
in there kind of snaps in place and
seems to be a pretty snug it's it's not
loose and of course because lightning it
is reversible again there's the
Lightning port and the headphone jack
pop it in a pair of headphones and get
your music on I really like also though
the inline controls and headphones will
still work so whether or not you have a
older pair of apple headphones or
something different like we have here
still going to function you listen to
music while you charge at the same time
and it's not going to obscure the
speaker grill or the fake speaker grill
on on the other side though if you put
in your pocket it can definitely snap
off pretty easily some more something to
carry with you and that's something to
keep permanently attached to your phone
but if you need a pair of headphones
this is a pretty good option to work
really well in my bed a week that I have
been testing I've used it quite a lot in
cars even an uber for example let's
don't try to give you the aux port I was
just staring at them like up phone off
17 life so short little video i just
wanted to show a solution to solve one
of the more annoying things about the
iphone will link to this down below if
you want to check it out but otherwise
there are a lot of options available
that do something similar this one just
works well and they tested it so plug in
if you need it annoying that you got to
have an adapter for a phone but hey
that's that's the way the world works
now so maybe while you're listening to
music and charging your phone at the
same time you might have a inspiration
to create a website and if you do you
can check out the folks at Squarespace

looking website blogs or online stores
