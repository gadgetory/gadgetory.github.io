TechnoBuffalo with review of this thin
little guy this is the latest MacBook
the reincarnation of the MacBook I went
to wait for a while but it is back thin
and clad in aluminum we tested the 1.2
gigahertz dual-core Intel Core M model
eight gigs of ram 512 gigabyte SSD of
Intel HD graphics 5300 configured at
1600 bucks so not cheap something has
revealed a bit differently I'm gonna go
through just all the questions I had
about the computer kind of just like a
lightning review so point point point
point all the things you want to know
about this we will talk about first if
you're the kind of person that says I
could build a PC for 600 bucks I could
build a way better computer this is
clearly not aimed at you this thin
little laptop I'm also going to end up
the conclusion whether or not I think is
worth it or not worth it let's start at
the screen so the 12-inch 2304 by 1440
screen looks damn good in fact when the
best screens I've ever seen on a
computer you're thinking about getting a
MacBook Air and after seeing whether
retina looks like on a similar sized
screen I would really think twice and
we'll talk a little bit more later about
that MacBook Air so about the core M
chip that's powering this guy it's
coupled with Intel's HD graphics 5300 so
the question I had was how weak is it so
think of this processor as the guy at
the gym who walks up thinks he can bench
300 pounds puts it on the bar picks it
up and then just immediately screams for
a spotter because it falls on his chest
that's what this guy's like so here's
what I can do and what it cannot do it
can 100% play 4k videos in full screen
no issue at all
but connected though to an external UHD
monitor it could not with the lid open
or delayed closed it was just a
stuttering mess 1080p video though
played fine on full screen whether the
laptop was closed whether I had an
external monitor connected no problem at
all with 1080p so that's all you're
playing on your watching don't worry I
did test it with YouTube and of course
it can do all the other streaming stuff
you'd want like Netflix and Hulu without
any issue the question I had was can a
game and the answers kinda I played
Starcraft 2 on default settings with no
issues at all good play some Arkham City
but if you're getting this computer to
be a gaming rig you should not do that
so it can also do some video editing I
tested on Final Cut Pro 10 but hot damn
is it slow it's a last resort machine it
would took about twice as long as my
two-year-old 13-inch MacBook Pro so yeah
I can do it but you know get a cup of
coffee put your feet up call your mom's
even called her in a while and just wait
we're processing Netflix YouTube all the
non intensive things though it'll work
on just fine without any servation
regards whether you got a plugged into a
monitor or not I was worried about how
hot it was gonna get without a fan it
got warm but not like worried about
having children warm we've got on your
skin to notice that it's not cool but
it's not gonna fry at all so Apple did a
really nice job keeping the heat down
alright so what about that keyboard this
is a really odd experience the computer
is so thin at 13.1 millimeters that plot
to completely redo the keyboard
mechanism they made a big deal about
their butterfly hinge with the
translates to is you've got no wiggle at
all you can press anywhere on the key
and get that same uniform click the
problem is though doesn't have so far to
go when it does its click so that means
you have almost no throw at all it feels
more like typing on an iPad than actual
keyboard I got used to it quickly but I
would not say I enjoyed it if ever used
the type cover on the surface three of
the surface pro 3 that is a much more
enjoyable experience in typing on the
guy another new feature is the force
touch trackpad doesn't actually move and
said it's a taptic engine that they
could feel like it's clicking it works
brilliantly i detecting hard presses or
soft ones almost perfectly it's an
absolute pleasure to use it's also
available on the macbook pro which
handle video editing and some gaming
just sayin if you want that feature
there are other options out there but it
does work really well probably my
favorite features of the computer now I
was expecting a really tinny sound from
the speaker especially on something this
small the speakers blew me away they
sound really good don't have any tinny
noise usually get from built-in laptop
speakers so if you just want a deejay a
party without any speakers plugged in
let's go work I should do a pretty good
job you want to see that review though
put a link to it down below I'm an end
with the score and a buy not buy
recommendation kind of something new
haven't done before previous phones next
let's talk about the elephant in the
room I'm not talking about Lucy or the
tomato in the room if you're a parent
hood fan let's talk about ports or
should I just say port
I don't mind switching to a new standard
in USB see I get the things I have to
change the port is really versatile lets
you charge with an external battery
which is a really nice feature and I can
do just about everything I do kind of
miss MagSafe but I was okay using the
big ridiculously overpriced HDMI dongle
I meant what I want to take the computer
with me I just needed to pull one cord
out and I was good to go all that was
great but one port is really difficult
to live with in actual use not
everything is Wireless yet what I would
like to at least had one USB port so I
can recharge something else built into
the power brick like you've got with the
surface pro 3 it became tough I could
see it being usable but dongles on
dongles on dongles only gets expensive
but if you forget one I also run into
problem not being able to use everything
to use I wouldn't taking your device
with you so Apple introduced a new way
to stack batteries they succeed in
delivering a really good battery life
here out the 39.7 watt our lithium
polymer pack I got almost nine hours
advertised while using Safari but if
you're a chrome user be prepared for
about half of that number so get used to
Safari if you want
use this one it's not plugged in I like
we're going to touch that 480p
front-facing camera I think that says
enough it's a 480p front-facing camera
on what as configured at 1600 a laptop
I'd soberness you could probably tell
where I'm going with this this thing is
a Ferrari with a four-cylinder engine
it's all bark and very little bite
you're clearly paying a ton of money for
design for its two-pound body and
beautiful screen but not much else here
this computer would be a big pass if
you're looking for a computer that can
do absolutely everything well that's
going to last you a few years few
caveats if you're a frequent traveler
you're doing a lot of emailing you do a
lot of web browsing I just watched your
1080p video yeah you'll be ok for your
place computer every year you'll
probably be ok but she want something's
gonna last you for years and years and
years I'm gonna be hard pressed to
recommend this it also puts the MacBook
Air in a really weird position the
MacBook Air is all about being thin and
light and then the MacBook comes in the
thinner and lighter gotta wonder where
the MacBook Air now slots into the
apples lineup pre MacBook Air there
existed two lines of computers there was
a MacBook and there was a MacBook Pro
makes me wonder if perhaps we've seen
the end of that MacBook Air Alliance
gonna go away and replace with just
different versions of the MacBook my big
issues with this is lack of horsepower I
probably would have appreciated it maybe
a little bit thicker of a device with a
fan and they Retina screen so pretty
much an upgraded MacBook Air would have
made everybody really happy get rid of
those huge bezels upgrade the screen and
I think people would have really
appreciated what that had also an extra
port or two would have been really nice
you can live with it but just be
prepared you're going to spend a ton of
money on dongles but fun advice there
are a lot of other USB C dongles that
are not made by Apple that are way
cheaper Google sells a ton for the new
Chromebook pixel that'll save you a lot
of scratch so again save a couple bucks
if you're spending this much money for a
laptop but if I was buying this with my
own money to use for a few years I would
really
you think twice and I think you guys are
watching hope you enjoy a good video a
thumbs up it was appreciated until next
time I'm trying to render from
TechnoBuffalo see you guys next video
buh-bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
