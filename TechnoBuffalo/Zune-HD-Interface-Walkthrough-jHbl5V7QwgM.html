an extensive walkthrough of the zune HD
interface we're going to cover pretty
much everything except for the internet
and the social part of the zune HD we're
going to save that for later videos so
let's start by turning on the device
taking it out of standby and the unlock
sequence is quite simple you just lift
up the window shade kind of like you do
on the on some Android devices so we
bring that up and let's zoom in on the
screen so the home screen of the zune HD
is what you're looking at right now and
there's actually two on the screens one
on the left and one on the right and
you're going to notice the graphics of
the zune HD are fantastic the the NVIDIA
Tegra platform really brings things to
life video looks great music is is
beautiful it's really a celebration of
multimedia I think on the zune HD
compared to say the ipod touch where
it's kind of like a multi-function app
device with multimedia with the internet
with email and everything in between the
zune HD is very focused on multimedia
now if you tap on this button here you
can actually jump from side to side let
me just take you through what you have
on the left here here we have something
called pins it's kind of like a favorite
music section so you can add any album
to the pins or a song or something right
now I just have this album here and it's
playing through the headphones let's go
back and this shows you history things
that you've done recently so in the
upper left corner is the recent most
thing I've listened to or watched or
played with so here we can see that I've
listened to a radio station I had some
albums I was looking at some pictures
that were on the device if we go down we
can see the things that I've recently
added to my zune HD so recently I've
added a teaser from the office a teaser
from heroes now the TV shows and then I
have some pictures that i've i've added
recently a new photo gallery that is a
calculator chess game new CD you can
basically go back through your history
and see what you've been doing on your
zune which is a great feature to kind of
go back and listen to the same track you
were on yesterday and so on and so forth
so this main menu is
a self explanatory it shows you music
and videos and pictures and we're going
to drill into all of those now let's go
into music zune has a really interesting
option for listening to music or for
buying music so-called zune pass it's
fifteen dollars a month that lets you
download unlimited music to your zune
and to your computer you don't own the
music but for as long as you pay 1499 a
month you get to listen to the music
which i think is a really good deal it's
a really good tool for music exploration
so you could download 50 60 100 thousand
albums in a month if you want to and
just listen to all the music you want
that said if you decide to change to the
ipod touch well that music kind of goes
away because you're not paying for the
zune pass anymore but also with the zune
pass you get to own 10 tracks a month of
those that you've downloaded so that
could be good right now that sort of
screen savers coming on so we can sort
by artists playlists songs genre and
albums and we can also swipe to the
right or swipe to the left to get to
these areas so let's go to albums and
let's go to Radiohead so we get a
beautiful animation and it comes up on
the screen now I can swipe to the right
to go to the next track or I can tap
down here to bring up the tracklist very
beautiful transitions and animations and
from here I can tap on any of these and
play them and right now it's playing now
you saw the screen saver so let me wait
a second you're going to see it come up
on the screen and here it comes so kind
of sliding across the screen it tells
you the name of the album which is ok
computer and you can have it also same
the name of the track obviously the
screen is going to shut off in a few
seconds to save battery life but really
awesome looking screensaver now for play
controls you can tap the button on the
left side and this is the standard
played controls you get so you can
increase the volume decrease the volume
skip to the next track go back or press
pause now you also get this menu in a
few other areas if I tap outside of the
album art I will get that as well and
like I mentioned you can
this button at any time whether you're
playing a game or you're watching a
video to get that on the screen to
adjust the play controls so let's go
back artists audioslave a very quick
interface again we can flick back and
forth this way or we can tap down here
and we always press on the top in this
corner to go back to the previous menu
very intuitive we can add it as a
favorite we can put it on repeat or have
it on shuffle very nice implementation
of music on the zune HD really lets you
see the album art and experience the
music in a very intimate way that I
don't feel like you get so much on the
ipod touch let's go to videos I've put
two videos on here right now beyond the
one that comes on here out of the
factory it's just a preview or teaser of
the office and it's in high definition
so if i had the cable i can plug it in
to an HDTV and get 720p video output but
i can tell you looking at it right now
it's beautiful if we tap on the screen
we get those play controls that i
mentioned right now the camera is having
trouble focusing on that and we can make
it louder or softer go to the next video
or the next actually we're jumping ahead
in the scene
okay so let's go to pictures and I am
going to go to some of the pictures that
I put in here recently I added these
pictures and let me the accelerometer
works extremely fast look at that very
fast we can flick to the side like we
can on the ipod touch we can zoom in
like so zooms very fast rear enders
extremely fast then we can tap on the
screen and press play for a nice little
slideshow you get the point and pictures
really really pop on this oled screen
it's it's really beautiful so let's go
back and go back again and of course you
can sort by date or folder or many
different ways if you have a lot of
pictures on your device you can really
keep them organized let's go into radio
this has HD radio capability which is an
interesting technology basically it's
higher fidelity radio and if you have a
car that has HD radio you know that you
also get some data on the screen so the
radio will tell you what song is playing
right now similar to RDS if you're
familiar with that let me see if I can
pull up an HD radio station now so I'm
going to have its can no that's not HD
radio this is a think we have some HD
radio back here actually I have placed a
little shortcut in here there we go
looks like it's not coming through as HD
right now because I'm in a area whether
it's not good signal what's really neat
about the zune HD radio is that you can
pause live radio and that's a really
innovative feature so it has a few
seconds buffer where it will kind of
save it start storing it to memory then
you can go back and play it when you're
ready to listen so a great way to
experience radio that I don't think
we've seen on any other devices and from
here we can add this to a favorite or
remove it to a favorite marketplace is
where you go to get apps and right now
there are a very very limited selection
of apps see it says not connected is
trying to connect and here are the apps
there aren't that many there are about
you know half a dozen apps microsoft
says there will be some high quality
games
Twitter application a facebook
application there won't be an SDK for
the zune HD in the near future meaning
developers can't develop their own
applications put them on the zune HD
they're going to be in-house
applications for the time being which is
unfortunate it's never going to have all
of the apps that the ipod touch does at
least for the near term so let's go back
to the home screen so we go back to
market place we can download music right
from here because I have the zune pass I
can download any album right now and
listen to it within a few minutes so
right now here's new releases from a
very a variety of artists I'm going to
go to top songs of let's say top songs
of rock let's see what we have here
right now we're connected over Wi-Fi
Kings of Leon Use Somebody okay so I'm
going to tap on that I'm going to press
add to cart yes and because i have zoom
past it's technically free i'm going to
go back at some more things to the cart
let's go with this so i know not the
song let's go to top albums let's go to
pop black eye peas that's a very good
album i'm going to add it add to cart
and now download all and you can see
where it says downloading downloading
and it'll take about you know 15 minutes
probably to download a full album maybe
less depending on how fast your Wi-Fi
connection is but you can see how fast
this is going we're at forty percent
already on this song and when we're done
the song will be thrown right into our
music library now fortunately the
marketplace won't let you download video
which is a shame you can only do
applications and music and if we go into
apps we can see the apps that I've
downloaded so far only 3 the calculator
is a very basic calculator let's look at
the chess game and what's really
annoying about some of these apps is
that you get an advertisement while
you're waiting sometimes it's actually a
commercial a 15 second commercial I
guess this is kind of
out Microsoft is so now it's loading the
apps are kind of slow I think they'll
probably increase in speed with ROM
upgrades so I'm gonna do single player
I'm going to resume I was playing a game
of chess earlier not doing so well and
you get the point the graphics are okay
it's a very simple game it works well
but it's not the fastest let's go back
to the home screen and you can see this
is taking some time sometimes the zune
HD gets a little laggy most of the time
it's extremely fluid so we're going to
skip social and Internet come back to
that later and let's take a look at
settings so there's not that many
settings here we can go into Wireless
turn on wireless see what networks are
around I mean change the brightness of
the display the time out the screensaver
that you saw if it comes on which
probably uses some battery we can make
adjustments to the radio depending on
where you live if we go into music we
can actually turn on the equalizer
what's annoying about this is that you
don't get a drop-down list so if I'm
flipping through and I want to get to
the last one which is none I have to
keep tapping this oh and see I just
missed it so you can see why that's a
little bit annoying you can't customize
an equalizer clock you can change the
time screen lock which is the thing you
saw earlier you can enable a pin if you
don't want someone picking up your zune
and seeing the things you have on it
internet settings are very minimal we're
going to talk more about internet later
change the language to french spanish or
english and if we go to about you can
kind of see how much space you're
currently using on your device and how
many pictures how many videos you have
that sort of thing so overall I'm super
impressed with the interface on the zune
HD I think Microsoft and vidya whoever
was involved with this did a really good
job at making things super smooth super
intuitive very well optimized for this
small device with with us very sensitive
screen and easy navigation very smooth
transitions it's a lot of fun to use
which is really important we'll be back
more covering the internet expiry
rants on the zune HD we'll also talk
about social and do some comparisons
with the ipod touch be sure to follow us
