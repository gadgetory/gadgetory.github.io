to another edition of good to go I'm
Noah Kravitz from technobuffalo calm and
I'm James kinnard from ZDNet mobile news
James what's going on happy june happy
official summer even though at least up
here it's been cold and rainy since I
it's like a hundred degrees here so
there you go you got the summer we've
got you seen Gulf Coast I mean this is
it it's already here ya know well I
guess we've got the typical Bay Area
summer which is I you know cold and
overcast instead of a yeah more
importantly yesterday was the first day
of prayer Casey's lidge's what we we
watch quite careful yeah yeah no kidding
and tornadoes in New York tornado
warning in new york city site of crazy
it's crazy i don't know what's going on
its 2012's coming well i guess i guess
that's why we're not meteorologist were
mobile phone guys so mobile device guys
so we're going to talk about what we
know a lot going on this week pretty
view of Windows 8 shown off yesterday at
the All Things D or the d9 conference
and then Apple doing what they never do
and pre announcing what they're going to
talk about at the WWDC keynote here in
san francisco on monday so why don't we
start with what actually happened
already windows 8 they they showed off
the president windows mobile is on stage
with the kids from The Wall Street
Journal and showed off a preview of
windows 8 it's going to run on tablets
it's going to run on you know big
desktop monitors it'll run on arm
system-on-a-chip builds I app apps yeah
what's your what's your take what you
see what you think well yeah they must
be feeling a lot of pressure because
they actually did the same presentation
at computex of Taiwan mm-hmm I mean the
the dog and pony show they gave a brief
you know demo of what the interface is
going to look like which is kind of like
Windows Phone
own turned on it slide and she go for a
bigger screen yeah and I just find a
pretty interesting that their contention
that they're going to have the same
version of Windows a running on all
laptops tablets and desktops and well I
just think that's biting off a lot more
than they can chew and there those are
totally different device types I don't I
it sounds like a hot mess to me I don't
know I'm not I wasn't at the conference
I was watching some some of the live
blog coverage while I was trying to get
some other stuff wrapped up so you know
I read about it more later and you know
I have not been a day to day Windows
user for quite a while when I was it was
short-lived so maybe not the best person
to talk about it but I mean what you
just said trying to do one you know one
operating system one platform for all
those different sizes of devices and use
cases and the whole like it's all touch
screen base but then it remaps stuff to
the keyboard and the mouse or trackpad
and I don't know just what I saw kind of
look like the Windows Phone Metro UI
sort of as a skin and then you get
underneath it and I guess they're going
to have certain apps built for the
portable devices but the rest of the
absolutely regular windows apps and then
you're trying to navigate with the
touchscreen it just reminds me of the
old windows mobile where you know you
had a stylus and you were trying to poke
around on little scroll bars on a
portable screen and I don't know it
didn't it didn't sit well with me well i
mean the the interface itself I i have
to admit it looked pretty nice but i
think the problem they're going to run
into is what has always been a problem
for windows touch tablets because I mean
there are windows 7 touch tablets out
there today the problem or the apps I
mean are the developers supposed to
write every app to handle all of these
different types of devices if it's if
it's one version I don't think they're
going to do that that's a lot of work
yep you know may I'm not a developer so
maybe I'm taking a very narrow view of
it but I
can't imagine trying to produce an app
that works well with touch on tablets
but yet works okay on desktops with the
keyboard and a mouse and road I just
itch H it's really hard to tell where
this is going then what's amazing is
they really are feeling pressure because
they're moving fast of all of this I
mean they will Microsoft doesn't move
fast ever yeah and I think that's why
they've stepped forward and said let us
show this off this week because they're
feeling the heat they know they've got
to do something they are you know they
just shut off your the mango update for
one phone 7 and you know that this gets
a little beyond my knowledge of the the
business side of desktop and laptop
hardware but you know rolling our
windows 8 forearm and just what that
opens up you know seems like the whole
Microsoft Intel arm relationship seems
fascinating and like you know perhaps
really the bigger story then the windows
8 UI but I mean it's all obviously
linked together I know there's a there's
a thing online today I guess at computex
in video was showing off one of their
quad-core kal-el reference designs
running Windows 8 which you know sort of
takes the the whole thing about single
core dual core quad core smartphones and
tablets into this new realm where well
not just a tablet it's windows and just
you know what that's going to open up
Pandora's box of I I don't know business
opportunities fragmentation developer
concerns what you name it well I mean
we'll just have to see how this shakes
out it's too early to really make any
determinations but it's just very
confusing and I'll tell you that but one
thing's for sure that I in my opinion
Apple has got these guys scared I mean
yeah they do then the ipad has just
caught the entire mobile industry by
surprise i mean yeah i even here every
day today from from my reader
there's there's a huge contingency of
people that say Oh tablets are fad
they're gonna go away I tell you what I
don't think anybody's really taken into
account how many ipads that Apple has
sold this isn't a fad this is a gigantic
industry well so let's let's talk about
that and let's look ahead to next Monday
and it's funny to say look at because
right now you've got not just the you
know the the d9 conference but
Qualcomm's uplink conference going on
and the heads of HTC and nokia speaking
and currently Texas over there to that
challenge yeah and you know all kinds of
stuff going on but um you know like you
said sort of a looking at how Apple has
you know sort of just I mean shifted the
shifted the power around and and people
started chasing them to try to catch up
with what's going to happen next what is
going to happen next they went ahead and
drop the press release earlier this week
saying you know WWDC we're going to talk
about Steve Jobs will be there I'll be
there with a team will necessarily be
just jobs giving a keynote but they'll
be there they're going to talk about iOS
5 they're going to talk about lion of
course the next build of 0 is 10 and
then I cloud and lots of speculation
everything from you know the itunes in
the cloud service to system level
integration with twitter twitter
announcing this week they're they're
moving in on yfrog and twitpic and
they're going to launch their own photo
hosting service you know all kinds of
quran apple rolls out the iwork suite
for ipad and iphone so now they're you
know kind of formally make it out as an
enterprise move but just you know
another sort of step towards
productivity move productivity move yeah
that's that stuff yeah better word for
it I don't you know from the little I
know and I know we're talking about
mobile and not you know desktop laptop
stuff but it let it all bleed together
so much the little bit that I know about
Mac os10 lion the next version next big
you know update to the Apple operating
system things like
full screen apps and things like sort of
an app launcher where you can see all of
your applications in one sort of grid of
icons view I mean the desktop is
becoming a little tiny bit more like iOS
and so what is this you know how we can
talk about anything but just it when you
were more talk about windows 8 and how
Microsoft feeling the heat and tablets
not being a fad you know Apple seems
committed to it's not just that they've
rolled out hardware and they're trying
to make a move in mobile it's they
really seem to have a vision for what
they think personal computing and
perhaps computing in general is going to
look like in the future I don't know I
mean but you know it open question to
you anything from what do you think
we're going to see next week to you know
is that where we're heading is everybody
sort of now chasing apples vision of
what computing is becoming well I think
that's probably true some what I mean
Apple has made it clear they because
they've showed off pieces of lion before
so it's not like it this brand new they
definitely have tried to take the the
most compelling factors of the ipad
interface and bring it into the desktop
there's no question they there they very
straightforward about that yeah we're
bringing some of this stuff in here
because it fits it works and that's what
they do is they try to bring stuff in
that works I think what we'll see next
week definitely the talk is going to be
centered around lion and I ls5 or iphone
5 iOS 5 I guess is what we should say
hardware and I think it's going to be
very soft we're focused and I and I
think there's a good reason for that
because they're not ready to bring out a
new iphone i don't believe because they
just did to deal with verizon and just
silly i mean it would kill the verizon
customers if they brought out a new
uncle ya know i'm with you i think
September yeah it's going to be later so
and then plus you know we just had a
refresh of the ipad we have had the
iphone 4 it's now been out for about a
year but you know the iphone and the
ipad are now such mature products that i
think they're pretty much stuck from
here on out at very incremental type of
upgrades i mean i really can't see them
Wow let's completely shake things up
they're selling too many of these things
to change them too much and it would be
silly I had this I agree with you and I
think we're at a point in the the
product cycle where we're we're going to
shift back to seeing yeah I think for
the past couple years we've seen big
leaps and bounds in mobile hardware
advances you know the processing power
and the display resolution and the
sophistication and in response time of
the touch screens and the accelerometers
and gyroscopes the front camera is and
all that stuff and I think we're going
to shift back to seeing a little more in
the way of software and services you
know coming more to the fore and and of
course like you said you know that they
have to especially come in like Apple
you know they their bread and butter is
moving hardware and move in sort of you
know premium hardware but you know and
they're already doing that you see
that's that's that's the whole thing and
and their their other thing is about
very you know a holistic approach to the
user interface and usability of the
products and I think that's why there's
kind of stepping back now and moving
like you said to the software side let's
let's really start bringing in all this
stuff together and grow and that is I
think the move they're looking at to
keep them ahead of the competition you
know so they don't have to have new hard
work to do that they can yep keep
innovating in so very so iOS 5 you think
we're going to see big changes uh what
people say under the hood you think
we're gonna see big changes on the
surface
revamp to the way it looks and functions
I i would be surprised I mean I I can't
see them complete I wish except that
money I can't either that's that's not
really their style they they do you know
they don't have to do anything it seems
like they do have to do something about
notifications um I think I can't we've
been saying that for years yeah they're
saying no we don't yeah I mean widgets I
don't think we're gonna see widgets I
don't think that's that's apple style i
think widgets might make sense on the
ipad but they're not going to change one
and not the other it's just it you know
I don't mean this in a positive negative
way I just mean that's our google roles
and Google is now trying to bring it
together with ice cream sandwich tablet
sand and you know phones Apple's already
got it together or they're bringing it
together and I don't think they're going
to you know put widgets on one or not
the other and I cannot see them putting
widgets on on an iphone screen it just
doesn't seem like what they were doing
yeah and the fact that they have
converged the two device types into
basically the one version of iOS
actually limits how much they can change
like I said they they can't make drastic
changes on one most likely that won't
screw up the other row row or diverge it
again and I don't think they want to do
that I think it'll be software under the
hood stuff and we're gonna see a lot of
cloud stuff at they're really going to
start promoting the heck out of that
yeah so so you know and i'm not sure
where we're at with our timer here to
keep this at this month yeah we're we're
pushing it already all right so so real
quick what do you you look up in the sky
you see anything in apple's cloud or is
it is it murky and we just have to know
i think they're going to tie it into
everything from was 10 on the desktop to
the to the ipad through itunes i think
they're gonna they're gonna clarify the
whole ocean h and they're gonna find
ways to monetize it I itunes perhaps you
know deeper Twitter maybe Facebook
integration
and more options for sure I'm not sure
they need that stuff now you know I've
already got it through third-party apps
and there's no I mean there's not really
a good way to monetize Twitter and
Facebook that's what everybody else is
discovered right right there do not got
right they they they haven't really
found a way to do that I mean we all
like to be on each other's facebook
walls and tweetin all the time but we
don't want to pay anybody for the
privilege to do that right whereas you
know if you want to not have to worry
about if you've got a particular song on
your iPhone or not but you know you pay
a few bucks to stick that all in Apple's
uh North Carolina data center and stream
it down your device well that's that's
that's what I was going to suggest is
let's say how can they make money off of
say twitter I mean I hear a lot of
people who are heavy on Twitter saying I
wish I could back up at archive all my
oh my stuff right that's where the cloud
could come in so well well will suck all
your tweets up to to our cloud and and
when we're Apple you know they'll just
be there yep nothing so there you go I'm
not and we'll all end up paying them so
much per gigabyte you know our storage
we'll just have to see how they play it
then yeah and so uh no no new iphone
hardware next week now I can't see it I
don't think so just can't see over there
well whatever it is eh it'll most likely
only be part of the story you know
they'll roll out you know some of this
stuff and iCloud and some of the stuff
you know I always like the beginnings of
it and it or rates like everybody else
does and be I think we'll be back here
next Thursday to talk about you know
whatever it is that goes down between
now and then then there'll be one more
thing there'll be one more thing there's
always one more thing and it'll be
software I or services right right all
right any any final parting shots
anything going on on on your ZDNet blog
over there you want to talk about before
we go
well no just business as usual trying to
cover all this stuff galaxy galaxy tab
10-1 officially announced for the u.s.
today I think you mentioned or maybe us
before we get on the air a date leaked
for the HTC evo view the flower thing
the shift I'm not evil the evo 4g is
getting an official gingerbread update
