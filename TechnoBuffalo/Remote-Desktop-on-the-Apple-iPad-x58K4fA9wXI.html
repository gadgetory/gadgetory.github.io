TechnoBuffalo and in this video I want
to show you quickly how to use a really
cool remote desktop or VNC client to
access any computer whether it's your
home computer and your in the living
room or let's say it's your home
computer and you're at the Starbucks you
want to access a file from home view a
document or just use your computer as if
you were right in front of it at that
very second so let me show you what that
looks like I'm gonna turn on the iPad
here and let's go into landscape okay so
the application is called desktop
konnekt it's a little bit expensive it's
about 13 dollars but if you have a need
for this it's a fantastic application so
when I open it up here and quite simply
I can connect to my computer I'm using
the local IP address you can see it
there the 192 IP address I'm going to
click connect I've already set this up
using a free VNC client on the desktop
called type VNC and here we have my
desktop and right now you can see I can
point the cursor around on the screen I
can press the X button in the upper
right corner and it will go off the
screen in a minute I can pinch to zoom
around and pan so that I can get a
better view this works very very well on
the iPad they actually have the same
application for the iPhone but of course
because of the smaller screen size it's
not as easy to use so I'm gonna click no
and so I can do everything here that I
could do if I were right in front of my
computer so let's say I have a party
going on and I want to you know play a
song on my Zune player so let me see if
I can do this I'm not perfect at
navigating so let's say I want to play
the Gorillaz here and there comes and
you can hear the music start playing
from my desktop computer very cool
another thing you can do is actually
type with it so I'm going to bring up
word here and there it comes
zoom out and I'm going to bring up the
on-screen keyboard and type you know
hello
and you probably see if i zoom in a
little bit I typed hello this is a test
so just a cool way to log into your
computer and be able to use it as if you
were right there again the program is
called desktop konnekt it's a little bit
expensive but you'll probably use it a
lot if you have a need for this kind of
thing that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
