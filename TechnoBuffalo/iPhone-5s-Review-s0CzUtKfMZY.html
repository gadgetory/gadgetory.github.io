TechnoBuffalo here at the full review
for you of this guy the iPhone 5s
Apple's flagship device I put it through
its paces for quite a while and I want
to share my thoughts up to you and help
you decide whether or not it's worth the
upgrade let's get started so as I do
with all my phone reviews I want to give
my disclaimer I used this guy for seven
days since the launch day as my daily
driver and I tested it using AT&amp;amp;T in
Southern California we did a full review
of iOS 7 so I'm not really gonna focus
on how the OS works but more on how it
works with the device and not critique
iOS 7 so much itself let's jump in and
talk right about hardware so
cosmetically this is pretty much an
iPhone 5 it feels exactly the same just
with a different color palette obviously
though there are huge differences that
go well beneath the surface here so
let's talk about the biggest one the
upgrades and that's that own button
right there touch ID the fingerprints
and scanner setup in typical
applications crazy easy just a few taps
on your thing on the home button and
you're pretty much all set I really like
the idea in the implementation Apple put
it front and center of the phone making
it really difficult to not at least try
out there you put it on the back like
another device you might not use it
really I bet everyone who's picking up
an iPhone 5s at least gives it a shot so
to use it you actually do a few ways you
can either push the home button all the
way down or you can just leave your
finger right on top of it either way it
will unlock it it worked pretty well
registering my finger prints on average
about 6 out of 10 times which seems to
be on par with most people's experiences
if yours varies enough to hear it leave
in the comments down below if you're
used to using a password on an older
iPhone you know the four times you get
the entry actually your PIN code won't
bother you but if you just used to
unlock your phone and go you might find
it a really really annoying but you
really should have a pastor on your
phone anyway so let that be a lesson to
you password geophone I like the iTunes
integration but for me touch ID is more
about the future than simply about just
unlocking your phone should Apple ever
decide to open up the API is remembering
passwords would be a thing of the past
imagine just buying things on your phone
not remembering any passwords just
holding your finger out over the home
button and just get everything now to
remember your itunes patch don't
remember your Amazon pass whatever it
might be just all you need is this guy
that's always a debt to your hand
another mission for me on the iPhone 5s
though is even to 11ac apples Airport
Extreme Base Station ships with it and
it's filtered down to the laptop line so
why not on this guy
you're coming way more standing other
devices this is one really big head
scratcher so it's really impossible to
talk about the a7 and m7 with any
authority nothing currently written
takes advantage even remotely of any bit
of power their benchmark show it's at
least as powerful if not more powerful
in the currently in the Snapdragon 800
so suffice it to say it's a written fast
phone I'm sure those more apps come out
take advantage of processing and motion
power the 5s will see a huge difference
but in everyday you said you felt the
same speed wise the iPhone 5 which to me
never felt like a slow phone at all
there's not much you to talk about
screen wines it's still the same 4-inch
screen at the 326 PPI as the iPhone 5
that came before it
I usually gloss over camera my reviews
cuz for me it's the camera phone as good
as they looked on my screen and Facebook
is really mostly all I care about I'm
usually pretty happy with just that but
I've had a request to focus more on it
so I'm a man of the people so let's rock
the new duel two colored LED flash is
actually pretty awesome shots in
low-light at the flash I look way less
washed out like night and day
pun intended full images in the written
review if you want to take a look at it
which a link will be down below you can
see it all those looks like flash on
flash off wax on wax off on a side note
I don't really like the camera UI all
that when freezing which is very
unintuitive for me but personal
preference there on the server so you
might say the camera is the same as the
iPhone 5 it seemed to be a theme here
they both have the same day megapixel
shooter but that's really not the full
story at all
larger pixels on the 5s do create more
vibrant images showing brighter colours
and darker blacks but it's still the
camera phone so don't leave your DSLR at
home but it's good enough to show Mom
and Dad you're picturing a brand new
baby for example let's jump into battery
life battery life from the iPhone 5 was
it's always okay good enough to get me
through a whole day but just never
class-leading
it's largely the same on the iPhone 5s
but about 510 percent worse so keep that
in mind so my general usually I'll take
the phone off the charger around 7 a.m.
usually I make two to three hours phone
calls I was connected to Wi-Fi pulling
down to email addresses about an hour so
of video watching thrown in there
texting
social media and some games started in
there and usually you know I get
sometimes around 30% at the end of the
day which again is about 5 to 10 percent
less than the iPhone 5s now I've been
using this guy pretty heavily taking
tons of baby pictures so I can say it
with authority next let's talk about
software and I promise I was like gonna
review iOS 7 but you got to talk about
the OS on the phone it's different now I
give the Apple credit people want two
different DUI and iOS 7 has been super
polarizing obviously to say the least
but iPhone the camp that just likes
change even if it's just for changes
sake so for me it's kind of welcome
there are a bunch of design cues
throughout this whole thing the frosted
glass for example is a nice touch there
are parts like the calendar that put
design way before function it's usually
the other way around so kind of
interesting to see Apple take that
approach are some good things those
series way better and almost some park
the kick-ass Google search and also she
can be a dude down so what's a
conclusion on the iPhone 5s this is
clearly the best iPhone ever made it's
been the case with every flagship
iPhones in 2007 it brings some new and
welcome design things to the table in
the form of touch ID processing power
horse power colors and camera Apple
seems to really focus on refining their
software features not adding a whole
bunch of new ones like Samsung to other
iterations of the galaxy for me that
really depends on what you like and need
so there's very little reason to upgrade
from the iPhone 5 the time apps come
along they take advantage of the a7 m7
combo the iPhone 6 the probably on the
horizon anyway I really upgrade if you
have to have the latest tech toy
available or need that better camera
flash combo or just really big golden if
you have an iPhone 4s earlier jump on in
you'll get all the great features the
iPhone 5 plus some new things for it the
5s your best bet though is probably to
wait for a redesigned iPhone 6 I know it
seems weird to say wait for an
unannounced device still a year or more
away but I don't see anything must-have
on the 5s it really can't get on my
combo the iPhone 5 and iOS 7 so the
final verdict on the iPhone 5s it's a
very solid 8.5 it's a great phone and a
very good evolution of the iPhone line I
think your guys's thoughts leaving the
comments down below do you love the
iPhone 5s is it met your expectations it
exceeded them with gold unicorn rainbows

where you just have no interest in it at
all and you want to wait I want to hear
