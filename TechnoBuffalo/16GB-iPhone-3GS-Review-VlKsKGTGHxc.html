got a review for you of the iPhone 3GS
I'm gonna try and make this review more
of the 3GS and not an overview of 3.0
like I've done in the past so without
further ado let's go ahead and get
started
I always start all my phone reviews with
its phone and it's gotta make phone
calls and I will say it call quality on
the 3GS does seem to be sniffing Utley
better than call calling on the 3G on
the 3GS have regularly having dropped
calls people on the other end could
definitely know I was on the cell phone
with your white noise and some sort of
sputtering I'm not so with the 3GS I
made something to deal with the new
radio that's used or just even the
upgraded hardware in specs but call
quality is fantastic I'm also a heavy
speakerphone user and the speakerphone
on the 3GS is extremely loud
in fact where when I was on the 3G I
turned up all the way to hear adequately
now I have to turn it up about half the
way full volume really is just too loud
so I will probably quite quietly up
updated the speaker on the 3GS so some
of the things that I enjoy about the 3GS
at the end I'll give you my impressions
but whether or not I think it's
worthwhile upgrading if you have a 3G so
voice command and a lot of these
features that I'm going to discuss our
features that I know have been around on
other phones and I know that this
discussing them always causes quite
heated debate in the comments buttons
and our new features on the iPhone
aliefs this certainly married some sort
of discussion so voice command voice
command and voice control is really a
fantastic implementation on the iPhone
and on doesn't let you do voice styling
which certainly been around for a while
but you have full control over your iPod
and other phone functions which are
quite nice they're a lot of times and I
just want to say call Rebecca and it'll
just go ahead and call her so I have to
take the phone out while I'm driving
unlock it slide to unlock hit top of the
phone button go to favorites and then
hit her name now they can just take too
long to do and quit unsafe while driving
so I'm very happy right now there's
voice control and the fact that you can
access it while the phone is locked it
makes it that much easy
so there's no longer need to unlock the
phone so I really am a big fan of the
voice control the compass feature I've
got no need for and I don't think Apple
anticipated delay consumer needing to
use the compass but I think we're the
interesting thing with that comes into
play is how developers we're going to
use it so if you're playing a game and
you're moving around and it'll know how
you're moving and where you are I think
it will start to see the benefits of the
compass down the road
I don't even start to see it exclusively
I think in the App Store I'm not that
much of a need to know what my latitude
longitude is you know maybe you guys do
or if you're going hiking it's certainly
nice to know but nothing that I really
require expect in a phone one of the
things that I really love about the 3GS
one things really pushed me over the
edge to upgrade was video as you guys
know I make a lot of videos sometimes
it's a pain to have to carry my big
camera with mirror tripod now with this
I can't record and upload videos
directly to YouTube like I did yesterday
with the Roomba demonstration and the
quality as you guys saw is actually
really strong for a mobile phone at 30
frames per second I think it really
rifles a quality of a standard flip mino
the audio fidelity also is absolutely
fantastic it's clear it's crisp and it's
been overall very impressive the editing
sort of software that's on here isn't
really editing software it's mostly just
ability to crop you can't piece two
Clips together at least right now it's
just ability to cut clips but that being
said I really like having an extra
camera you know if I'm out and I want to
see something that I want to record to
share with you guys I know that that
ability to do that with the iPhone 3GS
that I didn't have with the iPhone so
that alone for me was worth it the 3GS
also has updated hardware and
specifications let's talk about those
and how they affect the real-world usage
I did head tech comparison the iPhone 3G
and 3GS and you can see some of those
speed increases play when you're opening
applications and such I will say that I
do notice a significant speed increase
over the three G's in everyday use that
wouldn't be enough of a reason for me to
upgrade
I think the 3G was playing fast enough
the extra speed is quite nice one of the
things that I really was looking forward
to the 3GS was the
supposedly increased battery life they
were saying realistically he was getting
anywhere from one and a half to even two
times as good a battery life and I got
to say I have not seen that yet had the
phone a week and I've done really decent
amount of battery conditioning and
battery usage to try and drain it pull
it back out the drain it pull it back up
to really get it to full strength and
battery wise I see zero improvement over
what the 3G was that main chain is only
had the phone a week and if it does I'll
update this video
you know maybe two three weeks down the
road I'll actually see the benefit of
the supposedly increase battery but
right now I'm just not seeing it so some
3.0 features that I should mention cut
copy and paste is very nice but now you
get those on the 3G you know nothing the
revolutionary there the Universal Search
is nice I've never used it outside of
just playing it and see how it worked
and at some day hopefully the ability to
MMS and tether at least legitimately
will be a quite nice addition as well so
overall the 3GS for me has certainly
been a very worthwhile upgrade if only
for the video capabilities
it's the fidelity of this fantastic
audio and video and it really is a nice
alternative to carrying around a camera
so for me personally it was a no-brainer
to upgrade her for you guys if you're
not into the video you're not making a
lot of video if you don't have a need
for an increased still and video camera
and you have a 3G you may not want to
upgrade no one can tell a difference
when you're talking on your phone this
looks exactly the same has a 3G there's
really no way to tell the difference
other than you know some shiny lettering
on the bottom you know one can no one
can tell him it really doesn't matter
that much the increased speed inspects
well nice and though help webpages load
a little bit quicker there's nothing
that drastic but if video is your thing
then I think the 3G X is a great way to
go also the increased processor and RAM
if you play a lot of games on your 3GS
you only know that a significant gain
both graphically and speed was so if
you're a big gamer on your iPhone I
think you might be a big gamer on your
iPhone the 3GS you may also want to
consider are they's gonna come down to a
personal decision about whether or not
you're eligible for the upgrade and if
you are is it worth the money or if
you're not eligible is it still worth
the money to kind of force your upgrade
it's gonna be a personal decision but
for me it was definitely an easy one to
make
I am thrilled with the 3GS I think it's
probably one of the best phones out
there I do wish after using the Palm Pre
for a while there are some way to
multitask on the iPhone 3G s 3G or
original iPhone I just think something
like that would be coming I think the
3GS
on its own is a great phone but again it
may be a victim of Apple success and
really the rumor mill you know there
were rumors that Apple was gonna have
front facing camera and a new design and
I think that when you didn't see those
people were disappointed that took away
from what Apple didn't do and they did
update the specs and they did offer an
amazing phone at the same price point
about the iPhone 3G that introduced it
so you aren't getting really improved
function but you're not getting an
improved design and I think that that's
also where some of this deployment came
in you know it looks exactly the same
and that may be nice if you have cases
or what other sort of accessories you
may have for the iPhone but you know
what are you gonna do I would expect the
next generation iPhone to have some sort
of radical redesign hopefully with that
front facing camera that most people
have talked about but of course Apple's
development cycle doesn't coincide the
rumor mill so you can't really hold them
accountable for it so overall if I have
to rate the iPhone 3GS on scale from one
to five I give it a really really really
solid 4 and 3/4 it's a great phone one
of the best I've ever used and it's why
I use it every single day and you know I
test a lot of phones are here and there
are many that I like to keep and used
for myself with the iPhone 3GS and the
3G before it one of the few that I
really hold on to and use on a daily
basis but I got white with the 3GS and
kind of dig the white back and for those
you that are asking it doesn't show
fingerprints it's not cracking it looks
just as good as the black just in white
so anyway I hope you enjoyed for
occlusive
we should have follow me on Twitter
twitter.com slash John four Lakers and
if you want to see the iphone 3gs twigs
and head tag comparisons with the Palm
Pre the blackberry storm and the
original iPhone 3G go back and check out
some previous videos that did really
some thorough comparisons of each phone
hope you enjoyed and I'll see you reckon
you guys will see me in the next video
