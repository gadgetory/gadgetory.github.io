TechnoBuffalo show I'm I'm your two
hosts for today Sean ani editor-in-chief
of the site and i'm joined by deputy
managing editor todd Hazelton hey
everybody he's back the UH so let's see
you we won't go into how your travels
went yes they were long to say the least
yes with an added extra day that we
won't discuss ah but for those that may
not have known Todd was off at Mobile
World Congress in Barcelona hmm and you
know now whole lots been going on the
past couple weeks Todd I don't know what
we're going to talk about this week I
know it's crazy there's so much yeah
because as soon as you got back from
that we have the apple event right but
let's go in chronological order let's
jump back to mobile world congress and
of course we had the announcement of the
galaxy s6 in the galaxy s6 edge which
both were well known before they came
out and we also had the announcer the
HTC One m9 also well known before it
came out right that uh oh now excuse me
I should i call it galaxy s space 6 yeah
it's not a why they do this time just so
just so everyone knows samsung sent out
a email to the press shortly before they
have been telling us that while in the
rest of the world it was going to be
gout written as galaxy s6 in the u.s.
they had planned to write it as galaxy s
space 6 rotten that's nice yeah and then
when I usually miss galaxy s space 6
space lowercase edge yeah come on
whatever so you've had some brief
hands-on time with each of these phones
yep was there anything that you walked
away from being really impressed with
any of them mom I think for me the
biggest thing was that Samsung really
really and they said that look we made
some mistakes along the way and we
listened to our consumers and they did
the
six in the s6 edge have the aluminum
bodies they have gorgeous displays they
shine in the light unlike anything else
I've seen that I mean they look like
very premium handsets 0 for anybody
that's complained in the past about
Samsung and plastic phones I mean that's
alleviated now these are great looking
devices the only complaint i had and i
told samsung samsung this face to face
is the backs of both of them gets super
fingerprinting like within seconds of
playing with them you know wash our
hands and everything we had to wipe it
down again for each photo so like we
were constantly wiping down the phones
for the for the camera at the show
that's my biggest complaint otherwise
beautiful devices and the one m9 to is
fantastic I think HTC did the right
thing I know a lot of people are saying
hey you know like this doesn't seem like
a big upgrade but what they did was they
designed the phone to sort of mix in
elements of the one m7 that was very
popular the first one that they did and
then the One m8 which was last year's
model it was a little more round a
little more slippery and so now you have
this really beautiful device a little
more sharper on the edges like the one
m7 was and I'm really excited for that
early impressions on that phone the
camera could use a little bit of some
tweaks it's a 20 megapixel camera HTC is
still updating the software daily and I
saw the reports that were comparing
shots on it with other phones um issues
he's well aware that they want this to
be one of the best cameras they've ever
put on a phone so they're trying to
tweak that software before launch so I'm
excited to see how that 20 megapixel
camera performs since seven looks great
i love the customization they did it's
very easy you know i know a lot of
android fans can go out there and say
like oh you know it's easy to apply you
know of an icon pack and stuff like that
but this makes it easy for you know
everyday consumers you just open up the
theming application you can apply all
kinds of cool themes um so i really
liked that and then i'm also i think the
galaxy s6 and s6 edge though stood out
to me because they support wireless
charging out of the box and both
standards so you can do chi or i guess
the other one power matter is alliance
and that's a big deal because starbucks
is
rolling out their chargers and stations
around the country samsung said they're
going to work with other partners I even
talked to them about you know Samsung if
you go into any airport you see a lot of
their charging stations around the
airport like what if you and those right
now require a plug-in what if you made
those wireless charging stance that
seems like probable in the future so
speaking of wireless charging it not not
to get off topic while you're at mwc you
may have missed the story about ikea is
going to be building wireless charging
into its furniture right yeah so that's
really cool too i think i think
hopefully over the next couple years
we'll see that in a lot more places and
they said I charges faster I'm not sure
what they did on the on the engineering
side but it's faster than before because
I know you know especially as you get
used to quick charge and turbocharging
all kinds of these different
technologies they can charge your phone
up like fifty percent in 10 minutes or
something you kind of you're like an
well I'd rather not use wireless
charging because it's kind of slow but
they said it's faster now so you know a
lot of exciting things to try with these
funds launched and again the mobile
payment Samsung pay will launch this
summer so not the same time that the
phones come out but it supports magnetic
terminals too so you can pay at the
terminals and that's sort of the
technology they purchased Samsung their
press conferences that developed it but
they purchased it with their acquisition
of lupe earlier this year so there are
lots of exciting stuff on horizon well
Sasha Mahal has a a question related to
the say Todd HTC one m9 or samsung
galaxy s6 and if you choose s6 than s6
or s6 edge and why um well I think I
would go with the s6 edge just because
it's sort of the high-end most premium
phone out of out of that launch I'd say
well I don't want to say that I think
the One m9 is a fantastic device I
really liked since seven I'm not gonna I
don't want to knock that for any reason
especially until I play with all of
these for a while but the s6 edge stood
out to me most because I'm really
excited to see Samsung pay I'm really
excited to use the wireless charging and
in my hands I was just like wow this is
a really really nice looking phone so
that's what I'm most excited for I think
but you should have the One m9 hopefully
you know I think they're they're all
launch sometime in April so hopefully we
have them in our hands and then I'll be
able to make a final judgment but yeah
I'm anxious to see all these I I'm
really anxious to try the edge I it's
not a phone I ever foresee myself
carrying but I i just i want at least
try it and see how it feels in the hand
and everything else now since you've
held them you can answer the the magical
question for me with the note edge i
found myself wanting to put my finger
tips below yeah great how is it with the
s6 edge it's a little better on the s6
edge because the edges in has steep it's
sort of just like a soft decline on the
sides it's worth elope yeah but it's
still kind of in the way I want to say
it's not you know you kind of like my
fingers going to touch it so we'll see
you know again over long-term use but
I'm still pretty attracted to it and I
want to see what else Samsung in the
developing developer partners add to it
right now it's sort of just you swipe in
from the edge and you can see you like
your favorite contacts or it can khlo
when you put it face down so you know
who's calling you and then it has some
of the edge panels that we saw on the
the note edge as well but those panels
and the developers who have already
written apps for the note edge they're
not supported by this because they're
totally different gotcha yeah we're
getting a couple questions about this
which is something else that we all know
you got to try at Barcelona which was
the HTC vive yeah so we've got a couple
questions here but related to the vibe
will hit real quick from Dan legis what
do you think about the HTC vive just in
general what was your overall feeling I
was really blown away by it at first we
were briefed on it um ahead of the show
by HTC but we weren't allowed to see it
so we had only seen a picture and we
were all kind of like and like there's
there a reason you're not showing it to
us and then we finally we had private
meetings at the show or we got to put it
on and its really mind-blowing it
reminds me a lot of the oculus it's way
more advanced in the gear VR which is
fine because the gear VR is powered by a
smartphone this requires a very heavy
you know machinery
gaming PC and then there's a lot of
wires right now and the controllers are
still wired to they're planning on
making a wireless but once you're in
that world it's it's really incredible
you sort of feel like you're leaving
this universe and you're in another one
and it's hard to understand I guess
until you like put it on you really you
feel like you're somewhere else the
graphics to me weren't as sharp as what
we've seen with oculus but I think the
implementation is really amazing they
have these lasers that they put on the
wall on the walls so when you're in this
world you can see where your boundaries
are as you approach a wall they're sort
of like checkerboard that magically
appears and you can just walk around and
using the controller's interact with
things so I was in a kitchen and making
a recipe and then hitting like throwing
eggs against law which is really funny
and then I was in a like a valve
obviously created this like a portal
world where I was supposed to fix a
robot and they're making fun of me for
being a dumb human and all this kind of
stuff but you're just immersed in this
world and in another spot I was on this
sunken ship and this huge whale comes
like swimming by me it's like right in
front of you so you can touch it almost
and so it's really incredible an oculus
has this kind of stuff too and what I
saw with the latest prototype from
oculus at CES was you know the graphics
were a little bit sharper and stuff like
that but man I think valve and HTC are
going to be great partners especially
for gamers it looks like that's the kind
of content we're going to get out of
this but we also we know there's movie
content Lionsgate studios and stuff like
that are on board so really mind-blowing
stuff I can't wait for it I guess
consumer launch is scheduled for this
year is what they're promising so it's
medical that's impressive and for the
record I asked as she see the prices and
they honestly their executive who's in
charge of these other he runs the Recon
of stuff so he does he did the re camera
he did the grip Fitness band and stuff
like that Iran's all these connected
products for HTC he said I we honestly
have no idea what's gonna cost her so
well we have a follow-up question from
Sasha Mahal hey Todd since you tried out
the HTC vive how does it compare to the
oculus rift and other VR headsets did
you get any motion sickness um I didn't
get motion sickness but then again I
don't get motion
sickness I haven't from any of these
other ones i will say there is this
detachment from reality feeling that
almost causes sort of a stir of panic
really like you're in another world so
your brains trying to comprehend that
and that's what's kind of weird it's not
motion sickness but it's just like when
you when you're standing on top of a
building and you're afraid of heights in
a city in this fake world and your body
is scared that's a weird feeling because
you know that you're just standing in
this conference room but your brain
thinks something else and so that's
what's wild about all these things and
even you know even gear VR powered by
the the note 4 does that kind of stuff
to me when I'm flying around 360 degree
views around you know New York City is
one of the demos um it's wild and these
are just so compared to the gear VR
which is again powered by just a
smartphone these are powered by super
put the Theophilus and the HTC vive are
powered by super you know beefy
computers so the difference is huge and
again I think HTC vive oculus rift on a
par with one another just oculus seems
to have slightly sharper graphics but
then the vibe allowed me to interact
with the world more than I've ever had a
chance to with oculus and I know oculus
is plenty controllers and stuff too I've
just never had a chance to use them
awesome so immersive I mean they're both
just mind-blowing right right well we
have a one more question i think though
the tech to take on this since you
already wrote up like what we gave
awards to and everything else is sasha
baja last hey Todd what was your
favorite parts about MW 20s mwc 2015
what why we discuss a little bit like
what goes on in and around I mean was
their press conference you especially
enjoyed a meal you especially enjoy the
meals um I don't often get to go around
barcelona but the sick we had a saturday
where our camera guy was flying in where
it was kind of a little bit off time we
had to do some writing but and I got to
go walk around see the barcelona
cathedral and then when Ron came in
that's our camera guy from TechnoBuffalo
we had a meal right next to it and had
shared some tapas and stuff I think that
was my fee
part I was showing him some of the city
some of the Gothic quarter which is
gorgeous if you've ever been a bar
Cellino and then I think that was fun
just showing somebody else to see that
I've been to before usually alone but
but also um it's just it's hectic and
it's crazy how fast you know seven or
eight days we were there it goes by we
were nas in meetings leading up to the
show in meetings through most of the
show and then you know we're filming and
writing late into the night because
thankfully we're still on eastern and
pacific time zones are not much time to
adjust so we're you know we're up late
into the night getting everything done
for everybody that is it's a good time
yeah it always amazes me how fast CES
flies by yeah it's just like didn't we
just get here right it always seems like
oh okay and that's time to go home
already and I thing is at technobuffalo
we actually do Airbnb for an apartment
there where we have a sore on and I
shared an apartment and that sort of
allows us to immerse better in the
culture you know are not just going to a
hotel every night but we're in a
neighborhood and walking around there
and go to restaurants and stuff around
there so that's always very fun yeah and
so much cheaper than the hotels yes and
the dollar to the euro right now is
fantastic so yeah yay thankful for that
well let's move on from mwc because we
still have the other giant elephant in
the room and that was monday's apple of
them that's right so we already knew
about the Apple watch we got a few more
details like the pricing and we also saw
the introduction of the new macbook
right so I'm not even sure where to
start let's start with the the Apple
watch sure the the price for me at least
was a disappointment yeah I know I think
going into him you know I knew it was
going to be expensive we saw it was
going to be 340 on the way Apple told us
that but then you know I guess the model
I wanted was like one of the ones with
the steel band it's the Apple watch the
actual model I want
is a thousand dollars and I had no idea
was gonna get thousand bucks you know I
thought maybe 556 the house but you got
away too much for me John's desired
models 1200 oh yeah so there you go and
and you know paying 350 or 400 bucks for
a watch with it with a rubber band is is
also kind of hard to swallow and I get
it there's a lot of technology in there
but when you're looking yeah but when
you're looking at the price of competing
products you can get a really nice moto
360 for 300 bucks with a metal band or
even other watches it's just like jeez
it's a hard you know pill to swallow and
you look at you know iPads that can cost
that much short or this is you know
there are models of this that cost more
than macbooks so that's a crazy but I
get it you know it's it's a watch
industry and it's sort of luxury and
it's not for everybody but uh I was
hoping I'd be able to enter for a little
bit cheaper now I'm kind of put off
because honestly I i think the Apple
watch looks fantastic looks really
exciting i love the idea you can you
know maybe one day I can open my hotel
room with NFC built into it which they
demoed Apple pay seems cool all kinds of
neat stuff like that target yesterday
said their apple lets you you know make
a shopping list and as you're walking
around tell you which aisle is the next
items on that kind of stuff is awesome
yeah I just you know $350 is a lot of
money at the end of the day for about
anything about the fact that that's for
the thirty eight millimeter which in
Apple's defense they never said thirty
eight millimeter was the ladies and 42
me actually to you in the sizing guide
they do oh yeah ace in the sizing guys
it says like look fits most women's
wrists and then that one size fits most
mens wrist so like all right weather so
as men are minimum unless we want a tiny
watch on her wrist is going to be four
hundred bucks right exactly you know and
I I backed the the pebble time on
Kickstarter you know I I was got in
early enough that I got in on the early
bird special so I think it was 149 you
know I'm gonna have a color screen I'm
going to have seven days of battery life
yeah you know I i I'm sorry I just I
can't see
paying that price for the Apple watch I
just can't I know but you know and I
wrote the editorial saying that you know
it's just kind of it seems crazy to me
and I have a nice watch my wife got me
in my wedding and I think that you know
for a lot of people i was talking to
other journalists to you have the
sentimental value of these items you
know maybe it's a Rolex passed down from
your grandfather your
great-great-grandfather you know all the
way down through your family and that's
sort of the watch that matters to you
and so that the Apple watch has to
replace those things and yet it's very
expensive but I think we'll see you know
maybe it does some really cool stuff
that that I just find irresistible when
it launches but I don't know and again a
battery life kind of concerns me too
because I know with every wearable that
I've owned so far these the batteries
died and I never plug it in and I'm like
oh great now I can't even use it now i'm
too lazy to you know deal with putting
it on the charger waiting three hours
before i can put it back on my wrist i'm
already out the door so that's one of my
issues too but yeah no i agree and dan
legis asks about the Apple watch hey
guys do you think the Apple watch is a
better UI than Android wear I don't
sleep with it but yeah John seemed to
you know suggest that it does take some
learning um I like Android wear but i
I've always complained i think the UI
kit is a mess and so anything at this
point seems like it could be a better UI
than android and that's just because
there's just too much digging around i
mean it reminds me of the problem with
windows mobile not windows phone but
windows mobile we ready to dig around
the operating system all the time to
find you want it and I feel like this
this should be a little better you know
and i think android android wear will
improve I mean it already has
drastically but right I guess the next
update rumor has it will include
Chester's and stuff so it doesn't seem
all that far away well also on Monday we
got introduced to the new macbook which
of course you know you can say oh well
it's the bringing back of the old
macbook although there's very little
relation beyond the name yeah so it Iver
I ran up a couple of articles about it i
just want to share my thoughts real
quickly I think my biggest problem with
all the laptop situation on money it's
fine they wanted
reduce USBC great but when they updated
the air and the pro why didn't they
include one USBC slot on those yeah I'm
with you yeah that makes no sense to me
I mean that's how you introduce I was
speaking with Joey the other day and he
had a good point about you know when we
were in the transition between tapes you
know cassette tapes and CDs cars came
with both right exactly right and then a
few years down the road yeah we went to
CD only and now you're even seeing cars
without CD players and just having exile
auxiliary plug ins and satellite radio
but you know if they really wanted to
push this they should have included it
on the air in the pro and they should
have done a fine yes I understand you
want to do it yo as thin as possible on
the new macbook but making it the only
way to do it I don't think it's the
right decision yeah it's crazy I think I
have more problem with that on the
macbook than anything else I add I think
the macbook is overpriced personally but
the USBC port alone is enough to make me
go I'm not really interested because I
you know you like you said in your
article you know they were talking oh
it's wireless and you know who needs
wires and all that by the way here's a
79 dongle yeah it's only $79 but that's
not gonna be truly mobile if I have to
carry around dongles with me that's not
making me wireless that's not making me
portable you know speaking tangled
exactly exactly i I just I don't know
and we have several questions here about
the macbook it is there anything you
want to add that you didn't include in
your articles oh no it's it's all my
articles I just think you know 1,300
bucks is is a lot and I think for core m
it's even more because you could get a
macbook air that's more powerful that
still has the USB ports you know doesn't
have type C but they did upgrade it and
and that's pretty desirable or you can
go with the macbook pro which has the
new trackpad to and
that's what I mean honestly now I have
my eye on the macbook pro I haven't seen
the macbook in person and apparently
it's pretty stunning but for me I'm
really worried about you that the USB
type-c is the only option and it's the
power cord which worries me a bit more
I'm not sure it has enough power for me
and then yeah I guess that's those are
the big issues I've had with it yeah uh
from Sasha Mahal is the new macbook
necessary should have just replaced the
macbook air I don't think so because I
think that's sort of this is apple's way
it happened with you know DVD players
right they started removing the DVD
players from the macbooks when they went
to the air and everybody was like like
we still need those and then up now of
course we don't and I think apples write
and sing like yes this is a future and i
agree but and then that's probably why
it's still selling the macbook air to
like here if you need the USB ports by
this thing you know I hope it's good too
yeah I just I'm still not sure about
this um from brazen and Franco who
actually I think his question was split
into two here so could the new macbook
really sway away someone from buying the
air I don't see the point on the new
macbook the older ones was all about the
cheapest to enter the ecosystem but this
new one weird move for Apple I'm sorry
it split it into two questions I'm
trying to find the other half weird
moved for Apple to release the macbook
at such a steep price I he's got very
good point the original macbook was the
cheapest way to enter the mac ecosystem
yeah the white plastic and I need to pay
the tax for the black model look out
exact yeah exactly you know so you know
if you're going to use that name I I
think maybe they they should come up
with a different name yeah maybe like a
macbook premium or something but you
know it's maybe it's assignment to come
that there's going to be macbooks that
are slightly you know more expensive and
they drop that price I don't know I
don't know what's going on but yeah I
agree the naming suggests that it should
be that entry level and the funny thing
is is that you have the
air then you have the macbook which is
lighter than air this is like what but I
don't know that I mean for me I think
and for most people it's probably the
macbook air is going to be the way to go
when you look for students and you know
it's the cheapest entry especially if
you're looking at the 11 inch model but
you know quorum knee I think I feel like
Apple and Intel have a partnership
probably encore em and they were like
you know make this thin and beautiful
laptop for us that runs Core M so we can
show everybody what brought us all about
stuff so maybe that's what it was a
quick clarification benjamin mcdonald
brings up the new type c is really fast
when it comes to charging is designed to
work with laptops when Todd meant by the
question with power is yes they say it
will last nine hours when you're at an
event at rarely lasts nine hours and you
don't have access to power so it's more
a question of are the batteries really
as good as they say they are yeah that's
what I'm worried about because we saw
the Lenovo yoga 3 pro or pro 3 is based
on it runs on a cool ram processor too
and they were promising really long
battery life and in my usage with that
laptop it doesn't get very far so I just
want to see how the macbook performs and
yes type sees its it's designed for
charging and it's supposed to work
across tablets and phones and everything
is great to have that standard to that
though my point is that when i'm
charging my laptop as i am right now
then I can't have my microphone plugged
into USB right because then I've already
used that port and by our last hearing
unless you test the dongle which the
dongle only has one of each right you
know so it's not like you're going to
plug in a hard drive and a mic right and
then dongles sure they exist but like
I've been telling myself for the three
years I've owned this laptop over by the
ethernet toggle I never axel I don't
know and I don't want to spend 13
hundred dollars just to spend $79 for
two more ports that's just me I I do
have the ethernet dongle from my macbook
pro because I end up in some weird
hotels sometimes better still wired but
uh you just you never know what
situation you're going to end up and
when it comes to internet unfortunately
bright
uh moving through we have a bunch of
questions coming in here so let me just
peruse quickly here's a new product that
we have not touched on yet from Andre
j.g.t pH uh hey guys what do you think
about the new Moto e yeah it seems cool
right they just added added the LTE to
it is super affordable I think it's
great it's great for consumers who you
know in the past if you broke a phone or
something you just had to drop tons of
money to you know 600 bucks to go buy a
new one now these android makers
motorola show me alcatel now with their
idol 3 that was just nacim a little
Congress great phone I mean these are
all come in the United States for you
know sub $200 prices and you can buy
these phones I mean whether you it's
your primary phone sometimes it's good
sometimes it's not great at me if it's
MediaTek processor it's not always
powerful to get from Qualcomm ursa like
that but these are awesome options
whether it's back up or your primary
phone or you need a phone because you
don't want to pay international roaming
costs and you're traveling abroad I
think it's great for everyone and then
for motorola it's just a good business
decision they're trying to get into
especially now with lenovo i'm into new
emerging markets so lenovo is huge in
china but Motorola had a grasp in Latin
America thanks the introduction of the
earlier moto g + x and yi so this is
just expansion on that so nice moves all
around especially for people who need
LTE and stuff like that but while you
were in barcelona amazon ran a one-day
sale on the blue studio 6 yeah there you
go this him yeah I I picked one up it
was a $29 dual sim yeah that I right
there I was like this is the perfect
international phone yeah since i'll be
able to run my t-mobile and my three sim
when I'm in England I'm right why not I
like it so far I haven't used it
extensively the it was all oh and the
funny thing is it came with a case oh
yeah a very basic case but I was like
that's kind of nice that's
the screen had a like a weird feel to it
for like the first 20 minutes using it
and then it like wiped off so i think it
was like some sort of packing fest or
something it now it feels fine so yeah I
know it's interesting uh let's see here
what else have we got let's just change
things up here first and we have a
question from prim Nagoya which gaming
console do you have I I personally have
all three of the current ones I always
like to say it's because of my job but
it's just really I love gaming I have
the playstation 4 in the xbox one I had
the wii u i loved it my wife was like
you're never playing it and i honestly I
don't play these other ones very much
here I tried to you I've been trying a
lot more i played far cry 4 i've been
playing dragon age inquisition now so
i'm forcing myself to spend more time
with these katie consoles but so the way
you were sitting here my wife is like
you're selling now so i did i become
pointless yeah we just get too crowded
with electronics here in the living room
and ya gotta get in here and there ya
know i had lately have been primarily
playing the ps4 but that's just because
I've been a huge destiny cake yeah well
i have i also i'm a pc gamer too i just
need to upgrade a little bit here to
keep going with that it's about time
it's been two years since i upgraded
then i also i used the the shield tablet
with my TV in my bedroom and play games
on that which is actually really really
cool especially given the price against
brini tablet yeah i'm trying to find
there was one question that was a lot of
fun trying to find it here oh there it
is from sasha mahomes going back to
apple firmament what other device would
you like Apple to bring back just like
they brought back the macbook again I'm
still saying this is not really the
return of the macbook but right okay so
Todd you and I joked before the show we
already know what I'm going to say yeah
but what's what's an apple product you'd
like to see them bring back I don't know
that it's something like there's
thing I've seen them you know ditch that
I really want to see again i would say
i'd like to see the appletv revamped and
we've been waiting for that for a long
time they just dropped the price of 69
box which is pretty sweet I don't really
use mine all that often so I kind of
want to see what what their plan is with
home kit there that's their initiative
and their software development kit for
up the smart home I want to see if they
if they decide to make their apple TV
sort of the hub of the home so I guess
it's not bringing it back but it hasn't
been updated in a long time so it is
sort of rain in bed so excitable TV I
don't know why do they haven't updated
that thing yo wonder with her we'd not I
don't know and the price drop almost
made me think that maybe they were going
introduce a higher tier Apple TV oh yeah
I mean we were fingers at the Ray ready
to write that new lives I know we were
like okay say it say it yeah okay
they're moving on to another product mmm
okay as for the product i'd like to see
brought back the ipod classic called it
solid state drives that would be awesome
but yes this is my current app i still
use this almost every day this is my
hundred and sixty gig ipod classic but
everyone makes fun of me for using it
but i don't care hey moving along here
let's see uh interesting question from
Sean the man 34 his Thunderbolt dead on
max um I don't think so i think it's
just telling ya I don't think on the
desktop side but looks like it on the on
the macbook both of ya actors yeah
exactly for everything uh a fun note and
something i did not realize from sasha
boho hey sean it's been a year
technically tomorrow since the
TechnoBuffalo show started yeah all
right yes of course see how it is
planned as a weekly show and it's week
52 or an episode 38 will let you do the
math
haha busy yet yeah we do we do man you
know we we try I'll say that we try but
a lot of things come up uh and good
question here from breeze and Franco
since the president has definitely been
set do you think the note 5 will lose
the removable battery and SD card slot
yeah I think so it seems like it just
the way Samsung was talking about it
with the galaxy s6 and almost like I
mean I know Samsung's fans and me too
I've always been like oh it's great to
have the removable battery it's great to
have the expandable storage the way they
talked about it with the s6 and s6 edge
they were just like like this is how it
is and and there's they would say like
there's plenty of storage you know 32 64
128 gigabyte options so it seems like
that's the way they're going and if they
if they do the aluminum unibody and
stuff like that again it see ya i think
that's that's just how it's gonna be but
i'm not sure yeah i think it's pretty
obvious that's the way Samsung is going
yeah I'd only thing is I mean you look
at it doesn't mean it's impossible
because HTC so with the one m8 and one
m9 have expandable storage so it can be
done it can't be going back to the apple
TV first and Dan legis was asking should
I invest in an apple TV or wait until
the next version is they usually updated
after the prices drop I don't know um
might be waiting for a long time that's
a thing yeah Apple has a very odd
history with the Apple TV and it's
really hard to predict what they're
going to do with that product for so
long they just refer to it as it's a
hobby it's a hobby right when you've
sold 25 million of them it's a little
hard to call it a hobby right you know
it took Roku almost five years to sell 5
million and apple sold by eight or nine
million just last year mm-hmm so it's
hard to sit around go well it's the
hobby we really don't know what they're
playing with the Apple TV that's the
problem I the price drop like Todd and I
were just saying we really thought the
price drop was going to indicate the
second tier
almost coming out a higher tier that
being said I think with the price drop
there's a stronger possibility of a
September refresh along with the iphone
or the ipad in october i get it out
there before the holiday season that's
kind of where i'm leaning right now i
don't i think you're going into the
holiday season that would be a great
time to refresh it great but at that
price and see here's the thing as the
streaming guy i've tried every streaming
device on the market for the millbrook
III bro code three and I w seven bucks
right now right now yeah they're a the
Roku's far more robust that being said
if you're deep into the apple ecosystem
already own you have a ton of movies
with them or television shows or
whatever right the $69 price is hard to
be and I don't know what they're going
to do in the next version this is
possibly the hardest time ever to be
someone on the fence about Apple TV
because I really don't know what's going
to happen yeah but we don't think you'll
be upset with a Roku I use mine all the
time my eyes the 1i have plugged in dude
it you don't know III I've like the
cheapest model i think i like that you
know I walk around constantly with the
banner yo praising the Roku I it's one
of my all-time favorite gadgets i
absolutely love it right from Sean the
man 34 and this is a question I think
that's not a lot of people's minds why
haven't we seen touch ID on macs and
will my mac require a password even if
I'm wearing the Apple watch to the
second part we don't know that's
interests definitely possible to use
bluetooth unlock it like we've seen in
android right as for why touch ID has
not come to max yet I don't know I i
kinda we'd heard some rumors that the
next macbook update would include and we
can't just say macbook anymore the the
next laptop update would include it
but it was a very soft rumor I don't
know and Qualcomm at Mobile World
Congress I didn't have a chance to see
it myself but introduce technology that
scan to your fingerprints through the
glass so it seems possible if you have a
glass trackpad that you could put your
finger in a certain spot and have touch
ID work there too so and we do know that
you know the home button on the iPhones
his class and does similar bills so yeah
exactly I mean for Apple pay why not
really if you're on a website in safari
and you just pay using your thumb print
I mean it's incredible how well that
works it almost dangerous i was buying
concert tickets with my iphone and
ticketmaster you just had to do is just
hold my finger print and they were you
know here comes six tickets oh there
goes three hundred bucks uh Sean the man
I just saw your comment I'd already
picked another question I will get to
that is a very interesting thought from
Benjamin McDonald I don't have a lot of
money but I would like a new tablet i
have a samsung galaxy two in a tab to
and its really slow but what cheap debt
what cheap tablet yeah i could not speak
j what cheap tablet do you recommend not
iPads can't live with iOS oh man i don't
typically recommend cheap tablets
because i think you run into what
happened with you there it ends up
getting pretty slow over time um that's
a good question i would look at older
models of samson so you can get a galaxy
tab s used those are really i mean
they're just gorgeous tablets i try to
buy a more premium tablet used or
refurbished somewhere it's probably your
best bet I'd look at the reason looking
away as I'm looking up a tablet right
now I odds leave i wouldn't i would say
look at anything from his sous yes she's
makes great tablets this makes really
nice tablets and they're fairly
reasonably priced so I I would say just
go to Amazon look up anything from a
sous tablet wise would be my
recommendation yeah don't I wouldn't
skimp on RAM or proxy
sir because I mean just like everything
then actually storage because you don't
want to slow down on you again exactly I
love the Nvidia shield tablet that's not
too bad yeah the nexus 9 is nice oh
there's a lot of options out there for
android users a lot opens what you want
to pay yeah yeah I think basically once
you know your budget then that's the
easier way to go at it uh good point
from Sean the man that I wanted to get
back to HBO now runs out in three month
HBO now now runs on three months three
months and around WWDC hint hint new
apple TV hardware that's a very
interesting thought yeah the excrescence
runs through through toledo EDC in tune
yeah that is a very very good point Sean
the man thank you for bringing that up I
had forgot about the three-month
exclusivity yeah I which that's a very
odd exclusivity window in 90 days hmm
yeah I don't know from Sasha and the
hall how many computers do you guys have
are they mostly Mac in which you use on
a daily basis mostly pc actually um I
have my desktop here at my macbook air
in front of me and then I have a sous
windows 8.1 netbook that are my go-to
computer so two-thirds windows actually
I'm goes and I have Windows 10 burning
on my desktop here it's just been great
so far yeah I I'm running on iMac here
and i have another imac at home which is
an older model and then i have a macbook
pro and just for dubbing around when I
like sitting on the couch I have I
picked up babe refurbished HP Chromebook
which I actually really like yeah I need
a Chromebook in my life yeah I'd really
like the cross hook
but I i'm mostly Mac I I have been p you
know windows in the past i just i
switched as i've mentioned before and
sorry you can call me a traitor if you
want uh i need a new you're terribly
laptop so we'll find because the netbook
i have a point one is great it's just
you know i think i paid it was on sale
at best buy for like 140 bucks remember
that day I literally ran out and i
texted Sean like sorry it's just what to
best buy they had this computer for a
hundred forty bucks but I paid for what
I got the track that's not fantastic
it's little jittery but I'm 40 plus yeah
yeah exactly I'm just scanning real
quick here because we have so many more
questions and we are at the end of the
show so let me let me see if we have any
questions from someone who hasn't
already asked one uh to do there we go
from Zeke with the under duction of the
USBC on the macbook do you think we will
see us bc on the next iphone and ipad
man it's a standard so i'd love to see
apple follow with the industry but i
have a hard time believing it's gonna do
it I don't know yeah yes from you know
what seems like yesterday a switch from
30 pen to lightning feel like it's been
a couple years I don't know I that
thought crossed my mind is well on
Monday I just I don't know if they're
ready to sacrifice lightning yeah I
think they like making all the money off
accessories with their uh no that's
silly talkin their apple approved i
forget the the approval moniker is but
uh their products that use lighting you
know they make a lot of money off that
so right now I I think they're gonna
stick with lightning for a little bit
just because of the money they make from
the accessories yeah that's it I think
we'll see the industry shift I think
we'll see a lot of phones and tablets in
the next couple years I do to with USB
see how you to do I agree well folks
that is going to do it for this week's
up so now I'm sorry we can't get to all
