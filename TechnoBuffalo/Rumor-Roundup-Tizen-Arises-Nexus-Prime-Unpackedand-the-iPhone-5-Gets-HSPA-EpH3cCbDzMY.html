to you by Squarespace what is Tizen and
what might it mean for the future of
android running on samsung handsets
they've got a big event going on at CTA
San Diego in just a couple of weeks we
finally see the first Android Ice Cream
Sandwich device unpacked at ctia and we
all know the iPhone 5 is finally coming
set to be launched this coming Tuesday
October fourth all this coming up right
now from the intel appup elements
conference in Seattle its technical
buffalo's room around
hey what is going on everybody I'm Noah
Kravitz editor-at-large for
technobuffalo and I am here at the intel
appup elements conference in Seattle
Washington bringing you this week's
installment of rumor roundup this is the
rumor roundup for the week ending today
Friday September 30th 2011 this week's
episode of the roundup on revision3 is
brought to you by Squarespace alright
the big news coming out of this
conference this week is Tizen Tizen is
what me go used to be but now Samsung's
involved huh well it's still a little
bit confusing but basically me go was a
linux based platform that is probably
best known for showing up on nokia n9
which you know was the phone that was
released to coincide with nokia
basically announcing hey forget me go
forget sim you know forget all that
stuff we're going with Windows Phone 7
still the device which was shipped just
to select few countries not including
the United States has gotten rave
reviews for its sexy design and the
inherent usability and kind of coolness
of the operating system well Intel now
has a big-time partner in the mobile
space and Samsung and they've used the
app web elements conference to announce
the birth of Tizen Tizen is a new mobile
platform that you know it's kind of
unclear but basically it's going to take
elements of me go it might be built on
the Samsung bada OS kernel kind of
unsure what's going on but the rumor
here is that this all you know the
timing of this was not accidental
samsung announced that bada is going
open source and samsung also just
announced they've reached a deal with
Microsoft to pay Microsoft ten dollars
per android phone that they make part of
this whole ongoing patent war thing
that's threatening to take over the
technology world in general but
basically Microsoft claiming that
because of patent infringement there do
a royalty on any Android phone that's
sold and
asking for fifteen bucks a phone samsung
struck a deal ten bucks a phone and at
the same day they announced that Tizen
was also announced rumors that the first
tizen phones may be launched as soon as
Mobile World Congress next februari so
what does this all mean couldn't be
nothing but it could mean that Samsung
is trying to roll their own OS which
they already haven't bought it but
trying to roll it on a bigger scale and
looking maybe to pull back from their
Android involvement with all the patent
stuff going on with the fact that they
now have to pay Microsoft royalties and
with everything Google's been doing with
Motorola Mobility buying them it would
stand to reason that a company like
Samsung a company like HTC for that
matter might be looking to say hey you
know what we don't know where Google's
going with this whole thing with
Motorola we got to make sure we're
covered let's get another partner oh I
don't know Intel they're huge and also
you know Intel hasn't really done much
in the mobile space me go hasn't exactly
set the world on fire I look for more on
Tizen coming later this year with the
first alpha release of the platform and
then next year like I said februari
Mobile World Congress we could see the
first tizen devices perhaps from Samsung
speaking of Samsung they have sent out
invites to their next unpacked event
which will be taking place on october
eleventh at ctia san diego our own jon
rettinger will be live on the scene at
CTA bringing you all the news including
whatever Samsung is unpacking and the
rumor which makes a ton of sense is that
they will be unpacking the nexus prime
aka galaxy prime aka the first Android
Ice Cream Sandwich device to grace
planet Earth with its sweet sticky
goodness that sounds funny I had some
good ice cream at the Intel party last
night there were sour cherry popsicles
with vanilla ice cream on the inside
really good anyway Samsung's been doing
these unpacked events at all the big
mobile shows recently and also some of
them on their own they didn't want I was
at in Barcelona earlier this year with
the galaxy s2 line and now it looks like
they may be unveiling the nexus prime if
you recall lots of rumors about this
phone the first first Android Ice Cream
Sandwich phone really high spec device
set to launch on verizon wireless first
which makes a lot of sense because the
other three big US carriers AT&amp;amp;T Sprint
and t-mobile all
their own galaxy has two devices now
verizon doesn't have one and that that
may well be because they're sitting on
prime set to be unpacked according to
the rumors but I believe him october
eleventh in san diego at ctia stay tuned
to TechnoBuffalo whatever is unpacked
there jon rettinger will have his hands
his eyes and his video camera on it so
we'll bring it to you ice cream mmm ice
cream sounds good hey I want to take a

the iPhone 5 is almost upon us thank
goodness we can put these rumors to rest
we love the rumors but you know it's
move on to something else and I China
Unicom has come out and said that they
believe the iphone 5 will support 4G in
the form of hspa+ running at the full 40
2 megabits per second now this is
interesting because in the US t-mobile
is the only carrier to currently support
the full-on hspa+ 42 earlier this week
they launched their first hsps 42
devices but t-mobile looks like they
will not be getting the iphone 5 in fact
a tmobile executive posted an open
letter recently this past week which to
me was one of the sex things I've ever
read it was basically saying we've told
Apple we want it we support unlocked I
phones why won't they give it to us I
don't know anyway stand clear from that
but the interesting thing is that China
Unicom saying they'll be getting an
hspa+ 42 iphone 5 which you know means
that the technology's there for a
similar device to run on t-mobile in the
US and it also speaks to the question at
least in rumor land about there being an
LTE version of the iphone 5 it looks
like probably not you never know we are
we are kind of placing bets that
there'll be one world version of the
iphone 5 will have a dual mode chipset
that will support cdma as well as gsm 4g
implementations on both this point looks
like probably not an LTE version but
i'll tell you what an LTE iphone running
on verizon's network in the US and HSPA+
42 iphone for that matter running on
t-mobile's network here in the US work
supported would be blazing fast and i
personally would like one so Tim Cook if
you're listening and you haven't decided
yet there's still a chance just roll
them out LTE hspa+ 42 china unicom
t-mobile USA verizon just just hit
everybody up with them the more I phones
on the market the more choices people
have and the more incentive for non
iphone phone makers to kick their game
into high gear nexus prime ice cream
sandwich we want to welcome a big
