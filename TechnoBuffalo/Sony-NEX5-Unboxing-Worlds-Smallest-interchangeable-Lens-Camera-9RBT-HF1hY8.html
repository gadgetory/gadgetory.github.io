TechnoBuffalo here's their boxing for
you of the world's smallest
interchangeable lens camera the Sony
nex-5 so for those of you that have been
following me on Twitter everyone
watching so in my beloved videos you
know that I am getting married in just a
few short weeks and I wanted to take a
great camera with me on my honeymoon
something that was serving was below a
DSL alright and when I carry the bulk
and the weight but I want something with
a bit more features and a standard
point-and-shoot I like to take a lot of
four shots you're gonna put them up all
over the house that's some flexibility
with how I do the photography now I can
edit the images right on a camera so
enter the NEX five sort of perfect and
services right in between the DSLR and a
point you shoot so as I mentioned this
is interchangeable lens system using
Sony's new emails in this particular kit
I've got an 18 by 55 millimeter lens to
some stuff that's included this has
something called sweep panorama so
actually can take the camera sweep it
all the way around take a ton of
pictures put them all together right on
the camera itself into a 14 megapixel
image that image is actually now going
to be in 3d to a 3d capable TV I mean
kind of interesting 14 point 2
megapixels it shoots video at full 1080
that's 1080i AVC HD and nine twenty by
ten eighty or mp4 at 1440 by 1080 so go
ahead and continue to look around the
box so there's sort of another picture
of what we just saw on the back we get a
bit of the spec which again I will talk
about I've got it and the is a range of
206 12,800 you get full control over ISO
aperture and sort of the rest of the
DSLR features that you'd expect
again the HD movie this can use SD or
Sony's of course memory stick format
it's got optical steadyshot and all
kinds of other stuff this does again use
Sony's email but you can use any
estonians existing lenses with an
adapter let's go ahead and dig in this
particular kit as I mentioned has the 18
by 55 millimeter lens there's also a
portrait pancake lens of available this
particular kit is going to run you just
shy of
hundred dollars so go ahead and open it
up there's some additional accessories
you might want no interest there here we
have some software which is application
software for the Alpha camera I'm not
sure if that's Mac compatible or not but
there it looks like it's only for
Windows XP Vista or seven limited
warranty always important lens and
accessories take a quick look at some of
the lenses ancestries are available this
particular camera the NEX five comes in
black or silver there's also a model the
NEX three which is a bit less expensive
this one has a full even magnesium alloy
body the NEX three is plastic and only
shoots video at 720p other than that
literally isn't very much differences so
if you looking for less expensive entry
the NEX three is a great camera so here
is the 16 millimeter pancake lens that's
available you came back 55 millimeter
and there is a 18 by 200 millimeter lens
as well that's available all that's are
sure how that's gonna look on a camera
the small but you've got the option so
interchangeable lens camera information
guide enough about that let's go and
take a look at what comes in the box so
here we have the flash I believe it's an
external flash module the camera is
quite small so there wasn't much room to
include one I'll show you how this works
it goes ahead and attaches right onto an
accessory port open it up turn it on
turn it off push it back down we'll take
a look at that in a minute push that off
to the side or right now what else are
we going to get you're going to get a
very elusive and hard to find USB cable
so this is not a firewire camera it is
USB we are also going to get a battery
charger which is typical Sony fashion a
little bit on the larger sudden you've
got a shoulder strap does not appear to
be the best quality shoulder strap but
you are going to get one and of course
you're going to get a battery to power
your camera let's see what battery this
is it is info lithium ion Sony's W
battery hopefully this will power it for
plenty of time
seven point two volts puts the axe 1,080
milliamp-hour bowers in case anybody was
wondering but enough of the accessories
nobody wants to see those let's take a
look at the camera itself and I was
looking very closely at either the Canon
t2i or the Sony NEX and I just didn't
need or want a full DSLR I'm certainly a
camera novice something like this was a
bit simpler for me but so gave me some
room to explore photography it was sort
of a step I guess in between a full DSLR
I'll go ahead and take this out of the
box move the empty button now empty box
off the side take a look at the camera
again pull it out I got the gray model
again it's available in black as well
and here it is sort of again the body of
a point-and-shoot but with the full lens
support of a DSLR that's like there's
also a hood that gets included in the
box
although no filter there's a hood there
let's take a look at the camera so it's
a bit strange have a jetting out like
that but you do have the option there is
not an optical viewfinder that's sort of
what separates us from being a full DSLR
you can get an option an optical
viewfinder at the top but for most time
you have to use I believe this three
inch true black the supply which
actually can swivel up or down so you
can use it take high or low shot if I
can get it to dribble down I believe it
also will swivel up so depending on
where you're located that should be a
nice option all your controls it's not
touchscreen or done via the buttons on
the side and I'll give you a guys a full
tour of the camera as I get more
comfortable with it there's the
accessory port where the flashes and you
can get a microphone or the optical
viewfinder is going to go right in
there's a View button power button if
you want to go jump right into movie
certainly your shutter button on the
bottom there's a battery compartment and
your tripod mouse we've got HDMI out
case you wanna hook this up to a
television or computer I suppose and
there is your USB port for getting all
your information off and if I were to
bet I would say that the SD card slot is
where the battery is and indeed it is
and also a memory stick slot they can go
in there as well so you actually have
the option to pick your format which is
nice to see so
to remove away from proprietary here is
the 1855 millimeter lens you can see it
sort of do its kind of creepy looking
thing go and take this off and I will
remove the lens here I'll show you guys
what the sensor looks like very quickly
again it's a Sony's new email system we
should be able to turn that pull lens
right off you can see it is a full DSLR
size sensor on a camera of whose body is
very very small and of course here is
the lens itself go ahead and put that
back on so don't give me dirt in there
right away I'll just try and put this
back on there we go and it locks into
place
so this is the Sony nex-5 this is sort
of an unboxing and first look at the
camera I'll definitely do videos and
pictures showing you guys performance on
everything I just see if this was a
smart buy it still be buy or wear it
ranks
hopefully we'll take good enough
pictures for a honeymoon that I can
decorate my house with and remember for
the rest of my life anyway I am John
