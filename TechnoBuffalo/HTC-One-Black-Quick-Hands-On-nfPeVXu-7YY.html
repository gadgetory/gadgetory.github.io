TechnoBuffalo here and I've got in front
of me a black HTC One this guy's been
around for a few weeks but I hadn't seen
one yet in the flesh so I figured since
I was curious what looked like I thought
you might be too so let's take a look at
the black HTC One will compare it to the
grey one maybe you could decide which
phones right for you let's take a look
so here is the black HTC One I figured
since I was looking at it for the first
time maybe you guys my two and if you're
looking to pick up the HTC One maybe
you're deciding between the colors if
not then no worries at all so this is a
sprint version though you won't be able
to tell cuz there's no sprint branding
on here at all so I kind of give them a
lot of credit for putting on a phone
without any branding so let's bring in
the grey one here we could check a look
at some of the differences so first
obviously it's black so you can see that
the speaker grill is less defined all
the sensors are kind of less to find the
speaker grill on the bottom that combine
to make boomsound are also served less
pronounced than on the grey the material
and it feels almost exactly the same so
it still has that aluminum feel to it it
looks like it's soft touch but it is not
I will say though and I've got
relatively clean hands the oil in your
hands definitely show up on the black a
lot more so keep that in mind I click on
the left so the colors match everything
here including the volume up and down so
grey and black it really looks super
sleek if you go to the other side you've
got the sim card stuff there as well the
top you've got the power button there
3.5 millimeter headset jack power button
same power button but in black you
hardly even notice it everything else
here is exactly the same obviously the
UI is sense 5 and Scott blinkfeed all or
set stuff on it again we've got the
sprint version if you guys are deciding
which ones right for you hopefully this
will help you decide for me though I
think I still prefer the gray image i've
been using it for so long i'm just used
to it but does look really nice in black
and got two options and again this is
probably my favorite phone of the year
that's far so plenty of options for
which to choose from and I guys hope you
enjoyed spin a first look at the black H
you see what is anything in particular
that you want to see about it let us
know I'm not gonna do a full review of
the phone because
exactly the same phone that review but
is anything else you want to see about
the black color something that I didn't
color cover and rather in my initial
review the HTC One let me know and i'll
be sure to show to you see you guys next
video
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
