Hazleton from technobuffalo i'm here at
Mobile World Congress in Barcelona
checking out the alcatel idol 3 there's
actually two models of it available a
4.7 inch and a 5.5 inch model otherwise
relatively similar and really low-cost
so these are kind of going after the
oneplus ones on the market you're
getting pretty decent thin device here
with relatively high on specially get a
snapdragon processor this has a full
1080 HP display and it's going into demo
mode there we go this has 720p you're
looking at a 13 megapixel camera on both
phones and then up front this one has a
wide angle 8 megapixel camera while this
one has a 5-megapixel wide-angle camera
both are running a version of lollipop
actually Alcatel's oddly just calling in
android l still so i'm not sure if it's
the full version of lollipop or not
should be otherwise going around the
device you have a power button and it
looks like the SIM card tray on the left
hand side microUSB charging on the
bottom volume controls on the right hand
side and then up top to 3.5 millimeter
headphone jack so pretty much identical
phones you just get slightly better
cameras on the 5.5 inch model obviously
a better screen larger screen and then a
smaller screen on this one a little bit
more pocketable this one seems to be in
demo mode so we can't interact with it
here you can see actually it doesn't
look a lot like lollipop and performs as
such there's some pre-loaded bloatware
on here it seems like but it seems to
run all right pretty quick
hey KACE wanted to give you a quick look
here this should launch for about 200
bucks and this should launch for about 2
49 so pretty great prices considering
out of some pretty nice looking phones
