go further what's up everyone John Renzi
from TechnoBuffalo here live from CES
2013 we are at Pep gone with the trade
show before the trade show at the
Samsung booth taking a look at one of
the newest laptop Samsung unveiled today
this is series 7 Chronos is the Big
Daddy premium laptop that they're
offering it's going to take a first look
so Samsung unveiled two series 7 laptops
today this is the Big Daddy the series 7
Chronos and this is meant to be their
high-end laptop so take a look at this
guy it is a 15.6 inch screen here you
can have up to one terabyte of storage
16 gigs of memory of course it's got a
full multi-touch optimized for Windows 8
although not much interconnection here
in the trade floor Core i7 processor AMD
Radeon HD 88 70 M all kinds of power a
packed into this guy it's got a full
aluminum build non-removable battery as
sort of is the trend nowadays we've got
full Gigabit Ethernet right here DVI out
HDMI 2 USB 3.0 ports 3.5 millimeter
headset jack we got this giant
multi-touch trackpad ur starting to see
this trend now with pcs no more is the
physical button there if they can see I
can scroll with two fingers and it will
move to go ahead and navigate the
windows 8 home screen we had a full size
SD card two USB ports and of course the
locking connector on it extremely thin
profile and very powerful Samsung's
hoping this is going to appeal to the
design conscious power user who wants a
PC that doesn't sacrifice on design
front and for the first blush but it
looks really nice
let's go ahead take a look here and see
how the multi-touch works we can go
ahead and jump into something that might
have an image they look at this lady and
her family cooking will be super creepy
