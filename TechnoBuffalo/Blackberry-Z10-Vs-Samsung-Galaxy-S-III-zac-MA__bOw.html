TechnoBuffalo you're back with another
smartphone smackdown this episode we've
got the king of Android the galaxy s3
squared up against the newcomer at the
BlackBerry z10 we're gonna talk about
operating system build quad and go over
what I like and don't like about those
phones at all it's really clear winner
let's get fight
all right so on the left if you couldn't
do it by the giant logo we've got the
BlackBerry z10 the perky upstart
challenger on the right we've got the
stone worth the king the phone you know
this is the Samsung Galaxy s3 so this
smartphone Smackdown is going to be a
little bit different in the olden days
we could you compare speeds we could
open up the browser at the same time see
which apps open quicker that doesn't
work anymore all these phones are fast
and all these phones open applications
relatively quickly the one tenth of a
second or 10 millisecond different
really doesn't matter so we're gonna
break this review down in a way we've
never done before I'm gonna talk about
what I like best about each phones if I
mentioned build quality for example on
the BlackBerry z10 that means I like it
better on the z10 than I do on the
Galaxy s3 so let me go and jump in and
get started and then give you a few
disclaimers before I do first the
BlackBerry z10 just came out a few weeks
ago whereas the s3 was released back in
May we're looking at a u.s. SPECT galaxy
s3 this is for AT&amp;amp;T s Network are
looking at an unlocked BlackBerry z10
that they gave out at BlackBerry's
conference just a few weeks ago and it
does have support for 18 T's LTE network
and in the past I've tried to avoid
talking about the operating system as a
whole and really focus on the phones but
it's impossible to get away from with
this review the BlackBerry operating
system in BB 10 was made for this phones
first time we've really seen it
mass-produced and available for public
consumption so we're gonna talk a lot
about the operating system and things
that I like best about each so it's not
gonna be physically all about the galaxy
s3 as a whole but the software that runs
on it as well so let's go ahead and get
started and start with the new guy on
the block the Challenger the BlackBerry
z10
I just mentioned built quality let's go
ahead and start there I really actually
like the build quality on the z10 both
the z10 and the s3 have plastic
removable backs but the body on the z10
just feels better whether it's not the
texture back or how flush it sits with
the battery you don't feel like it's got
a removable plastic back it almost feels
like a unibody device
the bezel feels thicker feels better
built and it just feels more substantial
in the hand so another thing I really
like about the z10 and I think
BlackBerry totally nailed this one
is multitasking I love the way they
handled it here when you open an
application you get the little preview
window and it's not just a default
preview window a lot of apps will
actually show you relevant information
about that app sort of like Windows Live
Tiles well I do wish you could close it
like you can on the PlayBook by just
wiping off the screen hitting a little X
in the corner is not a big deal but I
really like the way they handled
multitasking here it's very very elegant
and the multitasking window is your home
screen I think black braid just did a
great job with that
one of the other things of BlackBerry's
of course known for is email and I think
they hit this one out of the park not
surprisingly I really like the unified
inbox approach email came through so
fast it came through faster actually on
the blackberry and did even on my
desktop computer but you're talking
about email on the galaxy s3 or Android
device Samsung's
email client I think is awful and has a
long way to go to improve know obviously
the Android caveats are here you can
download third-party apps to improve I
usually use k9 for my Android email you
can use secondary apps obviously like
Gmail but lack of unified inbox kind of
makes that annoyance for me personally I
know you can do tweaks with the routing
to make emails come through a little bit
quicker but so the out-of-the-box
experience black break this one right
out of the park so one of the highlights
of bb10 are gestures and how gestures
work blackberry peak it seems kind of
gimmicky but I found myself using it
more and more and more at sea my
notification like blink read I wanted
off I had an email who was from if it
had a reply right away and just by
peeking in and I swiping up and moving
my finger over to the right a little bit
I could just get a quick look at my
inbox even just swiping straight up and
holding my finger on the screen I could
see that little red asterisks to know if
I had an email a text message or
whatever else it might be it was really
handy and something that I found myself
using quite a bit
speaking of using quite a bit you're
gonna want hit a home button quite a bit
on the blackberry for coming from an
iPhone Windows Phone or Android device
but there is not a home button to be
found the home Mac
is to swipe straight up now first that
was one of the more annoying things
about the phone but the more I used it
sort of days and days and weeks on I got
really used to about myself liking it
and as I switch back to Android or tried
iOS again I kept trying to swipe up on
the screen surprisingly that was
something that I really enjoyed about
the black brazii 10 I wish other os's
would actually use it if you've never
tried it definitely something you it's
gonna take a while to get used to but it
does become second nature very quick so
when blackberry announced the z10 and
BlackBerry 10 in particular they were
really touting the keyboard awesomeness
and they also hit a home run with this
guy the keyboard is probably the best
on-screen keyboard I have ever used the
frets are in a great place I love how it
starts to fill in words for age of
typing you could just swipe them right
up on the screen it became second nature
and it learns as you go and I love what
BlackBerry did by putting a touch sensor
underneath the screen so if you've got
fat fingers you accidentally hit the
opiate tip the P key it'll sense that
actually will move those contact points
over they really did a cool job and of
course everything I'm talking about if
you want more detail on it definitely
check out our blackberry z10 review or a
galaxy s4 you do which is gonna run
through all these features in depth but
the keyboard they absolutely nailed if
you're a blackberry purist and you're
coming from a bold or an older curve and
you don't want to give up that physical
keyboard you can wait for the q10 to
come out for a few months in May issue
or you can take the plunge and try to
keep around the z10 I really don't think
you're gonna be disappointed and using
the z10 week after week it never felt
slow to me it always felt fast never
felt bogged down the dual-core processor
and 2 gigs of RAM were awesome I think
that's due to the vertical integration
model what that means is BlackBerry
makes the software and BlackBerry makes
the hardware so this phone was made just
for this operating system they didn't
have to deal with really anything else
that went into it now they certainly
outsource the processor and there are
components in there but the phone was
built for this operating system in
particular which is really an incredible
model Oh executed properly and it worked
beautifully I didn't feel any sort of
lag at all I used in his detent it felt
quick it felt as if II and it really
just worked well never at any point no
matter how many applications I had open
did I feel like the phone was slow or
to catch up with what I was doing so
when it comes to speed and this was
surprising to me to the BlackBerry z10
definitely took that and the last edge
that I'm going to give to the z10 is the
screen itself
it's a 4.2 inch green with the
resolution of 768 by 1280 with a 355 PPI
the screen itself was actually beautiful
which I was pleasantly surprised about
because Samsung is really known for
putting out awesome screens pictures
look great videos popped text was crisp
and clear and this is a huge comp into
blackberry because Samsung has some of
the best screens on the market but I
think they absolutely nailed it and it's
great to see a high def screen
finally on blackberry all right so we
talked about all the awesomeness that is
in the BlackBerry z10 what about the
awesomeness that's in the galaxy s3 this
phone currently sits is the king of
Android and has for the past few months
and it's got that position for a reason
there's a lot of stuff to love so let's
go ahead and first start with apps the
Google Play Store has a ton of
applications and I found myself when I
was using the z10 wishing that I could
finally go back and use Instagram and
some of the other apps that black brace
that is coming but just aren't here yet
things like Instagram whatsapp etc I
just wish they could have I knew when I
was using an Android device particularly
the galaxy s3 that any app I wanted
there would be an Android version and
that just because the OS has been around
for years and Blackberry does not have
that luxury well they claim to have
70,000 apps not many of them are overly
useful so apps something the galaxy s3
absolutely has over the z10 next is
browser one of the things I use
absolutely the most on the phone the
browser on the galaxy s3 and really
Android in general is pretty incredible
I'm talking about the built in browser
not even Google Chrome which I know a
lot of you guys use in Chrome would have
been the same thing here incredible
browser was smooth it was quick
everything just worked very well and of
course mobile websites are optimized to
work with Android devices and I'm
certain they're based on the same base
of technology it's a WebKit so things
work pretty well on the z10 but
everything worked perfectly on the
galaxy s3 and you'll find that's true of
course of almost any Android device so
the z10
has a speech-to-text functionality built
in and it works as you talk it'll type
but nothing holds a candle to what
Google has on Android devices I think
the Galaxy S series with a perfect
examples of that speech-to-text
just works great and quick as you talk
and get punctuation it shows up almost
instantaneously and it just worked in
the day that's really what you want from
your phone you want it just to work you
don't have to think about all the things
your phone is doing to make the
processes go you just want the phone to
do what you need and when it comes to
speech to text it absolutely nails it
and of course Google now I love Google
now for knowing how long to take me to
get home sports scores stocks Google now
is incredible add-on comes with
jellybean built in and of course the
galaxy s3 features that it just works
very well and again that's the theme
here things just work on Android used to
be the hallmark of iOS but Android has
really come up very quickly
one of the other great things about
Android particular is customization on
the z10 you can't do that much you can
change the background you can make
folders but that's really it you don't
have options to put widgets and changed
away icons look and change fonts really
to the depth that you can on the galaxy
s3 or Android it just worked much better
and that's again that's the moral here
things you just worked better on the
galaxy s3 so the next thing that I think
that the galaxy s3 has got over the z10
something I never thought I'd say
actually TouchWiz itself has a really
lot of nice additions here that's come
along very well over the years and I'm
not the biggest fan of the cartoonish
look in the big bright icons and that
kind of things but TouchWiz does have a
lot of nice functionality you've got
things like all the s functionality here
as well you've got S Memo as suggests
and of course s voice and all the tweaks
that go into it as well anything from
how the home screens perform to the
widgets TouchWiz has come along very
well and isn't as heavy as it once was
so I give Sam some credit certainly that
edge goes to the galaxy s3 so I
mentioned in the z10 what things I liked
was the gestures but what I missed was
physical home buttons for back and menu
I found myself searching for where the
menu option was on the z10 while I
preferred the home button swipe gesture
on the blackberry I
did miss the back and many buttons and
the physical buttons found on the galaxy
s3 or the capacitor buttons that are
here so I talked about how much I liked
the screen itself on the BlackBerry z10
but I preferred the screen size on the
galaxy s3 if Sir mix-a-lot taught me
anything it's bigger is better and I
really like the bigger 4.8 inch screen
on the Galaxy s3 when it comes to the
screen itself that edge still goes to
the z10 but the size I like my phone's
big and I prefer the larger screen size
of the galaxy s3 so which one would I
pick if I had to choose one of these
phones if I have to choose one of these
phones for you
the winner would be the galaxy s3 for a
few simple reasons first and probably
most importantly I know Samsung is gonna
be around for the next two years or the
duration of my contractors three years
if you're in Canada you can't say the
same for blackberry they've got a great
operating system they've got what now
looks to be a brighter future but
there's no guaranteeing what that's
gonna mean for you is future support
Samsung hasn't been known to push out a
ton of OS updates for their phones are
kind of slow but they do come and
Samsung's gonna continue to support if
you're gonna be customer service
warranties will be honored and I think
that that would be one of the main
reasons I would choose a Galaxy s3
over a blackberry is d-10 now
BlackBerry's done an incredible job at
the z10 it's probably the best first
generation operating system that's ever
come out but as I mentioned in the
review if you want to catch the
competition and you're losing in a race
which blackberry certainly is right now
you can't just run as fast you have to
run faster and I don't think blackberry
is running any faster I like the
scalability of Android I like everything
about the galaxy s3 and this phone is
the winner for a reason insta-kill of
Android for several months while so many
competitors have come out for a reason
it's a great phone on a great platform
it's available on pretty much any
carrier you can pick this up almost
anywhere you go in any country there's
always going to be support for it so the
winner of the smartphone smackdown is
the galaxy s3 and I know a lot of this
scenes like Android versus BlackBerry 10
but it's the only way to approach
something like this with such a new
operating system
in the z10 so hope you guys enjoy it if
you liked the video you liked this style
of smartphone smackdown give this a
thumbs up it really helps us out I check
us out at TechnoBuffalo come for latest
and greatest tech news I will see you
