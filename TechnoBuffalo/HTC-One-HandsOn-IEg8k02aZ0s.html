with technobuffalo we're checking out
the HTC One this is a silver model it's
coming to ATT sprint and tmobile in the
united states have already got the home
page loaded here but here let me show
you some of the new features the home
button you can see they're down there
yes this is blinkfeed which is actually
your home screen now so you always have
the option of having the other on others
filled with widgets but now we've got
blinkfeed i messing around here and it's
a populated with news so I played mr.
reuters article and you get the full
story and the idea behind it is is
constant consumption on the go of just
eating a little bits of information it's
really neat idea the only problem is
that you can't customize speeds with
with ones that aren't already provided
through lengthy okay so let's move
around the phone you've got these stereo
speakers on both ends which I believe
they're calling the boom something or
other fun pacing wide angle camera got
the silver volume buttons on the right
side just like the butterfly or the
droid DNA in the fact this is all
aluminum case of the entire design is
unibody aluminum on the top 3.5
millimeter headphone jack on the power
button and you can see the power buttons
really dark that's because it has an IR
blaster milk and I'll show you that app
in just a second a real thin design and
then the back camera here which shoots
zoe pictures they're saying it's
ultrapixel camera so basically the idea
is that they no longer want to focus on
megapixels but instead on on the quality
and a sensor that you get so here we'll
jump in
let's go to the camera because that's
one of the really cool features so you
shoot pictures at any time but there's
also the option to shoot a Zoe see I
just click look turn it off so I click
that that's the Zoe and now at all times
whenever you take a picture it's
actually going to take three seconds of
video you can see that red bar going now
see that red bar so it's actually
recording three seconds of video so that
when you go into the gallery this is
hard with one hand so when you go to the
gallery now there's actually live data
here you can see that the floor is
actually moving in here is if it was an
actual shot it seems to have stopped
here we go these tutorials can be
annoying in any case so there you go see
the live moving photos there now if you
click one it becomes a highlight reel
which is involves photos and these
shorts Zoey three second clips so you
can show your friends a vacation in this
30-second clip that includes all of
these short zoe's that you might have
taken along the way and it creates its
own music and everything like that so
any case guys this is a quick look at
the HTC One this is thought Hazleton
with TechnoBuffalo really amazing phone
1080p screen here can it take the galaxy
s3 even the galaxy s4 that remains to be
seen we can't wait for review mnet's
landing at the end of March Todd
