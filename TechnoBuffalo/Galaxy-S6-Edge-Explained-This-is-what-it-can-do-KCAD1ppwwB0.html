Hazleton from TechnoBuffalo I already
brought you our hands-on video with the
Galaxy s6 edge and now I want to show
you a little deeper dive into what you
can actually do with the edge of the
screen like why is it there what makes
it important you can see it it looks
cool but what else so when you have the
phone open on the lockscreen here you
can quickly access your favorite
contacts now note the color codings
because we'll get into that in a little
bit and you can quickly place a phone
call or a text message a crisp fernandes
what's up will swipe it back so it's
always just a swipe away from the side
of the screen there okay so now we can
go into the customization I'll show you
all the different things you can do with
it
go into settings edge screen now here
you can see the edge lighting you can
set the device to light up the edge when
calls and notifications are received and
I'll show you that in a second people
edge that's what we already showed you
where you pull in from the side
information stream I'll show you that in
a second but it's similar to what we've
seen on a note 4 or a note edge rather
and then night clock which I'll also
show you you can go in here select the
notifications that you want to receive
information streams shows different
things so you can manage the feeds right
here we have it looks like just your
notifications and calendar alerts Yahoo
a Twitter Yahoo Finance here and then
Yahoo Sports on the end you can download
feeds now remember and I told this the
apps are different from what's on the
note edge so they're not the same not
compatible so very different and then
you can go in and change the wedding's
the weather settings the weddings the
weather settings two different edges
here change it from Celsius to
Fahrenheit and stuff like that so now
let me show you some of the functions
now what we can do is I can demo some of
the features because Samsung actually
set it up for us here so here's SMS and
we'll actually in a call alert and we're
gonna show you how it works so the phone
will start ringing but if it's face down
you can see the edge actually glows blue
to show us that that's the caller coming
through and obviously it will work a lot
better in the dark
we get an idea of who's who's calling
you and you can just see right there the
color change so it actually does have a
use for you
now I'll show you what it looks like in
sleep mode so if you're here you can
activate the stripe it's actually facing
the wrong way there we go and this is
great if you're just lying in bed or you
have it on the desk and you just want to
quickly check the weather the time or
the battery charge and then this is
where you're going to flip through to
see your stocks your sports scores
notifications what's going on on the
Yahoo News and Twitter and everything
like that and then if you want you
should also get a bedtime clock there
and it's just sort of a soft glow after
this deactivates let's see if it goes
into that mode for us in case that's a
quick look here at all the features you
can currently do with the galaxy s6 edge
we imagine as developers gain support
they're gonna create much more
functionality but that's a that's a
start of what you'll see out-of-the-box
