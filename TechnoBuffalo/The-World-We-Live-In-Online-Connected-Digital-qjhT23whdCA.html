to you by harry's hello there you sir or
madam walk back the episode of renters
wrist is the show where I Rift and
sometimes rave and sometimes get my ram
peas in a bunch about something going on
in the world of tech usually I'm getting
old and preachy and telling you
shouldn't do something this week though
I want to talk about how freaking
awesome it is to be alive right now
there's rettinger stress it's go and get
started so it's very easy to get
short-sighted on fighting about iOS
Android Windows Phone or blackberry
which one is better but the fact is we
have any ridiculously awesome time and
it sort of dawned on me over the weekend
so I mentioned this in all automobiles
my wife and I have a one-year-old at
home which makes it very hard for us to
go out and get stuff makes hard for us
to do dinner which makes sort of going
anywhere a little extra layer of
difficulty so we ordered products on our
phone from box that showed up at the
house we had groceries delivered via
amazon fresh i was able to call a ride
via uber I'll able to books and travel
for us all from my phone while never
leaving the couch this is a ridiculous
time you live in I think we should
appreciate just leave with just
ridiculousness of things we can do just
from our mobile phones regardless of
what platform you use that that's
another discussion for another day the
fact that you've got the wealth of the
world's information in the palm of your
hand is I just hard to even fathom you
look like the Library of Congress these
big libraries as a world that have
volumes and volumes and volumes and
there's like man I got it on the phone
is absolutely amazing so I'm 34 I'm you
know young the old penny on your
perspective you know but I remember a
time before the Internet I remember
having encyclopedias my parents had a
big set of encyclopedia britannica I
just have to go and look stuff up I
remember wedding Carta actually hit now
the fact you can do anything you want
from your phone is absolutely ridiculous
fact that I could essentially order
things from a costco equivalent I gave
grocery show up at the house I could
order dinner from LA
I I could book travel like to have a car
come pick me up without ever having to
get up which that's probably another
statement on maybe my laziness at home
it's just an absolute insanity it's just
a mind-boggling thing of what we have
right now technically wonder what we're
going to have in 10 15 20 years for
decades you know from now and my son is
my age what that's going to be me stop
real quick to thank our friends at
harrys it is Movember so just hold on
one second let me get my movember attire
on feels a little more like it so are
you going to grow out an epic handlebar
mustache you're going to try and just do
the wax and make a curl up there if you
are you want to go just a badass beard
like this Harry's calm is the official
razor partner of November so you can
shape that pretty awesome neck baby
thinking about growing and they will be
there for you during the entire harry
month whether or not you want to grow
your mo with Harry's you can get an
amazing shave and you goodbye supporting
both members quest to find fund research
on importance men's health issues which
as a man is important so you should go
ahead and do that their starter shave
set starts at just 15 bucks per month
that includes the razor blades of your
choice and Harry shave cream or the new
foaming shave gel gel guy but that's
just me Harry's also just released their
very own line about to shave moisturizer
so you can be soft and smooth in that
areas where you don't have her go to
Harry's calm now and Harry's will give
you five dollars off they type in my
promo code which is techno that is
Harry's har ry s commenter promo code
techno check out to get your five
smackeroos off and change the way you
shave forever but also free shipping so
the next time you think about getting
mad and Reggie and screaming about
someone who likes iOS or Android or
sonic applicable names taking out what
those phones can do and the fact they
have a browser on that which can give
you access to anything you want to know
and beyond that there's not to type
anything you could just ask your phone
any question and it gives you an answer
is insane to me I remember when I was in
high school I had when those big TI it
was an 83 graphing calculator did
everything I needed to do as far as math
now I can just download an app on my
phone
and I can have that anything i want in
the world product-wise can show up my
house I can book travel I could see the
world all without having ever have ever
having to get up and I can book travel
to go do that it is just a crazy thing
to anything sometimes the port a
perspective on life you gets her very
short-sighted on little things in front
of you and just appreciate what we have
right now you don't need a
six-hundred-dollar flagship phone to
access any of the stuff I'm talking
about just a really cool thing and I
just sort of dawned on me that it was
something cool to talk but I thought
maybe just for a few minutes my change
in perspective before you just leave
hate comments on someone's YouTube
videos or in person think about the cool
time we live in and the guy just want
the deserve to share that thought I hope
you enjoyed Noah's a little bit off
topic and tangent but we just live in a
really badass time and appreciate the
bad attitude of the time that we live in
same guys for watching until next time
I'll be back with some more tech topics
