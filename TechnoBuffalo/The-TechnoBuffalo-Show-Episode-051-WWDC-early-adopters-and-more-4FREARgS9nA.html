TechnoBuffalo show I'm live your to host
for today Sean ani editor-in-chief of
the site and i'm joined by deputy
managing editor Todd asel t'en hey
everybody are you doing today Todd I'm
good that was quite an introduction
sounded like it so we tell you that
fresh they're coming out to entering the
room boxer yeah we'll get you some intro
music and pyrotechnics next week yeah
Mabel won't mind that at all nope but so
we are luckily in a quiet couple of days
before the next event is upon us which
is going to be III yeah and I saw
somebody tweet a little bit ago or like
a week or so ago that with a six week
period will have had google i/o WWDC III
san diego comic-con yeah it's insane
yeah saying this is just it's a wild
period it's a we always think about
January sort of like the busy time
because CES but really it's it happens
all year round it really does named by
these events yeah it's become a
year-long situation now yeah you know
and Comic Cons not you know as important
to us as you know say WWDC or whatever
but still you're we go and we do cover
comic-con mail so it's yeah it's it's a
crazy time period but we're off of WWDC
and yeah i mean we all right so we
covered it we saw iOS 9 we saw El
Capitan I think those are the big
announcement some beers and watch os/2
which I'm most excited for I think watch
os/2 looks pretty pretty awesome the
native apps for the Apple watch and all
that kind of stuff they're going to open
up the sensors but yeah iOS 9 and El
Capitan I feel like going into it we
sort of knew they were going to be I
think I guess focused on performance and
stuff like that we get some things but a
lot of it and what I said in an
editorial yesterday are things that are
taken from
windows and Android and stuff like that
which is fine but guy and I want to make
that clear by the torta I think I did
it's okay to borrow these ideas but you
know their crate like say for example
snapping two windows side by side in El
Capitan or we're multitasking on the
iPad where you have the the two windows
you can scroll through different apps
and stuff and change one of the windows
on the iPad that's something that we've
seen in Windows it's fine that Apple is
taking them it just also wasn't like you
know groundbreaking exciting it wasn't
as innovative as Apple might make it
seem a lot of these features have been
elsewhere I see press and Franco here
says all i have to say is Metro bunch of
scopes and android yet so a lot of these
things were pulled from other ideas but
like I said it's all good Syria need to
get smarter we've said that on earlier
podcasts finally she's a lot smarter you
can use you know I was saying actually I
think I said last week like I want to
just say like remind me to get milk at
the grocery store like so geolocation
reminders and stuff like that and that's
coming to Siri so so here even in
Cortana and Google now for what here's
the funny thing there were two things
two tiny things that got me the most
excited and that was he shake your mouse
to pay you that's pretty fun which a lot
of people are like whoa that's not
useful I I agree it's not useful if you
just run one monitor yeah when you met
me or whatever look video yeah but what
you sometimes have three or four you
know which I have four times that I was
like oh yeah the other thing was all the
improvements to notes I I like he use
your boats me too so I was excited about
that but again there was nothing really
there that doesn't currently exist in
other forms and other places right and
yeah third party apps was with the other
thing I was just like news and the notes
yeah exactly so so that's why I kind of
walked away most impressed I suppose by
watch os/2 because like I said they're
opening up the sensors to third party
apps ensure you know pebble that's one
of the things they've done here and
especially I guess it's the whole
form they're opening up so you can add
different bands that add certain things
like GPS or whatever to the pebble time
but I think in a lot of ways Apple sort
of at the forefront in at least in the
apps on watch on smartwatches I think
they're doing a bit of a better job than
what we've seen on other platforms
Android wear is good you know the latest
update but it's it's not available on
the Moto 360 at which I use so I hadn't
really had a chance to use a lot of the
apps and then pebbles been created has a
huge developer base but I just I think
apple watch will be at the forefront of
that even though i had an editorial I
know recently so that's their trashy
right now because I think one of the
problems is they opened it up and
actually I don't know if I talked about
this on the last one but I'll give some
background they opened up the the
watchkit right so developers can add
apple watch support to their apps and a
lot of these developers were just
developing the apps and for example one
that I reached out to you hadn't even
received his Apple watch it so it didn't
even work and he didn't know that and so
that's kind of like quality control
issues but hopefully that all gets fixed
brazen franca raises a very excellent
question it's okay to borrow ideas it's
shady to steal them patent them and sue
the original crater and everyone else
was something similar yeah yeah now so
far as I know Apple has not patented a
the features that were saying they
borrowed air quotes right from other
services and other operating systems if
they were to do that that would to me
honestly be more of a indictment health
flawed the patent system is yeah but ya
know there's there's a world of
difference there for sure yeah and
hopefully that doesn't happen but you
look at like for example Microsoft makes
a lot of money off Android because it
owns a lot of the patents and google has
to pay it so you know in a lot of ways
these companies you don't you don't
necessarily know who owns what and
they've already
worked out these licensing things or
whatever because Microsoft originally a
couple years ago is going after like all
these guys HTC and everybody suing them
and getting them to sign on these
licensing agreements so yeah I don't
know it's a dark road we're all
traveling down when it comes to pens
that's for sure right something needs to
be fixed in the patent system and if
Apple was to go after any of these pants
yes I I would immediately go come on
really you know that's not right but
we'll we'll see what happens with all
that but we have a question firm and now
we got lots of questions coming in so
yay from such a Mahal what was your
favorite WWDC 2015 announcement like I
said for me it was oddly enough no sand
the shake to wake your cursor but what
was your effing mind was watch watch
os/2 I think that's the most exciting
but I did um let me know I always nine
teams great you know I always try to
update to the latest stuff on my phones
i haven't done Android M yet and I
haven't done i OS 9 yet but i did
download iOS 9 this morning so i plan to
put that on Android M I'm a little more
wary of because you know I just got put
on the Nexus 6 and then it's sort of
owned by Google I don't really like to
mess around with that but I have let me
it is owned by Google's are reviewing it
but I have you know my own iphone 6 plus
a little more prepared to put iOS 9 on
that and I've been testing iOS not or
the early versions of iOS almost every
year last year iOS was way too buggy for
me at this stage hopefully this year is
a little better yeah I'm hoping so as
well you know it's I I don't know it's a
I find it enter here's one thing that
made me laugh throughout WWDC oh and we
were ailing you know i wanna say was 4
gigabytes and you know we were able to
get iOS 9 down to one point something
gigabytes okay is that because you found
a better way to compress it or is it
because there's that much less in it
yeah I don't know I think ever I think
it's that they're compressing it I don't
know
hey I just that was kind of an apples
and oranges moment for me I was like you
but it's good news for folks that have a
16-gigabyte iPhones yeah so the
operating systems not taking all day I
just saw what was it there was like a
new sony phone or something where it had
like 1.2 i forget the phone like 1.2
gigabytes of usable space pretty slick
what are you and like i know you can put
in a micro SD card in a lot of cases and
transfer some apps over but it still
doesn't give you a lot of room right
there and you know cloud storage and all
that 11 gigabytes that's a joke but
don't buy that phone so we have to
discuss Apple music yep you know so
here's my first thought okay oh they're
all yo and the artists will be posting
things that are exclusively F amusement
yeah for how long yeah we've heard that
before we've heard that before and not
just we're not just from Apple we've
heard it from multiple sources yo you
know artists get bored quickly they move
on their contract for promotion runs out
all the time yeah so I I'm just like
don't even make that a selling point
it's not worth it it's going to go away
they're not gonna care after six months
yeah I think for you know it'll probably
be filled and they said like any artist
can put stuff so it'll probably be
filled with you know emerging artist
stuff which is always good but you know
I think the real attraction would be
like exclusive music videos and stuff
like that if they can get them but they
seem to end up sort of on VEVO and stuff
like that first you know are not apples
gonna compete with that and plus you
know the thing that Apple fails to
address in this and they're like you
know I think they said on stage you have
all these things you have your music
player and you have Instagram and you
have this that you know tumblr and you
follow these artists on all these things
like we're gonna put them all together
and they're forgetting that we like to
use Instagram like I open up Instagram
because that's where I want to go I
don't want to open up music and then you
know just get music there I want to go
to Instagram where I get you know I
followed the artists I like I follow
photographers I like I followed my
friends I fell out like that
when Instagram is well it's like me and
Twitter you know I I always talk about i
have three monitors going in any time i
have one monitor dedicated to nothing
but twitter that's because i'm bringing
in the entertainment news i care about
the tech news that I care about the
regular news I care about it's all in
one place and I'm not going to open up
Apple music just go ooh what's you know
Katy Perry doing today right yeah no
it's that's not what I want to do I want
to be able to go I want to be able to
see and just for the record folks I
don't follow Katy Perry you know if Katy
Perry goes by my twitter feed great i
can go okay that's interesting but then
okay there's 14 far more interesting
things going on yeah and like I get
there trying to make the experience more
robust more like feel like you're really
interacting with these artists in some
way and they can they one of the big
highlights are saying is he's human
curated playlists right like I think
Jimmy hottie avene her I forget that
they I usually say I of I'll is a
private one of those on stage like you
know saying algorithms are stupid which
is funny because you know iOS 9 is all
about that in your location and stuff so
you know algorithms are stupid human
curation like you're at the gym you know
a music engines not going to tell you
you know play the right song next when
you're working out you need someone that
knows you're on Jim mix and they forget
that like Spotify has this they have all
these lists they have lists created by
people if you want to go on Spotify and
make a public list and share it you can
and most of those lists that are shared
under like moods and i think i said like
i like indie chill covers and other
things i listen to are created by humans
there's other people other Spotify users
and they have thousands and thousands of
users so to say that Apple musics the
only one out there you know with human
curated stuff it's not true and Spotify
has a ton of that and I wrote yesterday
I'm excited to try Apple music because I
think there's cool stuff in it BB's are
not be PC but uh beats 1 radio the 24-7
radio station sounds pretty interesting
although that's a free feature and I'm
really interested in controlling it with
seer
b which is something i've wanted forever
like when i'm in the car but i think
i'll probably stick with spotify because
of those you know i have all those
playlists already i really like them has
sharing features so i can easily share
with all my friends it's got that
facebook login and i haven't heard much
about that from apple so i'll give it a
try three month trial but i really like
Spotify it's something I'm looking for a
replacement well you know the thing is
I've had human curated workout playlist
for years it's called I built them and
itunes chasing them on my ipod and
that's kind of the fun of it yeah I I
enjoyed sitting down and you know
although funny quick story never ever
put the main theme music from Conan the
Barbarian in your workout mix because
not only will you try to lift more than
you've ever lifted you will try to lift
the entire way track because you're that
you're invincible honestly I had that
music on one one time in the gym I was
like I can lift anything and I couldn't
yeah I I I have a lot of problems with
yeah I've as I've said before i do
subscribe to pandora that's mainly
because i like i use it more as a music
discovery right engine but in general i
don't have a lot of interests in music
subscription services mmm hey oh yes i
am currently subscribed to spotify for
three months i found a great deal where
I got premium for 99 cents for every
month so I was like ah sir for a buck
you know why not but and i'll try Apple
music for the three months will I pay
for it after that I highly doubt it but
we have a very interesting question from
Sean the man 34 about this will Apple
music be the I think he meant say the
most subscribed music service I believe
it will just because it is pre-installed
on hundreds of millions of devices one
not is my dad has never wanted
subscription music but now because Apple
has he wants to try thoughts that's an
ex
excellent point mm-hmm this is going to
put a service in front of hundreds of
millions of people that may have never
even considered a premium subscription
service yeah that's it I was saying
today spotify announced that they just
hit 20 million subscribers up from 15
million in January and I said you know I
think people are gonna exactly like Sean
said they're gonna boot up their iphone
see this and be like I've heard about
these premium music services unlimited I
have three months free it's already here
I'll try it then there'd be like wow
that was great I mean there's there's no
question I think once you try it most
people really really enjoy it I mean you
get everything you want yeah I can't say
most people 20 million people out of
what seven billion on earth but hey
Gabbar today I think like you you know
it's pretty sweet i think a lot of
people are gonna what's a few billion
between friends yeah yeah i think for
some people they might be like oh I've
heard about Spotify you know not the
techies I've heard about Spotify what is
that and then they just haven't really
gotten into it and now you know music
right there on our phone they probably
dive in yeah I know in general I just
while there was interesting things at
WWDC it was for me fairly lackluster and
I the other day I was speaking with joey
davidson our gaming editor for those who
aren't familiar with him and he did make
a really funny joke to me about the name
El Capitan oh yeah well we realized yes
it is a landmark in California Joey
stated it also sounds like something at
frat house names their dog oh yeah
exactly it does funny yeah I mean I i
think i would have been better office of
like Big Sur or you know I Orange County
I don't know in which cousin kinds of
different things we think I was talking
about it might have been Roy or branding
on staff to you though is El Capitan it
is the mount is that face right that
cliff in Yosemite it seems like maybe
this is sort of just like
representing it it's a smaller update to
Yosemite I don't know it could be and
could be on it sort of related well one
other topic we wanted to touch on this
week was the concept of the pitfalls to
being an early adopter yeah so Todd and
I have both received our pebble times
Todd is not wearing hilary he's still in
love with the Apple watch which is fine
that's his right you know at the time Oh
bad pun which was not intentional at the
time the Kickstarter happened you know
we both were still big pebble lovers I'm
still a big bubble of our I still love
it i will say that my pebble time
arrived on saturday and I church tipped
one hundred percent amare at thirty
percent so it does not look like I'm
going to get the promised weak battery
life I'm going to let run down to zero
which I hardly ever let anything do but
i want to see exactly how far I go mmm
so overall I'm very happy with the pub
so far yay not a problem but then
there's other early adopter situations
and for those of you listening on the
audio show I am holding up to the camera
I have finally received my coin credit
card and I have not bothered to do a
thing with it I'm not going to bother to
do a thing with it for those of you that
don't remember the coin and rightfully
so I think it was about a year and a
half ago they solicited these was a long
time yeah so for fifty dollars you get
this card that is just a generic credit
card essentially but super cheap like
it's like paper yeah I'm like it's
really thin yeah it is really thin and
you can put up to four credit cards on
it and then you can just carry this one
card instead of the four credit cards
well here's the biggest problem with
this it's not even so much that Apple
pay has taken off or Android wallet or
any of those it's the fact that there's
no chip in the card yeah now by next
year all credit cards are going to be
required to come with a
when they're issued and more and more
credit card readers are adding chip
ability if you go to England at all they
look at you like you're from an alien
plan if you don't have a chip in your
car it's so true Oh might have it now
have them not to you Oh almost all mine
avid now so the fact that this came
without chip is honestly to me the
biggest problem amongst many problems
but that's why the biggest problem so I
paid fifty dollars for this year and a
half ago or however long it was I will
never use it it will just go into the
drawer of dead tech and that that is
definitely one of the pitfalls of being
an early adopter you know we get very
excited about new technology when it's
announced we jump right on board and
then sometimes the train takes those two
destinations we no longer want to go
yeah i mean i got mine i used it once
and i honestly it just felt like weird
like I have to explain this every time I
felt like and I just didn't want to do
that and I was like yeah whatever I'm
not using my coin card I'm because you
don't want to risk right like you don't
want to go out to dinner and have them
come back and be like it's not running
or something like that I mean it's just
kind of embarrassing and so you know if
they come back and see that you don't
have your wallet on you then what do you
do and so I feel like I still need my
wallet I just well and even in the coin
box if you take out the insert that
everything was on me inside it says not
sure where to put your cards once you've
load them onto your coin toss them in
here along with the card reader so you
always know where they are and then you
know don't lose this box so even they're
saying even there well I mean they're
saying you know don't accidentally throw
your credit cards out yeah but you're
they're trying to you know put your card
seniors you're never gonna need them
again situation you just presented todd
is the perfect one he would still need
your credit cards with you right you
know even though I am I now use Apple
pay and inside except at many places I
also
use android wallet I still carry a
wallet on me i still have my credit
cards with me because I've been around
technology long enough to know hey
something's probably going to go wrong
yep and if you listen to podcast you
know both of us still print our airline
boarding passes nope yep well heck I
still print out before I leave I print
out my hotel reservation I print out my
airline reservation my rental car
reservation I print out all that stuff I
carried in a folder with me because you
never know what's going to happen you
should have seen when I went to Aoife
last year in Berlin that's where for
people who don't know it's where samsung
announces Galaxy Note stuff like that
each year I printed out maps and
directions for everywhere I had to go in
case you know like I don't know the data
network was too slow now i will say i
don't print out maps anymore i I've
given up on printing maps that was the I
I was bull had back-to-back meetings and
they're all over the city and I was like
you know I need to be able to get there
ya know and that makes sense you know
especially in a country where you don't
speak the language right you know at
least like when I go to the UK you know
it's not super hard for me to find
someone they can answer a question for
me although sometimes they look at me
and go your ex and stuff from around
here but no really I'm a native uh I
mean back to early adopters stuff i
bought the pebble time i think i opened
it either I guess monday morning or
something it's still been charging I
don't even really played with it and I
just sort of looked at it and I was like
I mean the Apple watches a lot more of
what I want so I just haven't really and
it so does android where I think in a
lot of respects the only thing it's nice
is the battery life there you know I'll
use it and play with it i think i'm
gonna do the review i'm just not as
excited as I was when I bought it right
no and that's understandable you you
found a new girlfriend yeah yeah we did
you I mean just like screen and the
build immediately like side to side and
I know it's like half the price of the
Apple watch it's just like not even
close now someone that has not played
with an apple
for any length of time is not worn 1 i'm
extremely happy with the puppet on right
so long as I hold up for you the email
i'm receiving well we've got a ton of
questions coming as always we thank you
for all those very we'll start with the
most important question of the day from
Shauna man 34 something came up and I
can't stay for the live stream but had
to log on and that's the usual question
have you returned anything lately Todd
yeah it might be that double time I got
a review it i don't think i'm gonna wear
it so i guess i can't return it i don't
think but i could sell it ah todd todd
diner well let me go through here we
we've got a ton of questions from
christopher miles with all the features
being added to the app watch it seems
Apple is taking the quote smartphone on
your wrist unquote approach is that what
you guys want from a SmartWatch or e or
our google / pebbles notifications have
more your style excellent question for
me I think I'm more of a google / pebble
notification hub kind of guy well yeah I
think that works better because the
problem right now with a lot of these
and you know pebble works better in this
case but the apps on the app will watch
are so slow to load that it's almost
pointless to ever try to load them
glances are great that's when you slide
up and you look at glanceable
information but when you try to open an
app a lot of them are super slow that
the screen usually just times out and
just like forget about it so until their
native until they load quicker I'm more
for the notification hug like for
example I was I heard a song the other
day and I was like oh I should Shazam
this and I looked at my Apple wash and I
was like I'm not going to rely on that
so just use my phone because any was
gonna take too long oh yeah but Apple
and they actually talked about this a
bit during wwcc their big bet is
obviously on the App Store mean they
seem to make a lot of money off this if
they can create another app store
another place to buy these apps then you
know big bucks for them and same with if
we
ever see the apple TV with its own app
store apples you know definitely excited
that about that they're gonna push that
what's always google I mean we just saw
a during I oh they're talking about
Spotify an uber coming so yeah I i I'm
definitely more of a hub guy it's I want
to be nice to have a few more features I
just I see myself I you know meet odd
you know if it's more than three im's
long what do i do yeah i hit skype yep
if i have to type anything if i have to
respond to anything I'm just gotta go up
forget this and pull out my phone right
yeah but it is nice and also sort of you
feel like you change but you know to get
these alerts when I get up from my desk
to make lunch or something and you know
you need me I get the alert right on my
wrist don't have to pull out my phone
like that's that's really nice yeah it
also feels like you're never need you
Todd you never disconnected yeah uh from
nav 9900 epic music will be going on
Android do you think this will help
Apple take away Spotify and also if
Apple does something like this with
Android what do you think will be the
next Apple doing something on the
Android side excellent question um I
don't know I this is we had heard rumors
that Apple music was gonna go on Android
and I was kind of iffy on it because
Apple really hasn't done anything with
Android right this is going to give
Apple a world of information and it's
going to give them data and statistics
and all sorts of stuff this was actually
a really brilliant move and I think this
was the service to do it with after this
who knows they could open it up to any
number of things but I honestly I almost
be this somewhat as a Trojan horse hmm
see I see it a little differently but I
definitely see that take I see it as
like you know itunes has always been
available
on PCs and this is just sort of the
extension of that bringing music to
everybody still and they have the
foundation because beats music was
available for Android so they're like
okay you know let's reframe this whole
thing it's Apple music and that'll hit
in it too because it's already built and
then we get the pc users that are on
android on to apple music as an option
but again they have spotify they have
google play music they have our do they
have you know there's a dozen services
so i think we were just talking about on
the iphone and the ipad and people like
you know our parents they're like oh
what's this unlimited music thing i want
to try that you know i think that's
going to happen more from ipads and
iphones vs android you know because i
don't think an android persons can be
like what's this because it's not going
to come pre-loaded yeah but no i agree
what would you like to you inside and
actually where did that question go
there there was a great question about
being pre-loaded and moved on me I that
is the one thing i hate about hangouts
questions is that they move around o
blessed you ah there it is from brazen
Franco about Apple music which breezin I
I'm impressed you're able to actually
put the little apple icon in there about
Apple music being pre-installed isn't
this antitrust material just like how
Microsoft was sued for having internet
explorer pre-installed that crossed my
mind to i'm really really curious about
how they're getting around that i am by
no means an antitrust expert I know next
to nothing but i will say i agree with
you this does feel a whole lot like the
whole microsoft internet explorer
situation so how is Apple getting around
that let's good question and what is it
the attorneys general in Connecticut in
New York than your time said today are
investigating apple for antitrust with
Apple music because I don't think it's
for this but because there were reports
that it was sort of strong-arming its
way into the industry may be trying to
stop you know Spotify from offering the
free alternatives Pandora
ad-supported alternatives but then
Universal Music Group in that in that
report wrote back to the New York State
Attorney General said like no such
agreements are in placing there's no
like strong-arming we haven't talked to
sony music we haven't talked to warner
music and that's not going on but you
know Apple did do this actually at least
a judge ruled so with the ebooks case
back in 2013 where it was sort of price
fixing the cost of e-books so not
unheard of and a trust could be coming
is a concern to at least you know some
people out there but i don't know if
it's about preinstalled versus you know
just yeah oh no it's going to be really
interesting i am sure that Apple has a
squad of lawyers mockery night and I
wonder how different the situation is to
you I mean back then you did have max
and you did have windows and it was sort
of this Microsoft Windows thing and
today you have android though which
globally is larger than iOS and you have
to buy an apple product for iOS as
opposed to back then you aren't buying a
Microsoft product for Windows you're
buying you know windows just came on
these other so I don't there might be
differences there once again way above
my pay grade yeah its way about my
bedroom idea also from brazen Frankel
will you cover the pair's game weekend
autumn as far as I know we're not going
to have any one there in person but we
will of course cover it remotely from a
key cater I think I hope my apologies if
I got your name wrong do you think the
iPad will start selling more after the
iOS 9 update not really I think the
whole problem is that every iPad that
was capable of running iOS 8 is going to
be capable of running iOS 9 so there's
not going to be like a massive need to
upgrade I think it's going to be a
matter of apples God do something with
the iPad physically to make it a must
buy once again
right like if it's if there's an iPad
pro because the multitasking screen
splitting is only available for the iPad
air 2 and then presumably the ipad air
three so that's two and then presumably
the ipad pro so there's three products
right so maybe it'll convince people to
buy the pro but the ipad air 2 and ipad
air through your product i mean if it's
the same functionality you're not going
to move from the ipad air 2 to the 3
very interesting question from
Christopher miles guys you're you're
asking some awesome questions today you
always do but today you're on fire from
Christopher miles do you guys think
apple is relying a bit too heavily on
developers to build the narrative of the
Apple watch with their other products
they've had more of a cohesive vision
with this it's quote this is a watch
first debs do something with it unquote
yeah I think so yeah because if you look
at the basic functionality they give you
it's you know Siri the time the weather
your help tracking but none of the help
tracking was open the sensors weren't
open to developers and I would argue
there's no like killer must have app for
the Apple watch yet so they're probably
waiting for someone to come along and
make something it does you know this is
like oh here's why you need one yeah not
that that's a very very interesting
question because so much of what is
going on with the Apple watch is not
from Apple itself it's a lot about what
developers can do with it the very
astute question Christopher moving on
did you do we've got so many questions
here of again from Christopher miles are
you guys excited for fallout 4 you know
I was talking to Joey about that the
other day when it was announced I I
admit I have not played fallout 1
through 3 that means that for looks
interesting but I don't know anything
about the narrative with you Yeah right
the two games I'm playing right now or
Witcher 3 and I just started yesterday
elder scrolls online she's uh we good so
far I'm still just playing a
lauda destiny I don't know why they I
don't know why that game clucked with me
so much from shauna man 34 why hasn't he
be hired a summer intern lately funny
you should ask that a new summer intern
named Niven who will be doing lots of
things out in the irvine office rose
this summer yeah I funny side note John
asked me maybe a month or two ago when
we were going through a really busy
period in he goes do you think you would
benefit from an intern and unfortunately
a lot of what I do there's absolutely no
way an intern could help me they
couldn't take the conference calls they
you know I wouldn't want them scheduling
the post or proof reading them or
whatever you know just like there'd be a
college kid or a high school kid sitting
across my office for me just staring at
me you know for eight hours a day
waiting for me to tell them something to
do it that wouldn't be even the most
remotely unnerving but yes we do
actually have a summer intern this your
name Nibin and I'm sure you'll see him
pop up somewhere sometime in a video or
something I met him I was out there I I
am NOT a mad at me I'm just not a video
internees not on camera yeah he's just a
strict office intern helping us out with
numerous things i'll meet him in a
couple weeks when i go out there for a
comic con uh from Aqib cater again hope
I'm saying your name correctly i do you
think apple should make a VR headset oh
why not everybody else is yeah right I
didn't tell you Todd I'm releasing a VR
headset nice yeah to be out of her gourd
yeah sure why not I'm just like well
ocular who's gonna reveal their final
design today in like 20 minutes right
yeah i believe so so will will will see
how much it costs that's that's going to
be the the big deciding factor for me I
honestly I don't see myself getting into
VR but yeah we'll see ya games that are
like witcher 3 where you can explore a
huge world like that with vlr roof I'm
all over it take a lot from Sean the man
34 how many apple keynotes do you think
we'll we will see the
your left well Kurtz will have the
iphone one will have the ipad one I
think it's just going to be two more
yeah unless a sneak an apple TV one in
there somewhere but probably just those
2i I just don't see them giving Apple TV
its own yeah event I I think they're
gonna stick it in in October with ipad
is that strict guess folks course i also
thought we were going to see it this
week but yeah lot of people did for
Malcolm rains do you use a tablet and if
so what operating system and why well
unfortunately Malcolm word the wrong
people to ask because we both use
multiple tablets and we have multiple
operating systems I've had median Nexus
9 ipad error in nexus 9 so yeah Todd and
I unfortunately are unfortunately
unfortunately are in this situation
where we kind need to have access to
both operating systems so we have both
devices on hand so yep but I'm a huge
tablet user I love using a tablet see
I'm not I was actually talking about
that yesterday I don't use my much just
at night like if I'm browsing the way
before bed or something yeah brazen
Franco algorithm or what power itunes
genius just saying exactly what power is
like everything you know is operating
systems there are algorithms everywhere
uh whatever but what can you do from
such and behold do you think we'll see
the apple TV a new version of the
set-top box at Apple's October event
also has ipad makes another price of it
yes i do think that's where it's going
to be I cannot see them going through
another holiday season without
refreshing it I just can't see that even
if it's just like like a new processor
they're not even ready just like refresh
I don't know yeah yeah I just know from
brazen Franco when is the Tokyo Game
station I bet you're actually
asking about Tokyo Game Show and if so
that is in September and ron duwell who
lives in japan will be attending so we
will have live coverage from that show
from such a mahal hey Sean how's the
Nvidia shield TV box is it worth it and
how does it compare to the roku or Apple
TV or some other Android TV devices I
will have a full review coming probably
within a week I would say of the Nvidia
shield TV it's not going to be
overwhelmingly positive oh I will say
this the hardware itself is gorgeous I
have a lot of issues with Android TV
software that's the bigger problem and
so I I'm kind of walking this fine line
and my thoughts about what is invidious
issue what is Android TVs lack of
features yeah yeah so I hundred channels
or I didn't they say that that such
stuff that's bogus as there's no 600
channels I'm sorry from such a Mahal
what do you want to see in the next
Apple TV set-top box more channels more
channels having nabin a cord cutter I
mean I hardly ever use anything other
than my Roku simply because it offers
the most channels and the apple TV just
oh and also for the love of everything a
better remote yeah well I think we've
seen finatus you just that's coming
right or at least reports I was terrible
there's an apple TV remote somewhere on
this desk I don't know where other it is
good this is the single worst remote
ever built I'm sorry it really is it is
horrible it does not fit in your hand
the quick wheel technology I don't know
I hate this remote is horrifically bad
blah
you know Barry I want to see Syrian I
think series gonna be in the next
version I really do although I was
surprised they didn't really talk about
Syrian uh in El Capitan at all which
ones like seems like an obvious feature
especially with Cortana in Windows 10
from brazen Franco Sean make your VR
headset out of tin foil and give it with
a complimentary tin foil hat done well
