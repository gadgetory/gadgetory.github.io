hey guys john here want to give you guys
a demo of spaces sorry if you can hear
some water going it's raining outside
that probably sounds like i'm taking a
leak or something but I'm not just the
rain Sadie wait guys faces comes with
every version of leopard or is the only
version of leopard any leopard computer
has spaces essentially what it is or
what it is is separate desktops me give
you guys an example let's say I've got
Firefox open and i also have say ical
with them and i need some more room or
i'm editing a video on youtube when I
want some my own space I'll do is I'll
hit the control key and one of the
arrows left to right and you can see the
little box right there I have four
separate spaces I can set that to be as
many spaces at want i'll show you the
settings in a minute so this box right
here is a desktop that i'm on i can move
to a fresh one open up something
brand-new i can open up calculate now
I've got calculate around this desktop
here and as you guys see you can easily
move around between desktops it's
actually very cool space isn't a feature
that I use that often but the times I
have needed to use it it definitely
comes in handy under system preferences
here you have an option for four spaces
make sure you guys here expose an expose
and spaces got spaces and you can enable
how many rows or columns that you want
here you can show spaces in your menu
bar or not and you can set how to
activate it really any way you want I've
got mine set for the control key but you
guys can do whatever you like so this is
just a real quick demonstration for you
guys of spaces I hope you enjoyed it I
know there's something similar for
windows and for linux but this is just a
mac version built in a nice
clean tight package and just works great
like Moses legs Apple it just work
anyway guys hope you enjoyed don't
forget to check out the website wwg on

good one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
