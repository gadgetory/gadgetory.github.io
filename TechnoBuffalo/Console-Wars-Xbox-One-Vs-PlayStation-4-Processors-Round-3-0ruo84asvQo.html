different architecture can be a daunting
task now this was the case for the last
generation luckily this is not the case
for the new generation of consoles in
this episode we'll be taking an in-depth
look at the CPUs GPUs and RAM of the ps4
and Xbox one its LP from TechnoBuffalo
welcoming you back to the next
installment of the console wars if I
were to have made this comparison back
in the good old days the round would
have lasted probably two minutes now 25
years later things have gotten a bit
more complex so I'm just going to cut to
the chase both Sony and Microsoft have
opted for AMD's custom APU solution that
combines a CPU and GPU onto a single
chip now this has its advantages an APU
makes more efficient for the two chips
to work in unison this consumes less
power and the physical benefits are of
course that the surface area of the
single chip is much more manageable in
terms of cooling both a fuse holds the
custom low-power AMD Jaguar CPU it has
two quad core modules that are designed
around the x86 architecture coming from
PCs dating back over 30 years the ps4
hosts a 1.6 gigahertz processor and the
Xbox one hosts a 1.75 gigahertz Jaguar
CPU and in case you're wondering what
x86 really means well the x86
instruction set is basically the main
interface between the programming
language and the hardware x86 has been
the most common instruction set used by
both Intel and AMD since the very
beginning of modern pcs so it should be
very familiar to pretty much everyone in
the business of programming games now
this was not the case for the ps3 cell
processor which was more than just a
simple pain-in-the-ass to develop for
the PowerPC solution on the Xbox 360 was
better in this regard
but it was also not the most ideal
solution in terms of development across
multiple platforms and thank goodness
both companies have now realized the
importance of making game development as
convenient and is affordable as possible
I think it's very unlikely that Sony and
Microsoft made a deal behind closed
doors to unify the key architecture so
I'd actually give credit here to AMD who
is most likely presented both companies
with an offer they could not refuse and
this is to the benefit of the entire
industry so much obliged AMD and good
thing that Nvidia wasn't a sore loser in
any case the Xbox one's more robust
cooling solution enables a slightly
higher clock speed so the green teams
has a 10% advantage here there's still
debate on how many CPU cores are
actually devoted to gaming performance
on both systems but most likely these
differences aren't substantial enough to
give significant advantages to either
console as modern games are less CPU
bound and more GPU intensive and this is
exactly why the majority of the chip
real estate is devoted to the graphics
processing unit on bold ap use the GPUs
in bold consoles are based on AMD's GCN
a graphics core next architecture this
is essentially the same architecture as
in AMD's HT 7000 and its new r9 series
of graphics cards and it's actually the
same architecture as used in my own 7970
gigahertz edition graphics card at its
prime so about two weeks ago this was a
400 bucks graphics card so in addition
to the semi high end GPU my gaming rig
features about a grand and a half of
other components so ps4 can be a rocket
scientist or the murmurs off the Xbox
these will always be a step ahead
georgians disk drive because you can't
afford less amount of money into it but
don't get me wrong the formants
optimization is where the consoles can
really stand out against PC where the
potential of even high-end graphics
cards go often under used coding
directly the specific set of hardware
enables developers to crunch out every
little bit of juice and this is why
console games can look at
gorgeous and in many cases even get
close to the visual fidelity of high-end
graphics cards beautiful graphics are
just so much more than high resolution
graphics and textures multisample
anti-aliasing and above 60 framerate I'd
actually go out to say that design and
art makes up for about half of the
visual experience and in some cases even
more that being said I do expect a
significant leap in graphical prowess
with every generation of hardware so I'm
a bit surprised at how many yresolution
doesn't matter articles there are out
there because in an age where 40 inch
televisions are considered as small
resolution simply matters 720p on a 65
inch screen at an average viewing
distance things start to get fugly
pretty fast at these TV sizes there's a
significant difference between 720p and
1080p and this is true whether or not
you believe in it I got a bit
sidetracked there but in any case both
GPUs embedded on the dies of the
consoles are of the same AMD
architecture but there are some
significant differences Microsoft
elected to implement 12 GCN cores
resulting in a total of 768 stream
processors while Sony went with a total
of 8 team GC and cores and that adds up
to 11 hundred and 52 stream processors
and this equals to 50% more stream
processors on the ps4 and what our
stream processes you ask well stream
processors in the GPU handled most of
the traditional graphics rendering tasks
but they can also be harnessed for more
general-purpose number crunching and one
good example of this are particle
effects which seem to be making a
comeback this generation the GC and
cores are capable of doing a lot of the
tasks that were traditionally assigned
to the central processing unit and they
can actually do a lot better job at it
we've already seen games like resogun
and infamous second son use very
elaborate particle systems and metal
gear ground zeroes has a spectacular
simulated weather system this is
actually done mostly by the GPU as the
architecture allows for general-purpose
computing which modern GPUs can actually
do better than traditional CPUs with the
GPU and eight core CPU working together
we can expect some
spectacular stuff to come we'll see much
more advantage taken of these features
as we progress in the consul's life
cycles in addition to 64 stream
processors each GC and core host for
texture mapping units as the PlayStation
4 has 50% more GC and cores it also has
the same advantage in texture mapping
units which are responsible for
addressing and filtering the textures
that you see on the screen the more
texture mapping units you have the
faster the GPU will be at processing
texture info while the Xbox one may have
the better clock rate on the GPU the ps4
has 50% more GCN cores which may result
in a lot more leeway when it comes to
graphics rendering and even some more
general-purpose computing tasks but
where does all this power come from
let's take a closer look at what powers
these consoles zoom in please a little
bit more
yes it's had and what about the Xbox one
right in any case ROPS or raster
operations pipelines are also key to
visuals Rob's help with implementing
anti-aliasing that smooths out the
jaggies and Astro filtering that
enhances the textures and z-buffer that
calculates depth effects etc this is
essentially the part of the GPU that
makes the finishing touches to the
graphics so having half the amount of
roughs isn't doing the Xbox one any
favors the PlayStation 4 has eight ace
units or asynchronous compute engines
while the Xbox one only has two
asynchronous compute engine service
command processors for compute
operations on the GC and cores in
essence they manage the workflow and
resource allocation of the various tasks
making it more efficient for the gcn
cores to do several tasks at the same
time as time goes by developers may
learn new techniques to capitalize on
these ace units subsequently reducing
the GPUs workload on a sidenote the ps4
actually shares the same amount of ACE
units as the super high-end r9 290x AMD
graphics card but the power the CPU and
GPU are nothing without the memory
interface and one of the biggest
complaints from developers about last
gen Hardware was the memory or simply
the lack thereof high definition
graphics require a crapload of textures
and all kinds of content simultaneously
on the screen for each individual frame
so you can imagine how tricky it has
been to fit even 720p worth of textures
for every frame of content with less
than 512 megabytes of RAM for this
generation the message is clear from
both Sony and Microsoft you asked for it
so here it is
developers no longer need to waste time
in conceiving clever ways of streaming
textures from virtual memory they can
just throw an enormous amount of
textures and other attributes in huge
pools of memory so when it comes to
graphics I'm pretty sure that the amount
of memory will not be the bottleneck of
this generation 8 gigabytes is more than
enough both systems have a unified
memory architecture with the same memory
being allocated for graphics and various
other tasks
Microsoft went with a more conservative
and affordable alternative of ddr3 and
Sony splurged on some more expensive but
faster gddr5 the differences between the
two are that ddr3 is considered as more
general-purpose memory and gddr5 is
mainly designed for graphics use both
types of memory have their benefits
gddr5 is significantly faster allowing
for whopping memory bandwidth but ddr3
has a lower latency which allows a bit
faster access to compensate for the
lower bandwidth of ddr3 the Xbox one
uses 32 megabytes of a super-fast es RAM
which is embedded on the same die with a
CPU and GPU for almost immediate access
the es Ram is specifically reserved for
tasks that require a very high bandwidth
developers are also able to access both
memory pool simultaneously which can
make it possible for more overlapping
graphical effects while the 32 megabytes
may seem a bit small for this day and
age developers can map an unmapped
content on the superfast virtual memory
with amazing speed and super low latency
which can enable all kinds of graphical
eye candy like z-buffer and shadow maps
effects for example project cars will
use the es RAM for deferred rendering so
we can expect to see developers better
taking advantage of the esram going
forward despite the undoubtedly
interesting potential of esram many
developers have stated to prefer the
sustain speed of GTA 5 over esram simply
for the fact that gddr5 is almost as
fast and there is essentially no limit
to how much you can use and it's just
that much more straightforward to code
for there's a misconception however
going about that es Ram is bottlenecking
the Xbox one from outputting 1080p it
simply is the case because 32 megabytes
of high bandwidth es Ram is more than
sufficient for 1080p frame buffer it's
more likely that the es Ram is
indirectly limiting the performance by
taking up space on the APU die from
elements that actually crunch out the
numbers to push out the pixels
I think many would agree that this real
estate could have been better served
with poor GCN chorus for example
clockspeed teraflop accounts Rob's Asus
memory bandwidth is all this textbook
jargon translate into practice quite
consistently throughout every
multi-platform game released a date
there seems to be a slight pattern
emerging Xbox one iterations of games
are running at lower resolutions Metal
Gear Solid Ground zeroes Call of Duty
ghosts Final Fantasy 14 tomb raider
trials fusion and list goes on all run
at 1080p on the ps4 and not so much on
the Xbox one the tech spec advantage is
on paper and the math is adding up to
sum things up both systems have done a
good job in making things as accessible
as possible for developers eight gigs of
RAM is more than enough to enable
developers to slap all the textures and
all the content that is needed
1080p renderings of graphics the Xbox
one has the GPU and CPU running at a
higher clock rate but no matter how you
look at the amounts of stream processors
ultimately determine how many pixels the
chips are crunching out and a ps4 has a
significant advantage in this respect
the advantage in stream processors is
also consistent with the power
consumption tests we've made in episode
2 ps4 is more power hungry and this is
very much thanks to the gcn cores eating
up those watts and the math is
consistently adding up as well
Sonne gamble been implementing the more
expensive gdr 5 which Microsoft stated
to be not great for developers but
looking at how games perform and how
much textures developers have already
managed to slap into games like infamous
second son and even launch game Killzone
Shadowfall not to mention the praise
that the ps4 has been getting from devs
it's safe to say that Sony's gamble has
already paid off I am actually a bit
surprised at how technically
accomplished the games were even at the
earlier stages of this product cycle
this is something that I definitely
could not say during the last generation
while the Xbox one is by no means a
slouch the ps4 has a 50% advantage in
stream processors double the amount or
ops four times the ACE units faster
unified memory and added bandwidth paths
from CPU direct to the GPU and memory at
this particular time in space it's hard
to argue to the hardware and it's
impossible to argue with a map
these reasons playstation 4 takes round
three with a clear market in the next
round will be answering the question
with the is Mario and we'll be
taking a look at Nintendo State in the
console stay tuned for the next
installment of the console games
by the way I believe in the winners and
losers and especially the freedom to
