TechnoBuffalo here with an unboxing that
I'm really excited about this is the
Amazon Kindle Fire it marks new
territory for Amazon as they stay away
from the traditional iing displays and
moving to more traditional tablets
that's what this guy is it's got a
backlit panel a ton of media options to
go ahead and rip open its cardboard
housing and see if it can catch fire
Kindle your interest some other bedroom
all right so the Kindle Fire comes in
traditional Amazon Kindle boxes just a
little bit bigger so that cardboard very
green friendly go ahead and pull a tab
the tab has been pulled let's go ahead
and see we got and there is the Amazon
Kindle Fire sitting right on top on the
top portion here it's like we've got
some sort of information guide getting
to know your Kindle well I'll get to
know my Kindle right now hello Kindle my
name is John so here is the Amazon
Kindle Fire we'll take a look at that in
just a second push that off to the side
we're going to get not much else in the
box here is power and looks like it's
being fully powered by microUSB so
that's always nice no proprietary
adapters there and I think that that's
pretty much it nothing else in the box
let me get a cord for syncing that is it
art so throw that off here is the Kindle
Fire it's go ahead and kill off plastic
just try to fam classic is off do my
Emeril let him slide this out here well
this does feel incredibly like the
BlackBerry PlayBook alright so push that
down go ahead and try and power it on I
didn't find a power button well it lives
on the bottom ha and I will run through
the specs of this guy hopefully he's got
enough charge Julie show you something
there we go you can see the little fire
starts to pop up there alright so let me
run through what you can expect when you
pick up your Kindle Fire which is
coincidentally enough available today so
it's going to be priced at 199 dollars
so a really affordable price point for
those that are looking to get into the
tablet market it's running a completely
customized version of Android 2.3 but
they sort of forked away that's my fort
away from Amazon and they're not using
some of the native Amazon apps that you
are the native Google apps that you
might see on traditional honeycomb
tablets you're not gonna have androids
native app store instead you're going to
have the Android app store which as
somewhere in the realm of
thousand apps right now so developers
have to code for Amazon's ecosystem and
Google you're not gonna get the native
Google Apps like Gmail in here as well
but allegedly there are third-party
support to get your email on here
hopefully but we'll check that out from
a dimension standpoint 7.5 inches by 4.7
inches by 0.45 inches and if you want to
know what this thing feels like in the
hand and you haven't had a chance to go
see one if you've held the BlackBerry
PlayBook they are almost identical
allegedly rim used the reference design
for the BlackBerry PlayBook it weighs
fourteen point six ounces so it's a very
light tablet on the back you got sort of
soft touch feel it says Kindle and blaze
in there no camera present here on this
guy as well as you can obviously see so
go ahead and unlock that again slide to
unlock this and we'll go sort it to the
home screen it's got a seven inch
multi-touch display with IPS technology
with a resolution of 1024 by 600 and for
those of you math folks that's 169 PPI
Kindles are known for their ridiculously
long battery life this guy is going to
give you eight hours of a continuous
reading or seven and a half hours video
what the wireless turned off it's being
powered by a one gigahertz dual-core
chip it's got 512 megabytes of RAM only
eight gig of storage and you're not
gonna find no matter how hard you look a
microSD card slot here no camera it's
Wi-Fi only and don't have any sort of
three genus in here it's got Amazon silk
browser which does some server-side
rendering for supposedly faster browsing
you've got a free month of Amazon Prime
in here so I'm gonna go ahead and log in
and I'll take you through the operating
system a little bit alright so after
some software updates looks like we're
finally rebooting here let me walk you
through the device and give you a bit of
a tour so you've got that now familiar
bezel list display here that sort of
hides the screen when it's turned off
and again it's an IPS display at the
resolution of 1024 by 600 seven inches
on the left hand side of advice we've
got nothing on the right hand side we've
got nothing on the top we've got two
speakers on the bottom there is your
power button your charging port and 3.5
millimeter headset
and that's about it so let's do a real
quick size comparison about the Kindle
Fire with let's say the current
generation Kindle I can definitely see
the difference there obviously this is e
ink this uses the IPS backlit display go
and stack these two you can certainly
see there's a Fitness difference it's a
whole Kindle family here and if we bring
in something like the iPad 2 for example
I'll stack these guys on top of each
other you can see the screen difference
here as well and the thickness between
these two so I'm going to keep in mind
at this price point you have to be
reasonable with your expectations at
$200 you're not going to get the specs
of a $400 or $500 but like the iPad 2 or
a lot of the honeycomb tablets out there
what you're gonna get is reasonable
specifications you're gonna get a
dual-core chip and 512 megabytes of RAM
but the real sort of Trojan horse here
is that you're getting access to
Amazon's ecosystem so you're gonna have
access to all the prime videos and
that's Amazon Prime enough prime isn't
like awesome or Optimus you're also
gonna get access to their incredible
library of books magazines there's a
comics application in here which is
supposed to be pretty impressive and
you're getting a web browser with access
to the Amazon App Store as well so it's
an entry level tablet certainly but it's
priced very competitively you're gonna
lose out on some storage with only eight
gigs but you've got cloud storage
options here as well so very curious to
play around with the device see how it
works of course we'll be doing a ton of
hands-on demonstrations at TechnoBuffalo
so be sure to check us out for all of
your kindle fire news fact it probably
seeing most of it later on
today so if you keep checking back the
site you will be seeing a lot of Kindle
Fire coverage I'm John Rhett enger' from
TechnoBuffalo I'm going to take a look
at this new tablet I'll come back with
some more coverage I'll see you guys
next video bye bye
