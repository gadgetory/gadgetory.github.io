in the past I've done viewer mail bags
where I answer questions from YouTube
but I also get a lot of questions in the
comments and questions via Twitter and
Twitter is a great way to ask kind of
some short questions like provide you
some short answers but unfortunately I
can't get into the amount of detail that
I would like some of the questions
really involve more than 140 characters
that Twitter allows so I'm going to
start a new segment where I enter your
total questions on camera a little more
in depth so let's get started first
question comes from Matt something and
he says John for lakers how did you get
your start on the internet well Matt
member else is interested really it kind
of happened by accident I've always had
a love for technology ever since I was
little I've always been saving up all
the money I could to buy some sort of
tech that I liked or thought I wanted or
buy something to give as a gift to other
people Tech has always played a really
big part of my life something that I've
always enjoyed so about two years ago I
was looking to switch from a pc to a mac
and i started searching around the
internet for questions and comments
people have had about switch from pc to
mac and while i was looking on YouTube
there are a few Mac reviews and a few
opinions on the house which one but
there weren't that many at the time I
don't know anything about no it's 10 or
how it worked so I thought that if I
made you tube videos kind of detailing
my transition from pc to mac that would
help me not only learn a new operating
system but also learn my new computer
and that's really how I got started I
didn't really plan on making a career of
it at the time I didn't think anybody
was even going to pay attention and it
really just grew from there I made a few
videos and I started out with space them
out and I get some questions from
commenters and a few subscribers and I
just kind of kept entering from there it
really happened very organically and
it's one of the things in life that
actually I'm very proud of is how much
it grew and how it sort of became a
community so the next question that we
have is from itouch PSP john for lakers
how did you come up with the name John
for lakers you're a fan and since
when what's kind of ties back into the
how did you get started on YouTube thing
I made the name John for lakers long
before I started making videos it was
just to comment on other people's videos
and if I at the time had any inkling
that I was going to be making videos I
would have picked a way better name than
John for lakers that was an old instant
messaging name that i had i think when i
was in high school i've been a fan the
laker since i was a little kid and my
dad took me when I was young and I've
always been a sports fan and lakers were
always my team of choice so that's how I
came up with the name and if I thought
about it longer probably should have
picked something a little bit better the
next question comes from clueless Dylan
at John for lakers who is your biggest
hero now this is probably going to sound
a little bit cheesy but my biggest hero
in the world out of everybody is my
father my father really is a guy that I
look up to someone I admire he's worked
so hard as whole life to provide for a
family and really never asked anything
for himself would never complain after
getting up at five in the morning not
coming home until seven eight sometimes
even nine o'clock at night would never
complain what always offer to help cook
dinner offer to clean up the dishes if
my mom made dinner we're just always
there for me he always found time to
help me with my schoolwork to help my
sisters with whatever they needed I
always put his family first it really
just was a very giving guy he is a very
even guy and I feel really blessed I'm
lucky to have a father like him so my
father is definitely my my hero I know
it's a little bit cheesy but it's it's
true so my next question that we have is
from Enrique jr. John for lakers why do
you tweet I thought this one tied it
nicely with a Twitter question video oh
the reason I tweets after there are a
few reasons the first to let people know
when there is a new video up or a new
posts I'm interested in it's too kind of
a weight immediately blast it out to the
audience and if there's something
pertinent topical going on its way to
spark a discussion about it it's also a
great way to interact with the audience
you know there's I have fewer Twitter
followers than I do when
tube and it's hard to answer every
YouTube email but the tweets that come
in general I try to respond to people
took the time to type it then get a five
god of two minutes it's you know only
fair to try and respond if I can don't
different way to interact and like I'm
doing right now answer questions that
people have it's also a cool way to
share life experiences you know what's
going on sometimes tweets are silly like
hey at seven-thirty i got a late start
of the day like i did this morning or
just stop term your salvation pretty
good special effects you know just a fun
way to share what's going on in my life
and hear what's going on in your life so
next question uber freak at Jonah for
lakers which wireless carrier do you
think is the best overall coverage
devices and customer service so there
are kind of three questions there the
carrier of choice for me and the care
that I had long before the iphone was
one is singular and AT&amp;amp;T i love having a
gsm base server is not being able to
take out it's in part pop it into a new
phone or pick up an unlocked phone and
try it ever since before i started doing
tech reviews you know i always like to
borrow friends phones and play with them
and see what they thought make my own
opinions on new devices so i've always
loved a gsm carrier and my family had
eighteen t so it's kind of how I came to
it and I've been very happy with it I
think for me coverage has been fantastic
I am blanketed in 3g wherever i go i
think the download and even upload
speeds are relatively quick i think
customer service when i called them has
been absolutely fantastic and i've been
relatively happy with AT&amp;amp;T i think that
they're certainly one of the best
carriers out there and they're one of
the biggest for a reason you know i've
also tried verizon i think their voice
services is fantastic i have not tried
sprints I've tried a tmobile I think
that their services are very good and I
think the customer service is also you
know some of the best out there but the
perfect kind of combination of all three
for me at least has been a cutie
certainly coverage is going to vary
braddon maybe t-mobile's best for you or
bryden's best for you but for me at
least it's been 80 so the next question
comes from Jody trick add john for
lakers well I guess it's an obvious
question how do you feel about the zune
hg you think it has any chance against
the touch well the zoo microphone HD was
announced yesterday by microsoft's and
it's an o LED capacitive touchscreen
it's not really no better right now it's
capable of showing high-res video but
not on the device itself you can't get
to a TV it can show high-res video we
don't know much about it's actually
going to have thorough Xbox integration
if it's going to play games does have
multitouch one thing I will say is a
knock-on it's running a modified version
of internet explorer not letting a
webkit-based browser like is found on
the iphone for example so browsing
experience I do not expect to be that
good certainly the one thing the ipod
touch and iphone have going for it is a
relatively mature App Store and if
Microsoft's can mobilize some sort of
App Store I think it has a chance to
compete mostly with those that have a
thing against apple or really like their
pcs Apple is gaining market share though
and let the zune HD introduces software
that's compatible with macs I don't
think they're gonna have much of a
chance of passing the ipod touch in
terms of success since active actually
crosses platforms to pc and mac
certainly the mac demographic is growing
at people who think they may switch in
the future might not jump to the zoom
also the zune brands I've been drug
through the dirt with kind of some bad
marketing some bad advertising and
really something negative word-of-mouth
whether that's justified or not and I'll
let you decide but people aren't really
running to the zoom name so I think it
has a chance probably one of the best
chances of any of the ipod touch killers
but i don't think it's going to be
throwing it anytime soon next question
that is actually be the last question
was from mr. Jody trick so guys I hope
you found this useful and i hope you
liked having some kind of questions
