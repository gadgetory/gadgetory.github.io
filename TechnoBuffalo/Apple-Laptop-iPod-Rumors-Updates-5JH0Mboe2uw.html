for lakers calm and I wanted to give you
guys my opinion on the new Apple product
visions that are coming I get this
question a lot in emails what do you
think is coming should I which I not
wait I don't have any insider
information but i can see industry
trends and analyze them a bit i'm going
to share with you guys my opinions on
what I think is coming from Apple in the
next I'd say within three weeks first I
think that the macbook line is going to
get revives to have an all aluminum
casing in a much thinner form factor
with the rounded edges similar to the
macbook air still going to keep the slot
loading drive I think all the port
you're going to say the same thing
you're going to see a increase in speed
processor speed increase in hard drive
capacity other than that they're gonna
be that many changes I think it's mostly
going to be a design change with some
minor process bumps but with a minor
process bumps and design changes its
going to get closer to the macbook pro I
think this is where the big changes are
going to come and how Apple is going to
distinguish the macbook from the macbook
pro so I think the macbook pro is going
to keep its aluminum casing I'll get the
rounded edges that the macbook air has
think they're also going to add hdmi to
the macbook pro and you're also going to
add slaw blowing blu-ray drives I would
say that is a certainty and that's
really one of the only few ways they
have left to differentiate the pro line
from a consumer macbook line rumors have
been circulating about glass trackpad in
the macbooks I think if those do show up
they're more likely to show up in the
macbook pro and able to use those for
what I would soon be more multi touch
capabilities similar to the screen on an
iPhone I wouldn't bet on those though
the big changes that I would assume are
coming for the macbook pro again with
the hdmi outputs perhaps given wireless
USB and small building blu-ray drives
but also to expect all notebooks all
three notebooks the macbook air the
macbook pro and the macbook all have
civic
price drops as well I'll expect an
entry-level macbook to start at nine
ninety-nine I'd also expect the macbook
air to get an increase in processor
speed as well as hard drive I think
that's a foregone conclusion is about to
happen this revision I would not expect
any additional ports I think that may
come at macworld in January other than
that guys are just my takes on the apple
notebooks and what I think is going to
be happening the next few weeks on the
ipod fronts I think it's a foregone
conclusion that the ipod nano was
getting revised gone will be the short
fat version of today and what will have
an elongated version with a wide screen
similar to what the zooming looks like
actually be more rectangle shaped with a
wider screen I think we'll see slimmer
iPod Touches at a lower price points and
I think we'll see increased capacity in
the ipod classic we're not in physic the
classic changing that much because it's
classic so price drops all around in the
ipods and the macbook lines I don't
think the desktops are going to change
maybe speed bumps but i don't think that
the imac the mac pro or even the Mac
Mini is going to change the next couple
months so if you're thinking about
buying a computer waiting to the end of
sep tember at least to see what's out
anyway guys just my just might take an
opinion so what I think is going to
happen again no insider information just
just what I think so this is jon
rettinger with john for lakers calm and
