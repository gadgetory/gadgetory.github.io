from TechnoBuffalo here is an unboxing
for you of the Samsung continuum for
Verizon Wireless it is a continuum ation
of the Galaxy S series of devices you
can permeate all US carriers this guy
brings something unique to the table let
me show you what it is so with all
unboxings let's take a quick look at the
box you have a picture of the device on
the front and below is what sort of
unique about this it's got a ticker
which is a Super AMOLED display it's
going to show you some snapshots of
information we'll talk about that in a
few minutes here's the device you've got
some hearing aid compatibility
information on the Left rule the air on
the right and some package content
listings on the back go ahead and dig in
here is the Samsung continuum push it
off to the side for just one second and
see what else we are going to have
inside of the box so we've got its 1500
milliamp hour battery which is blue with
seen a blue Samsung battery yet we've
got the wall charger two USB ports we've
got a micro USB charging port and we've
got some tips and hints and shortcuts in
there if I can ever get it out go ahead
and let gravity do the work for us if
there's a lot of a user guide
information they're going to be inside
so if you fancy some reading I'm going
take a look at that all right so here is
the Samsung continuum and before anybody
starts screaming about the plastic on
here I'm going to go ahead and pull it
off but you can see that it shows
something a little bit unique on the
sides touch here so there's a ticker
display it's activated on the side so
I'll go ahead and show you that I'm
going to whoop this off and let me run
through the specs of this guy for you so
it's gonna set you back $199 on a
two-year contract of course on Verizon
Wireless it's got a 3.4 inch Super
AMOLED screen at the resolution of 480
by 800 now it might look like a much
bigger screen it actually has another
screen right below it which is all
so super amoled you can see it sort of
on the angle there there we go that is a
1.8 inch Super AMOLED screen the
resolution of 400 by 96 Super AMOLED
means that the touch screen technology
is actually integrated into the glass on
display it's gonna mean that you're
gonna translate it's gonna translate
directly rather to darker darks richer
colors and better visibility in direct
sunlight so we talked about the 1500
milliamp hour battery it's gonna get you
about seven hours of talktime
it's guys got android 2.1 on it it's got
Samsung's one gigahertz hummingbird
processor which is screaming fast and
has 336 megabytes of RAM which is a
little bit less than the 3/4 found in
its Galaxy S brother at the focus it's
got a 5 megapixel camera sitting on the
back with LED flash and autofocus that
can shoot video at 1280 by 720 which is
720p and it's got Wi-Fi and built-in
let's go ahead and pump in the battery
take a look at this ticker I'm kind of
excited to see what it looks like
so if you're looking at Verizon Wireless
and you're sort of debating between the
continuum or the fascinatin go ahead and
tell you the differences so here is the
fascinate for Verizon Wireless it's got
a four inch screen and it's one display
they both utilize that Super AMOLED
touchscreen technology however the
continuum here makes use of this ticker
display which I'll show you it's gonna
give you a bit of information it's also
where your capacitive buttons are gonna
live for the Android operating system so
if you want a more traditional phone
with a larger display the fascinates
going to be great options for you if
you're looking for something a little
bit different and a different way to
show your information and get quick view
of things maybe one tick with the
continuum but enough of me yeah bird
let's go ahead and power the guy on
alright so in goes the battery um push
the back back on and we'll hit power at
long last and see what this guy looks
like we're gonna have to go through a
bit of a Verizon activation period the
back of this is plastic similar what
we've seen on the other Galaxy S devices
most notably the fascinate go and hit
the power button and while that's
booting on I'll show you a bit of the
device so on the left hand side
gonna have volume up and down buttons
gonna have a micro USB charging port
gonna have a little bit of a lanyard
slot - if you want to carry it around
that way in the upper left on the right
hand side you're gonna have your micro
SD expansion card slot you don't remove
the battery to get to that which is
quite nice see if we can see what size
it's gonna come in here I can get my
thumb in there to push it out there we
go it's gonna come pre-installed with an
8 gigabyte micro sd card
quite nice go ahead and push that back
in or these attempt to I have long
enough nails to do that you've got a
hard button presumably for the camera
down there as well on the bottom you've
got your microphone port top you've got
three point five millimeter headset jack
and you've got the lock button now one
of the nice things I liked it's am some
did here is it got rid of that little
door that you have push back and forth
to get some micro USB charging port so
it looks like that powered on maybe we
don't have any sort of Verizon Wireless
activation period which is nice to get
it through and we've seen right here a
very familiar unlock screen and seen
this on touch woods phones in the past
but we do have to activate it
unfortunately but you can see the sort
of capacitive buttons that are showing
up there now right above this new touch
strip
let's see if this touch rip will show us
anything here so right now it's just
showing us a date go ahead and activate
the phone and I will come right back
alright so we've got the phone all
booted up and set up let me show you
this little landing strip across the
bottom like the Pamela Anderson the
phones here go ahead and there's a
capacitive buttons on the side to go
ahead and just push your fingers on the
side of them we can either turn it on or
turn it off so I'll turn it on you can
get some access some information I'm not
entirely sure what this is gonna show
yet since it's not fully configured look
like you can show some SMS RSS you can
show Twitter updates here so now it's
pulling in some RSS feeds they click on
it's gonna go ahead and open it up for
it's kind of a neat way to display
information although I'm not sure if
you're gonna inadvertently tap the
screen when you're trying to use the
capacitive buttons above it but we will
definitely see first impressions it does
have Bing Maps preload it looks like the
Google services for whatever reason are
not here see what the applications that
are gonna come pre-installed we got
or the touchwiz way of looking at things
so it is a 3G mobile hotspot cable which
is kind of nice
go ahead and keep scrolling see what
else we have there it looks like
blockbuster is there there's a Justin
mentioned Bing you know car cradle you
want to use Google Maps Navigation Gmail
gallery settings talk task manager
scramble kind of fun mini diary looks
like there's a Twitter client already
built in there's some Wi-Fi settings
right and go voice recorder and the rest
of the vcast bundled service see down
below I'm getting some RSS stuff popping
up on that little ticker which is kind
of neat so this is again running Android
2.1 I'll use this guy for for a little
while as I usually do and come back with
a full review and let you know if this
is going to be a worthwhile upgrade to
your current phone for just a very quick
size comparison in case you're wondering
how the display is gonna look again this
is a three point four inch display here
is a before inch samsung fascinate one
more time go ahead and see that it is
noticeably smaller go ahead and stack
them side-by-side about the same
thickness if you want to see sort of
continuing the Verizon tour here is the
Droid X for a size comparison 4.3 inch
phone versus the 3.4 so there's a big
difference there see how greasy my
fingers appear to be go ahead and make a
smart phone verizon sandwich and see
what those guys look like right there
anyway I am Jon Risinger from
TechnoBuffalo anything you want to see
about since on continuum leave it down
in the comments and I'll be sure to
address it in my review and following
videos I will see you guys in the next
video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
