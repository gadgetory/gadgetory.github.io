for technobuffalo and I'm at nokia world
and London with the Nokia Lumia 810 801
802 is going to take us through it okay
so this is the new model for lumia 800
first thing is like to point out is the
design which is a you all agree is
pretty nice new design a seamless em
unibody case we've got there they just
made I have one hundred percent
polycarbonate plastic and seems
something I talking elm street oh so
it's really durable and where as well as
well and the screen that we've got here
is a lot less greenwich family and you
can see the pages really jump out there
so it is unlovely lovely images that you
get on the form there
and a couple of key points I'd like to
follow Ahram the people up here and this
is where you can basically communicate
with everyone and that you need to
communicate with and the main feature
here is that we have all of our kites if
you are Facebook Twitter users of people
are these days and you can have them all
here under one and one roof so if we
just put a call the cancer this year we
showed you everything that is going on
with on within all of these guys so all
your Twitter or your facebook is in the
one place which is really really happy
and if we just poke along here this is
the most recent people that I've been in
touch with
this is actually think it's kind of
standard fondue and if I just click on
someone here give you an example within
this contact you have their mobile
number you can text them you can talk to
my facebook chat msn chat they have it
you can directly write on their Facebook
wall and you can email them it tells you
everything the company nopes apparently
everything you could possibly want it's
also back bottom which is a great great
feature and so mainly the people people
you can also meet groups within the
people and I have him a body's group
here which is this group here that's all
my main friends within that you can take
everyone within that group that you
printed send them all email switches
a nice feature also
what else do we have here we have nokia
drive which is a unique snuggie at the
moment and this is our satna
so you have em satellite navigation from
your phone I think it's one of the first
poems to to demonstrate that's really
really good you can just hear that your
destination is also in 3ds there's nice
little 3d images that come up there
we also power and internet explorer
which runs on ie9 which is possibly the
fastest running minute nokia music
so then nokia music we have a wonderful
wonderful thing called mix radio makes
radios and
you can work offline
you can basically download loads of
music we have 14 million tracks on our
database see if you want to click on pop
and it comes up with different different
things that you might want to look at
here and these are all preset playlist
and if you open up the playlist you can
start playing a song if you don't like
that song just get this off it has an
intellectual memory so it remembers what
you skipped and hopefully it'll pick to
start making music they its Taylor to
you and what you like and these songs as
well you can also download these
playlists and straight onto your hand
side here which will be stored on there
for one month and then you need to
refresh them if you if you want to still
have them on your it will give you the
option to refresh switches which is nice
as well so basically free music this is
all free there's no charge me apart from
the end they think two other you are
running to join looked
so within the app which is well we also
have a really nice feature which
spines are and so take your purse cake
is really find out where you are in
singer rihanna and and it's going to
tell you all the gigs are around this
area that you are in tonight we've also
got the 8 megapixel camera and which is
carl zeiss lens
and pencils and we saw and we say pocket
to picture in seven seconds so all you
need to do whatever you're falling back
just press it down here
now you are ready to take
we've already taken today so there's no
coming out of the camera application
she's ready to go for you
and I think that's pretty much the main
features on this phone lumia 800</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
