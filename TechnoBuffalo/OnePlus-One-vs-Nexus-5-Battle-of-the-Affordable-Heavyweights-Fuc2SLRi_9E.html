to you by godaddy just going on guys a
märklin sangha from TechnoBuffalo and
it's another Tuesday show so that means
we'll be comparing the oneplus one and
the Nexus 5 and see which ones do better
by we'll be comparing things like screen
size camera processor and build quality
so let's get on with the video so to
start things off for you guys the Nexus
5 is equipped with a beautiful 5-inch
IPS display with a resolution of 1920 x
1080 as a two point three gigahertz
quad-core Snapdragon 800 chip inside two
gigabytes of RAM in either 16 gigabyte
or 32 gigabyte of internal storage
unfortunately there's no microSD
supports are you stuck with whatever
storage you choose the Nexus 5 also has
Adreno 330 GPU which is great for gaming
a 2,300 milliamp battery an 8 megapixel
camera in the back with optical image
stabilization and it's running stock
Android 4.4 KitKat it's available in
three different colors white black and
red and starts at three hundred fifty
dollars for the 16 gigabyte version or
for four hundred dollars for the 32
gigabytes for a phone that's almost a
year old the Nexus 5 is still one of the
most popular Android smartphones out in
the market due to its hardware software
and pricing and since it's a Nexus
device you'll get the latest Android
updates the moment they become available
which is probably one of the reasons you
want to get a nexus 5 in the first place
the oneplus one on the other hand sports
a gorgeous 5.5 inch IPS display with a
resolution of 1920 x 1080 it's equipped
with powerful 2.5 gigahertz quad-core
snapdragon 801 processor 3 gigabytes of
ram 16 gigabyte or 64 gigabyte of
internal storage yet again there's no
microSD slot so you're stuck with
whatever version you get it also sports
the same Adreno 330 GPU found on the
Nexus 5 in a huge 3100 milliamp battery
that will last you pretty much the
entire day and on the back we have a 13
megapixel camera with dual-led flash is
capable recording 4k video and it's
running cyanogenmod 11 s which is based
on stock Android 4.4 KitKat it's
available in two colors as of now though
one plus plans on offering different
rear shells that people can buy
including different woods denim and
Kevlar the 16 gigabyte version in silk
white starts at just three hundred
dollars while the 64 gigabyte and
sandstone black is just fifty dollars
more $350 the one plus one which we
reviewed a week or so ago in my opinion
is the best bang for you
that is if you can buy one it has
similar specs to some of the top tier
Android devices on the market right now
like the LG g3 and the galaxy s5 but for
about 300 to 400 dollars less without a
contract the only problem is one plus is
relying on an invite-only system which
is making it difficult for people to buy
the device well the Nexus 5 is readily
available for everyone to buy it via the
google play store when it comes to
design both the oneplus one and the
Nexus 5 sport plastic builds by no means
do they feel cheap both devices still
feel premium without the premium price
tag but nonetheless they both feel great
in the hand the Nexus 5 comes in three
different colors black white and red and
all three have different feel to them
though I really like the matte finish
that the black and red variant offers
rather than a glossy feel of the white I
do prefer the form factor of the Nexus 5
over the oneplus one since it's a bit
more compact and easier to hold but
overall build quality I prefer the ones
more premium look with its chrome bezels
and seamless slightly curved design
screen size the oneplus one has a full
half inch larger display than the nexus
5 doesn't sound like a big difference
but it's very noticeable in person it's
roughly the difference between the
galaxy s5 and no 3 and makes watching
movies and playing games on the 1+1 a
bit better they're both 1080p LCD
displays and color accuracy seems to be
the same in my opinion with the oneplus
one you can tweak some of the colors
contrast and saturation within the
settings app to your liking so there's
more flexibility there but we think both
devices have similar displays and really
it's just a matter of what size you
prefer even though we prefer the Nexus 5
more compact form factor we do like the
exocrine real estate that the oneplus
one offers in an ideal world the 5.5
inch one plus one would be as compact as
a g3 but because of the devices
capacitive buttons you have larger
bezels on top and the bottom when it
comes to performance the oneplus one's
hardware's roughly you have generation
more advanced than the nexus 5 it uses a
Snapdragon 801 chip which is basically a
supercharged version of the Snapdragon
800 use on the Nexus 5 it offers a bit
more power but nothing you'd really
notice in real world use the oneplus one
also has 3 gigabytes of RAM built in
while the Nexus 5 only has 2 gigabytes
and this makes the one in theory at
least more powerful than the galaxy s5
the HTC One m8 and Xperia z2 let's take
a quick break and thank our friends at
godaddy it's go time and go daddy's here
to help you kick butt on lines start

promo code 199 techno to get your calm
for just a dollar now
nine cents some limitations apply see
website for details now the camera is
one of the most important pieces of
hardware consumers look for in a
smartphone that the Nexus 5's camera
isn't all that bad too especially after
all the updates that Google pushed out
months after it was released as an 8
megapixel camera with the sensor size of
seven point nine millimeter and an F 2.4
aperture though the Nexus 5 does however
include optical image stabilization
while the oneplus one doesn't that means
you'll see less blurry photos and videos
when it comes to shooting the oneplus
one on the other hand sports a 13
megapixel shooter an F 2 point 0
aperture and a slightly bigger sensor
coming in at eight point three
millimeters it doesn't include optical
image stabilization though it does take
advantage of software stabilization
which is usually good enough for the
average Joe both camera apps on a nexus
5 in the one are pretty similar they're
both very simplistic and offer their own
unique set of options to take experience
up a notch on paper the one plus one is
definitely the more impressive camera
and should be able to produce better
photos and I think it does photos seem
sharper low light is good and colors are
more accurate compared to the Nexus 5 I
can say the same for the Nexus 5 2 but
the colors are a bit washed out for my
taste the Nexus 5's camera has always
been so so although it's been improved
significantly thanks to the software
updates that Google pushed out still
it's not quite as nice as a 13 megapixel
sensor that's available in 2 1 plus 1
and when it comes to video the one plus
one can film in 4k Ultra HD in 720p slow
motion video well the Nexus 5 can only
film in 1080p so there is definitely
more to like on a one plus ones camera
now one of the most interesting
difference between these two phones is
software when you first look at the
oneplus one and the Nexus 5 software it
looks nearly identical but while the
Nexus 5 uses stock version of Android
the oneplus one software is merely based
on Android see antigen mod is a
community-based open-source version of
Android that gives you loads of control
over settings and other features that
stock Android doesn't offer it's
basically for hardcore geeks and those
who love to tinker with the device
cyanogenmod offers a ton of great
features to specially with a 1 + 1 which
is running a special version of
cyanogenmod 11 s it'll give your device
features such as double tap to wake the
screen themes performance tweaks and the
one we really loved was the ability to
turn on or off the software keys on the
one plus one which gives you a similar
look to the Nexus 5 stopper buttons both
can be tweaked the way you want them to
though we'd have to give the edge to see
an engine mod here so to wrap things up
for you guys I'm definitely going to
have to go over the oneplus one on this
one it's got the better build quality
better camera and a cheaper price tag
and
x5 is great too but the Nexus 6 could
just be right around the corner and
that's it for this video guys if you
guys have any questions or any
suggestions let us know in the comments
