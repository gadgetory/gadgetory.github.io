october 22nd is a great day for windows
fans it marks the end of vistas rain and
the dawning of Windows 7 which was just
released today so it's all you windows
fans out there are you going to upgrade
is it worth it to you are you going to
stick with vista or you can stick with
XP and let windows 7 workouts problems
maybe upgrade at service pack 2 we've
covered windows 7 extensively LP has
gone over some of the key features and
even benchmarked it so there's a ton of
information out there to help you make
your decision I'll put a links to both
of those videos in the sidebar to you
Apple fans are you going to install a
windows 7 via bootcamp are you going to
virtualize it via parallels vm fusion or
virtual box or do you have no interest
whatsoever in running any sort of
windows i'm really curious to what you
guys have to say about windows 7 do you
think it's it's worth it i've used it in
my opinion it's what vista should have
been it's a stable and it appears to be
relatively reliable platform just going
to depend on where your preference is
live whether you're on the mac side or
the window side or that you're like me
and you sort of straddle the middle
certainly i use a maximum primary
computer but I definitely have windows
installs and I do occasionally need to
use it so for me the sweet spot seems to
be virtualizing windows 7 those you that
are thinking about using bootcamp for
windows 7 just know that Apple does not
officially support windows 7 via
bootcamp with their drivers they didn't
issue a note today saying it will be out
relatively soon and it's not going to
support 64-bit so if you are going to
use bootcamp definitely stick with 32
and the virtualization options only
support 32 as well just something for
you guys know and another thing if you
are looking to go purchase windows 7 and
your students you can actually get a
really good deal downloading it if you
just go into google and you type 741 the
numbers and the windows you'll see that
there's a link there you can actually
get an upgrade to windows seven for
thirty dollars for a few months i
believe if you just have a student email
address pretty cool so just wanted to
see what you guys think leave a video
responsive very curious as to uh what
you guys are going to say about Windows
7 i'll see you in the next video bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
