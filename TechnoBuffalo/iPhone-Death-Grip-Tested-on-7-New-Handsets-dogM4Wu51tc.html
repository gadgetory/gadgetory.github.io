technobuffalo here during the iphone
four reception keynote Steve Jobs made a
point to say that Apple's not the only
phone manufacturer who's devices suffer
from the antenna issues penny where you
place your hands you could have degraded
signal quality and even drop calls he
demonstrated that on a few devices which
considered last generation the previous
generation bulbs for example the droid
eris which has been given its end of
life by verizon so I'm going to put it
Steve Jobs words the test and compare a
whole bunch of current generation phones
to see if they do is indeed suffer from
the same issues all right so first let's
demonstrate the problem here on an
iphone 4 it has a screen protector on it
and it does have a screen protector on
the side as well which is supposed to
fix the problem but actually does not
this is running the four point 01 you
can see by the or point 01 you can see
by the bigger reception bars up there
I'm going to go ahead and give it the
old grip and lets see that go down so
right now I'm sitting at about three
bars and after about five or six seconds
that will start to drop down go in turn
the screen back on there it goes down to
two and we will continue to drop I'll
generally it hovers around four bars
normally my pick it up drops down to
about two or one so there we've got the
problem here iphone four got dropped all
right so let's bring in the king of
Sprint's line up here we have the evo 4g
i'm gonna try and hold these in a ton
different place and see if we have the
issue so first take a look how reception
is normally I've got about two bars here
of a sprint's 3g service I'm gonna go
ahead and hold the phone as I was the
iphone 4 see the same spot see if you
have any problem what immediately drop
down to one bar if I let go will it to
jump back up I generally hover around
one two three bars of sprint service LLC
we can get that to drop down even
further and continue to hold the device
and see where my hand is seems to going
back up now and going back down does
look like perhaps the evo 4g
suffer from the same problem if I hold
it on the other side there's some
antenna play some issues here so now
I've got two bars no issues there if I
go back to the left we had that drop one
time see if it just coincidence or
actually a problem and it appears as
though we're staying at just about two
bars so if I put my hand on different
spots at the back of it maybe there's a
different antenna placements to make
this sort of a fair test I'll go ahead
and see where my hand is right here I'll
sort of push in everywhere that I can
see if that affects it and I'll hold the
left hand side as well I may move the
screen at the same time we do not appear
to have that problem we're replicating
the issue so we may be able to give so
we may be able to give the evo 4g a a
clean bill of health e'er now that's
kind of yet to be seen so it looks to be
okay so the evo 4g gets a clean bill
let's go ahead and bring in the
just-released droid x to see if we
suffers from the same fate alright so
here is the droid x you can see the
reception of God about honest got one
bar only have about two or three bars of
service that my battery is going to die
ah meel hit ok so you can get enough
usage out of it so right now it is at a
three bars go ahead and grip it the same
way and see if we get that same problem
here on the droid x and actually have
more bar to service when I gripped it
from the left hand side still looks to
be pretty strong I'll I'm hitting
buttons on my side that does not degrade
anything at all or if I hold it on the
other hand on the right hand side and
see that designing and see your my hands
place end up the camera wouldn't get
that other turn out the hit back camera
button nothing there if I do the top and
bottom nothing if I turn it over to
place my hands everywhere and try and
push in do we have any problem or any
way that you might hold a phone so like
this we don't have any problem like this
we didn't have any problem
I'll sort of push everywhere so it
definitely looks like the droid x or
avoids that same fate of the iphone 4s
let's try a few more devices alright so
next up is the samsung captivate for
eighteen t this is a galaxy s device
similar to what you may see on other
carriers we've got pretty good 18t
reception here about three barns go
ahead and give it the grip here and see
if we have the same problem so hold it
just as I would hold any normal phone
i'm sort of gripping it the same way to
the iphone 4 try make my finger go all
the way across it and not turn off the
device while I'm doing it swipe till
knock all right try that one more time I
got hit in the button we got pretty
solid bar still hovering at the same
spot doesn't appear to be effective but
leave it for another second or two to
see still at three bars does not appear
to be an issue so that as long as I held
the iphone 4 before it dropped off I'll
go ahead and try holding with my right
hand and see if that would be a problem
serve all the ways you would hold the
device and look like immediately with
the right hand we dropped down one bar
keep holding in see that keeps it going
down
it looks like we are stuck a tube are if
I let go let's see if it goes back up
see if it really was a problem and it
did go back up let's try that one more
time so it looks like these galaxy s
devices may actually be affected by the
same issue and there it goes oh we are
seeing the bars being dropped so drop
all the way down now 20 so the samsung
captivate and presumably the rest the
galaxy s devices actually have it on the
right hand side so when you hold it down
you are going to have that reception
problem here on the galaxy s let's go
ahead and take a look at a few more
devices alright so now we've got the
nexus one here which has full bars of
signal strength to go ahead and hold it
on the left hand side like I've been
doing I like I hold it normally during a
phone call I'll keep holding it for the
same volume so it dropped down one bar
let's see if it keeps going
to appear to be all right if I let go if
that goes back up so if it wasn't
theatre problem and it did go back up so
we duplicate that one more time so the
nexus one does drop when you hold it on
the left hand side this is a tmobile
variant case you're curious what if I
hold it on the right hand side see if it
continued so soon I let go and right
back up just a one bar drop if I do it
on the right hand side appears to be
okay and there been some reports that
there are some areas on the back advice
if you hold it that you may get some
issues with the nexus one so I've sort
of got my fingers spread all around the
areas of the phone and see if that
doesn't even to the signal bars which we
did not see try the left hand side one
more time and see how many bars we can
get that to drop since we know it does
drop at least one
it looks like it doesn't want to keep
dropping I got my hands all the way
along the side of advice just as I did
on the iphone 4 and the rest of devices
we retested cancel that out
so now we're not seeing that drop so
this is sort of inconclusive you may
drop one bar the nexus one you may not
have any issues I know it's been
reported a next one has had problems but
seems to be hard to duplicate here I'm
going to hold my hands on the bottom and
the side and see if we get it didn't
happen
and the nexus one appears to be okay not
suffering from the same fate that the
iphone 4 or the galaxy s the samsung
captivate had so go ahead and push that
off to the side let's go ahead and
continue our tests alright so next up
for the death grip test we have the
iphone 3gs are still one of the more
popular smartphones out we've got now
five bars of ATT service let's go ahead
and see this is affected at all by
holding it now Apple did say that the
iphone four drops less than one call per
100 more than the iphone 3gs let's see
if this still an issue we'll do it the
same whole test see if it's a problem
see where my hand is and the same spot
it was in the rest of the devices try
and make that all the way through we saw
one bar two bars see that goes down any
further
so it appears that we do still have a
two bar drop with the 3gs by let go
let's see if those bars come back
it doesn't look up now those bars are
coming back so that was indeed a problem
let's see if we can duplicate those
results go ahead and hold it again you
can watch those bars
and we do not appear to be having the
same drop issue although we did have
five bars initially we're now down to
four absorbed in the phone same
direction without any signal degradation
so what if I try the right hand side of
the device and spree ported that the
antenna is actually in the middle of
phone so I got in my right hand consider
my hand is located bars still appear to
be well looks like we just drop down one
to call you could lose anymore
I like go let's see those bars come back
drop down to let's see if those bars
come back if I let go see my hands on
holding anymore and if those bars do
come back then indeed the 3gs is plagued
with the same problems and those bars
are coming back that its new brother the
iphone 4 does have two confirmed that
problem thus far on the iphone for the
samsung captivate now the iphone 3gs i
was a bit inconclusive with the evo 4g
not a problem on the droid x and it was
did not appear to be a problem on the
nexus one let's keep looking we got a
lot of phones to run through all right
so the last guy to go under our knife
here is the HTC aria for AT&amp;amp;T I'm
hovering it just around three bars here
let's go ahead and hold it on the right
hand side this is a guy'll be very easy
to serve in Gulf with my hand to see how
that works and it appears that I'll be
HTC phones we've tested I've come out
relatively unscathed in this antenna
issue let's see if the aria is the
exception to that rule still around
three bars that are you trouble
once all those notifications go away
we'll still see still around three bars
let's try the right-hand side now the
other way you might hold your phone if
you're right-handed see if you have a
new sort of trouble I'll immediately
that drop down a one bar see if it keeps
dropping down cam right back up get hit
okay let's go ahead and let go and try
that one more time so it looks like the
aria is going to be okay doesn't appear
to be a prob left to the right hand I'll
try the hands on the bottom test if
there's an antenna issue back there
looks to be all right so the Aria
appears to have made it so let's recap a
sort of what we saw the iphone 3gs did
indeed have the dropped call or the
signal derivation antenna issue go ahead
and push it that one off the evo 4g
appeared to be okay we saw some signal
loss it was one bar but it came back so
it appeared to make it out okay the
samsung captivate we actually saw the
problem even more vividly than we saw it
on the iphone 4 definitely has the
problem although on the other side of
the device we'll see if that holds true
with the other galaxy s devices the
droid x didn't have any sort of signal
drop whatsoever so that one passes the
test of the iphone 4 probably don't need
me to comment on that and the nexus one
finally appeared to be okay so it looks
like our signal drop culprits are the
phones that are made by Apple and the
one by Samsung if you guys are looking
out for phone and this is a concern for
you these are going to be three phones
that you're going to want to check
yourself to see if the problem is going
to be replicated for you anyway guys i'm
