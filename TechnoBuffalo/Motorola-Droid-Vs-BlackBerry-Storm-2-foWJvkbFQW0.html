of the hottest smartphones for Verizon
Wireless the Motorola Droid and the
blackberry storm2
we're gonna put these CDMA kalaiy as
head-to-head in the series of tests
covering browser and browser speed text
entry customization navigation apps and
then a few other little features as we
go select to jump into something that I
use the most on any mobile device the
browser these are both running on
Verizon Wireless is same 3G EVDO Rev a
network each with about three to four
bars of service we're going to load the
same webpage over 3G and I'll show you
how to navigate works then we're gonna
load the Samboy page again over Wi-Fi so
you guys can see really which one's
faster or slower let's go ahead and get
started we're gonna load TechnoBuffalo
comm on each this has been loaded on
both phones so it'll be a test of a site
that you visit on a regular basis this
is a pretty text rich site so it should
be a decent comparison let's go ahead
and open it up on each alright it's in a
history there let's get it in the
history here as well okay and try and
hit these both at the same time and
we'll get started ok and we are off on
each device you can if you want to
monitor the progress you can see the
yellow bar across on the Droid and the
blue bar across on the bottom of the
blackberry storm clearly the Droid
jumped out to an early lead fact the
page is almost already loaded you can
start reading and navigating through
it's not quite done yet and the storm
has yet to really even render the page
the Droid is already done in the storm
is still loading so while the storm is
still loading I'll show you how
navigation works on the Motorola Droid
clearly showing that that has the faster
browser rendering close you wondering
it's based on WebKit the same browser
that's found on
the iPhone so navigation is done really
just with your finger since both are
using capacitive touchscreens scroll to
anywhere you'd like if you find a bit of
text that you'd like to read you can
zoom in in one of two ways you can
either double tap and that'll zoom it in
or you can take advantage of the zoom
down below here with a plus or minus
magnifying glass and the storm2 is still
loading
so we'll zoom out using that magnifying
glass we just talked about one of the
things that I always check when I view
mobile devices is how quickly the page
renders as I scroll from the storm2 just
finished well not you see that checker
pad and as you go through showing the
vise and the processor can't keep up
with your scrolling that's nothing that
you see here on a motorola droid really
keeps up and you get sort of physic
scrolling so as you flick your screen
you flick your finger rather it keeps
going
there is no multi-touch for pinching
zooming here now again all your zooming
is done either by double tapping or
using the magnifying glass but a renders
page is very smoothly and cleanly and
I've been very impressed with the
browser on the motorola droid you see
rich HTML websites and of course it has
an accelerometer so you turn the device
you can view it in landscape or portrait
turn it the way that's meant to be there
you can view it in landscape or portrait
makes it nice and easy to read size and
it back up it's got a very quick
rotation speed let's take a look at the
storm and see how the pat√© renders and
you can see them head to head the Droid
clearly renders pages a little bit
better brightness on each of these
devices has been turned down so you can
see this on camera this is also done via
flick scrolling although there was that
sort of delay that I was talking about
it's not quite caught up all the way as
I'm scrolling unfortunately keep going
and it's still taking a little bit of
time so zooming is done very much in the
same way as it's done on the droid you
can double tap to zoom in on some text
takes a bit of a second to render can
double tap to zoom in a little bit more
a little bit more or we've got that same
hourglass functions on the bottom the
plus and the minus I go ahead and zoom
out
and zooming BlackBerry's been known for
fantastic email their email services
what's kept to think rim going their
blackberry push services it is
unbelievable but they are not known for
their browser and the storm to is really
no exception the browser definitely
lacks behind the smart phone competitors
in this case on the motorola droid so
let's do the same speed test over Wi-Fi
and see if that helps at all
so Wi-Fi has been turned on and enabled
and of course we're connected to the
same network so let's see if Wi-Fi helps
the speed of the storm or not and again
we're gonna load TechnoBuffalo calm good
search okay it's there okay and we're
off on each now the storm to has been
much faster than it was on 3G but
certainly not able to keep up with the
Droid which is almost already fully
loaded it's not appeared to be even that
big a difference between the Wi-Fi
speeds and the 3G speeds so it's already
done now on the Droid and same old story
still loading up on the storm navigation
of course is the same as what we just
saw and as I scroll through there's no
page loading time it's already there so
while we wait for the storm to load I
can tell you a little bit of a story
because I think we might be here a while
I'm starting to get to see some images
you can already view some text you can
see the Wi-Fi is turned on it's got the
Wi-Fi signal up there and it's still
loading so that just goes to show you
that if browser is important to you the
BlackBerry is not the way to go it does
have a usable browser but certainly
cannot keep up with the likes of the
Droid and we are almost done so in the
interest of brevity here I'm gonna cut
this short because who knows how long
we're gonna be waiting for the storm to
to load let's go ahead and move on to
the next series of tests finally
finished up text entry
so text entry is done in two ways on the
motorola droid but go ahead and open up
a new message here it's done either via
on-screen virtual keyboard which comes
up in portrait or via the full QWERTY
keyboard which is down below so I should
preface this with saying that I don't
really use either of these devices on a
regular basis so I'm not used to
keyboards on either so there should be a
fair test
however the as you use these will become
more accustomed you'll probably get a
little bit of increased accuracy so
let's start with the soft keyboard on
the droid it's relatively spacious and
quite nicely laid out and as you move
your fingers over the keys you can see
what letter that you want to type let's
go ahead and start typing a message and
I'll do my typical this is a test
message and see how it works and you do
get some auto correction as you go so
this is a test not bad
using the on-screen keyboard let's try
it with the QWERTY keyboard now the
quartic keyboard here is interesting
there's a lot of real estate space
that's being taken up by this d-pad the
keys aren't really rounded or domed at
all so it's very hard to feel separation
I'm not the biggest fan of the QWERTY
keyboard on the droid but let's go ahead
and try it again and see how it works
and we'll type once again this is a test
so not so accurate this is a Ted's nest
like Snoop Dogg here I think it's
something that you would get used to but
the physical keyboard is definitely a
little bit of a downfall of the drawing
a little bit of a disappointment
certainly I prefer physical keyboard
over a soft keyboard but this is not one
of the better implementations that I've
seen so let's take a look how text-entry
works on the blackberry storm2 now let's
use a unique technology called sure
press that you might have seen or heard
from the storm one it's got a capacitive
touchscreen on top but this whole screen
actually clicks almost like one big
button now on the storm one there is
only one sensor so the screen would just
click in one spot so if you're trying to
type something that was in the corners
you'd have a pretty hard time trying to
get the accuracy with what you wanted or
even getting that clicked register at
all the storm to really improves on that
technology something called PCO
technology that it uses essentially what
you got to know is now it has four
sensors one in each corner meaning it's
much more accurate and because there
isn't just one sensor the time you have
to wait for the screen to come back up
is much improved over the storm one a
lot of original owners lamented that
they had a wait a very long time to type
on the soft keyboards that came on the
storm and that was a real big turn-off
so let's see if that's improved we're
gonna go ahead and open up a new message
here as well and see how it works
okay so you've got a few keyboard
options here right now you've got a sure
type keyboard similar to what's found on
the pearl or the pearl flip it's two
keys per letter it doesn't learn as you
type let's go ahead and try this is a
test on this keyboard and you'll see and
you'll hear the screen is actually
clicking as I'm going
so a little bit of an error but not too
bad this is attack dud is at-at I think
you would get used to this this keys are
big and they glow a blue color as you
put your finger over it if you go ahead
and rotate it you're going to get a full
QWERTY keyboard here in landscape and
this was probably one of the biggest is
employment of the storm one let's see if
it's been improved with the storm - I'll
try typing the same thing this is a test
and I was able to type that actually
perfectly so if you have to compare soft
keyboards I think that the storm - is
actually better than what's found on the
Motorola Droid I even would go as far to
say that's the soft keyboard the full
QWERTY keyboard is even a little bit
easier to use than the actual QWERTY the
physical one found on the Droid I think
that you probably get used to the Droid
is you use it more but just enough first
week usage the storm tooth keyboard is
quite easy to use and a huge improvement
over the original so let's go ahead and
move on to customization one of the nice
things about Android is that it's an
open-source operating system meaning
you've got the capability to do whatever
you like with it this is a Google
experience phone look at the back it
says with Google so that means there is
not a skin on it so nothing like the
Sense UI that you've seen on the HTC
Hero however you got a full array of
customization options you can add
widgets to the homescreen as you can see
here I've got a YouTube widget with a
OneTouch upload I've got a power
management widget I've got a Google
search widget with Google Voice I can go
ahead and hold down the screen I can get
a ton more widgets and customize this
any way I like
I've got C right there I've got three
home screens to choose from to put
things anywhere I'd like I can drag
icons from my menu tray anywhere and put
them somewhere on the home screen if I
choose so I currently customize what
shows up where it shows up and how you
interact with it now you can do sort of
the similar thing with the blackberry
storm and the black
very OS in particular if you go ahead
and hit the BlackBerry button you can
view the full menu items now you can
move things around and change the order
but you can't control how many icons
show up here on this short homescreen
you are stuck at 8 however you can
determine which goes where you can
arrange these icons any way you'd like
navigation is done by the very familiar
blackberry buttons that you've seen on
BlackBerry devices for years past send
button the BlackBerry button which pulls
up a menu back button in the end button
and of course your finger and on the
droid it's done by a back a menu a home
button and then there's a search button
as well and that also uses a capacitive
there's a little bit of haptic feedback
when you touch these so it feels a
little bit different than just touching
the screen these buttons on the
BlackBerry have that same sure press
click as you feel as you push it so you
definitely know that you're pushing a
button so let's go ahead and move on to
the next series of our tests and we'll
talk about app since both have their own
app stores so on Android we're looking
at the Android Marketplace and it was
revamped for Android 1.6 the Droid is of
course running Android 2.0 the first
device to actually run 2.0 go ahead and
reopen that back up let's take a look at
how it looks so you've got it arranged
by a series of categories we'll go ahead
and just pick one we'll pick comics and
you can see that mostly the applications
are relatively cheap and there are a ton
of free ones that should not the best
category to pick let's pick
entertainment so here I am now under top
paid can pick top free one of the nice
thing about Android Marketplace is that
most of these are free applications did
you go ahead and open one up so here's
one called funny jokes you get a little
bit about the app you get some
screenshots of what it looks like you
get some user comments and you get some
more about the developer we can actually
email a developer or the developers web
page directly which is kind of cool and
for one to install it you just go ahead
and push install BlackBerry has
blackberry app world which works in
pretty much the same way go ahead and
open it up although I have found that
apps in blackberry app world are
little bit more expensive than those
found in the Android Marketplace so your
main app home screen you can scroll
through and see what the new apps are
it's a very clean interface you can go
through and view the same categories
that we saw before so I'll hit
entertainment give a second to queue up
and we'll pick gadgets big gadget guy
and this is still connected to the Wi-Fi
network so let's just pick one
we'll pick big tin can and Buzz me so
this is a free application loading up so
you can download it directly you can see
reviews recommend it
screenshots you have to click buttons to
do that so if you wanted to click a
screenshot you go ahead and flick screw
flip through rather and see them I
prefer the user interface on the Android
Marketplace over BlackBerry App World
but it's really gonna come down to
personal preference I found that things
here are a little slower to load in
BlackBerry's app world and there are
many more applications in the Android
Marketplace so again you know it's gonna
really come down to which one you like
more so guys there a ton of categories
that we could have covered here in this
review but interest of brevity I had to
cover some of the ones that I thought
were most prevalent if we want to talk
about email for example there's nothing
better than a blackberry blackberry has
really been then known for its pushing
my capabilities it works well and it
works almost all the time it's very
little downtime we could have talked
about camera and the five megapixels
megapixel sensor on the droid versus the
three on the storm2 or how the droid can
capture DVD quality video even but again
we're just a little bit short on time so
the final decisions gonna come down to
you personally
I had to pick one based on my needs I
would go with the Motorola Droid
hands-down
but decision is going to be in your
hands for exclusive content check me out
