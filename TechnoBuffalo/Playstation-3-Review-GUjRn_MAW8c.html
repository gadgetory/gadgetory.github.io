review of the PlayStation 3 as a blu-ray
player as you guys will see in a minute
I kind of walk you through the load
steps and how quickly it loads and talk
about the quality
fortunately you can't see the quality
over YouTube a couple things I do want
to clarify first off the video quality
is amazing looks better than the Apple
TV HD downloads first of all second
thing is the remote can turn the console
on and off just like a normal remote
could control any other component so
something else to keep in mind anyway
guys enjoy you know any questions let me
know about about the stuff and I'll talk
to you soon don't forget to check out
WWJ for Lakers comm don't forget to wwww
alright guys started for a little bit of
the shaky camerawork here we've gone
handheld so here is the PlayStation 3
you guys saw it during the unboxing kind
of did a walkthrough of it so let me
give you guys a sense of how it works as
a blu-ray player first off the load
times are very very very quick as you'll
see in a minute the load times with my
old HD DVD player the a 2 which is now
totally obsolete it would take about
almost 2 to 3 minutes just for it to
open up for me to put in a disc in the
low times where additional 2 or 3
minutes so let me show you how to
PlayStation 3 works as a blu-ray player
from off you can see the red light right
there
meaning the console is off you pick up a
blu-ray disc here I got two of them 300
and Casino Royale let's pop in cuz you
know Ralph right up here
I know some of you guys saw too and the
the blog I picture of my cat sleeping on
the Apple TV that's the cat if you're
interested
that's Mercedes um alright so enough of
that get to the good stuff
here is Casino Royale and again guys
this is the console being off put it in
automatic it recognizes it sucks it
right in turns on I'll take a step back
here if you guys can see the television
automatic returns on the PlayStation I
mean mute it here automatic recognizes
it as a blu-ray disc and just like that
guys automatically starts playing really
really really quickly loading and there
it is it's playing so from inserting the
disc until the second starts playing is
under a minute I mean it's really really
really quite good so let me pause this
here for you guys one second
now you can say folk intro here of what
it looks like
all right so let me turn this off video
quality is excellent guys blu-ray looks
gorgeous the PlayStation 3 can handle it
as well as nu standalone blu-ray player
from what I've heard it looks great it's
quiet you can't even hear the noise and
the best thing about it is it's totally
firmware upgradeable which not many
blu-ray players out there are froze you
too don't know when blu-ray is first
introduced it was introduced as 1.0
profile the updated 2 profile 1.1 which
the older players could naturally update
to and their final standard will be
profile 2.0 which would be really
shortly and the PlayStation 3 is the
only 2.0 compatible player out there so
if you guys want a blu-ray player and
you also maybe want to play a game or
two PlayStation 3 is an awesome awesome
awesome way to go guys I'm so happy with
it I'm so glad I bought it and
everything just works as advertised one
thing I do recommend that you get you
know I'll do a walk through the
PlayStation 3 later in another review
one thing I do recommend that you guys
get I'll show you right here I show it
in the unboxing video is the PlayStation
remote so you don't have to use the
controller to control it it looks just
like a regular remote control
PlayStation 3 you got your buttons
fast-forward pause all the controller
buttons your PlayStation button you know
and your pause rewind remote is really a
must-have in my opinion using the
controller is a little bit odd to
control the video and playback so remote
really makes it feel like more of a
standalone player and a guy just we just
want to say if you're looking to get a
blu-ray player again PlayStation 3 is an
absolutely awesome way to go you know it
looks looks great the quality of
playback is excellent
you know just worked as advertised so
hopefully that's will help you guys
decide what to get now at the format war
is over and just a quick sneak peek of
some other stuff I'm going to be
reviewing here is my cabinets right
there you can see an xbox sling box on
top of that an old HD DVD player my wii
Apple TV
and my cable box and this is my LG
50-inch plasma screen and I guess
they're the rock band drums - any guys
hope you enjoyed and I'll do another
review of a walk through the whole
PlayStation PlayStation interface on
another video but you want to get some
up until you guys that PlayStation 3 is
an excellent blu-ray player thought the
guys soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
