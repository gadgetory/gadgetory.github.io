to you by loot crate what's up everyone
welcome back the episode of rumor
roundup I'm reduce jon rettinger and i
want to save you the time and effort of
searching the internet for all the tech
rumors because I give you the four
biggest ones from the week that you need
to know of this week HTC might be
teaming with Amazon on a Kindle phone
google kiosks are showing up the best
buy hinting at the Nexus 5 might be near
apple is slashing iphone 5c orders and
nokia is looking to get into a new
product category instead of a guru music
player let's go ahead and get started so
according to report from the financial
time is a pretty reputable name HTC is
Amazon have gone past the dating phases
and have hopped in bed with each other
of course it's GC would come right out
and MIT that's working with amazon
w-wait too easy although the company's
chief marketing officer been home so
that HTC is still in I quote very open
to Cobra in collaboration with carriers
and other technology brands so HTC was
obviously not available for comment that
we did try and reach them perhaps if
this is successful might be a precursor
to Amazon buying HTC they've famously
been struggling they've had layoffs over
the past few months and perhaps amazon
might be their Savior we're also hearing
rumors at the phone might only be
available amazon prime subscribers even
a crazy rumor may even be free for
amazon prime members it also feeling
subscribed amazon prime that is like the
best 25 bucks you will ever ever spend
another wacky rumors that they're gonna
be using some weird eye tracking
technology in a smartphone I wouldn't
expect anything until late 2014 if not
2015 while you're waiting you might want
to sit comfortably for a few more days
probably for your nexus 5 Google kiosks
are starting to show up in best buy
locations all across the country we
expected the Nexus 5 to show its face on
the 15th but then it's obviously didn't
perhaps glad time you watch this video
to the 17th we already know all the
details about the nexus 5 looks to be
pretty awesome latest tech smashed into
it including android 4.4 kitkat smoothly
a pretty baller spec sheet including
snapdragon 800 I for one and I'm super
excited for it I just like Nexus phones
so hopefully I don't have to wait much
longer so one thing you won't
have to wait for is the iphone 5c
supposedly just not selling that well so
the 5s has been a huge success for Apple
the 5c though not so much citing
anonymous sources from familiar with the
situation which is sort of everybody The
Wall Street Journal reports that apple
is cut its order with Pentagon by under
twenty percent and by about a third with
Foxconn the article also said that an
unnamed component suppliers order for
iphone 5c parts has been cut in half
which could have huge obviously effects
on the smartphone's availability through
2014 although people aren't buying them
they're probably not gonna be selling
that many apple said it sold nine
million iPhones over launch but they
were super coy about breaking that down
so no how many 5 s's are five see you or
sold a one report claims that consumers
bought more than twice as many copies of
iphone 5s compared to the iphone 5c of
many pointing to the plastic smartphone
surprisingly high price tag as reason
for its disappointing sales would
certainly make sense it's an expensive
phone it's last year's iPhone 5 and a
prettier package perhaps consumers are
smarter than Apple originally thought
but if you do want to get an iphone 5c
part of a problem picking one up and
lastly nokia reportedly set to unveil a
guru music player on the october twenty
second event so in addition to nokia is
upcoming phablet tablet devices they
will allegedly introduce a brand the new
dedicated music device which seems like
a weird thing to do since most people
are trying to do convergence devices
they unreleased a dedicated one by oh
hold off judgment till i see it our good
pal f wings put it and ipod shuffle plus
NFC equals nokia grew on this twitter
account early reports suggested six
devices will be showcased in nokia's
october twenty second event and it
certainly looks like an mp3 player is
gonna be one of them we should see the
Lumia 1520 which I'm really excited
about the tablet to 25 20 which kind of
man about and some other devices at the
event in Abu Dhabi which we will be at
our own Roy Choi's hop it out and
