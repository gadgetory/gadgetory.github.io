unboxing for you of the new iPod shuffle
this is the $79 for gigabyte version
there's also a 2 gigabyte $60 version
this veronik got in blue comes in a ton
of different colors now instead of just
your old simple grain blacks but I
thought the blue was kind of cool again
so let's go ahead and unbox it this is
the first time I've actually played with
it really even seen one of the new
shuffles so I'm curious how it's gonna
work with no real physical buttons other
than hold go ahead and open it up it's a
very simple box pretty reminiscent of
the rest of the Apple iPod lineup
you've got the device on the front with
the earbuds on the side some information
on the side tells you the size capacity
on top and that's about it let's go
ahead and peel back the plastic a very
satisfying woosh sound that you get go
ahead and open it up and there is the
shuffle right on top sitting in some
plastic it's clipped in and push that
off to the side for just a minute see
what else we get in the box
iPod shuffle the headsets there we go
headset is locked into that piece of
plastic right there and there is the
controller for it it's got a volume up
and down and a button in the middle and
charging using 3.5 millimeter to USB and
some start here information let's go
ahead and take a look at the Nano itself
take it off this clip here a little bit
of tape and it just opens up just to
slide it right on out there we go it is
quite small I mean that is a really tiny
device um almost like a piece of Trident
gum with the headset jack on the top let
me give you a size comparison some
things you might be familiar with so for
example here is an iPhone 3GS zoom out
just a bit when you really get a sense
of how small that really is it's quite
impressive here's another comparison
here is the Apple Bluetooth headset it's
almost exactly the same size so this
thing really is tiny and extremely thin
it's got a clip on the back so you can
clip it to your shirt your shorts you
know wherever you want if you're going
for a run take four gigabytes and music
with you I'm gonna use this for a little
while and do a full review I'm just like
I said I'm very curious how it's gonna
work with no physical buttons anyway for
