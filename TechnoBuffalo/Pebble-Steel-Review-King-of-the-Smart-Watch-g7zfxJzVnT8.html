technobuffalo here at the full review
for you of this guy the pebble steel
SmartWatch took a look at the original
pebble a few months back but it's grown
up now it's got a new metal body let's
go and see if it's worth your SmartWatch
buying dollar
with the pebble steel it's really all
about the design after all it's called
steel because it's made of fancy fancy
steel so if you're deciding on which
pebble to get the steel is really all
about how it looks and it looks really
really nice the face now is corning
gorilla glass so if you drop it or
anything you put your watch in your
pocket you are going to be protected
also if you just rub your wrist against
something you've got the best from the
folks at corning here as i mentioned
it's may do a stainless steel it's got a
more professional look to it I really
like that it comes with either the metal
band or the leather band you can sort
have a picker which one you want it
comes with both of them so you can
decide if you want that more metal
metallic look you want to go more casual
with leather you've got the choices here
at that as well it's also available in a
black matte we have the brushed steel
here as well though the band's no longer
use open standards pebble did release a
3d render so third party bands will be
coming but just not as many as a 22
millimeter bands on the original pebble
which is pretty much standard for all
watch band so if you like a lot of
customization in your bands and the
pedal steel might make you have a bit of
a frowny face when issue I had the
original pebble was the magnetic
connection was really really weak that's
of course where you have to use to
charge it so pebble listened and agreed
and they fix out the pebble steel it's
now way stronger in fact you could
dangle the watch wait just with the
magnetic connector so that's so much
better and maybe quite happy also new to
the party here is a tricolor LED so you
know when the launch is indeed charging
it's not going to blink though you get
notifications I just lets you know that
it's charging and it's tricolor so you
like different colors you've got that
option there as well so with all this
niceness including the cording gorilla
glass and stainless steel comes at a
price it is $249 or also known as 100
more than the irregular pebble
functionally though it's exactly the
same it's the same UI in the same
internals as the original table watch
really all you're paying for is
aesthetics only we're not getting any
sort of additional functionality other
than the magnetic connector and that tri
color LED because it's the same though
most this will sound familiar from our
original pebble coverage battery life
has been exactly as advertised which is
not very common in the
mobile world industry they advertise
five to seven days and I got pretty much
exactly five I do use pebble card which
does pull in some data so that could
drink battery life a little bit more and
the original pebble OS if you wanted a
data connection you needed a third party
HTT rap but no more OS 2.2 found to be
really really welcome addition I think
pebble did a really elegant job
integrating that does create two
separate Bluetooth connection zone case
you look at your phone and you're like
why do I have to hear couple of watches
cannot accept apps and with all app
stores your usage is really going to
vary from you though pebble cards have
been a really really killer app you can
customize ever you want to show so I've
got stock prices I've got Laker score
that's usually a loss I've got battery
and I've got local weather just a really
really nice app you can customize it
completely so you can see things for
changing their and it certainly could
see the last Laker score what's coming
up next usually has not been a very good
though so aside from a couple cards the
apps I've really found useful I've been
Tetris and flappy birds clone so you can
get your game on there's an
accelerometer built in here so you can
move it if you want to play asteroid
there's a ton of fitness apps really
curious again is going to vary you can
choose whatever you want from the app
world so interesting thing with the
pebble in the tech world there's an
obvious emphasis on touch control screen
resolution raw horsepower how many cores
it has how many gigs of RAM pebble took
a very very different approach that was
refreshing they don't have any of that
it's got physical big clicky buttons not
much the way of respect since a black
and white screen which is essentially
just yank oh and just notifications
machine but somehow it really really
works oh and smartwatches first start to
be a thing I was not overly jazz on them
I didn't see much of a point so why I
looked at my watch I just look at my
phone or why pay for a watch I just look
at my phone but the more I use smart
watches the pebble in particular the
more I finally got it if you're like me
I'm sort of always having to check my
phone for an email whether it's to see
what's going on technobuffalo or
contracts over it might be when I'm at
home around in public it's really rude
to always be checking my phone I try to
do it as little as i can but with the
pebble just vibrates on my wrist I can
see if it's an important email or
someone just telling me i won you know a
Nigerian lottery and she doesn't require
my immediate attention so it's been a
very nice welcome addition from that
front so get your use might vary if you
like
your phone then you might not find use
for this but if you don't want to pull
your FOIA as often as you like the
pebbles are really really good option so
for almost positive things over the
pebble steel is not without its faults
it's got a really really sharp bezel on
the top of the bottom if you drag your
finger over the screen you get to wear
that steel actually hit it's quite sharp
that's on the top and bottom and left
and right you can really feel I don't
know if it's sort of first batch of
construction or a quality issue with the
watch but you really definitely notice
that it's also certainly pricey 249
bucks but when you buy this you know
what you're getting your spending an
extra hundred dollars because you want
the metal look so I can't really knock
it for that people know what they're
getting when they pay for this not a big
fan of branding on the front but that
might be more of a personal thing also
I've got just normal man arms with
normal dude hair and it kept pulling the
hair out of my wrist I kept getting
caught in a link so if you're a super
hairy guy you might run into trouble or
you can just you know wax your arms but
again these are all really really minor
things for most people though when it
came down to deciding which pebble to
get in you decide that you want one you
know do you want the original pebble or
do you want this deal I probably
recommend the original pebble ensues
extra hundred bucks and maybe buy a
metal watch band or two and you know
saying them saving maybe fifty dollars
or so on the whole deal but if your
professional you want that leather look
you want the metal look going to get a
really really good product here with the
pebble steel it's going to be the watch
that's going to grace my wrist for the
foreseeable future and I've really been
happy to wear it i look forward to
putting it on i like the cool
professional look on it I like Sir the
industrial steel appearance of it I know
some people in the office preferred the
leather so you've got those
customization options I gets a really
really solid 8.5 and definite
recommendation from me so you guys are
looking for a SmartWatch you don't
really look no further than one of these
two guys a pebble or the pebble steel
it's a refreshing difference from what
other smartwatches are doing I look at
the Sony SmartWatch 2 or the qualcomm
toq this one's not all about specs all
about the functionality and I like you
can see it in direct sunlight because of
that sort of eating display there's no
issue with it at all I like how you ax
to backlight it's got accelerometer so
as you sort of flick your wrist up it'll
light up for you I like to get
notifications the subtle sort of vibrate
on the wrist you can choose to ignore it
or not ignore it I think pebble did a
really nice job with this and I'm
excited for what's next
from the company so what do you guys
think about the pebble steel do you
agree with my assessment of smartwatches
you think they are awesome and make you
way less true do you think they have
zero place on anybody's risk and you
look absolutely stupid wearing them
either way I love to hear your thoughts
or even if you fall somewhere in between
