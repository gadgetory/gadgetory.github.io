to you by citrix what's going on guys at
mark and tagging from TechnoBuffalo in
and today's rumor roundup will be
talking about blackberrys new high-end
all touch device motorola may already be
gearing up for the release of a 2nd gen
Moto 360 android lollipop for the HTC
One m8 and the next iphone update might
include the biggest camera jump ever
this is rumor roundup let's start
rounding those rumors up BlackBerry's
more recent smartphones have been
targeting faithful fans who love their
physical keyboards but the canadian
company hasn't given up on full touch
phones just yet high-end handset
codename rio is reportedly set to make
its debut in 2015 on the blackberry z10
made its debut last january it wasn't
exactly a pocket-sized powerhouse but it
certainly wasn't terrible either it
features a 4.7 inch 720p display a
quad-core Snapdragon s4 and a fairly
decent 8 megapixel camera at the time
those specs are pretty high-end and we'd
expect a similar approach with Rio but
if course specs were never BlackBerry's
problem the company will need to work
hard to improve its software if it hopes
to attract new users from rival
platforms like Android and iOS the Moto
360 is one of the best smartwatches
available today but it looks like
Motorola may already be gearing up to
release a 2nd gen model 1 lenovo
executive hinted at an upgraded version
of the Android wear device with an even
nicer design the second gen Moto 360
will apparently be more beautiful and
more like a clock we don't know exactly
what that means though it could probably
mean Motorola is planning to get rid of
that small silver dead screen on a
current model or it's also possible
lenovo was simply referring to the gold
and silver moto 360 variants that
recently launched here in the US if
Motorola is planning to release a
next-gen moto 360 we may now have to
wait very long for an official
announcement the same lenovo official
added that device should be available in
russia by early 2015 but for now it's
just another rumor but if you're willing
to wait a few extra months it may be
worth holding out we've already seen a
few alleged screenshots of sense 7.0
running the latest version of Android
but the new leak suggests that HTC could
have plans to bring a few lollipop
features that
current version of its and software as
well based on some of the screenshots it
looks like sense six-point oh may soon
get a total material design makeover one
image reveals HTC is adding lollipops
I'll interactive notifications to its
lock screen and another one shows
androids redesign recent apps interface
which should be huge improvement over
HTC's current multitask and grid layout
now back in October HTC said they'll be
able to make the jump to android 5.0
lollipop starting early next year and
hopefully it meets its deadline let's

it free button the iphone 6 and 6 plus
were just released a few months back and
we're already in a rumor mill for the
next iPhones according to a new report
next year's iphone update might include
the biggest camera jump ever apple's
next phone could utilize a two lens
system giving iphone users DSLR quality
images it might be similar to HTC's
famous duo camera found on a One m8
which combines traditional sensor with a
sensor dedicated to according def data
and providing better low-light
performance now there's a lot of systems
out there the Apple could seriously be
looking into and as it does every year
the company will need to find a way to
entice customers to upgrade to its s
devices which will likely hit this
September apple doesn't typically
introduce substantial megapixel updates
though a 2 lens system could provide
technology to create higher quality
images thank you guys so much for
