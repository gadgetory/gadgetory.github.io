are checking out the new Instagram 4.0
is out and it has video so is it Vince
to Graham I'm not sure but we're gonna
do video we're walking around right
outside Buffalo HQ here in a beautiful
sunny gorgeous Irvine and I think my
first clip is gonna be of Ralph
recording me wave hi let's go find more
stuff flowers selfies jumping in a
circle alright so we have our video
recorded you can see we've got our Clips
right here and we're gonna tap on next
and it's gonna show me the video here
this is the cinema feature which I'll
get to in a second and of course just
like Instagram you've got all your
filters so if we want to see the video
we made
now I'm gonna mute this really quick so
that you guys can see what cinema is so
you can see the running here is like a
little bit jagged and of course even
here there's a little bit of shakiness
because you're holding the phone with
your hand but Instagram has created the
cinema feature which makes this a lot
more stable in terms of looking more
cinematic so that's a nice feature that
people really like and of course you can
pick your filters so if we wanted to
change the look of the video we could do
that very easily it's this very old
timey look see and even my friend is
saying it makes vine seem kind of junky
what a fabulous
perfect timing text so we have all these
different features let's go with black
and white just because well I like I
like the old-school look so we'll go
with that and we can tap on next and
then we can choose a cover frame so this
is a really neat feature that vine
doesn't offer where you can choose what
people see when they are picking your
video so if we wanted to do this
craziness of me jumping we could do that
it's me and my wacky eyebrows we'll do
that one because it's ridiculous and we
can add a caption just like we would on
Instagram we can share to Facebook
Twitter Tumblr email and Foursquare we
can also add it to our photo map which
is cool but here's our caption we're
just gonna put yay because yeah
Instagram video is here and then you tap
share just like normal we also have a
couple other videos so here's our here's
our video that just got posted and if we
want to watch it all we have to do is
tap on it and there it is and that is
Instagram with videos so Instagram 4.0
and of course if you want to see other
people's videos all you have to do is
scroll down and it will play them
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
