to another installment of good to go I'm
Noah Kravitz from technobuffalo and I'm
James Kendrick from ZDNet mobile news
James III can't believe it's thursday
afternoon again i don't know where that
where does the time go man have me at it
busy as usual because i didn't realize
they was thursday Rex this morning I
really did not like whoa weird the week
oh I was uh I have stuff I'm supposed to
do this can't happen to me no I know I
know i sat down thinking you know I'll
crank out these these two articles
before before we do our thing and the
next thing I know I'm halfway through
one of them and it's it's time for us to
get on the air but it's always a welcome
oh I think of it as a break in the day I
get to get out of my own head and get
into yours for a minute so oh it's such
scary but it's fun it's fun it's fun so
um blackberry in the news this week for
a bunch of reasons maybe we'll maybe
we'll stick to the to the product stuff
and now there's been enough said and
written about you know their CEO co-ceos
adventures in the media this week maybe
we'll just leave that one alone yeah not
much you can say about that yeah but
some early reviews of the play book
coming out and you know I think kind of
is expected from my perspective I
haven't yet played with a shipping model
they go on sale next week played with
some of the prototype some of the trade
shows the pre-launch models but you know
it sounds like it's a slick hardware the
new qnx user interface has some good
points and bad points some bugs lots of
software updates apparently being rolled
out even in the review period but for a
lot of people the sticking point is the
sticking point from the beginning the
whole blackberry bridge thing if you
want to get email it's ironic if you
want to get email on your blackberry
tablet you have to have another piece of
hardware within range tethered to it I
don't know you not now that the product
is about to hit the stores give any any
any thoughts on the PlayBook what it
means for
em you know etc etc well I mean I don't
know to tell you what it means for them
and I'm not sure they do either but
they're obviously trying to get this
thing in the enterprise and they'll
probably have a decent shot at that I
mean it's blackberry i mean the the only
down or the only upside to the
blackberry bridge you know method of
using email and contacts and calendaring
requiring of library phone is that means
that employees can personally buy one of
these and go get straight on to their
network right because the the enterprise
the company doesn't even enter into it
so i guess if you if we're going to slap
them around we have to at least give
them a little bit of that's one little
positive no absolutely in there but i
really it does bother me because they're
not I don't believe their intention was
to roll out without those three aky apps
email contacts of calendaring it sounds
more to me like they could get it ready
and that bugs made bread they've been
working on this thing for a long time I
mean they've been talking about it
they've been showing it they've been
bringing it out to trade events you know
they've been having their own press
events with it for months right right
right so I I'm really not ready to cut
them a lot of slack I'm saying you know
what right okay it's almost ready and
that really bugged me like on all the
reviews that you probably noticed this
too I mean every single reviewer to a
person said you know the power button on
this thing it's too small right yes s
it's unusable yeah that to me that is
incredibly disturbing how do you not
catch that right and and when it Alexis
suit they caught let's assume they
caught it how do you not fix that yeah
till everybody's claps around and tells
you this
I have that that bugs yeah that kind of
thing yeah yeah no I agree and yet it
happens what about the whole i did also
read interestingly enough that a couple
people said it's the best the best
mobile device in terms of handling flash
yeah that they've seen which is
interesting which a lot of them compared
it to android what do you make of the
whole you know android apps are going to
run on it and I mean is that something
they were able to throw in about for
telling a future is it you know well
they haven't thrown it in yet no I mean
we can always say anything you want I'm
not sure what that's going to really buy
them yeah they'll probably love for it
to have the ability to run apps just
simply because they can say they can't
and then you go grab apps but they're
never I don't see them ever getting
access to the android market so I'm not
sure what that mean right right and then
they've already said that they're
emulator and they're doing with an
android emulator and they said the
emulator will not run honeycomb which is
the version of Android designed for
tablet apps so I'm thinking personally
that's kind of just throw it out there
and try to make some points off of it
but I'm not sure how that's gonna really
play out for anybody hey I'm going to
get off topic for a second because
because you're talking about Android in
the marketplace made me think of it you
said that the new kindle or the
subsidized kindle with the desktop ads
screensaver ads this week we we talked
about amazon you know a few weeks back
and astor seems like a little little
baby step towards the i think it's
coming but maybe maybe we'll see i think
it's actually a good thing personally
but if that happens but you know if
essentially if carriers can subsidize
the cost of your smartphone by you
signing on for two years you know why
not amazon why not walmart or you know
the gas station or whoever subsidizing
your the gas station doesn't make much
sense the
got the windows on the gas station as a
guy at the gas station can substitute a
blatino makes no sense at all they don't
suppose anything they don't even
subsidize their own gas no no but you
know you I wonder if we could move into
a little bit of a and if it last turn I
don't know a little bit of an age of a
you know add subsidized hardware that
kind of thing I hope dial with pushed
and stuff I don't want to see as I'd
rather pay a little extra and keep keep
them off of there what was the the
internet me there more than one internet
services and the days of dial-up that
you know you had the you could pay for
it or you could get the cheaper or the
free plan but there were just ads all
over your screen and yeah there's still
services that do that today I mean what
are the big online download you know
places that too yeah at fast downloads
or have ads right back to uh so back to
back to the playbook next week you know
you think we'll see I don't know sales
numbers that kind of thing consumer
interest or you think it's they're not
going to give us any numbers they're
gonna they're gonna throw it out there
and I just don't see them given a bunch
of numbers because it's a no-win
situation for them because there's no
way that any of these tablet Lakers can
match what Apple did you know with the
ipad and in the ipad 2 that happens done
it twice now yeah and there's no way
they can match and that's the sole
purpose and throwing numbers out there
so that people can say you know compared
to apple look look what it did wood
versus the ipad and they're all going to
lose that so why even give the numbers
out you think we'll see lines around the
block at office depot or you know people
people hate that that's a snarky
question i'm gonna retract that one from
the record but you think we'll see
people i mean you think two three weeks
from now you know wherever it is i don't
know down by you but you know with me
it's the BART train going from the east
bay in the san francisco and around the
area you know that's always the thing
for me when I see somebody on the train
with the device then it kind of ticks
like you know okay well I thought you'll
see you because I rim with the
blackberry brand I mean we we often talk
about them as if they're going away
right i mean they're still huge you know
and there's still the blackberry is
still probably the I don't know that's a
good question but I bet it still the
number one phone in the enterprise all
bad all right right whatcha anyway I
mean they cut that going for them so
yeah people are going to buy these and
then probably have a better shot at
getting people to buy these than a lot
of the android tablet maker just because
it's black / red but I I think we'll see
them around and it looks like a
compelling hardware like you said and
everyone pretty much confirms that that
they like the hardware and they just
wish you know it was a little more
polished software integration and all
that stuff and that is I think gonna end
up being the biggest question is how
long does it take REM to fix that yeah I
mean now where we don't know but I think
you'll I think you'll start seeing more
playbooks you know on on bart than other
non ipad then zooms then I think so but
you're late yeah oh yeah i think you
will just it's a blackberry all right
timekeeper how we doing yeah we're there
we're there you sit there we're finally
figured out how to how to feet get a
feel for the time hey there you go yeah
we're we're just there it's a good good
dropping off spot an excellent all right
well maybe this time next week we will
we'll have a little hands-on feedback of
our own on the play book or the G Slater
