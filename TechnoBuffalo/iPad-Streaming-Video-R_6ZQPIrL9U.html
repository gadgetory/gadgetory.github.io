TechnoBuffalo here I received a ton of
questions about streaming video on the
ipad how it works in applications and
how it works online rather not a lack of
flash it really hindered my progress
through the web so I'm going to show you
how streaming video works in a variety
of ways and you guys could be the judge
about whether or not lack of flash or
each whether or not html5 really fills
that gap in so let's start with Netflix
now let's give you access to all of
netflix on demand content for free
assuming that you have a netflix
subscription take just a second to load
up now this is the Wi-Fi version i'm not
able to test fees or anything over 3g
but i can show you how this works here
so you can pick any movies you're
actually taken to Netflix's website
things work inside as they would on the
site pick any movie that you want or TV
show so here's something that I played
recently Ghostbusters to go ahead and
hit play start to queue up and plays
actually relatively quickly almost as
fast actually it does on a computer I
just prepares it for playback and
certainly load times are going to depend
on the fidelity of your connection and
we're off it is plying it of course you
can rotate it and it'll go into
landscape mode and quality does look
actually pretty good and audio fidelity
is quite nice so you can watch movies
very easily from netflix let's check out
one of the other probably most popular
streaming video players on the ipad the
ABC player this takes all the content
from the ABC network and puts it right
on your ipad including episodes that are
released just the next day so thursday's
episode of lost is already here but open
this up but you can click through and
sort of see a ton of them I like to show
v you'll go ahead and click on that pic
an episode you can go right to the
episode page get a bit of a preview on
it pick it and just go ahead and hit
play and I'll start to play actually
pretty quickly you get a bit of
commercials you can serve as long
mins or zoom out then you get the
commercial and of course you can rotate
it and you get the full screen then the
episode will start to slice the
commercial between having two let's go
ahead and quit out of that so probably
those are probably the two most popular
implementations of a streaming video in
apps what jl serving video works on the
web and show you some of the more
popular websites so I've got CNN right
here ready to go or at least it was
supposed to be ready to go let's go
ahead and pick one of the CNN videos so
we got a bunless sandwich which sounds
kind of grows and the video plays just
as it would is if you were on cnn's
homepage on your browser you can go
ahead and zoom in as you could zoom out
and you can rotate and of course go to
full screen and it plays very nicely
sort of right in the application all
right in the web page rather let's check
out a few other websites let's go to
ESPN it's like that I go to quite a bit
and we'll see how streaming video works
on ESPN so pick an article it's got a
video let's go to westwood grabs masters
lead and we'll see how the video plays
and how quickly it loads and how well
look so it's funny you actually get a
thing that says get adobe flash or pops
up and then it starts to play which
almost tricked into thinking that it
does have flash but it just loads
actually in QuickTime interview a tiger
wood the same things to apply and you go
ahead and scroll through and so Tiger
Woods talking about the Greens at the
Masters in Augusta show you another site
that I check out quite a bit Ted it's
got some fantastic lecture series from
really really fascinated people if you
haven't checked out Ted so you can go
ahead and pick pick any video you want
here's my seven species of robot that
sounds kind of interesting go ahead and
click that and just as you would expect
you get a play button go ahead and hit
play and just like everything else that
we've seen plays natively
right in the browser their claws on you
guys are getting a sense of how loud the
speakers actually are in the iPad they
are quite loud so you're missing out on
the lack of flash games and other flash
content at least for me as far as
shooting video is concerned I've run
into some compatibility issues on the
iPad but for the most part it's the
eighty percent of the time there are now
iPad compatible websites for iphone
compatible websites that will stream
your content in place the flush think
role you're going to see the number of
those sort of increase as the iPad gains
more market share so guys what do you
think about streaming video on the ipad
is it something that you're you're
impressed with not impressed with the
dude as well as you thought or not as
well as flash a complete deal breaker
for you or do you not care sort of
curious to hear what you guys have to
say anyway jon rettinger from
TechnoBuffalo and for all your tech
information to get more info on flashing
lack of flash HTML flag 5 be sure to
