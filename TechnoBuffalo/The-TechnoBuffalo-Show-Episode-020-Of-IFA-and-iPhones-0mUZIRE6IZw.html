technical Buffalo show on live your to
host for today Sean ani editor-in-chief
of the site i'm joined by executive
editor mobile Todd Hazleton it's up
everybody yes guys joey is still not
here we're trying to figure some stuff
out because he's also hosting morning
twitch streams so if he did that and
then came over here there'd be a lot of
his day even though so we're still
trying to work out the balance there we
miss you hey but that's actually not a
horrible thing because Todd were about
to go into the crazy period yeah insane
you talking about what we said what we
say June was crazy than July was crazy
well what you like July actually was
calm hahaha but I think it's stuck we
could see it picking off you know yeah
when's this coming once it's going in
you know leaks everywhere and now all
those leaks seemingly are coming to
fruition now when do you leave for
Berlin monday i leave on Monday yep
Monday night and I land in the afternoon
Berlin time on tuesday good times good
test for those that don't know why I
Todd is going to Berlin he is headed off
to the annual Aoife conference which is
kind of like the european version of
CEOs yeah and it's actually grown so
much in the past few years and I can I
mean just looking at my calendar this
year it's incredible I remember I first
wants eva maybe maybe five years ago or
something I forget it was when Samsung
first introduced their very first note
tablet and that it was like that the 7
inch version and there I think that was
like the only thing of the show it was
actually really funny one of the only
other things was like the garmin nuvi
phone i want to thank like and I so I
was like scouting the show for just for
that so there were like two products the
hair that we cared about and now it's I
mean my schedule looks just about its
busiest Mobile World Congress which
occurs every year in February and it's
also a major show so this is turning
into you know quite an event well I
remember we sent John
to Aoife I want to say it was 2011 or so
and he came back with like having seen
two three devices right yeah yeah and
now it's just I I've looked at your
schedule it's nuts I mean because now
not only do you have like Samsung you've
also got away and ZTE and HTC in all
back acer lenovo toshiba yeah buddy and
don't forget motorola decided to help
their meeting in chicago right yeah so
we'll also be there I won't be there but
we'll have somebody there for their
event as well which is going to be
exciting because we're expecting the X
plus 1 or expecting the g2 or expecting
pricing and release dates for the Moto
360 smartwatch and then of course you
know right we get back rumor is
September 9th is the iphone event so
whoo yeah which I'm I'm really wondering
if on note 4 or days when we're going to
see the official app you know it
wouldn't surprise me because when was it
it was my 2012 I was in Barcelona for
mobile world congress and i was covering
i think i was i think i remember the
article like best products of Mobile
World Congress that I was writing when
the Apple invites went out for an ipad
event and literally it was like
everything stopped you know you had home
Annja facturers like hundreds of them at
the show and the topic switched apple
and that's what Apple likes to do yep
Steve us 2011 I was sitting in the press
room in the south hall connector and we
got the invites for the verizon iphone
event mm-hmm and the entire press room
just stopped yeah you know we're all
like uh yeah it's pretty well and I
think even I I might be wrong but I'm
almost certain that when samsung
announced the unpacked event for Aoife
uh you know like last week or two weeks
ago pretty sure that's when like
Bloomberg and a wall
shree journal ran their stories talking
about September ninth for the iphone
which seemed you know like little plan
it in there oh yeah did you know how
apple's business works oh no app apples
a master of why pay to go to a show when
you could just send out an invite via
email and everybody stops yeah it's
pretty wild yeah that said we was going
to be super exciting I think I think
we're gonna see a lot of really cool
stuff alright well Sasha Mahal asked
before the show you what else do you
think we'll see it Eva I think we're
going to see a ton yeah stuff um well I
can talk about rumors and yeah you know
so it sounds like note for I mean
Samsung has been pushing videos now
teasing that thing pretty much yeah
there's rumors that there's going to be
some sort of VR headset with that that
that seems to 0 originally we thought it
was going to be more like cardboard
right where you sort of bring your own
display like whether it's note for
something else but then it looked like
recent leaks said it might even have its
own display too so that was I'm confused
about that but then also leaked apks for
the note for suggested VR headset also
and so you start to wonder well if it
requires a CPK is it does that mean that
this is only going to be limited to
Samsung devices or will it support other
phones too my guess is just samsung
phones I don't know that's my guess as
well I mean it's relying on that custom
software yeah wait yeah more bloatware
yeah because if if you don't have a
samsung phone you know yeah i don't know
what we'll see at any time you you tied
to a specific device like that you know
any same song football almost any
samsung phone you know you're you're
narrowing down your market so much right
you know it's I don't know how wise that
is exactly but you know we see it across
the board samsung typically i mean with
their smart watches even write like they
just only work with Samsung products
which you know they sell enough phones
that I don't think they're you're too
worried about it
yeah exactly he's like I like their ties
in powered smartphones and I mean
smartwatches rather and i think that uh
you know if they opened them up i'd
probably consider that at least over
android wear for now they said they saw
the other day they had thousands of apps
available for them to do so yeah yeah so
I I don't know it's gonna be an
interesting show it's it's definitely
becoming a try ometer a trio of a big
shows now with CES Mobile World Congress
and Aoife at least Aoife is a good
distance away from the other to the
other two are like right on top of one
another ya see yes and then you know in
January and then mobile world congress
right again in February's pretty crazy
although it did seem like this year at
CES a lot of the phone news was not
there right right yeah I sorry your
secret stuff like yeah yeah there were
some tablets I think I get the feeling
now that they're starting to save that
more and more for mobile world congress
yeah i think so too especially because
you know i think once upon a time it was
like well here are the phones when i
first started the business you know it
actually even broke down to carriers
like remember when all the carriers had
advanced it was like sprint like here's
what we're offering and verizon here's
what we're offering now it's not really
that much i mean they still hold these
little conferences here and they're like
we were just at sprint last week for the
sharp aquos but i think you know now
it's just like we're selling these all
over the globe and we're gonna you know
will tell you the markets later but
check them out and and then they you
know they make their way here you know
in a lot of different varieties yeah
with mentioning the sharp phone it seems
like the number of phone manufacturers
is growing and I would have thought by
nether web in some form of contraction
right do you think at any point we are
finally going to see a contraction um
yeah I think we'll see people exit the
market but it's I mean look we see it I
think it's gonna take a long time look
at Sony leaving the laptop market for
example right like they were in it
forever but I think everybody wants to
get in
in on the smartphone market and see how
they can do obviously sharps been a huge
brand abroad and now I think with soft
soft thanks ownership and sprint and
their partnerships in Japan with sharp
that's why we're seeing sharp here in
the United States but then you look at
you know one plus in the one plus one
which is just an affordable handset that
we can talk about a little bit here
because I'm still trying to figure out
if i want to buy one but you know i
think that's really yeah I've got mine
right useful but that's kind of like oh
here's this smartphone maker that came
out of nowhere almost right and then you
have Joe me Xiao am I you know show me
with the what's his name from google
over there and they're trying a lot of
interesting things I think they're gonna
probably try to tap into the US market
as well again at lower price points so
you know yeah I think right now we're
gonna see everybody do all that they can
and then whoo-hoo lasts you know is
gonna be a matter for time I mean what
BlackBerry's market share is crashed but
they're even there trying to make a
comeback but you know their market share
is still down yeah yeah so let's go
ahead and jump into the the oneplus here
first thing you said yarn to talk about
that today I'm just I'm confused like I
feel like I don't know if I want to buy
it but I kind of do it just feels like
it's pretty incredible how expensive and
nice it feels mm-hmm I'm afraid to this
is this is technobuffalo this property
and I haven't taken out of my apartment
cuz I'm afraid that I'm gonna scratch it
or like ruin the resale value well funny
cuz you don't usually like I don't
usually worry about that you know like I
mean even even with review units i
obviously I take care of them but for
some reason this thing is just like dang
I mean it's like holding a branding
compare it to a to like the one m8 like
it just feels really nice for like an
iPhone you're like I don't want to drop
this I to me and this sounds so silly a
lot of it is this back panel yeah yeah
yeah absolutely it feels like stone or
her like yeah I know I just it feels so
awesome does it scratch that's what I'm
still worried about I i have really
complain i've not been here
case and I just carried it in my bag and
I haven't seen any scuff thing hmm so
yeah so y esta Todd's debating whether
or not he should get a 1 plus 1 and I I
do have some poems that I've noticed you
know playing with here at my desk ok
Google that command doesn't always seem
to work like I just said it nothing
happened and and on a lot of other
handsets like if I'm not I wouldn't be
surprised if I had a phone here it would
have probably lit up I notice a lot of
them are really good at it like the Moto
X especially but others if the screens
on you know I can almost be like 10 feet
away say ok Google that's I mean again
it didn't even do it here and then my
other problem is um I'll see I just
reset it but I had google now on the
side and when I would swipe to go back
you know to my home screen like I'm
switching between the panels here it
would just it just wouldn't do anything
or like the google it would just swipe
with notification so it didn't feel like
that sensitive but I got to go into the
screen settings and stuff you know play
with it more people obviously love this
phone right no it's a great phone I mean
my only qualm about I'm using on t
mobile and I can't use t-mobile's Wi-Fi
calling that poison anybody yeah stuff
like that like you may not built in but
I'm you know so here's my thought um I
am going to Berlin next weekend
typically when i travel to Mobile World
Congress or Berlin are you I used to buy
a sim card abroad put it in my phone but
then you know one year for whatever
reason I was super busy I couldn't get
calls out to my wife so I can only skype
her at night she was like it and in the
time difference just made it really hard
so I really talked to her that often
during the business trip and so the
following years I've just you know just
paid for it with 18t and I end up
getting about 300 for an dollar bill by
the time I get home I just like I put as
much data on there as I can i think it's
like eight hundred megabytes i go
through that and then it charges me
again charge me again i come home with a
big deal but for me it's worth it yeah
thinking if I buy this phone and and
carriers have come a long way since the
last time that I've tried just getting a
sim card over there I will basically
just offset the costs of that three
and four dollars that i usually peg and
I thought maybe I would bring my own
phone to tmobile and and do their simple
choice plan so that i get the global
roaming and i don't even have to worry
about it you know that that's why i
switched to form a team t to t mobile
was the the global roaming yeah and in
addition to that last year when i went
to the UK i did go ahead i had a spare
phone so i took the mega 6.3 with me and
slapped a three sim card in it mhm and
that was awesome because three does not
do anything some carriers won't let you
use their data for skype calling the
three will so I paid a three's being
great for me to you yeah I paid 15
pounds for the entire month I was only
there a week by paid 15 pounds and I had
unlimited data calls and texts and i
just used skype to call everybody and it
was awesome right so that's what I'm
thinking I'm you know because when you
bring your own phone and t-mobile and
all that stuff I mean I'm not even have
to worry about yeah a contract and I'm
not I'm not I'm not promoting t-mobile
by any means yesterday you're saying
like versus what I would usually pay the
oneplus one or any unlocked phone for
that matter would offset the cost except
for the one plus ones like a super
premium phone at United's kreisman right
and we also realized we we have unique
issues I mean Todd travels outside the
US a couple times a year you know for
technobuffalo and I just go out the
country once a year on vacation and you
know so a lot of people this won't
impact your decision making whatsoever
and we understand that but if you do
travel outside the US at all for
vacation or if you live in another
country he traveled with the US you know
these are things you need to think about
I the first time I ever went to japan in
two thousand i rented a cell phone well
no no that year i did not i didn't do
that until the second year um or did I
don't remember anyway I give you guys
Mike phone remember this yeah well back
then those weren't around yet but yeah I
used for hauling cards to call back home
the second year i went to japan i rented
a cell phone from a company which was an
awesome service i arrived at my hotel
and the phone was waiting for me there
already hit charged up everything nice
popped it out of the bag and had a phone
and i was off to the races but you know
it's amazing how things have changed I
mean if I'd had skype on a regular basis
back then oh the money I would have
saved yeah or we've come I was just
thinking when I said skype phone that
must have been a two thousand six
thousand seven linksys had one neck ear
had one you know the router makers seem
to have been making these roads I still
have some here in my office they were so
cool and now you know it's just like a
nap in your like a yeah I know I I wish
they still I wish more pill standalone
skype phones yes great like my folks
could understand that right yeah yeah
but that was unfortunately that never
caught on yeah that was cool though
because my now wife she was studying
abroad and and so I would have the skype
phone like next to my bed and she would
call you know on her time and and I pick
it up versus you know like then I mean
you only had to rely on a computer and I
wasn't at my computer exactly i was
pretty well yeah it was so we have a
question here from master guy 635 how do
you think of Seuss's SmartWatch is going
to do in the market that's a it's
interesting I mean right now we've said
it pre pre frequently Android wear is so
new that both Sean and I are aren't
super impressed with it but I think
there's potential as soon as could do
well if the rumor said it's coming in at
99 bucks or $149 true i mean that's
really undercutting every other the
Android wear SmartWatch by you know a
hundred bucks really good margin more
than a hundred bucks in some cases 229
if they come in at 100 bucks um but you
know I think apple is still like you
still wear the pebble I think it's still
the best option right there on the
market but for people who might have
been holding out on the pebble because
that's also more expensive than the
rumors for this use price
and then people who might be looking at
the Moto X if that comes in at like 250
right then I mean I think they could do
well and really push enjoyed where well
it depends how they position it too I
mean if it comes to us that kind of
stuff yeah now if it trill does come at
$99 that's almost impulse buy these days
right exactly especially for someone who
has a known as SmartWatch yet they're
like I want to see what this is about no
you know I have android and why not yeah
you know yeah exactly quickly going back
to the one plus one for just second
Sasha Mahal ask how's the battery life
on the oneplus one really good really
good I can easily get through like a day
and a half ooh nice I haven't used my
enough to figure that out like I said
I'm afraid to use it as a daily driver
yeah so benjamin mcdonald s do you think
that the Moto X plus 1 or as i like to
call it the Moto Z will have metal
corners hmm it looks like i don't know
about corners but it looked like it had
a metal I mean the leaks I thought
looked like it had some kind of metal
stripe around it but you can never you
know you can't tell it's so hard these
days like even LG honestly tricked me
after the press conference um when they
use the word metallic I honestly thought
like oh that means metal but it doesn't
metallic means metal looking mm-hm and
it certainly was metal looking and so
like you know these manufacturers are
gonna try to to get us to think
everything premium about these devices
ahead of time so you know look at
everybody else am son's got the faux
metal borders on their phones they've
had that for a while so whether or not
motorola does it or not you know i don't
know but i would expect if it does that
it's going to be more expensive yeah
positive middle yeah we'll just have to
see Sasha mahalo asks a question that
I'm not too familiar with what do you
think could be the fourth item on
motorola September fourth event invite
what did they mention for devices I
don't know I'd have to look at the
invite let me bring it up be the Moto X
plus 1 the moto g2 they'll probably talk
about the Moto 360 yeah
um every not just as every choice is a
new adventure was there I don't know if
there were four things I mean we were
expecting a lot of things from Motorola
in the coming months I mean you know I
think there's rumors that Motorola's
building the new Nexus I wouldn't be
surprised to see motorola refresh its
portfolio of droid devices on Verizon
there's been a lot of rumors there and
they did it actually I think last year
they I'm almost positive they refresh
the droid devices on verizon before the
Moto X because I remember them talking
about the processor and the voice
controls and then we saw the Moto X n so
that brought it all together yeah yeah
exactly speaking of that sajan bahala i
also asked do you think montréal will
be making the next Nexus and could we
see a tease of the upcoming even an
impossible and answer in october
november i think that all right look I
don't know what's going on with the
Nexus right now yeah I mean either but
I'm gonna guess that's fully in Google's
hands especially you know I don't know
in this transition to Lenovo's actually
gonna take place like when it's going to
be finalized right because lenovo is by
motorola mobility but that doesn't mean
I mean motorola can still build up the
nexus for google it doesn't have to be
owned by the company to do that
obviously LG built the last one but i
don't think we'll see it teased or
mentioned that discreet that's just mike
i agree i would take i think well we'll
see I such and I think october-november
is probably I mean Google's promised
Android L the full release I don't know
it's going to be called right in this
this fall and I think when that's
released maybe we'll see the Nexus at
the same time right like here's the
device that runs that software I don't
expect that that will come in Chicago
next week ya know Google will want that
for their own event or their own
announcement it they're not going to let
somebody else take the glory on that I
don't think right damn it we're getting
close though I mean I figure October's
when we're going to see Android L
lollipop whatever that they end up
calling it Yeah right must
who knows what they're going to do with
it let's see from Benjamin McDonald
would you buy a chromecast or wait for
Android TV devices it's good question
mmm i love the chromecast um you know
it's on you on your use case for me I
put and I guess I could do this to an
indoor TV comes out but I take the
chromecast and I put my backpack and you
know what I'm at a hotel I'll use it
there you know with the Wi-Fi when it's
available and stuff like that but
Android TV seems like something that
i'll leave in my living room and so and
so i think i have a use case scenario
for it because otherwise my chromecast
hits in my bedroom and that's where i
use it mostly because i have all these
Xbox and Playstation and all that stuff
here yeah I you know the chromecast was
impressing at first but it's I think
it's use cases are dropping actually
yeah below I mean Google's promised all
these features right and letting
screencasting you can do now and stuff
like that but I do think it's limited
and that's why they're doing Android TV
but for you know 30 bucks I think it's
get out yeah the boys uh from Sid hunts
khatam my apologies if I mispronounced
that what do you think about the LG G
watch our is there another LG watch ping
again it's a it's rumored for Berlin a
round version of the g wash oh that's
right that's right i do i had i forgot
about the name ok yeah the round one i I
think round ones are going to end up
being the winners yeah i think i agree i
mean here's here's my regular watch I'm
just so you know I'm used to the round
one I know regular watches come in
rectangles and squares too but it's just
it seems to me more natural to have a
round watch but I haven't used the 360
yet either so yeah I know I mean I like
the pebble but i think i would like to
go back to round yeah doubles gotta work
on their design I mean I get it it's
it's early right it's a Kickstarter
product well yeah I know and the pebble
steel looks
really nice but still you know I think I
think that he needs to I mean I'm of two
minds with the pebble for those of you
watching on video if you've never seen
it ill the three buttons here they're so
chunky but I also understand I mean
they're easy for me to push yeah but
they're also really chunky like I mean
it's a great product and it works really
really well I just think it could look
better yeah exactly even even the steel
which I think looks better yes it does
it does look better is it true that HTC
is making excess 9 who knows big shrugs
I don't know that'd be awesome I like
these products but see at the same time
that I think the 7-inch tablet is the
sweeter form factor I mean when you get
up unless they're making a 7am on right
and then you know what happened to the
talks of 82 yeah well and remember
shortly after the nexus 7 last year
there was a mysterious tablet that
showed up in one of Google's pages hmm
that looked like an eight and we never
heard another word on that mystery
tablet yep yep you know which I just
love when we have to study pictures and
go is that definitely no yeah is that
real hey Ike it's hard hard some days
our jobs uh yeah because sometimes these
companies just put in like you know a
place older picture just like anybody
else would yeah exactly and it makes all
of us go what is that from master guys
635 what are your thoughts on OS is like
Android auto and apple carplay I think
they're a great idea yeah they sound
awesome but I think I've said this in
other shows I have an older car you know
i just i put i put my iphone or my
android device strike right up in the
cradle and that's great for me yeah I
mean I I Drive a 99 Tahoe I mean I'm not
going get to take advantage of any of
the stuff i think i have a 2001 explorer
I don't even know a year is doesn't
six-member but that being said you know
it
I I like the idea of anything that
lessens your potential distractions yeah
for sure yeah so yeah especially when it
comes to like voice controls and all
that you know bigger buttons I mean
because that's where it's built for
versus my phone on the dashboard I'm
like ah yeah pythons passenger seat
track it to it a question more directed
at me from sasha hall what do you think
of the roku powered TVs and this is more
towards sean because his parents have a
preference to use roku um I'm of two
minds the biggest problem like for
instance my folks have a Samsung
television with built-in apps you know
for netflix and hulu and all that but it
is so clunky and so slow that it's
easier for them to use a roku connected
to that television so i think a lot of
it is going to depend on how responses
and how quick the roku interface is when
it's built into the television itself
exactly that being said I think that you
know it's the cost of these televisions
because they're coming from to
lesser-known makers hisense and I think
it's TCL or TLS it's a tee something TLC
and yes but they're coming from two
lesser makers so they're already lower
priced so when you deduct the cost of
the roku and you know say you buy a roku
3 which is one hundred dollars that
makes these TVs really cheap because you
don't have that costs on top of it I I'm
going to have to play with one before I
make a final decision but i'm i'm
intrigued by it and i hope it works out
yeah me I'd rather get the roku and
connect it because I mean exactly like
you're saying the software on these TVs
is just waaah i don't think i've ever
used it because it's so blah my parents
used to until i finally one day watched
how long it took for netflix to lodos
like i'm buying your roku yeah writing
interface just terrible a terrible it's
sluggish but did you see like webos on
LG
tvs and that's it what's difference yeah
I mean I when I saw webos demonstrated
at CES this year it looked fantastic
mmhmm yeah but also i mean the
manufacturers are finally putting in
more powerful processors so exactly who
ever thought we'd need to talk about
processors and our televisions well when
you use Snapdragon 400 processors on our
wrists with Android wear it's exactly
exactly from master guys 635 what do you
think happened to the galaxy s5 google
play edition that was teased on the
android com website that's a really good
question i don't know what ever happen
to that I mean they had a full press in
each other right maybe yeah I what's
going on with google play editions in
general right now they all seem to be
disappearing yeah I don't know you know
but at the same time those are mainly
for developers so it could just be oh
hey we aren't selling any ya know and
plus how many developers just route the
devices and throw the Oh basic android
on there anyway right right or as you
know they probably bought the nexus 5
when it came out and building apps on
that gotcha okay let's see here Oh from
sasha hall what are your thoughts on
amazon buying twitch for 979 and
everyone thought it would be Google
instead well from what we hear google
was talking to them but the talks fell
through there was somebody else i heard
was involved in the talks i can't
remember who it was like a one-off
mention that they had also talked to
them was he yahoo am i making that up
yahoo it was yahoo thank you hey but
Yahoo's going around trying to buy
everybody right now yeah I think it
would have been good buy for Yahoo
especially if they're trying to compete
with YouTube on some level I think for
amazon i think the big play here is
going to be like this game purchase it
on amazon buttons I mean you guessed
early you've got 24 7 advertising for
all these games that Amazon sells it
just it makes sense now was it working 9
inherent 70 million dollars
well hey I think nine hundred seventy
million is pretty good considering the
twitch numbers when you when you look at
what was it last night a private equity
firm invested in snapchat giving it a 10
billion dollar value snapchat I mean
look it I think twitch twitch is
entertaining it's awesome it's bringing
in this whole new level of gaming and
even eSports and snapchats I'm not even
again to what I think about snapchat but
no people use it but I think also if you
look at it twitch for Amazon I'm curious
if they if they want to sort of create
their own ad network there which could
extend to mobile obviously where you
have twitch on mobile devices if you
have it and then across other people's
platforms I mean when you're viewing ads
on your Xbox and stuff anybody wants in
on that so amazon could enter where
otherwise google would be you know I bet
they they jump in real quick speaking of
Amazon mobile for a moment shall we
address these rumors that they only sold
thirty thirty five senses I know my
goodness talk about a long Wow yeah
there's rumors that they only sold
35,000 fire phones which I mean does not
surprise me given the reviews given what
we've seen with that phone it actually
just as I started that we got a question
behalf from Saddam uh it's if it's a
it's not a good phone that's me and
that's why I got home prices awww
exclusivity the exclusivity I think was
a big boo-boo and that as absolutely no
slam on eighteen t that is just a Gerald
business thing you're you're narrowing
your potential market down by millions
right you know if they had opened this
up I think a lot of the problem is
Amazon's name is so associated with you
know discounted products and they
released the phone at a price that was
like any other phone right I I think
that was a lot of the problem if that
phone had come in around the pricing of
the one plus one I would have bought one
that day right and would now regret it
yeah and would regret it exactly what I
and that's you know the software is
cobbled there too I mean it's you you're
not getting google play services you're
not getting all the android apps that
you could with a phone that cost the
same price from somebody else and there
aren't enough software features on the
fire phone to make that to offset that
problem right I mean and it feels very
much like a oh we've now given you a
tool that you can buy our stuff anywhere
you want anytime yeah exactly and you
can still do that from other phones it's
like like you can always buy from amazon
my gift amazon it up all the time when
I'm shopping this you know Chuck a price
right yeah you know so I I think that if
those numbers are true I think Amazon's
got a very large life it lesson that
cost them a ton yeah but and you have to
wonder how many phones that they build
and now what are they going to I mean
they have a what kind of contractor they
have with ATT at what point can they say
here this phones 350 bucks by it yeah I
don't know it's I think there was a lot
of factors contributing to these numbers
if they're true right if they're true
but I mean I mean that's really low but
I also don't think they're selling like
gangbusters I mean we know that so so
they're they're probably not great
either way yeah I who knows from Breton
Franco is is t be going to test a boon
to touch latest image on Nexus 5 maybe I
hope you test it yeah it's there's so
many things going on right now that's
hard for us to find time to do all them
unfortunately so it's quite possible and
I will pass it on to the folks in Irvine
who filmed the majority of the videos
also from breasts and Franco I just want
to address this for a second are you
just fighting about phil fish definitely
canceling foes to phil fish has made
so many announcements that next week he
could come back and go I change my mind
at this point I don't harass anything
Phil fish says no matter how definite
ease as it is oh good one for you Todd
from master guys 635 what do you think
about the HTC One m8 for Windows and how
do you think it will sell that's a
really good question well we know it's
coming to 18 tea too at some point after
an exclusivity with verizon um I'm not
sure how it's going to sell I me when
you look at the windows phone market
shared suggests that it's growing slowly
and I think this is a really awesome
piece of hardware for Windows Phone to
exist on and I think it gives at least
for HTC an awesome option to consumers
they can choose Android if they want it
and they can choose windows phone if
they want it and they did a really good
job that said I've talked to other
people you know the industry some people
really love it and some people don't
like it because it lacks some of the
requirements and other windows phones
have right like the dedicated camera
button it doesn't have that and I think
you know for some people who are used to
Windows Phone are upgrading to Windows
Phone they might want that yeah but
that's any you know nokia camera is not
there and stuff like that but you do get
HT won't if she sees a quite always get
this mixed up there duo camera setup
yeah it's pretty neat you get that you
get the different effects that you can
blow out the background stuff like that
too but you can do that on Nokia's
smartphones I think it's a really great
device I don't know how well it's going
to sell because I don't know how well
windows phones are selling right now
enjoy but it's a good option yeah but
you know the thing is do you think that
the issue with Windows Phone taking off
has been a matter of lack of options for
the handset or is it just that people
are not that interest in the OS um I
think it's been the OS because and
that's that sort of drives this I mean
like I don't know how well the HTC one's
gonna sell because you know no key has
been here making awesome handsets nokia
phones are great but they're just not
selling and i think that does come down
to the OS the app gap is closing slowly
I mean you do get some stuff that people
really like but you're all
so lacks a lot like I use pocket and
there's you know for saved articles and
stuff like that and there are
third-party pocket options on windows
phone but they cost you know to box and
then there's there's no snapchat which I
know some people actually care about I
don't and that'll cost you a couple
bucks for the competitors on Windows
Phone they're built by somebody else I
still think you know things like
Instagram aren't as good on Windows
Phone that's just me I just don't think
that the whole interface looks is great
and I also think you know there's
lacking areas were like Foursquare which
I think made a huge mistake splitting up
for square into swarm and foursquare but
like it's telling when this company
right like they totally ignored windows
phone with that update I mean they put
swarm there but foursquare is silly old
Foursquare and like I just like so
confusing and it seems weird when you're
going through the windows phone store
and seeing like these legacy apps like
did they just not care i mean like poet
or something i don't know i just
speaking to foursquare for a man I used
to be an avid foursquare user yeah meets
here badges so fun I've barely opened it
since it became swarm I don't use it
anymore actually switched to using Yelp
more these days yeah I that was the
biggest mistake from for a my payoff for
him in the end but those of us that were
loyal I couldn't care less now yeah I
liked earning badges you know I
immediately was made it was just fun
it's like they mean anything no I didn't
mean anything but it was gamification
you know it that was a big thing for me
heck remember kawal yeah wow thank you
gar na Cola uh so one last question here
I think this is really interesting one
to end on from brezin Franco is the rise
of Chinese manufacturers popularity
going to affect the standard 700 about
our price tag of flagships I hope so
yeah you have to I mean blue one plus
one is very much a phone that would cost
seven hundred dollars from somebody else
so I think so but we need when you look
at the market share offered by Samsung
and Apple I mean they're not I don't
think those prices are coming down
anytime soon but I do think the carriers
are trying to move away from the current
kind of subsidy model we see that with
their you know switches to things like
next and and edge on verizon and what
everything where you pay like zero
dollars down then 17 bucks a month is
pay off the price of the phone I don't
know yeah I think that's going to be a
very interesting because it like you
said with them moving away from the
subsidies you know it's going to become
that much more appealing to try a
lower-cost phone and yeah while Samsung
and Apple have this huge market share
right now okay i can pay seventeen
dollars a month for this poem or i can
pay thirty-six dollars a month for this
one right you're like yeah and that's
going that may actually end up working
in the advantage of these other
manufacturers because instead of the
subsidy price being 199 199 and the
other price is being hidden this is much
more up front now yeah and for whatever
reason I mean we I've always said it's
funny all have friends come up to me and
be like you know should I I'm just gonna
use this as an example should i buy the
iphone 5c or the iphone 5s the 5s is 200
hours 5 c's half that at $99 and when
they walk into the store that I've
always said by the pedal tones gonna
last you have a two-year contract
rightly that your the monthly fees
you're paying that hunted all our
difference is negligible afternoon 14
months so I say by the better phone but
still consumers are like well you know I
don't have 200 bucks right now which is
fine i'm not saying everybody should
have 200 bucks but now with this new
pricing model go in at zero dollars down
and you can pay thirty seven dollars
next month and the next month or the
next month and then it doesn't seem you
know as expensive and then carriers when
I mean because you're selling mortgage
that's the phone to you yeah but you
know you have the moto x was a great
example of a lower-priced phone now you
have the oneplus one I think we're gonna
see Huawei we're going to see Joe me all
these players come into the market at
lower price tags and maybe that will
force the other competitors but I'm not
so sure that they're shaking in their
boots because they have such huge market
shares
