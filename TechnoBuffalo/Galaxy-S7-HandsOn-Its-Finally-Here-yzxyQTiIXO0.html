from technobuffalo here we are at Mobile
World Congress 2016 taking a look at the
latest flagship from Samsung it comes
after the s6 so feast your eyes on the
appropriately named Galaxy s7 while
things might look similar on the outside
there's a lot of new things happening
both on the outside and the inside
you've got a 5.1 inch display 2560 x
1440 this guy though now is ip68 water
and dust resistance which means you can
take it in five feet of water for 30
minutes so if you're not gonna dive in
the deep end you can let it be your lap
counter while you're swimming colors
relatively similar to last year though
now the black onyx replacing what kinda
was a dark blue but the gold which was
my favorite of last year will also be in
the u.s. to start but no white at first
the United States so you're on a white
phonegap imported everything old is new
again and back on the Galaxy s7 is
expandable storage built right into the
SIM tray I can support 200 gigs of micro
SD card support but samsung says upgrade
to higher capacities when it becomes
available but because we now have
external storage it's gonna be 32
gigabytes only in the US internal so go
buy an SD card Samsung has always
brought to thunder with their cameras so
you'd expect that to be the same with
this flagship taking pictures for you is
going to be a 12 megapixel sensor with
dual pixel technology that Sam Smith's
claims have been used in DSLRs we get
brighter F 1.7 lens with larger 1.4
micron pixels so what this all going to
boil down to is really really fast
autofocus just to benchmark adverse
talash gens s6 the s7 is gonna capture
ninety-five percent more light because
each camera pixel is fifty-six percent
larger fun fact you're not be wondering
how much faster or overall better word
this is in last gens s6 will hear some
numbers to help satisfy the curiosity
the cpu thirty percent faster and the
GPU sixty-four percent faster also on
board with the galaxy s7 is an aod which
is a fancy way of saying always on
display gitesh notifications calendar
your personalized with the background
the biggest change I'm looking forward
to the s7 is in the VAT
department it is now three thousand
milliamp hours plus the newest fast
charging technology introduced in the
note 5 and galaxy s6 edge+ so it'll
charge really fast and of course other
things you'd expect like Samsung tight
basically the same fingerprint reader is
the last gen oh the metal around the
edges is now gone while we don't yet a
price you expect it to be coming soon
and to every major carrier in the US
there are a lot of changes break the
surface of the galaxy s7 that make it a
very worthy successor to the really
popular and very good-looking galaxy s6
but is enough to make you upgrade enough
to make you ditch your old android phone
or your iOS device to pick up layers
from Samsung up to you what you guys
think leave it in the comment down below
until next time I'm John Rankin
