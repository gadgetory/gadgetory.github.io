TechnoBuffalo with a review of the Canon
Powershot SX 260 HS is this power pack
jack-of-all-trades the model for you
find out in my full review ladies and
gentlemen welcome to my Canon Powershot
SX 260 HS review this camera is going to
be very popular on the shelves at Best
Buy your local electronics store and
I'll tell you why throughout this review
the sx260 HS replaces last year's SX 230
HS a camera that brought GPS and a few
other advanced features to the table for
2012 Canon has added quite a few new
features to its compact mega zoom camera
first we'll discuss design the Canon
Powershot SX 260 HS now has a rubberized
right hand grip so it's a little bit
easier to hold and Canon also abolished
that unsightly GPS hump that was found
on the SX 230 now the top of the camera
is nice and flush the zoom has been
increased from a 14 X optical now to a
20x optical zoom and the lens has a
wide-angle capability of 25 millimeters
compared to last year's 28 on the
downside the sx260 HS now has a slower
base aperture it has an F 3.5 aperture
compared to the SX 230 s f 3.1 aperture
that's about a stop difference and I
believe it made an impact in low-light
shooting
although the camera's battery
performance was not one of the best I've
seen I found that this battery pack
offered a little bit more juice than the
SX 230 s one of the best things about
the sx260 HS is that the flash does not
pop up automatically when you power the
camera on it only pops up when you
select flash in the menu system now with
this extra space on top I think Canon
should have taken the mode dial and
migrated it up here because it's very
easy to inadvertently select modes while
you're trying to fiddle with the shutter
button or zoom toggle and lastly Canon
carried over the same 460 k3 inch
display as found on the SX 230 HS and
since this camera is $50 more I think we
needed at least bare-bones minimum on
921,000 pixel display Canon
packed a lot of new and intriguing
features into this model first off we'll
start with the Smart Auto mode which has
been increased from 32 predefined scenes
to 58 predefined scenes what I found was
a better auto mode that proved itself as
one of the best auto modes in the
point-and-shoot market this camera still
has those fun lovable digital filter
effects like toy camera miniature and
color accent there are a gaggle of scene
modes on the sx260 HS and we could still
make color filter adjustments now for
manual controls this cameras pretty
power packed it has a 15 second shutter
it has an ISO that goes up to 3200 and
it has plenty of white balance options
on the downside I found the aperture
range to be very short f3 point 5 2 F
8.0 is really nothing to write home
about I also wasn't crazy about the
manual focus with this LCD screen
resolution is very difficult to really
fine-tune the focus and overall I found
this camera to be a little bit slower
than its competition slow to autofocus
slow to make some menu adjustments
lastly the GPS feature works very well
on this camera it takes a little while
to get an initial signal maybe 5 to 10
minutes but once you do the Canon map
utility with Google Maps is a fantastic
program just be sure if you do GPS
logging to turn it off before you go to
bed because you'll wake up with a dead
canon in the morning now let's talk
about some of the more unconventional
features Canon injected into the sx260
HS first off there's a new face ID
system this camera can actually record
up to 12 predefined faces all you have
to do is take a picture of the subject
fill in a little information about them
as far as their name and their birthday
and every time that same subject appears
in frame their name will appear and the
camera will adjust the exposure and the
focus to their beautiful visage gimmicky
yes but I did find that it worked then
there's a new live mode in live mode the
camera gives you sliders you can go dark
to light neutral to vivid
cool to warm this is very similar to
Nikon slider system that they debuted a
couple years ago on their coolpix
point-and-shoot lineup and then there
was a discreet mode in discreet mode
which is signified by an icon of what I
assume to be a librarian executing the
gesture all camera sounds an operation
volume
are completely silenced I renamed
discrete mode to paparazzi mode and then
I renamed that to stalker mode so
overall the canon powershot sx60 HS is
one of the most power packed as far as
features go from a compact mega zoom
camera and now it's image quality time
what's under the hood of the canon
powershot sx60 HS we have a 1 over 2.3
inch HSC MOS sensor the same sensor
found on last year's SX 230 HS but the
one difference is that we now have a new
digit 5 processor it's faster what does
that mean high-speed burst
HQ shooting that's ten point three
frames per second burst mode at full
resolution the results were very great
so if you're planning on taking a lot of
fast action shots this is a great camera
to do it with now when it came to the
great spectrum of photography this
camera was great in ideal lighting
situations that includes well-lit macro
scenarios and subdued landscapes but in
several dynamic shooting scenes where
you had a big backlight and a shadowy
foreground this camera tended to
overexpose and blow out so a lot of the
times I had to rely on the exposure
compensation
now that's an easy adjustment for an
advanced shooter to make but most
beginners will think that exposure
compensation is some kind of deep
psychological complex low-light exposure
was pretty decent with the sx260 HS
however certain high ISO images were a
bit muddy as far as noise goes another
thing about low-light is that the auto
white balance on the Canon Powershot SX
260 HS is fairly weak
everything exposed yellow so I had to
rely on a manual white balance in many
low-light scenarios the sx260 HS shoots
1080p 24 frames per second videos HD
videos the quality is very good I was
quite impressed with the videos from
this camera but I needed a more
extensive video control suite like you
find on Panasonic's and Panasonic's are
shooting a VC HD video at 60 frames per
second that's pretty superior to what
you find with 24 frames per second so as
far as image quality goes with the Canon
Powershot SX 2 6 ths it's a very good
performer however it needs a little
it needs user input in order for you to
get the most out of this camera and
that's not going to be a good thing for
most beginners now it's time for the
buffalo call with the canon powershot
essex 260 HS my advice is to go for a
Canon Powershot SX 230 HS because the
price will likely drop now or wait for
my review of the panasonic lumix DMC
cs20 coming up soon but for now this has
been the Canon Powershot SX - 6 ths
review for all image samples and videos
be sure to go to TechnoBuffalo comm I'm
Mike Pearlman I'll see you guys later
what did it do to die today at a minute
or two to two a thing distinctly hard to
say it harder still to do she beat it a
2 at 22 to with the rata tatata tatata 2
and the dragon will come and here is a
drum and a minute to tootle 2 today a
minute or two to do it's how I warm up
