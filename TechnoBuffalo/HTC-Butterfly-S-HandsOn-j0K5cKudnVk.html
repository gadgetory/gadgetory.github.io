we are doing a hands-on of the HTC
butterfly yes all right so here it is
the HTC butterfly yes this is a very
interesting phone and we'd also like to
thank Negri electronics for getting us
this fabulous device since is not here
in the States here's one thing that is
very different than your standard HTC
one that we've been so used to seeing
there's no aluminium back this is great
a plastic so it's it's a little
fingerprint II I know if you hold it for
a few minutes it definitely picks up the
fingerprints and can get very very
smudgy which I'm not a huge fan of but
you know it's nice to see something a
little bit different as you can see it
does have Beats Audio onboard and some
red accents around of the camera which
looks pretty nice I kind of like that
the red accents continue through to the
boom sound speakers on the front of the
device they continue to terrify and
amaze me boom Santa is one of those
technologies that I don't know how we
started with speakers on the backs of
phones before I add this seems like such
an obvious no-brainer at this point that
you know boom sound is I'm a little
spoiled by it I'm gonna be honest
powers are sleep button right here on
top headphone jack and you know
something that I really like of course
your SIM tray but also a micro SD slot
this comes with 16 gigs of storage
onboard and of course it's a little bit
less after the software has been
installed but you also get up to 64
gigabytes of expandable storage on here
with a micro SD card so that's a big
huge bonus so let's take the phone out
of its deep dark sleep and of course we
have since five the beautiful sense 5
with blinkfeed you get your highlights
all that good stuff once you set it up
it'll show you all of your things in a
very Flipboard Eska manner if you've
ever used Flipboard and of course
swiping to the right will show you all
of your standard Android home screen
functionality actually really like this
this is I'm a huge fan of the way that
they've done this sort of quick settings
here and then also into your deeper
settings here's everything that
going on with phone but I'm gonna go
into about because you know it can't
hurt to look at our software information
you can see this is running Android
version 4.2.2 and since five like I
mentioned before no 4.3 yet on the
horizon that we've heard of at least
from HTC but considering it just came
out earlier I'll about a week ago I'm
not too concerned about it so I'm sure
we'll hear more about when we can expect
4.3 for all of HTC's flagship devices in
the coming weeks and months uh let me
show you a little bit of a comparison
here in this hands-on I'm gonna bring in
the Droid DNA so here's the DNA and I
have to mention that if we're bringing
in this phone we also have to bring in
the original butterflies so I'm gonna
have three of these phones you can see
they all have the red accents on the top
all have the front-facing cameras in the
upper left side of their screen they are
all in fact five inch screens with 1080p
they have 441 PPI they're all stunning
I'm not gonna lie it's pretty amazing
HTC has some beautiful design choices
and of course their screens are no
different so I'm a big big fan of that 5
inch 441 PPI screen very very well done
here's the difference between old sense
and the most current version I believe
this is sense for if I'm not mistaken
but let's take a look let's go over to
our about and check out our software
information 4.1.1 and sense 4 plus so we
are looking in fact at sense 4 on this
device this is the Droid DNA on the
right and the HTC butterfly on the left
the original butterfly there's a few
differences between the original and the
new one so like I said they all have the
same screen the original butterfly had a
Snapdragon s4 quad-core 1.5 gigahertz
processor
this one's upped the ante a little bit
with a Snapdragon 600 quad-core
processor and that's clocked at 1.9
gigahertz so definitely some more speed
on this bad boy it's got 2 gigs of RAM
just like the original butterfly but
this one like I said expands storage
wise up to 64 gigs as opposed to the 32
gigs that you'd be able to add on to the
original butterfly
now the Droid DNA if we're all recalling
correctly no expandable storage wah-wah
that's where we play the sad trombone
music this one that has the four ultra
pixel camera on the back just like the
HTC one so you are getting a camera
upgrade here from the 8 megapixel of the
HTC butterfly the original and the big
news on this one for me anyway is
battery life because originally both the
Droid DNA and the original HTC butterfly
had two thousand twenty milliamp
batteries this one really ups the ante
it's got a 32 hundred milli amp battery
onboard so this is definitely gonna get
you through the day and on top of that
it's also a good thing considering
you're running a 1080p screen so if you
were complaining about the battery life
on your droid DNA because of that large
beautiful gorgeous 1080p screen you
probably won't have the same problems on
this lovely butterfly ass that is it for
me on the hands-on I mean if you are
curious about sense 5 and you want to
learn more about it you can check out
our HTC one review we do cover sense 5
pretty in-depth on that review and yeah
it's a great device I'm hoping at some
point we'll see a version of this come
to the States unfortunately as of right
now there are no release plans for the
States but this device is available in
overseas so I highly recommend if you're
into the butterfly line of devices this
one is yet another killer it's fantastic
I am really enjoying using it and that
is our hands-on for the HTC butterfly s
once again thanks to Negri electronics
