technobuffalo here with a review for you
of the samsung mythic this is going to
run you 199 on a two-year contract after
rebates for AT&amp;amp;T Wireless so let's talk
about the good then we'll get to the bed
and then we'll get to a conclusion so
this is running Samsung's TouchWiz
interface have demonstrated before in
countless videos what that means it's
got a widget bar across the left hand
side you can drag those widgets right
off onto your home screen and as I've
lamented in previous samsung touchwiz
phone reviews there's not enough screen
real estate on the phone for all the
widgets they take up a lot of space well
samsung to fix that with the mythic and
now give you access to three home
screens to get much more space to put
all of your widgets and the
functionality that you're getting with
those widgets saying would it's quite a
bit is what you'd expect there's a
Facebook one there's a message one
there's a Miss calls one there's one for
all your notifications then there's even
one for your friends birthdays you're
not getting functionality that's sort of
new or anything you're not used to
you're just getting that functionality
in a new widget based interface with
three home screens so one of the other
good things about the device is the
keyboard keyboard is quite easy to use
I've been a big fan of the TouchWiz s
keyboards other Samsung devices and that
holds true to the mythic it's very
simple to use that actually works quite
well one of the other positive of the
device is it takes advantage of ETS new
TV service so you can watch mobile TV on
the go and it's not that mobile TV that
you're used to wear it streams it over
to 3g service it's actually uses a new
sort of qualcomm services you're getting
actual channels and you're getting
really nice quality it's not pixelated
like you'd expect and this is of course
a 3g phone but it uses sort of a
separate radio for that so let's talk
about bad i'm not the biggest fan of
resistive touchscreens that i've
mentioned at the past and the samsung
mythic uses a resistive touchscreen and
now it does a user resistive touchscreen
it probably uses the worst resistive
touchscreen I have ever used on a mobile
phone the screen is extremely
unresponsive it's very inaccurate
scrolling around through contacts
brian has rolled through web pages which
I'll get to in a minute was a tedious
arduous task and not something I could
ever see myself doing on a daily basis
Samsung in the past has done a pretty
decent job with resistive screens and
i'm not sure why that didn't translate
over to the mythic perhaps it's a new
vendor or some sort of new receptive
technology but straight up just doesn't
work and for that reason alone I've got
a very difficult time in good conscience
telling you to go pick up the mythic
give it its price point and feature set
I just don't think it justifies it it is
a phone however and it's got to make
phone calls the reception was quite good
i'll be able to get strong bars
everywhere I went I didn't have any
dropped calls so the radio in here is
quite good that may be due to also do
tooi gmt strong service where I live in
Southern California navigation is done
through a series of icons across the
bottom I'll sure what that looks like
you got your dial your contact in your
menu and there's some new features yeah
the TouchWiz you can control your menu a
little bit more you can scroll around
see I gotta push really hard in order to
scroll so overall it is not an enjoyable
experience and not a phone that I can
recommend to you unfortunately the HTML
browser is barely functional and it's
barely functional because you can't move
around on it due to the poor resistive
touchscreen so I got to rank this on a
one-to-five scale it gets a to get only
gets to two stars because a call quality
was quite good and speakerphone was loud
everything else not very good the 3.2
megapixel camera takes garbage pictures
even with autofocus and an LED flash I
put this one probably towards the bottom
of your list there's a lot better phones
and 18 keys lineup especially this
holiday season so anyway guys hope you
enjoyed for exclusive content check me
