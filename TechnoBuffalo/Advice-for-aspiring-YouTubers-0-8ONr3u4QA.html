technology reviewer now there are
certainly many many many reviewers
professional and amatuer that have
achieved much more success than I have
in my year and a half on YouTube I've
gotten a little bit of notoriety but
certainly nothing that compares to some
of the major guys but I have learned a
thing or two so I'm gonna try and share
it with you guys in hopes of helping the
younger generation or some of the new
technology reviewers so I hope you guys
find this helpful the first thing is
stick with it one of the things a lot of
new reviewers do is they make one or two
videos they only get 20 or 30 views and
you really get discouraged and that's
natural and it's human nature but stick
with it keep making your videos your
views will gain people will take notice
your subscribers will go up it just
takes time you know the old expression
rome wasn't built in a day same thing
here
you guys just gotta stick with it for
some people it might take a month or two
months before people start to take
notice for others it may take five six
months or even longer but if you're
passionate about it and you believe in
yourself you know it'll show in the
videos so just stick with it don't be
one of the people that just fades out
and don't give something that you want
to do don't give up so that segues
nicely into the next point and that's
show confidence really if you show
confidence in your videos people are
gonna take you a little more seriously
you might not know the greevey theory
might at all might not always be right
but people want to take note and listen
to somebody who has confidence in what
they're saying so feel good about
yourself
it's tough sitting in front of a camera
being judged by potentially thousands or
millions of people you know but if
you're gonna do it have faith in
yourself that you can do a good job next
point is it's very easy for people to
hide
computer and comment and hate on your
videos you know it's anonymous no one
knows who they are parents aren't going
to see what they're typing in a lot of
cases it's completely behind the scenes
so don't let the haters get you down no
matter what you do you're gonna upset
people you make a video on Apple people
are gonna say why don't you talk about
PCs to make a video on Xbox people are
gonna say Playstations better you make a
video on cell phones people are gonna
say make a video on something else no
you're never gonna make everybody happy
it's just not gonna happen and the more
success you get the more people you're
gonna piss off it's just inevitable
inevitable so just keep that in mind and
just know you're gonna get a little bit
of hate don't take it personally it's
just someone taking a few comments
they're not gonna hurt you it's nothing
personal
I don't don't take it personally no
matter what they say just barrel through
it you can use the block button and
block people if you like I personally if
anybody leaves any discriminatory
comments or homophobic comments or
racist comments they're immediately
blocked you have that option you can
remove comments you've got control over
it at the end of the day just don't let
the haters get you down next thing I
want to say is be very mindful of your
speech a lot of times if you're talking
and you're saying a lot of us or you
knows then it makes you seem a little
less professional I'm guilty of saying
plenty of us definitely but I do try and
be conscious of my speech and the same
thing for you guys I think would hold
true as well know what you're saying and
write down some notes beforehand so you
don't have to say look away or this is
cool you know things like that it makes
you look a little more professional and
I think people will take notice of it a
little quickly the next thing is you
don't have to buy products to be a
technology reviewer that's a big
misconception you didn't have to go out
and buy a new Mac or buy a new PC or an
Xbox PSP cellphone whatever it might be
you do not have to go to buy products
you don't have to unbox to be a
technology reviewer just talk about
things and privacy
with I may not have seen the new product
X but from what I've read here's my
opinions on it as long as you preface it
I think people are gonna understand
they're gonna appreciate it a lot of
devices I haven't bought or haven't seen
or haven't tested but I've still done
reviews on them you know I think that
they're very interesting I did a video
on the MacBook Air I've never owned a
MacBook Air so you don't have to have a
lot of money all you need to have is a
camera and an internet connection so
these are just a few tips guys I hope
that you find them helpful you know
certainly there's a lot of people that
have had more success than I have but
these are just some tips that were given
to me and that I'm trying to share with
you guys you can be successful we're all
a community of technology reviewers and
the better you do you know by proxy the
better I'm gonna do it it lends more
credibility to the industry that one's
credibility to you guys so I'm just
trying to help I hope you guys found
this useful if you have any other
suggestions for aspiring technology
reviewers or things you might have
learned leave comments or a video
