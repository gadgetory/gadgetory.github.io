unboxing for you of the blackberry curve
8900 for tmobile this sucker will run
you 149 on a two-year contract it's been
a while because we had a black beard
come through here so I'm excited see
what this has to offer this the newest
blackberry for t-mobile service go ahead
and carve into the pack there take it
out so here we got note from the
friendly PR fo and some info about the
curve look at that in a second let's
take out the phone itself there we go
throw that on the floor so this came out
i believe last month so it's been out
for a little while but first time I've
had a chance to get my hands on it so i
got the tmobile logo on the front stick
together picture a device on the side on
the back it lists some of the features
highlighted by 3.2 megapixel camera with
video capture games high-resolution
screen it's got Wi-Fi it has GPS built
in it does not have 3g however it is
only using t-mobile's edge network got a
full qwerty board all that good stuff
let's go ahead and dig on in see what
this thing looks like I've always been a
big fan of BlackBerry's dating back to
my first pearl days I had 8700 so the
device is right on top actually is very
small in hand we'll do a size comparison
in a minute see what else we get in the
box piece of cardboard just lift that up
standard blackberry wall charger with
click they've used moved to microUSB but
it's nice they're using a standard we've
got a USB to microUSB cable got some
headphones looks like 3.5 millimeter
headphone so there must be a 3.5
millimeter jack on the device we've got
a carrying case let's see what this
carrying case is made out of if it
actual leather or just fake leather see
if any Nagas were killed and making this
naugahyde this looks like leather not
real leather one hundred percent genuine
naugahyde got a little thing in there
and when you put the device and actually
has a magnet in there and it'll turn off
the whole thing just the screen and
buttons will deactivate and finally
we've got some getting started material
tips and tricks and this and that let's
turn the device on and take a look at it
should be running the same OS as the
blackberry bold and zoom in just a
little bit here get a better view of it
okay so let's compare it with some other
phones you might be familiar with let's
use another phone with a front-facing
korte keyboard there is a treo pro they
look to be pretty close in size the
blackberries up a little bit smaller the
treo pro is very thin let's see how it
stacks up almost the same dimensions
there with was so that's nice goes to
show you how small the blackberry really
is here's the samsung epix for AT&amp;amp;T much
bigger certainly thicker but samsung
puts in a monster battery on this thing
set counts for the increase in thickness
here's the iphone most people are
familiar with the size the iphone so it
could be a good comparison stack them up
on top of each other and see there is a
significant difference right there the
iphones a little bit longer i'll let you
check the thickness want to be very
similar in that dimension as well and
another blackberry that i happen to have
here it'll be more on this one and
future videos coming up later on the
blackberry storm stack-on book on top of
each other and a storm is noticeably
thicker let's go ahead and turn this
thing on and see if it's got a charge
let's see what the boot screen looks
like it's agreed with the t-mobile
splash screen you don't think i do like
about blackberry is definitely have a
short boot up time that was just about
it and it does look like
the Bulls operating system those icons
across the bottom Wi-Fi is on if the
battery doesn't have much juice left in
it but I will do a full review and i'll
talk about the browser the operating
system itself keyboard how the screen
looks navigation and the usual things
that i generally cover my reviews to
stay tuned for that for exclusive
content be sure to follow me on twitter
twitter.com / John for lakers and i'll
see you in the next video goodbye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
