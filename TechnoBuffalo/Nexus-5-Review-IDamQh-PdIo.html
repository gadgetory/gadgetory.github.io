TechnoBuffalo here's a full review for
you of this guy the Nexus 5 the latest
from Android Rakim delicious deliciously
named KitKat I put it through its paces
let's see if this sexy nexi is worth
your heart and buying buck
I shouldn't said that when we came out
now they knew it sounded bad with all my
reviews I want to give it a screamer I
use this as my daily driver for three
days I tested it on AT&amp;amp;T network in
Southern California though it is
unlocked and will work with t mobile or
Sprint's the first talked about called
quality doesn't matter what the phone's
got and it's not to make good phone
calls it's not gonna be of much use to
you as with all modern smartphones now
called Claude is actually pretty awesome
microphone as we'll talk about is really
really incredible speakerphone cuz those
dual speakers on the bottom was really
loud no one had any problems hearing me
I no white noise no popping so overall
pretty awesome the phone is built by LG
and they did a really really nice job
with it I really liked the soft touch
back although it is a little bit of
fingerprint magnet
it just felt sturdy in my hand didn't
feel heavy but it felt really
significant so you get the sense you're
using really a premium device I also
really liked a hidden notification light
if you look at the phone when it's off
you'll never notice anything is on the
very bottom but get the notification get
an email or something things are
blinking at you and I really like sort
of how subtle it was the SIM tray is
located right below the power and lock
button which sure it looks like a volume
rocker which it's not that was on the
other side which I found a little bit
annoying but that's super nitpicky I
still prefer physical buttons to you
know on-screen buttons or at least one
home button and two soft ones but from
reading the comments last time I said
that I know that I'm the minority this
one definitely has soft buttons on the
screen on paper that's 4.9 5-inch 1920
by 1080 screen should be freaking baller
after all it's got a PPI of 445 and it's
made by LG I love LG screens in fact I
thought the screen on the GT was one of
the best in mobile industry and that
says a lot
however the screen on the Nexus 5 Ewing
images looked kind of washed out to me
not to say it's bad just not as sharp as
the s4 or the g2 but not being the
absolute best isn't always the worst the
screens still pretty good text looks
great video and games still look pretty
decent surprisingly though if it's a
billion direct sunlight was okay I put
this side-by-side with it
like the Moto X and screen didn't look
that much better than 720p on the Moto X
so I wouldn't buy this expecting to get
the most gorgeous display I pick up this
phone if you want a really well-rounded
package if this phone was an Olympian
you would run a three minute mile it
absolutely screams you'd expect that
though from a phone that's got a
Snapdragon 800 processor two gigs of RAM
and I know Wes and KitKat that was
designed for efficiency
let me gets out of the wakes I know you
guys want to know the quadrants core it
is seven thousand two hundred and thirty
four and I am well aware it's not the
most scientific way to benchmark a phone
but I did use it now my Android devices
so at least you can compare it I had to
do no memory management at all with this
phone it's got to use Ram scrolling was
super fast whether you're you know in
apps around a browser like apps what are
really quickly in games just as fast it
was legally fast phone you're gonna
forget you have to worry about memory
management forget how many gigs around
you have it just gonna work and work
really well that's probably that's calls
me you can give a phone throw the specs
fade into the background you can focus
just on the experience let's talk a
little bit about the delicious Kit Kat
we did a whole video on it but there are
some really nice tweaks I do like and
the fact you can scroll on from the
sides get to Google now I don't like the
integration of hangouts with SMS but
nice thing about Android if you don't
like it just download a new SMS app and
fitted your default KitKat felt really
really quick to me I didn't notice
anything giant that was in there
but I did like to file quickly I ran I
didn't notice a little bit of speed
difference I'm comparing it to the Nexus
4 they might because of the hardware
because the operating system but either
way it just feels fast I don't usually
talk that much about cameras my reviews
cuz not honestly it's not that important
to me the pictures look finally take a
picture my baby and I can put it on
Facebook naturally all I care about but
I've read the comments and you guys want
me to talk much much much more about
cameras putting images on video aren't
can do them justice so if you want to
see the article again links gonna be
down below to go ahead and check that
out though I will say though the mic
when you're recording video is awesome
probably the best I have ever heard that
really surprising we've used a lot of
mics we make our videos whether it's a
boom mic or lav mic or whatever it might
be but this little tiny microphone this
phone was really really incredible
so the phone respects like this might I
expect it to last you the entire day
it's especially wanted a tiny 2300
milliamp hour battery I did my battery
test bit differently than other sites I
don't run it on video and see how long
it lasts till it dies I use real-world
tests so let me tell you how my day goes
give it a full charge put off the charge
around 7:00 7:15 in the morning it's
always connected to Wi-Fi there my house
with the office where I am
percent of the day I think about two to
two and a half hours of phone calls
pretty aggressive
probably more than should be social
networking some on Facebook Twitter
Instagram posting pictures and just
reading comments prob about 45 minutes
to an hour of video probably bout a half
hour to 45 minutes of gameplay going on
constantly pulling down to email
accounts on push always regularly
checking widgets that are on the home
screen that are pulling in from down
information every 30 minutes end of the
day I had about thirty percent which is
not great but it's not awful and for me
the big test for battery life but that I
can get through a whole day in fact I
could get through a whole day was all I
needed from a phone I don't expect to go
to 3-4 days especially not a phone got
1080p screen a quad-core processor it's
just not realistic so it's fine I got
their whole day which is the best I
could expect I would have liked to have
had 40 or 50 percent yeah absolutely but
long it duckin died on me I'm totally
fine with that those are some other
intangibles don't fit in any category on
things from Nexus 5 the first one is
probably one of my favorite wireless
charging it is here I love that it just
built it on to buy another case not to
buy a new back plate it just works and
I'm definitely talking to you Samsung a
Nokia the fact I can show this thing on
my Qi charger and have it work is
absolutely awesome even better with the
new versions of Android you can charge
it wirelessly well it's powered off
which I really like I enjoy turn my
phone off and I it's kind of ritual for
me it's like unplugging well get the
latest version of Android pretty much as
soon as they come out so 4.5 or 5.0
whatever comes next
I love the naked adulterated Android it
is a beautiful bit of Awesomeness rolled
into one package of hugs I just like it
and like the way it looks like the way
it works like the way Android designers
have it not to say the skins are a bad
way to go
but I prefer pure Android over anything
else so what's the final score for the
Nexus 5 on our TechnoBuffalo test and
gets a 8.5 it lost a little bit for the
screen but overall a really incredible
phone in an awesome package if you want
the latest android has to offer you want
a phone you're gonna be sure and get OS
updates an even better phone maybe you
don't decide it to your contract for
this is a great way to go it's a killer
price point right now either 349 or 399
depending on 16 or 32 gigs I wish had
expandable storage and things like that
but I can live with it for a really
really killer price and an awesome
packet if you want to get a new
smartphone you own the best out there
Nexus 5 is gonna be a great way to go so
