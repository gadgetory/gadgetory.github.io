cross-platform a landing page Nintendo's
2d s final fantasy 14 a realm not quite
yet reborn and what to expect at apple's
iphone event it's Buffalo bullets in
time hello shiny happy people and
welcome to the Buffalo bulletin where we
recapped five major stories from our
site technobuffalo calm a couple of
times a week if you're interested in
reading more about any story we talked
about on the show check the description
for links or click on the graphics for
each story if you have annotations
available I'm Ashley skava hair your top
stories Google's president of product
management for Android the delightful
Hugo Barra is leaving Google to take a
position with Chinese handset
manufacturer shall me he'll still be
dealing with the Android ecosystem just
from an OEM side but it remains to be
seen who might step into his role at El
goob regardless of what his reasons were
for leaving borrow was a great on stage
presence at Google i/o so he will
certainly be missed up in Mountain View
blackberry launched the landing page for
their upcoming android and iphone
versions of blackberry messenger BBM is
widely regarded as one of the best and
most stable messaging platforms out
there so the announcement the service
would go cross-platform was a pleasant
surprise for everybody cross platform
BBM will only feature messaging though
at launch so video voice are expected to
roll out sometime later this year my
question is are you gonna use BBM
Android and iPhone users because I don't
know if I'm on board yet somebody
convinced in gaming Nintendo continued
its streak of wacky wondrous weird
creations with the surprise announcement
of the Nintendo 2ds yes the 2ds
basically a 3ds with the 3d toggled off
and without the clamshell functionality
looks totally bizarre but with a price
tag of just 129 bucks a shared release
date with pokemon X&amp;amp;Y and a marketing
strategy aimed at young kids Nintendo
actually might have a hit on its hands
all I'm saying is
stranger things have happened Square
Enix is having a really tough week as
the birth of their remade MMO final
fantasy 14 a realm reborn seems like it
might have needed an emergency c-section
femurs could not login across the
country causing Square Enix to
completely stop digital sales until the
servers could be brought up to speed all
realm reborn might be an apology to
everyone who plays the original Final
Fantasy 14 but it's not a really good
apology especially for anybody who is
burned by the first iteration of the
game our wild card for the week comes
from Todd Hazleton who reminds us that
the Apple 5s event is likely slated for
September 10th and he runs through what
we should and should not expect from the
folks up in Cupertino we've got
galleries and run down to both the
rumored iphone 5s and the iphone 5c so
if you're interested in that sort of
thing head on over and check them out
