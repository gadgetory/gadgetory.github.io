editor for John for lakers calm and I
just want to wrap up the coverage on the
Voodoo set-top box by offering some pros
some cons and help you decide if it's
the right set-top box for you so let's
start with some pros first of all the
Voodoo set-top box is totally refined
and what I mean by that is that
everything is super intuitive the remote
feels good at hand the interface on the
screen is fast it's easy to get around
finding out how to download a movie on
the Buddha boxes probably as easy as
picking up an iphone and trying to
figure out how to make a call for the
first time it's just very intuitive
number two is that the Voodoo set-top
box says 1080p uncompressed content
which means that the audio is super
clear the picture is almost blu-ray
quality and as far as I know there's no
other set-top box that offers such high
quality video and audio which is really
great if you have a great TV and a good
sound system and finally the Voodoo box
has voodoo labs meaning you can get
YouTube content picasa and a whole ton
of on-demand TV content in fact I
haven't really turned on my cable box
too much in the last few days because
there's just so much content on voodoo
labs that I really haven't had a need to
watch TV all this stuff is on the Voodoo
box alright so let's talk about some
cons the selection on the voodoo box is
really good but it's not fantastic there
are a few movies that I search for that
they just didn't have budu is a
relatively new company so probably in
the near future that's probably going to
change completely and they're going to
have almost every title that you could
possibly want number two is that the
renting window on the Voodoo box is only
24 hours and this is the case for all
set top boxes early and I think it's
kind of silly if you come home from work
on a friday night or school and you
start a movie and you finish it on a
Sunday afternoon or Sunday morning the
24 hour period has ran out right on the
Voodoo box you can extend that viewing
period for a dollar and ninety-nine
cents but it's kind of silly because you
already paid the money to rent it right
if you go to blockbuster and rent a
movie you can have it for three four or
five days sometimes all for four or five
dollars and finally the Buddha box is
not wireless the way you buy it from the
store it comes it has a wireless adapter
that you can buy
cost forty nine dollars it's actually on
amazon for 39 but you know devices like
the Apple TV they have wireless built
right in because I don't think most
people have a wireless or wired Ethernet
connection right next to their TV so
that's that's unfortunate it adds to the
cost so overall I think that if you
already have a set-top box you have an
Apple TV or if you have a roku player or
ps3 or xbox 360 tivo etc the Voodoo
set-top box may not offer enough to
compel you to upgrade but if you're
looking for a set-top box for the first
time I think the Voodoo box is a
fantastic choice I know you'll be happy
with it there's just so much content
it's a really well thought out system
right now it's ninety-nine dollars in
good vodacom and buy it from there they
show you other places to buy it and they
actually sort of brought down the price
even more since when we started this
series when I did the unboxing I
mentioned that it's ninety nine dollars
but you have to pay forty nine dollars
extra for content but now it's just
ninety nine dollars flat so I hope you
enjoyed this series and i hope i helped
you to determine if the voodoo box is
something that you would want that's it
for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
