TechnoBuffalo we're here at CES 2016 in
front of the Chevy booth where this week
they announced a brand new bolt we don't
know all the details yeah but here's
some information we do know it's gonna
have 200 mile range it's gonna come in
at under thirty thousand dollars so we
hear after tax incentives it's gonna do
0-60 in just under seven seconds and
suppose that fast charging which means
it'll charge up at 80 percent in under
an hour which is pretty insane
so what does this mean for the
automotive industry and electric cars as
a whole I personally think it could be
huge if Chevy has a price point and once
we find out more details but the big two
things here for me are the range and the
price point under $30,000 after tax
incentives is a huge huge move for Chevy
to hit that price because usually with
EB cars you've always made sacrifices
you got higher price points and even
hybrids at a point with a Prius when it
first came out
maybe then still today some would say
he's always had regular cars kind of
over here and you've had electric cars
over here I think what Chevy is doing is
bridging the gap a lot of people have
said this is the car the Tesla Model 3
was supposed to be I think that's a huge
compliment cuz I think that's what sort
of really well in the electric car
market but on the surface so far it
seems like Chevy is really headed in the
right direction this will not be a
performance car under 7 seconds 0-60 as
we just mentioned which is not great but
it's also not terrible and I think
that's the key as well it's finding that
balance finding that middle ground for
your average day to day driver
it's a five-door hatchback which should
be pretty practical to use it's a lot of
storage Spargo space all that good stuff
it has a 10.1 inch infotainment system
which is supposed to be sourced from LG
supposed to be one of the best
infotainment systems on the market I
don't know if that's because
entertainments really good or just
because the automotive tech has sucked
so much over the last couple of years
but again we'll find out once we get to
sit inside the car and check it out so
that's it for this video guys I don't
know about you but I'm personally really
excited about the bolt there's a huge
automotive enthusiast but some of those
something with cylinders and like a
turbocharger this is really exciting
because I would love to own an electric
car but there's just never been
something in the market that really fits
my needs and this might just be it the
minute you guys think in the comments
below give it a thumbs up if you like

we'll see you guys in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
