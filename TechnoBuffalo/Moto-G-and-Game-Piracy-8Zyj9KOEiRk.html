to you by Forza Motorsport 5 only on
xbox one coming November 22nd hello
internet and welcome back to another
episode of ask the Buffalo the show
where you can ask me Ashley discover any
question you might have for the wide
world of technology every Tuesday we put
up a call for questions on TechnoBuffalo
com you can leave your question in the
post comment otherwise you can send me
any time of the day or night on twitter
at TechnoBuffalo or at Ashley asked Emma
that's my twitter handle just use the
hashtag ask the be so i can see it and
usually I'll answer between three and
five questions every episode let's get
answering this is ask the Buffalo at ved
115 says hey Ashley what do you think
about torrents and game piracy uh well
then let me tell you what um I think
that just because we can torrent things
and because we can pirate them doesn't
mean we should you know especially stuff
like for example Game of Thrones this is
an episode by episode cost of three
million dollars in episode and it's a
really great show and I would hate for
it to not be able to continue because
all of us wanted it for free at the end
of the day it is content that somebody
made and somebody worked really hard on
and I know that with movies or games you
think to yourself oh you know Angelina
Jolie made 20 million dollars making
this movie she doesn't need my twenty
dollars but you've got to remember that
there are crew members on that movie who
have families to feed and they don't
make 20 million dollars for a movie they
don't even make 20 million dollars in a
lifetime so for me I would say game
piracy in torrents no bueno don't do it
and less let's see never Lewis asks hey
ashley is it worth getting the Moto G
over the Nexus 5 on one hand the Nexus 5
has better specs but the Moto G looks
pretty good and is only 199 for 16
gigabytes whereas the Nexus 5 is 349
this is a really good question i think a
lot of people have been asking this like
what should i get a moto g or nexus 5
but the Nexus 5 is running KitKat so
you're getting the latest version of
Android but the Moto G they're saying is
going to get KitKat and
anywhere e so you're not really missing
out on that I would say that if you're
okay with having a mid-range device for
a year or two years um you're totally
cool with getting a moto G I don't see
the problem with it I think it's
actually a really great not a burner
device but it's definitely a great
device where you can buy it and feel
comfortable about the fact that if it
breaks it's okay because you know it was
only a couple hundred bucks you didn't
pay six hundred and twenty nine dollars
for it like you want an iPhone
off-contract this is a great deal
however I will say the Nexus 5 is a
really nice device and if you enjoy
having that sort of Nexus experience if
you like LG as opposed to motorola's
build quality of course those are all
things that come into play also don't
forget the Moto G does not have LTE and
the nexus 5 does so that is a pretty big
decision maker for you if you have LTE
if you're in an area that has LTE you
might want the nexus 5 josh says hey
Ashley what are you going to be doing
with your playstation 3 and xbox 360 now
that the playstation 4 and xbox one are
here are there any current generation
games you still want this year or even
in the future I'm still playing games on
current-gen platforms I mean grand theft
auto 5 huge amazing I still want to play
it so I'm still gonna be playing that on
xbox and on top of that um diablo 3
hello everybody diablo 3 consoles super
amazing i have ever playstation 3 so i
won't be retiring my playstation 3 until
the ultimate evil edition of diablo 3
comes out sometime next year with Reaper
of souls expansion I saw it at blizzcon
and it was amazing and I had a super
great time playing it on the ps4 I so I
highly recommend that if you are you can
still be in a current gen games but I
think from hell we may have to like
start stacking them at home and our
entertainment center all of the new
consoles because I still have things I
want to play on current-gen interrupting
the show for a second to talk about our
sponsor Forza Motorsport 5 I got to see
Forza Motorsport 5 in person at e3
earlier this year and Matt this game is
some serious driving business it takes
advantage of the connected capabilities
of xbox one delivering features that can
only be possible via Forza Motorsport 5
s drivatar technology the power of the
cloud turns around real human behavior
by learning how you and your friends
drive then also creates an evolving
network of opponents who are always
to compete and and this is my favorite
part when you leave your house your
profile still works for you by racing
against other players in the cloud and
earning you in-game credits in the
process that's right Forza Motorsport 5
is going to learn how you race then race
just like you when you got to leave your
xbox one for more boring things like
work work who needs it if you haven't
seen what Forza Motorsport 5 looks like
you are in for a treat the cars and
tracks are crazy realistic hand-stitched
leather the light reflecting off a
perfect coat of paint brushed metal rims
and let me tell you the tracks are just
as perfectly rendered as the cars these
are living breathing worlds you'll be
racing through on race day people
gorgeous gorgeous sights and sounds for
anyone who's a fan of racing if you are
ready to race Forza Motorsport 5 will be
available on November 22nd available
only on xbox one well that's it for this
