like David Blaine but like my three and
a half year old brought something home
so for now I'm gonna sound like old
grandpa we've been talking a lot about
the Model X on the channel but that is
not the Tesla that's going to be what
Tesla is known for that award goes to
the model 3 which is announced last year
and is supposedly coming in 2017 and
we're getting one step closer to seeing
model 3s on the road and model threes
that you and I can actually buy so
according to Reuters routers that that
company Tesla is gearing up to start a
pre-production run of the model 3 on
February 20th which is very soon those
aren't the cars that are going to be
purchased it just to make sure that the
equipment is going to be ok that the
factory can handle it make sure the
parts are up to standards and also
actually test these cars on the road to
begin cold weather testing and hot
weather testing there's still a lot
about the model 3 we don't know in fact
don't even know the final designs going
to look like
we saw the snub-nosed version of the
model 3 when it got announced last year
Musca said a lot of things about that
design change we don't know if the
finalized interior is gonna look like so
it was obviously a lot we don't know but
there's still a decent amount that we do
know let me refresh your memory what you
can expect from the model 3 first give
me model 3 Tesla really wanted to spell
out se X as their model line they
couldn't get the model 3 patent from
Ford so I don't the number 3 so sex
again I'm starting price point of
$35,000 Tesla says the average price
that people actually pay for the cars
when they do some upgrades gonna be
around 42 we don't know the final
battery pack size we do know it's not
gonna have a hundred kilowatt hour size
like we have in the Model S the XV says
as options we do have a range of at
least 215 miles and is there 260 time of
at least six seconds certainly they'll
be much faster options and longer range
options as well so plenty range and also
plenty of speed even at that baseline
price the car looked a little bit
strange for a very good reason
Tesla pushed the cabin almost all the
way up to the front of the car so you've
got a really narrow front or front end
of the car where an engine typically
would go but that gives you in the back
is a lot of legroom and
a room for five passengers in fact the
car is so spacious for you being so
small Tesla says you can put a 7-foot
surfboard just straight through the back
if you'll be looking at the Model X and
love that sort of helicopter ish roof
even then a panoramic glass roof on the
Model S that is going to also be
available on the model three so it
should be pretty cool
almost all glass effect through the
entire top of the car and I think the
big thing about the car is going to be
the tech it'll have Tesla's autopilot
2.0 presumably assuming there's not a
3.0 by the time this hits the roads
which shouldn't give Tesla the ability
to do full autonomy towards the end of
2018 which is not really that far away
and that's full autonomy level five like
put your destination and go to sleep in
the back that's obviously barring a ton
of regulatory approvals Tesla claimed
they're going to get the cars on the
road by the end of 2017
but I would probably want to hold your
breath for getting yours sometime this
year
if the Model X is any indicator there
will be delays and they do ship at all
this calendar year probably like two or
three cars and then ramp up production
2018 and 2019 if I learned anything from
Tesla's it's generally maybe stay away
from the first year so production drunk
you've been littered with problems aside
with the a sweet eye with the X I'll
probably still see it with the model 3
so that's everything we know about the
model 3 I've got a deposit down I can't
waste get behind the wheel of one and
see what scar actually gonna look like
the interiors gonna look like
musk has been teasing a lot of stuff
about it so we're due to actually see
what the car is going to be see if this
is going to be the car that's going to
define Tesla and be the
paradigm-shifting automobile the
company's been claiming for years today
I think model food you put a deposit
down let us know down below and our
coming to the day it comes from Abdul
Maura heme who says glad to see the
audio in your videos have improved I was
still have a lot more to go we're

we got some sound dampening still do in
the studio we're hoping to bring you
quality audio and also I missed a
quality video as we move forward into
the year so thank you for noticing if
you want to give them a follow willing
to a channel down below find me
