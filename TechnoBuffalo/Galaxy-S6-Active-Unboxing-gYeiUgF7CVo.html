TechnoBuffalo here inside of this
nondescript AT&amp;amp;T box and a phone that is
ready to rumble
it is the galaxy s6 active I didn't take
Samsung very long to take the gorgeous
looking galaxy s6 and kind of hug it up
a little bit but what you get if that
little bit of ugliness is a phone that
can take a beating let's go ahead and
open it up and take a look so there is a
Gallic six active if you're you know
maybe in your mid 22 30s my remember the
movie twins
this would be your Schwarzenegger and
this one is very clearly your DeVito but
everybody likes a DeVito so maybe this
is going to be the right phone for you
push off this I am for a real quick
second we've got a QuickStart guide for
you guessed it not getting started
slowly here's how you do things but I'm
guessing you don't need this you can
probably look at this phone and be like
oh there's the home button I know that's
gonna take me home inside of this box
we're going to have some milk that I'll
try not to spill Samsung's music service
guess it's active quick charger and
micro USB charging cord and that is it
so here friends is the phone I brought
the knife just hit that definer you to
use it I don't have one but I'll just
I'll pull it up to myself like this I
can see I use the unboxing knife
that's my slick move so we can peel off
the back here and here is the s6 active
this is the black verts also available
in some camo colors but just like
putting lipstick on a pig at that point
on the left hand side that is not your
power button display what I just tried
to do off camera I guess I shouldn't
have quite quickly discounted that Quick
Start Guide you've got a volume up and
down on the right side is your power
button all these buttons have a texture
on it makes them really easy to to feel
which is quite nice underneath this door
that's where your SIM is going to live
it as the nano SIM variety on the bottom
3.5 milimeter headset jack noise
cancelling mic on the back that is where
you're gonna find the 16 megapixel
camera that can shoot 4k video of course
the LED flash and the heart rate sensors
on the front you've got a 5 megapixel
sensor you are looking at the same
screen that we've got on the galaxy s6
its 5.1
AMOLED technology it's also a qHD so
it's 2560 by 1440 and if you are a quick
at math you'll know that has a 576 PPI
keeping this guy scratch-free is the
Gorilla Glass 4.0 I believe it says
Android 5.0 point 2 on it I'm gonna go
ahead and set the sucker up and I'll
tell you all the rest of the specs now
we've got this guy all booted up what's
going to make this thing hum along
smoothly is the x3 no 7422 remember it's
actually two separate quad core
processors making a single octa-core so
one of them is a 1.5 gigahertz cortex
a53 the other one is a quad core 2.1
gigahertz the cortex a 57
it's got 32 internal storage we're
saying to yourself hey not a big deal
like to put in a microSD card got bad
news for your friend alright no room for
one on here the big reason that you
might want to pick up the active that's
IP 68 certified so that's dust and water
resistant up to 1.5 meters for 30
minutes so you can take this thing for
like a nice relaxing swim and still be
good to go so this should be running 5.0
point to go to the box but let's just
check and see if somehow it got an
update before it actually started
shipping about device yep 5.0 point 2
onboard here your highlighted by three
big actual physical buttons of course on
the left you've got your multitasking
I'd also allow and then we get to use
multi view your home button and your
back button so the big story here this
is like the galaxy s6 but ugly and more
functional so if that's what you need if
you're more of the outdoors type or you
live where it rains a lot
take your phone outdoors the s6 active
gonna be a very nice device to have if
you can get past the ugly look so it's
kind of like me in high school just get
to know me maybe maybe you might like me
and that's sort of what we still we have
with the galaxy s6 active so if you guys
want to see a four of you let us know
mostly what we'll do is probably just
torture testing its already reviewed
pretty much the same specs in the s6 and
the s6 edge do you want anything in
particular you know let us know in the
comments and I'm happy to take a look at
it for you so thank you guys for
watching hope you enjoyed please be

was coming until then John rendered
