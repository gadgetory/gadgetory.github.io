from TechnoBuffalo here we just got back
from the Apple store to pick up the
iPhone se which we just unboxed link to
that up above and down below the next
thing we got to take a look at is the
brand the new smaller iPad air iPad pro
iPad pro not the iPad air 39.7 inches
take a lot of tech from the larger 12
inch iPad pro for a hundred dollar price
premium let's go ahead and open this
sucker up excuse our unboxing knife and
this is what a lot of people have been
waiting for from the iPad front the
twelve point seven inch iPad pro is big
it's a big phone or big tablet so
smaller option a sequel spiritual
successor to the iPad air 2 I think is
what people are pretty jazzed about go
ahead and pull this off and there we
have the gold iPad pro 9.7 a lot of
power in this guy it's gonna start at
five hundred and ninety nine dollars
pretty decent resolution in the 2048 by
thirteen thirty six being powered by the
a 9x and the m9 motion coprocessor a lot
of nice things actually went into the
camera clean a 12 megapixel sensor but
it's got humps its got camera camera
humps for days if you put it down on the
table it sits flat lease there isn't
sort of a wiggle to it which is nice and
a five megapixel sensor on the front I'm
a sure this guy on what it boots up
you're going to see for the first time a
new true tone display it's gonna change
the color of the screen based on the
lighting in your room take a piece of
paper if you're in darker room with
yellow hues the papers gonna reflect
that light so the deal is the screen is
going to do exactly the same thing
around the device it looks like an iPad
you've got the camera sensor in the
upper right you've got the volume
controls they're supposed to be on the
right hand side the current-gen touch ID
we've got four speakers though borrowed
from the iPad pro the larger one which
are really nice hoping for the same
thing here as well other than that it's
an iPad through and through with a much
better camera and again this can shoot
4k video to Thea's
are interested in it OU's guy for a few
days and share our thoughts and opinions
it's nice to to feel the power of an
iPad pro
in a smaller package apples hoping you
are going to pick up this guy the about
$150 smart Keyboard for the nine point
seven inch iPad pro we tested the larger
version with the 12 point 7 iPad it
works like you'd expect to keyboard to
work I was also hoping you're gonna
continue the accessory game with $100
Apple pencil that's probably the best
stylus out there on the market I'm not
an artist I can barely draw a stick
figure but if you are something you want
to consider getting for quick comparison
here we have which is it looks every
time I look at this man damn this thing
is huge the bigger 12 point 7 inch iPad
pro you can see those guys side by side
it's like like Big Brother little
brother next to each other anyway guys
what do you think excited about one of
these products the iPad or the iPhone se
really want to hear thoughts on it let
us know why or why not because you get
thumbs up we always appreciate it until
next time I'm John render from
TechnoBuffalo talk to you guys in next
