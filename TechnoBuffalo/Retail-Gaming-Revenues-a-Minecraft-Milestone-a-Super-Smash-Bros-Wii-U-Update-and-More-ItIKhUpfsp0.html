revenues for november 2013 minecraft
mega milestone a potential release date
for super smash brothers wii u 1 hit
killing in samurai gunn and this week's
best new game releases let's get out of
controller hello and welcome to out of
controller the weekly TechnoBuffalo show
that covers all your gaming news reviews
demos and new releases in an easy to
digest capsule form I'm your host Ashley
sceva it's always a big week in gaming
so let's start out with the news
official numbers are finally starting to
solidify for last month's gaming
revenues and it's kind of a mixed bag so
it looks like the playstation 4 and xbox
one launches help boost hardware sales
quite a bit as expected with console and
handheld devices jumping fifty-eight
percent to 2.7 4 billion in revenue over
last year's 2.55 billion in revenue on
the other hand software revenue was down
twenty four percent from one point four
three billion to one point zero eight
six billion in sales another important
note though is that the NPD who's the
company that does this research doesn't
actually track digital online sales or
use sales so I guess take all of these
numbers with a huge rain of salt
minecraft making the news this week
after a pretty huge milestone the
original PC and Mac version of the game
officially crossed the 13 million sold
mark last Friday prompting a pretty
awesome tweet from minecraft creator
notch his official statement and I quote
whoa that's it no flowery PR speak no
ego just whoa that's not counting
versions of the game available on other
platforms like the Xbox 360 edition and
the Pocket Edition for iOS and Android
it's kind of amazing to see minecraft
continued to entertain gamers even over
two years after its initial release it
looks like the rumor mill is a turnon
this week with whispers of a potential
release date for super smash brothers
wii u and 3ds a year or two years know
the rumors pointed to a very very
exciting possibility spring 2014 as in a
few months from now
unfortunately before you get all excited
that gossip fire was put out pretty
quickly by super smash brothers director
Masahiro Sakurai who called it an
incorrect report he also went on to say
he wasn't sure when the game would drop
but that he was trying desperately to
make it happen soon either way I'm sure
super smash brothers wii u will be a
console purchasing game for a lot of you
