to you by the air force collaboratory
what's up everyone John rende you from
TechnoBuffalo here welcome back to
episode of rule Mirada this is the show
the title should tell you where we take
all the tech rumors from the week
they've been published on TechnoBuffalo
calm and I tell you the four biggest one
that you might have missed of this week
Samsung is promising foldable
smartphones by 2016
freaking giant tablets are coming from
everywhere the Canadian government
supposedly blocked the sale of
blackberry to Chinese company Lenovo
this rumor roundup let's start rounding
them up the galaxy round just came out
in the world starting to finally get
used to phones that have curved displays
and curved screens but what about phones
that are actually gonna freakin fold on
you well suppose that's gonna be reality
come 2016 the Samsung held its second
ever analyst day in Seoul and that the
company had plenty to share so through
the seven separate presentations as we
all have up on TechnoBuffalo comm they
did everything they could to try to
impress investors one promise which I
thought was especially cool was to roll
out smartphones it's 4k displays and
flexible handsets that can actually
freakin Bend within the next few years
could have big implications for wearable
technology
could have implications for readers
really everything that permeates screens
could have huge huge implication the
same thing did say though there are a
few roadblocks technology advanced have
to be made that the 2016 gates lips of
2017 2018 don't be surprised but it's
coming soon the future's here guys may
be inundated by giant friggin iPads
according to pad news apple supplier
Foxconn is working with a 12 point 9
inch tablet is currently working on a UI
prototype debugging although it is
probably possible and probably probable
that's a reference to machines that work
on the manufacturing of this I'm just
gonna call it the iPad maxi the site
suggests that Apple will launch the
device sometime in March of next year
but it seems a little more dubious
perhaps this giant iPad that calling is
more of a convergent device or hearing
serve slight whispers that there might
be a combination of an iPad and the
MacBook Air and this might be it perhaps
in 12 in
touchscreen MacBook MacBook tablet maybe
it's something's gonna come with the
next iteration of OS 10 maybe even OS 11
it's really based on touch I wouldn't
bet the whole house and there being just
a giant iPad but certain things have
happened but there is one company who
likes to put out ton of different
products that I would say we're
definitely going to get a gigantic
tablet from I would say that would be
Samsung you've been hearing rumors all
year that seems like could release a 12
inch tablet but apparently even that
might not be big enough
the report from eg and News claims Sammy
is prepping to release a wait for it
13.3 inch Android tablet next year I
don't know why someone would need a
tablet so large
especially since that's approaching
laptop size displays but maybe Samsung
has a better idea
ETI news claims that Samsung is
disappointed by recent galaxy s4 sales
as a result this changes overall
strategy hopes that a super-sized tablet
will be its next hot ticket item report
also claims a new device would clearly
target the struggling PC and laptop
business and may employ octa-core
processors were sound pretty awesome and
I will admit that at thirteen point
three tablets I'm silly but also admit
that a five to six inch phone also
sounded silly a couple years ago and now
that's become commonplace Samsung
assured in the phablet market and if
they're I sure in the would you call a
giant tablet goblet or a laptop tablet a
lab litt rounding out the news this
weekend in honor of our very own junk
watch visiting the TechnoBuffalo office
let's do a Canada story supposedly a
Canadian government rejected lenovo's
bid for black branded security of
concern if you remember the US
government also had the same security
concerns
back when Lenovo picked up IBM's a
laptop division so they've been
overcoming the past or maybe we just
have more lack security but a new report
from The Globe and Mail suggests Lenovo
was this close to making a bid for
blackberry but the Canadian government
said no don't do that government
officials in Ottawa made it crystal
clear it would not approve Lenovo is
offer because that gives McCadden
authorities we're worried about national
security specifically Ottawa didn't want
the Chinese company having access to
Canadians telecom infrastructure the
formal bid was evidently made that there
were rumors Lenovo was definitely
interested so that got shut down let me
interrupt the video for a minute to
thank our friends at the
air force visit the air force
