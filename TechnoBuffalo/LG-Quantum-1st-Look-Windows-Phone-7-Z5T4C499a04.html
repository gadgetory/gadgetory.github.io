technobuffalo here with a first look at
the windows phone 7 power LG quantum
brian from microsoft is going to give us
a quick tour yeah so probably those are
familiar with Windows Phone 7 there's
some things about every phone even
though they all look really different
that will all be the same and so for
example the three buttons on the front
all windows phone seven will have a back
button a windows button which will take
you to the Start screen and also a
search button and in addition to that
they'll also have a you know the power
button of course the standard headphone
jack and a volume rocker as well as a
camera shutter button so those are the
phones those are the buttons it will be
consistent of every phone and one of the
reasons we do that is to make sure that
there's a consistent experience across
all windows devices for our customers
but also for developers so that you know
exactly what kind of buttons and and
interfaces you'll be dealing with for
every Windows Phone and on this device
the back button the search button are
capacitive and the windows button is
actually a physical physical capital and
the cool thing about I'm with this clown
to that if you click and hold the start
button that's how you activate the
speech capability so you can speak you
know speak in directions or the call
someone or whatever a lot of stuff you
can do that controlled by voice here on
the phone
to the usual features are here 3.5
millimeter headset jack and charges via
micro USB correct the ass one also has a
cool photo paper it says yep so del

going to be an awesome phone for those
folks that are either a heavy messaging
people or for those that use their phone

know a lot of people really like having
the full qwerty keyboard and this is
just a great option for them it's got
the glass capacitive touchscreen as well
and what are the two buttons on the side
here a function button to function and
caps lock or shift button yep so and
