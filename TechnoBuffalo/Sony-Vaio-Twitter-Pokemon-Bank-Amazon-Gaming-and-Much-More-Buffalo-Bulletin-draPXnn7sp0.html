Twitter's first public earnings report
Amazon's newest acquisition the pokebank
opens for business in North America and
Steve Wozniak's unusual recommendation
to Apple it's Buffalo bulletin time
hello internet and welcome to the
Buffalo bulletin where we recap stories
from our site technobuffalo calm every
tuesday and friday if you're interested
in reading more about any story on the
show check the description below for
links or click on the graphics if you
have annotations available and toggled
on I'm Ashley escada Perry top stories
yesterday morning sony made an official
announcement regarding their vaio pc
business it looks like they're selling
off that part of the business to focus
on smartphones and tablets and also
restructuring its TV business to be more
efficient they've already entered a sale
agreement with Japan industrial partners
who will take over the pc division but
the terms haven't quite been finalized
yet we'll still see Sony spring 2014
line of i/o computers but Sony is
halting development on any other future
new products in the line and the Venera
twitter release their very first
earnings report since their IPO last
november and it was kind of a mixed bag
on the plus side twitter crushed
estimates on the revenue front bringing
in 243 million bucks in the fourth
quarter up a hundred and sixteen percent
year-on-year the bad news is it looks
like Twitter only grabbed nine million
more users quarter-over-quarter which
wasn't really enough for investors
hoping for some huge growth metrics of
those user numbers cause Twitter stock
to take a tumble in after-hours trading
and as of right now the stocks down by
about thirteen percent over in gaming
Amazon made a surprise move yesterday
announcing they'd acquired double helix
a game developer most recently known for
their work on the xbox one's installment
of killer instinct conveniently a double
helix and Amazon social gaming team are
both located in irvine california but no
one's quite sure what amazon is up to
with this aqua hire maybe they were
working on their own Android powered
console maybe they're working on a
streaming game service for prime numbers
oh maybe amazon just wants cheats for
killer instinct also in gaming the
Pokemon bank is officially live in north
america as
a service lit up in the eshop Wednesday
afternoon to the delight of fans the
Polka Bank allows players to store up to
3,000 of their pokemon online to be
accessed in layer versions of the game
if you have Pokemon X or Y it's a simple
deposit or withdrawal but if you're
using pokemon black white black 2 or
white 2 you'll need to use the free
transporter software for transfers the
service costs just five dollars a year
and there's a free Celebi Pokemon as a
gift if you use the service our wild
card story today can't get any more
interesting at least I don't think so
everyone's favorite apple co-founder and
technical Steve Wozniak spoke to Wired
recently and had a crazy recommendation
he thinks Apple should release an
android phone he says Apple could
compete very well and cites the design
of the iphone is one of the reasons
people might prefer an apple android
phone versus other Android manufacturers
of course is not entirely out of the
realm of possibility but I wouldn't
recommend any of you hold your breath
because you will run out of breath and
die that's the Buffalo bulletin for
today if you enjoy the show what thumbs
up would be super awesome of you and if
