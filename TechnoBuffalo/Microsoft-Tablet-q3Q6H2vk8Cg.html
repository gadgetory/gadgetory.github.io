you that have been watching my videos in
the past you know I'm a pretty big a
geek and I'm also admittedly an apple
fan and I've been waiting anxiously for
this rumored apple tablet for quite some
time there's been no word at a Cupertino
about when it's going to come or even if
it even exists for that matter but
perhaps we've been waiting for a tablet
from the wrong company just yesterday
gizmodo com r an exclusive piece about a
new tablet from Microsoft that they're
calling courier and this isn't just a
tablet it's actually two tablets put
together take a look it looks like this
so what is this courier tablet well
according to gizmodo it consists of dual
7-inch capacitive screens those you that
might not know what capacitive screens
are sort of give you the brief rundown
there are two type of touchscreen
technologies that are prevalent
throughout the world there's capacitive
like you see on the iPhone Blackberry
storm into mobile g1 and there's another
technology called resistive capacitive
essentially works by a transfer of
electrons from your finger for example
so if you try and use anything else to
type on the iphone or touch the icon
with it's not going to work because no
electrons coming through a plastic
stylus on the other side of the spectrum
you've got resistive that is empowering
most windows mobile phones really since
they've been in existence and that works
by taking two thin layers of film right
on top of each other as you push down
they create a connection and that
connection is what registers are touched
and for those devices people use
styluses nuts you can really point with
anything and that's how those work now
the advantage of the resistive
touchscreen is you get the stylus which
is both a pro and a con it's not very
accurate but you can't sort of draw on
it like you could on a pencil or paper
so back to this courier that gizmodo is
reporting on so dual capacitive
touchscreens these actually capacitive
touchscreens use a stylus if you'd like
so you have the option to sort of drawn
and right on just as you would on a
piece of paper in addition these 7 inch
screens are capacitive and make use of
multi-touch meaning like you can on an
iPhone go to pinch and zoom and
according to the video
gizmodo rain which you should definitely
check out in the sidebar that way or
this way one of the sidebars check out
the video really shows us in action you
take the ability to manipulate files
manipulate images and nip y elate web
into sort of a journal that they're
calling it so you can let's say you're
doing a project on problem new
electronics and you go to this case
gizmodo and you look at something like
The Courier you can actually take that
little bit of text you can cut it out
slide it right over to your other screen
save it to your journal you can write
some notes you can annotate it save it
as a notes and you're good to go you
also get a full multi-touch web browser
it's got a camera built-in and it uses a
single iPhone like home button with some
indicators across the top that tell you
you know battery life why if i've
strengthened those type of things
editions got a camera on the back so
supposedly this is in the very late
prototyping phases and microsoft is out
pitching ad agency to sort of promote
this as it comes to fruition it looks to
be a fantastic product no word on what
OS running but odds are it's a custom
build OS the video that was shown to not
look to resemble windows in any way
windows is meant to be a desktop
computer you know guess that this is
some sort of scaled-down custom version
so it is quite exciting and this is sort
of showing the tablet what we always
expected from a company like Apple
perhaps our gazes were just set in the
wrong direction so check out the link on
this courier device it's quite
impressive in the video really is very
nice so I'm curious what you guys think
if you something that you would use if
you have any interest in a tablet do you
only want one screen sort of the duel
booklet style tablet you sound appealing
to you you know I'm skeptical at
Microsoft and bring this to reality but
if they can and do it at a relatively
reasonable price point I think this can
set the stage for really future tablets
moving forward and take a lot of wind
out of companies like Apple sales so I'm
very curiously at my club comes out with
I one of you guys saying to leave text
or video responses for exclusive content
checking out on twitter twitter.com /
john for lakers or exclusive content
checkouts technobuffalo for more
exclusive content a lot of exclusive
content going around
anyway guys I'll see you in the next
video Oh bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
