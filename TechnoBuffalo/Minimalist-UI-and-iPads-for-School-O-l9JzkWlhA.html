to you by full sail university what's up
everyone welcome back to another episode
of ask the Buffalo the show where you
can ask me ashley is gather AKA not John
any question you might have from the
wide world of technology every tuesday
we put up a call for questions on
TechnoBuffalo calm you can leave your
question in the post comments or you can
send them to me anytime of the day or
night at technobuffalo on twitter or
ashley ask either but make sure you use
the hashtag ask the be so i can see it
and usually I'll answer between three
and five questions every episode well
this week we're going to talk about the
full-size iPad versus the retina iPad
design minimalism and more this is asked
the Buffalo let's get answering Twitter
user Brandon L Rogers asks what type of
college degrees are suitable or ideal
for someone who wants to get involved in
your field of work it's a really good
question it's something that's really
interesting there are about a million
ways you can get into writing about
consumer electronics the first would be
start up something yourself Brandon you
could do it you can you there we have
the power we have the technology we can
build it you can build your own tech
website another way to do it is you can
get a degree in journalism you can get a
degree in business and start your own
website and hire people basically you
just have to be passionate about what
you want to do so if you want to get
involved in technology you want to be
passionate about it which obviously you
are because you wrote in to the show
make sure that you make your editors
lives easy by having your own voice as a
writer so that everyone knows what
you're talking about and that you are
able to speak eloquently about any topic
and also you want to make sure that you
have great spelling skills great grammar
skills so that people are not constantly
cleaning up after your articles so those
are the two things i would say to work
the hardest on but honestly you can get
in pretty much any way that you can i
mean if you can get a job working at a
website do it our next question comes
from at comic books guy he says john i
have to get an ipad for school and i
don't know whether to get the mini or
the newest one with the retina
display well comic books guy I have to
ask you this question are you going to
be using this iPad to read comics
because I think your twitter handle is
sort of giving you away there and if
that's the case you want to go with the
retina displays you're not that
beautiful display when you're looking at
all of your comic books however if you
want something else a little bit more
portable you would be shocked at how
many people I know that have gone from
an ipad 3 or an ipad 4 to an ipad mini
without any complaints they actually
prefer it to the full-sized ipad mostly
because it's a lot lighter it's easier
to carry in a bag if you have a smaller
bag if you have a macbook air if you
have any kind of thin laptop and you
don't want to lug around another huge
device then an ipad mini might be the
way to go but like i said i'm a little
suspicious comic book guy i think that
you are going to be reading comic books
on this ipad in which case i would say
go read twitter use our ditzy pixel
wants to know what are your thoughts on
the minimalist future of interface
design and do you think it will hinder
usability I thought this was a really
good question and I think that we are
seeing sort of this trend of minimalist
design in interfaces but I do think that
the reason let's say the iphone
originally had all of these sort of
skeuomorphic designs that made you think
you were using you know an office
desktop calendar or anything like that
was so that we could get people used to
using a smartphone or a touchscreen so
these are things that people weren't
really used to beforehand if they
weren't mired in technology so now
people are so used to iPads so used to
iphone so used to HTC wants Android
Windows Phone that three-year-old babies
are using iPads so it's so easy and
really kind of in our collective DNA at
this point for the most part I think
that minimalist design is really the
future of it because we don't have to
get people used to using the technology
so if that makes any sense we know how
to use a touch screen we know how to use
gestures so in that way I don't think it
will hinder usability and I actually
think it'll open some doors as to kind
of merging the way hardware and software
works together technobuffalo commenter
josh asks hey Ashley how does it feel
working in an office with all guys uh
well since I have started here I
been shot out with nerf guns we
constantly trash talk and I have a
feeling that today after buying the left

everybody's really cool there's no drama
we all just have a really good time and
of course there is not all guys here you
have to think about the ladies boosie

dogs here in the office and they're
delightful so it's not quite all guys
