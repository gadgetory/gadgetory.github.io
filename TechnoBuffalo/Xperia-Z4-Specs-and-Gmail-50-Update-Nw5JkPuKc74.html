to you by godaddy what's going on guys
the markings hangin from technobuffalo
and in today's rumor roundup we'll be
talking a little bit about the new gmail
app the Xperia z4 that can mark a major
hardware upgrade for Sony and if your
current galaxy s5 user Android lollipop
should be right around the corner this
is rumor roundup let's start rounding
those rumors up Android PI point 0
lollipop was officially unveiled last
week but it looks like Google may have
at least one big surprise still up its
sleeve a new leak reveals gmail 5 point
0 for android which updates the upper
material design shows added support for
competing email services including yahoo
and outlook it's pretty similar to
Apple's mail app for iOS and the new
version of gmail will apparently work is
a catch-all service no matter what email
provider you use the entire thing looks
really clean and sleek but there's no
word on what exactly jml 5 point 0 is
scheduled to launch now I'm a big fan of
the current gmail app on Android and how
it's designed and we can't wait to try
out the new gmail 5 point 0 for android
lollipop so coming up next let's talk a
little bit about sony's upcoming
flagship device now the xperia z3 wasn't
much of an upgrade over the z2 at least
not from a hardware perspective but it
looks like the upcoming xperia z4 could
offer some seriously improved specs when
it launches early next year now the
device was recently leaked which claims
Sony will add a faster processor a
bigger screen and more sony apparently
plans to keep pace with the latest crop
of flagship phablets packing xperia z4
with the 5.5 inch display with a qHD
2560 x 1440 pixel resolution and they
also come equipped with a powerful
Snapdragon 810 processor with 64-bit
architecture clocked in at 2.8 gigahertz
and it should come at least with 32
gigabytes of storage it should also come
at forward gear bytes of RAM which is
insane for a smartphone I remember my
first laptop could only take two
gigabytes of RAM so four gigabytes
inside a phone might be a little
overkill but who knows what Sony's doing
with that now alongside xperia z4 were
also likely to see a z4 compact as well
hopefully it won't be too long before we
get a look at the Xperia z4 lineup but
for now the z3 and z3 compact are both
great options
for anyone in need for a new android
smartphone let's take a quick break from

user and wants something new to the
table well Android lollipop should be
coming very soon reports are saying that
Samsung is currently on scheduled to
begin releasing android 5.0 lollipop for
the galaxy s5 starting in december it
wisely warns that the launch may even
take longer for some models for the
galaxy s5 now in the US for example each
single provider will need to make sure
that the software passes the
certification tests which means that we
might ultimately see international
models of the galaxy s5 with Android
lollipop in December now as carriers
approve it one by one the launch will
slowly expanded even more devices and
