to you by a full sail university what is
going on in YouTube I am jon rettinger
welcome back to the pursuit of rumor
roundup this is the show where we take
the best hecklers from the week we
condense it into one show of Awesome so
you know what you missed and what might
be coming in the next few months let's
start with some crazy specs for the
galaxy s5 album I pagadian to wireless
charging in a way that we have never
seen before an HTC One successor smells
like coming in early 2014 the HTC to
these rumor roundup go ahead and start
rounding things up the galaxy s4 is
arguably one of the best SPECT phones
out there books like the galaxy s5 it
might be getting some crazy new specs so
mysterious new samsung smart phone was
spotted on the benchmarking site
gfxbench earlier in the week with the
model number SMG 900 s which is not a
sexy name but it's got a very sexy specs
supposedly has a 2k resolution screen
that is 2560 x 1440 which is insane
quad-core Snapdragon 800 clocked at edge
just walk e 2.5 gigahertz Adreno 330 GPU
and running 4.4 kitkat before you get
all excited it's possible that this is
the galaxy s5 for those specs don't at
all line up with what we've expected
with samsung's next flagship phone the
s5 supposed to feature of course these
are all rumors and things can change a
64-bit processor this device doesn't
even offer the latest knack dragon 805
processor instead running the older 800
which Qualcomm released in mid-2013
Samsung doesn't like to put mid specs in
anything for their flagships based on
the devices model number the SMG 900 s
might be a follow-up to the recently
released galaxy round you took a look at
which is a weird round ii phone which
had model number g 9 10 s there's been a
ton of noticeable technologies absent
from Apple's products for me though NFC
and wireless charging have been the
giant ones I've been pining for but
looks like we might get a solution to
the latter one so i did a patent first
i'm covered by patently Apple
appropriately named you told a crazy
charger which uses near feel
magnetic resonance or NF mr to power
multiple devices at once even without
touching them so stay with me here one
image in particular suggests the hub
could charge your mac wireless keyboard
and the mouse as well as nearby iPhones
iPads and iPods it's also possible to
placed on the sketches future I Maxim
technology built into them turning your
computer to a freaking wireless charter
for all your Apple product just by being
in proximity of the computer which would
be incredible it would be really true
wireless charging imagine having your
macbook pro or macbook air just chillin
around your house and charging
wirelessly you're totally reduce the
need for plugging anything in at all I
really hope this comes to pass probably
won't happen for the iphone 6 maybe
it'll be the cool new technology for the
6s but Apple please do this make it a
reality because that would be freaking
living in the future the HTC One was
probably my favorite phone of 2013 it
looks like a successor gonna be coming
in early 2014 before you say duh let me
tell you the information is coming from
so a patent trial between HTC and nokia
in the UK earlier in the week had some
kind of cool results revealing what
could be the launch window for HTC's
next flagship smartphone now they're not
going to call the HTC too but i like to
call it that according to a High Court
judge richard Almo das public ruling the
HTC One successor allegedly codenamed
the n8 will launch either februari or
march of 2014 based on previous leaks
the m8 may also come equipped with a
5-inch display quad-core Snapdragon 800
I was kind of open for the 805 run
KitKat 4.4 out of the box but of course
we won't know anything until they make
an official announcement perhaps we'll
see said six on board as well removable
back and probably the fingerprint scan
that we saw in the HTC One max either
way I'm excited but maybe they'll make
that HTC logo an actual freaking but

be and take a break for a minute to
