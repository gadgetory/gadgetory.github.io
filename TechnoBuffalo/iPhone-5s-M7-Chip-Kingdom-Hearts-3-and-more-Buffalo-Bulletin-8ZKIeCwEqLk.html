processor and Apple maps Kingdom Hearts
3 soul calibur three lost swords and
Jimmy Kimmel's clever iphone 5s Frank
it's Buffalo bulletin time hello
internet and welcome to the Buffalo
bulletin where we recapped five major
stories from our site technobuffalo calm
every tuesday and friday if you're
interested in reading more about any
story we talked about on the show check
the description for links or click on
the graphics for every story if you have
annotations available and toggled on I'm
Ashley skava here are your top stories
while everyone was busy talking about
the new iPhones this week an interesting
story hit the wire about a guy named
David hakan he's got an interesting
project called foam blocks where your
individual smartphone components are
easily swapped out on a middle
motherboard layer now if that sounds
crazy it kind of is but it's actually
just so crazy it might work so make sure
you check out the video speaking of the
new iPhones we're hearing the m7
coprocessor and the iphone 5s will
integrate with Apple maps and change
settings on your device based on what
mode of transportation you're taking and
where you are plus it's similar to the
Moto X's ability to tell if you're
driving so we're sure Apple will be
developing even more interesting use
cases for the m7 as time goes on in
gaming Square Enix crushed the eager
hearts of many a kingdom hearts fan this
week when they announced tetsuya nomura
is only one man and can't work on bulk
Final Fantasy 15 and kingdom hearts 3 at
the same time that means we will be
waiting a pretty long while for Sora and
the Heartless to return to our consoles
especially when you think about the fact
that it's been seven years since Final
Fantasy 15 started development and it's
still not out our wild card for the week
comes from none other than Jimmy Kimmel
the late night host pulled a classic
prank outside his studio this week
handing people and ipad mini and telling
them it was an iPhone 5s my favorite
moment of the video this one there's
also click it and lick it if you click
the bottom circle you can lick it and
also taste the flavor so I just lick it
yeah
comes in chocolate vanilla I can't
really take oh I can't taste it anything
no that's so weird yep click it and lick
it I might be weeping for Humanity on
the inside well that's the buffalo
