with the xperia x performance a new line
with a brand new design language from
the company since this is a fresh phone
from Sony we're gonna give this video a
fresh approach I'm going to give you
pros and cons about the xperia x
performance and you can make up your own
mind let's jump in with the pros
expandable storage is here so if you
need to carry your music pictures
wherever other miscellaneous things you
carry on your microSD cards xperia x has
you covered the cameras are incredible
which is not a surprise from Sony to
actually make most of the sensors in
every other phone you also get manual
controls and an incredibly wide ISO
range but my favorite there's no camera
hump here if you're an audiophile loses
your phone as a speaker quite a bit
first get a good pair of headphones but
if you do rely on your phone the
front-facing speakers on the Xperia X
are really good and although the display
is only 1080p some of the folks in our
office you're actually thought they're
looking at a 2k panel it looks really
good colors a nice and vibrant and it
does offer different color profiles to
choose from not surprising from Sony the
build quality here feels outstanding the
glass display is really smooth inner
feels premium it's brushed metal back
honestly it reminds me of a refrigerator
it's got kind of a cool slab look to it
top of nice build quality X performance
is also IP 68 dust and water resistant
the phone looks and feels premium which
you'd expect for a price point of $700
which I promise you we are going to talk
about so let's just get right into it
with the cons that price point the X
performance is the same price as Samsung
Galaxy s7 and 400 bucks more you can buy
two one plus three is I have a very hard
time recommending this phone a very hard
time wrapping my head around spending
$700 for a phone anymore
alone spending $70 for a phone that
doesn't offer what other $70 phones have
and aside from the camera and the
Snapdragon 820 it doesn't really have
flagship specs anymore no USB see for
example no fingerprint sensor in the
u.s. despite the button looking like
Sony's fingerprint sensor the screen is
1080p although as I said in the pros
it's a very good 1080p I can't believe
I'm gonna say this it only has three
gigs of RAM only just still a lot of RAM
if modern flagships going upwards of six
needs a little bit more the button
placement on the Xperia X premium just
left me scratching my head to place
another power button volume rocker and
dedicated camera buttons oh let me be
like whoa
happened the placement is really awkward
the buttons are super low on the right
side of the device the bezels on this
phone are ginormous I've kind of I kind
of accept bezels on phones like the
iPhone because it's a physical home
button there but you don't have any sort
of home button or buttons at all on the
bezel it's sort of a baffling design cue
here the general rule of picking up a
phone for the next year or two years
non-phone that's gonna be good now but
phone that's gonna be able to perform
well in 12 months 24 months and while I
think the xperia x performance will
perform okay it's tough to recommend at
this price point with phones being so
good at it v so kind of dollar price
point it's hard to wrap my head around
700 bucks for foam that's lacking really
key features having said that if you're
a fan of Sony you want an incredible
camera you want a physical camera
shutter button the experi X performance
is a decent option if you want to do
heavy VR for example you're gonna want
to look elsewhere 1080p screens not
going to cover for you if your key
selling points for a phone or camera
extendable storage and water resistance
look at the experi X if those aren't
sort of in your wheelhouse so you should
definitely look elsewhere
so you guys think about the xperia x
performance let us know down below just
mash the thumbs up button we always
appreciate it as you guys think about
whether on the Xperia X performance is
right for you also give a thoughts maybe
creating your own website fun fact the
original John 4 Lakers comm was created
using if you said Squarespace you are
correct

create professional design sites and I
am NOT a coder and they require zero
coding at all the tools are super
intuitive really easy to use and they're
gonna give you a free domain if you sign
up for a year you want to create a
website you just don't want to worry
about learning how to code check out
squarespace.com slash TechnoBuffalo
or use offer code techno for 10% off
give it a shot everybody wants a website
everybody fancies themselves the next
logging star now is your chance to prove
it put your money where your mouth is</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
