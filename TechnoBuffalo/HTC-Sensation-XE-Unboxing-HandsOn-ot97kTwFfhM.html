of a long story but I'm glad I did
thanks to the folks at HTC we could this
what is this get this off the table for
sending me the sensation XE it's not
available in the US it is available in
Europe so mine came in a white box not a
retail box let's open it up all right
it's the sensation X II the HTC phone
the new version of the sensation that is
powered by a little piece of films
falling off there we got here gotta get
to your full experience er powered by
Beats Audio I had dinner with some of
the folks from HTC last week when I was
up in Seattle for the Intel a pup
conference and they showed me some of
their newer phones and we even empower
them in any partisan and one of the reps
was carrying this phone around using it
as his personal device and I was like
wow that thing is sharp with the all
black on black with the red accents and
the beats logo on the back and you know
now I have one to try out so thanks to
HTC for loaning it to me
it's the sensation XE it's the XE
version of the sensation as the name
would imply so it's a little bit of a
step up in some of the specs again not
available in the US so that you can buy
it unlocked its GSM so it'll work on GSM
carriers but it's also banded to work
with t-mobile both in US and Europe so I
believe it'll do HSPA+ on t-mobile us as
I struggle with the battery cover here
it's become a trademark of mine over the
years as so many of you on Twitter are
so nice to point out okay so we had a
little protective thing inside the
device Android phone with the Beats
Audio technology dual cameras HTC Sense
get the battery cover back on hopefully
they'll be enough juice to fire it up
maybe not usually the other day usually
they shipped with a little bit of power
so we'll get to the phone specs in a
second also in the Box get the beats
earbuds usually I don't even bother with
the earbuds but these I'm excited to
check out see if you know they're really
worth the hype or not check it out
monster headphones anyway with the red
cable this phone's gonna look hot with
the black on black red kind of excited
about this the specs don't do it for me
as much as they used to but the design
does 3 button remote control in line
there and what are you can control
volume with this also I hope so
I like me I'm looking for a volume from
the from the air phone cord
there's my beats by dr. dre it's funny
it looks like it says I beats is that
what these are called I beats I don't
say I beats anyway there's my case bling
bling every time I come into your city
also in the Box I need open this it's a
USB cable USB to micro-usb I have a
million of those lying around and an HTC
modular power adapter the phone itself
aluminum unibody construction 4.3 inch
display QVGA it's got HTC Sense onboard
we'll skip all this stuff it's got the
so it's Android with HTC Sense got a
dual-core 1.5 gigahertz processor under
the hood four gigs of total storage 768
megabytes of RAM except privacy 4.3 inch
QVGA display I'll set up my accounts
later
so 4.3 inch with the full qvg or I'm
sorry qvg a 4.3 inch qHD display Thank
You 960 by 540 high res display
front-facing VGA camera in the back
you've got an 8 megapixel camera dual
LED flash autofocus 1080p HD video
recording the newest camera software
that is supposed to capture photos
faster and faster faster than ever and
that's how you know as these cameras get
better on the camera phones and people
rely on them more on
more as they would on a point-and-shoot
camera actually the the quick reload
time really important you know I'm sure
we've all anybody who uses their phone a
lot as a camera knows the software so
you've got Android 2.3.4 Gingerbread and
then HTC Sense 300 right on this one
anybody who's there for a lot can tell
you you know use your phone as the
camera can tell you that I it's
frustrating when you miss a shot because
you're waiting for your camera phone to
reload because it's slow sometimes the
software gets bogged down but other
times thunderstorms tomorrow other times
you know it's just that the camera
software is not very good so hopefully
this one will live up to the hype and
actually reload quickly for rapid fire
photo taking but we're looking at the
widgets here on the front got the HTC
widgets pre-loaded as well as the
Android widgets HTC watch this is since
3:00 which doesn't have one of the newer
widgets that was on the HTC Rhyme and
really liked that widget that much
anyway but I just curious if it was on
here I don't see it
anyway let's go to the camera real quick
the phone is about eleven little more
than eleven millimeters thick feels
really nice in the hand solid
construction the aluminum it was really
nice and how the black just looks sick
it's just there's something about sort
of the two-tone black the glossy black
bezel with the still glossy but a little
more kind of textured you know slightly
matter finish if you will around it and
then the red surrounded by chrome the
red LEDs on the bottom I don't know I
just think this phone looks great maybe
yeah maybe I'm a sucker cuz whenever i
watch SportsCenter everybody's got their
Beats Audio stuff and I'm jealous but um
I don't know I think it looks pretty
cool let's go to the camera I will try
some rapid-fire photos here
Bam Bam yeah you have to hit it twice
BAM go back to photo mode and then
shutter but that's very fast you know
we'll see how the phone is after like a
week or two of using it
if it's still going on this fast but
that's that's pretty quick and then
you've got your front facing camera as
well or what some in video mode now
sorry I thought I wasn't
there's the wah ba-bah blah blah blah
yep pretty quick doesn't make me look
any nicer but it's pretty fast and look
at that I can zoom way way way in so
this was the front-facing camera that's
just VGA it's good on one of the rear
camera shots in the earrings weigh in on
the texture of this bubble wrap an inch
or a megapixel and the q HD 4.3 inches
worth of it you can get way in there I
don't know man this is a really nice
phone I'm excited to play with it
rocker switch and microUSB port on the
Left spine on the bottom that
persnikitty battery cover button on the
right nothing doing up top headphone
jack for my Beats Audio earbuds excited
and power lock switch front-facing
camera earphone grill 4 capacitive touch
buttons on the back your camera your
logos there you go what is wrong with me
I'm too excited about these logos anyway
there you go a quick first look at the
sensation XE again not available the
United States officially you can order
through the internet I've seen it for
around 650 $700 unlocked and then it is
available over in Europe and the UK I
saw some pricing in the neighborhood of
500 pounds which I guess translates to
close to $700 u.s. sounds about right
anyway but very cool very excited the
folks the HTC saw fit to lend me one of
these and I'm looking forward to putting
it through its paces on the t-mobile USA
Network see how it does beats much much
more on this phone and the other new HTC
phones including the Rhyme I mentioned
and everything else I think Apple
announced some phone recently we're
gonna talk about that in this video over
on TechnoBuffalo comm so next time my
name is Noah thanks for watching bye bye
