TechnoBuffalo here with a review for you
on the 18 th p ipaq glisten little phone
with a lot of names this is going to run
you about 180 bucks on a two-year
contract it's takes a new take on the
blackberry form factor the candy bar
style with a keyboard down below and a
touchscreen up above we'll talk about
the specs in a minute but since this is
a phone first and foremost it's got to
make a decent calls call quality was
very good on the ipad list in the radio
that HP put in is able to maintain it
very solid signal strength call quality
on my aunt sounded great call quality on
the colors and sounded very strong as
well they both experienced no white
noise and people couldn't even tell that
we were on a cell phone so it was very
very good and signal strength was quite
strong really anywhere i was able to
maintain a relatively nice 3g signal so
talking about other sort of call quality
features speaker phone on this is quite
bad and a little bit of an embarrassment
for HP a little bit of a speaker grill
right there but that's about it really
low if you want to use a speaker phone
in the car this is not going to be the
phone for you let's talk about specs
this thing has a 2.5 inch qvga screen
resolution of 320 x 240 it's quad man of
course so it's gonna work anywhere in
the world it's tri-band UMTS selector 3g
it also has gps Wi-Fi B&amp;amp;G bluetooth 2.0
USB 2.0 and a proximity sensor all the
stuff you'd expect from a modern
smartphone resolution wise and i'll show
you the 320 x 240 screen does not look
so hot it's a little bit tough to look
at menu items we look at the windows
start menu you don't get many that you
can view I won't say though it has i'm
scrolling through here the resistive
touchscreen HP use a quick responsive it
works very well without a lot of touch
necessary scrolls very fluidly processor
wide it's powered by a Qualcomm 533
megahertz processor it's not
underpowered it's not overpowered sort
of right in the middle it's got a 512
megabytes of brawl
200 of which are accessible and 256
megabytes of RAM I've move about a
hundred and forty megabytes of which are
accessible and of course got a micro SD
expansion so I've talked about windows
mobile 6.5 or Windows Phone is Microsoft
is calling it in the past this is sort
of your standard build windows mobile HP
put nothing unique on this this is just
windows mobile in its raw form that's
not necessarily the worst thing
sometimes the skins that go on top of
this can have a bit of a processor drain
not so with the iPad it does come with a
mammoth 59 1590 milliamp hour battery
which lasts for days I was able to use
this thing for two full days with heavy
internet usage heavy calling and still
have about twenty percent of the battery
done so if you're a big user a power
user do not worry about battery life
it's actually one of the strongest that
I've used one of the great things about
this phone is the keyboard it's got a
really nice very big keyboard as you can
see the keys are raised and the phone
itself is a little bit on the white side
which not necessary the worst thing take
a look at it next to well an iphone you
can see that the keys it's a little bit
bigger and the keys are really nice type
on it's probably one of the best
physical keyboards that I've used in
this form factor there's low bridges you
can see where the keys are and just
feels nice and smooth that would have
liked the cute or the space bar to be a
little bit bigger but it was not bad if
you enjoy this form factor and it was a
lot of you do this is probably one of
the best keyboards on the market overall
I came by relatively impressed with the
phone which is really not what i
expected i took a look at the specs call
quality was great it was very responsive
it worked the keyboard was fantastic and
for someone like me who use the internet
quite a bit being able to get through
days and days with it it was really a
nice benefit to have so if you're in the
market for a windows mobile or windows
phone 6.5 device this one is definitely
worth checking out brings a lot to the
table if you don't like the standard
build of windows mobile you can always
throw something on here
like spb mobile shell or any other skins
that are available there a ton to really
give it some increased functionality if
you can deal with a little bit of low
resolution but you like the front-facing
keyboard the ipaq glisten is going to be
a very nice way to go on a one-to-five
scale by give it a very solid for that a
higher resolution screen and maybe a
little beefier processor probably would
have come close to that five mark for
windows mobile it gets definitely one of
the best all-inclusive packages out
