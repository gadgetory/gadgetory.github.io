unboxing for you of the Palm Pre and the
Palm touchstone conductive wireless
charger let's take a look at the box
before we dig in you have a picture of
the device the Sprint logo some specs of
the device on the back letting you know
that this box contains the phone the
lithium-ion battery AC adapter stereo
headset the rest of stuff will kind of
go through as we see it it's got Wi-Fi
Bluetooth and full GPS capabilities top
of the box it just says sprint and the
bottom two some serial numbers and the
Sprint logo so go ahead and slide this
off and the box here is very similar to
what sprint used for the Palm Treo Pro
with the sleeve it's very eco friendly
peel off the sticker I should say that
when you get yours in the store they are
gonna have to open it up to activate it
so the box comes right off there's sort
of protection tissue paper on the top
and here we've got the Palm Pre with a
screen protector on it will push that
right off to the side for just a moment
lift up the clear plastic shell that
holds the device you've got some getting
started information and an orange little
piece of plastic got a recycle envelope
to recycle your old phone some more
getting started information had it
turned on and how to use it some more
documentation right below it
introduction so the Spanish version of
what we just looked at it's a clear
plastic piece that separates the
paperwork from the accessories let's see
what comes in the box it's all put in
there with this orange almost like a
ribbon so we have then pull the ribbon
out a sleeve it is not leather but it is
cloth for holding the device it's not a
holster but it should protect it I don't
think I will ever use that but if it's
your thing there you go we've got a USB
cord to a micro USB
you've got your wall charger slides out
USB port plugs right in
and we've got a pair of stereo
headphones for the 3.5 milimeter headset
jack with microphone so here is the
device itself let's go ahead and boot it
up you will have to go through a
introduction and a palm registration you
first turn it on let's go ahead and take
a look at the phone itself and be sure
to stick around to the channel in the
coming days and weeks of a full bevy of
reviews going over the operating system
internet messaging really every facet of
the phone
definitely stick around if you like some
more information while that is booting
up let's do a size comparison with what
I consider to be the Prius biggest
competitor the iPhone 3G you can see
that it's certainly much smaller
thickness wise it is definitely a little
bit thicker that is due to the full
tactile QWERTY keyboard so while it's
booting up let's go and take a look
around the device and see what we have
it's on the left hand side you've got a
volume up and down and nothing else the
front of the device it's got the
capacitive palm touch screen which from
what I understand the screen is gorgeous
and vibrant but we'll see in a moment
it's got this one button and it looks
like a scroll ball but it's not just a
single button you push in it does have
this gesture area right here you can
flick forward and back and up to pull up
a quick launcher on the right hand side
of the device
we've got appears to be a button or some
sort I assume it is a soft launch button
on the top of the device we've got the
3.5 milimeter headset jack we've got the
volume profile switch so that will
change it from vibrate to ring very
easily palm is put that on all the
devices from the tree go on back and
your power and lock button on the back
you've got your camera port with flash
and a very large speaker grille and I've
got this glossy coating so you know the
phone is turned on it will do full
details here of webOS the operating
system emphasis running but it's got the
quick launcher you can go through and
pull out and it's using the card
interface so next let's go ahead and
unbox the wireless charging and this has
uses inductive charging you
the device right on top of it and it
charges let's go ahead and break the
seal here well use a pencil to do that
there we go and just a picture of it on
the front open up the box and it does
come with a new backing sort of a matte
finish and that's to help it stick to
the touchstone charger I'll show your
comparison there you can see that the
default backing is shiny and this one is
certainly met and that's really the only
difference pull this out and here is the
touchstone conductive charger what this
does is you take the power cord and you
plug it in the back you plug this into
the wall and to charge your phone you
just put it right on top and that's it
you don't have to plug your phone in you
just put it right on top and once you
have the new back on it'll stay right on
device I'll do a full demonstration of
the touchstone charger at a later date
