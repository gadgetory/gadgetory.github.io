technobuffalo here we are in New York
the samsung galaxy s4 event and what
would an android phone ounce and beba
that a comparison to the iPhone let's go
ahead and bring it back going on it of
course you've got the iphone 5 1080p
screen here Retina Display not quite
1080 here on the iphone 5 the big
difference though is the size and of
course to build quality let's go ahead
and do a little stacker on here there I
got a two phone sandals just need the
phone meet there in the middle I can
surely see difference in the size the
four verse 25 inches on the galaxy s4
have to go ahead and put these two
side-by-side the iPhone 5 is certainly
no fatty but the s4 certainly looks and
feels then at least not a big story that
was definitely the build quality a
similar story with HTC One no removable
battery of course the iphone and no
expandable storage as well both phones
are extremely quick of course will do a
full comparison test once we get intact
on buffalo labs on the left hand side we
don't have much different sim card slot
on the iphone a volume rocker up and
down so go ahead and put these two guys
right next to each other you're on the
left-hand side we got the volume buttons
in a profile switch on the iphone 5 turn
this around on the right-hand side power
in lock button on the top power and lock
but on the iphone and of course the 3.5
million headset jackets and noise
cancelling mikes big difference of
course is a camera there's a lot of
stuff going on at the camera back here
on the galaxy s4 both phones bring us
unto the table and i can't wait to put
these two phones head-to-head to see how
they perform there's been a really quick
video we're gonna fight these guys out
