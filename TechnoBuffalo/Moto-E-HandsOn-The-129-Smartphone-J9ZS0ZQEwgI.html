technobuffalo I'm here in a meeting with
Motorola so pardon if I'm a little quiet
checking out the Moto e you it's just
announced today and it's already
available for 129 dollars I can see up
front here we've got the 4.3 inch
display moving around nothing on the
left-hand side on the back you've got
the back it's a removable color up the
cover I don't believe that the battery
is removable but you can add additional
storage up to 32 gigabytes with a
microSD card and there's four gigs
installed right now there's a
5-megapixel camera there 3.5 millimeter
headphone jack up top sorry the volume
buttons on the power button on the right
hand side and then we're back on the
screen here you can see it's running on
HSPA network that's because it doesn't
have LTE support though the Moto G gain
that today for 219 dollars now if you
want that in addition to expandable
storage on that device as well so quick
look at the software you're running
android 4.4 point2 KitKat and it's going
to be upgraded to android android 4.4
point 3 in the near future as well and
it has some custom software on here you
see assists and other features that
we've seen on earlier Motorola devices
but alert is a new one right here you
can have people meet you so that
specifically somewhere to location have
an emergency a contact or follow you so
if you say meet me you can send your
location to somebody so they can come
find you an emergency you'll start
calling somebody if you need that so say
you're walking home you don't feel
comfortable you can look now it's in
panic mode so it starts calling somebody
so you don't wanna hit that all the time
and then
try to back out of here the third one's
called follow me and it basically show
it sends alerts as you move along so if
you're driving somewhere and you want to
send somebody updates on where your
location is every 5 to 30 minutes it
will ping them just like that so 5 10 15
to 30 minute intervals that's a quick
look here at the Moto e from Motorola
