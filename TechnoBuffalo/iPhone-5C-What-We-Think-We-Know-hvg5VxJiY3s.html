discussing what we think we know about
the iphone 5c so there's a lot of rumors
speculations and leaks flying around in
the blogosphere for all the websites
about this iphone 5c but we do know some
key points about it so number one it's
going to come in color the iphone 5c
we've seen boxes of this suggesting that
will have different colors like blue
green yellow a pinkish orange and maybe
even white no word on black yet but it's
definitely going to come in color and
some people are even suggesting that
they see an iphone 5c stands for color
number two lower end specs you're not
going to see the same specs as an iphone
5s or an iphone 5 even you're probably
going to see no Retina Display maybe no
LTE and definitely not any of the new
features the iPhone 5s is remember to
have like biometric fingerprint scanning
it's definitely aimed at the lower end
of the market so keep that in mind when
you're doing your research number three
price it will definitely be cheaper than
other iphone so i think apple is
actually going to take the 5c and
replace the forest with that making it
199 for the 5s on contract 100 for the
five and free for the 5c model it makes
a lot of sense in terms of at that point
they have a full lexicon of devices at
any given time once they release that
last flagship model for a particular
number so next year we'll have the
iphone 6 and then of course we'll have
the iphone 6s and the iphone 6c so
that's what i think they're going to do
with price but it's definitely designed
for emerging markets which brings me to
number four got to get in emerging
markets this device is designed for
emerging markets like china in first
quarter of this year samsung sold over
12 million smartphones to chinese
consumers and Apple only sold 6.1
million that's a really big gap and
apples absolutely going to be looking to
catch up and make up for the difference
with the iphone 5c our number five is
launch date we don't have a specific
launch date we don't even have a
specific event date for them to unveil
vice but we do think based on rumors and
speculation that will be seeing the
iphone 5c shown off and maybe even
released sometime in September alongside
the iphone 5s oh that's what we have
that's what we think we know so far
