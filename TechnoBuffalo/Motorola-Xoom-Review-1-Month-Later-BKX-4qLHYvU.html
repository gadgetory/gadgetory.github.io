membership today what's up everyone jon
rettinger from TechnoBuffalo here it's
been just about four weeks since the
world was introduced to the first
android 3.0 honeycomb tablet the
motorola xoom and in that month time the
tablet world to change quite a bit we've
seen the ipad to get released we've got
more details on the LG G slight coming
out we've got more details on HTC's
flyer and there are a ton of other
Android 3.0 or other tablets coming on
the market so what role does the zoom
have sort of in that and I thought it'd
be a great time to sort of give you an
update and what I fought about using the
zoom for the past month as you guys
decide which tablets right for you so
let's go ahead and get started so the
first thing I want to talk about is
something that I discussed during my
review and that is the build quality of
the motorola xoom the build quality is
absolutely outstanding Motorola did a
fantastic job with the device as far as
manufacturing goes it feels really solid
in hand and when you're using it you've
got no doubt you're using a high quality
piece of hardware it's heavy without
feeling bulky it's solid without being
heavy if that makes any sense at all you
got a whole bloody things in your hands
I really feel is absolutely fantastic
and I noticed that when i first used it
and the more that I've gotten to
familiarize myself with the zoom the
more I like the way it feels sort of in
that building there's something about it
that I found a very very annoying and
that rests right where you put your left
hand on the back side the left one
you've got the screen facing you and the
right side when you've got it turned
over and that is that lock button is
incredibly annoying to have to find with
your finger so when you've got the
device in landscape mode it's alright
you can go ahead and feel it right there
with your finger go ahead lock the
screen or decide to unlock the screen
however when you've got the device
rotated you really have to check to see
which way you have it so whether or not
you've got the motorola logo
in the upper right or whether or not the
motorola logo is going to be on the
bottom left it depends on where you put
your finger to find that lock button so
whether you got to go to the bottom or
you got to use your other hand to go
back up and hit it it's been a huge
annoyance with motorola xoom i wish if
they were going to do a physical button
that it would have been on the front of
the device i would have made it a lot
easier it's especially strange
considering they knew that the home
button was going to rotate and they used
a soft button here always in the bottom
left I really would have liked the zooms
have had the physical button right on
the front so I could always know where
it was one of the big problems that I
had at the zoom when I first in my
review was the lack of apps meant for
3.0 tablet or android tablets in general
that has since been rectified there are
a ton of tablet apps available and there
are a lot more coming soon let me go
ahead and show you what those arts go
ahead and back up here go ahead and jump
back go back into market let me show you
some of the great tablet apps that are
now finally available for the motorola
xoom so you're featured tablet apps go
ahead and jump in and from what I did my
initial review and there may be a
handful there are now many many many
more and many coming soon developers
have had a chance to get their hands on
the SDK now I had a chance to perfect
their applications and there are just
more coming on a daily basis so if
you're worried about apps there
certainly aren't as many as you'd have
on previous two dot something versions
of Android or Apple iOS but there are a
lot of apps available a lot of apps that
you use and loved in the past so things
like Dropbox of course you've got angry
birds living in here somewhere movies
there's angry birds seasons Cat in the
Hat you could like there are a ton of
application support now that wasn't
there in the past so talking about
Android three-point on the home screen I
know you guys were saying right there I
am taking my wife I'm a good husband I
am taking her to go see Lady Gaga in Las
Vegas this weekend that's the kind of
guy I am I didn't delete it I figured
I'll leave it there so you guys could
know possibly even make fun of me in the
comments
android 3.0 honeycomb as an operating
system I found it to be a little bit
cumbersome it can be difficult to
navigate at times but the more you learn
it I think the more you can appreciate
what Android can do for you I love
Android this is the same with a
smartphone world it is fantastic for
customization if you like to do even the
slightest bit of tweaks with your
operating system if you want to change
icons or have interactive widgets
android 3.0 does a really fantastic job
if you want to get to the core the OS
and you want to make big changes you've
got the option to do so in a lot of
these UI tweaks you can do without
having to do any fancy routing you can
go right to the App Store and download
apps that are going to change the way
you look and interact with the device
that is definitely one of the pros of
Android I really grown to like as well
and this is one of things i mentioned in
my review I loved notification system
insert the growl esque icons across the
bottom I think they are extremely
elegant and it's just a fantastic way to
view things as they pop up you can see
it right there some email there's a
thing to sign into an account new
applications available for download they
don't get in the way and they really
present the information nicely I do miss
the Android transfer pulls down but I've
definitely gotten used to this so one of
the big additions that wasn't on the
zoom when it launched is flash flash
10.2 is now available let's go ahead and
take a look at what that's going to look
like we'll go ahead and hop on over to
youtube you can see a video here of Noah
topping then go ahead and push play and
you can see know what talking all right
let me going to push play you've got a
sense to see what this looks like it's a
little bit choppy as Android arts flash
generally has been on Android but it's
very very watchable whether that's a
combination of flash 10.2 or the really
impressive hardware the Tegra 2 and the
gig of ram that are in here i'm not sure
but you can definitely watch full screen
flash without any difficulty this is
probably one of the best mobile
implementations of flash that's
currently available on the market
when you hear flash and the next thing
you're thinking of is hulu will you be
able to watch hulu content unfortunately
the answer is no you can view the hula
website but you can't view the content
let's go and take a look at the web
browser this is still one of the best
implementations of tab browsing that
I've seen available and this is of
course an android 3.0 they not unique to
the zoom but the problems that i had
when i first used the device are still
there you notice it's not as fast i like
it to be take some time for the content
to show up and this is over a relatively
fast Wi-Fi network i think this is a
typical instance of the software not
being fully optimized yet for the
hardware the hardware that's in here is
i just mentioned the Tegra 2 in the gig
of ram are extremely impressive this
thing is as fast as laptops from not
even a few years ago or at least should
be in theory as we see new updates to
android 3.0 a 3.0 one or whatever they
decide to call it i think we're going to
see the core operating system take more
advantage of the hardware so motorola
motorola xoom in android 3-pointers
whole is resting a lot on the potential
of what it can be it can be that
lightning fast platform you can offer
fully robust flash content it can offer
smooth pinch-to-zoom but it's just not
there you see the time that it takes to
load there's a lot still based on
promise of what this can do and the fact
is that what it's doing right now it's
not delivering that optimal experience
I'm really excited about what honeycomb
can potentially bring and this has
nothing to do with preference towards
operating system whether its iOS android
or webos coming soon for the touchpad
this is just how it interacts with the
zoom and it is very slow that's not to
say that it's going to be true with
other Android devices it's just not as
fast as other tablets out there and
again I think it's just the case of the
software not being fully optimized for
the hardware unfortunately let's go
ahead and jump back home so those are
some like quick impressions of the
motorola xoom android 3.0 honeycomb I
love the interactive which is here I
think it's fantastic way to interact
with your content I love being able to
scroll through and see things in a
dynamic way I love the customization
options
that I have with the zoom and there are
certainly a lot here if you're looking
to get a tablet and you sway the Android
way your cross shopping with the ipad to
still give the zoom a very very solid
look it offers high end features it
gives you the customization of Android
just know that you're not going to be
getting the lightening fast speeds that
you'd expect from the Tegra 2 if this
was a slower last generation snapdragon
chip that was processing this i'd say
it's probably relatively fast but
considering what Tegra 2 it's capable of
and what the rest of the hardware
engineer can do just not as fast as it
should be but i think in the next few
months we're definitely going to get
there and hopefully we'll see 4G being
added to the motorola xoom as well
currently out of the box it does not
support Verizon's 4G network it is going
to have to allegedly be sent back to get
that 4g upgrade something to keep in
mind you might want to wait until you
can pick up a 4g motorola xoom or even
the Wi-Fi only version coming out very
soon so what do you guys think do you
agree disagree did I get a little
rambling on you very curious to what you
