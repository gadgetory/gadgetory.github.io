TechnoBuffalo here a few weeks ago we
reviewed this guy it is the LG g3 but we
had it in an international version
straight from Korea that had this crazy
antenna we didn't see yet is what a US
carrier is going to look like what comes
in the box and the rest of that goodness
we finally have a version from t-mobile
that we are going to unbox and show you
what you can expect when you get your g3
from a carrier store go ahead open it up
we've got the box for the u.s. g3 all
done up here and kind of a Goldy silver
this is for t-mobile as that logo will
tell you to believe
last time visited with the g3 which I
said was the best phone I've ever
reviewed not the best Android phone the
best phone I have ever tested a we had
international Korean version which has
this crazy antenna which is fun to walk
around with and make people think you're
actually using it for reception but it's
used for TV in South Korea so this is
the US brain as it mentions go ahead and
see what we got in the box if you want
to read our full review or watch the
full review video on the g3 we'll put
the link to that down below go ahead and
check that out
here's advice pull off the side for a
second letting you know it's got laser
focus just like me
t-mobile sent us like two SIM card this
will send actually directly from the
folks at LG I think in conjunction with
t-mobile we got a welcome and start
guide charge and sync cable we've got
just a wall wart and the battery which
is 3000 milliamp hours there's a one
knock I had on this phone is that it
didn't have wireless charging I would
have loved to of seen that onboard but
hopefully we'll see something like that
make its way to the next version or
perhaps a new backplate so I go ahead
and put the battery in this guy ah the
phone feels super light obviously it
goes heck no batteries in there go ahead
and pull off the little back part so
we've got the back off that is where
your micro sim and microSD card
everything micro is going to live
including the battery so go ahead and
take one of the assumed cards a t-mobile
gave us pop it in pop in the battery and
I'll give you guys a quick tour in a
moment to back this guy all powered up I
waited to pull up screen protector to my
favorite things to do on camera
boom it is all off and ready to go so
being a modern LG phone you got buttons
on the back volume up volume down and
your power and a lock button go ahead
and turn on that gorgeous scream it
doesn't look so gorgeous until it is
unlocked so this is a quad HD screen
what's quad HD you say it's got a lot of
pixels so it's a 5.5 inch green that's
diagonal with a 2560 by 1440 fix our
resolution that is a whopping 534 PPI
which is insane Android 4.4.2 at launch
being powered by a beastly 2.5 Gertz
quad-core Snapdragon 801 chip 2 gigs of
RAM on board or you can't get some
international ones with 316 gigs or 32
internal storage of course you've got a
lot of LG software on there including
they're not feature that'll lock and
unlock it you have external storage up
228 gigs I saw you in the back might
take off the back of the device that
camera has a few secrets as well it's
got laser autofocus it also has a 13
megapixel camera and a 2.1 megapixel
shooter up on front Bluetooth 4.0 3000
milliamp hour battery and of course NFC
so we looked at the Korean version there
were just a crazy amount of bloatware on
the phone let's go ahead and see if that
carried over to the u.s. area here it
looks like the bloatware has been put
right inside of a single folder which I
like the t-mobile does but it's actually
pretty useful we do a voicemail right
out of the bat if you want if you want
to access your accounts or mobile
hotspot I can do that straight from an
apps including a t-mobile name ID which
leave for a fee you can see blocked
colors or unlisted colors to what number
they are so it might be important to you
and that is really it not much bloatware
here at all t-mobile's I think it's done
a really nice job with that well go
ahead and go back home again with my
favorite features that I liked about the
phone to the full review is first you
can pick what the on-screen button is
going to look like with you like black
or white or initial set up the screen
here was just absolutely gorgeous and
that really did it for me a design
almost bezel s display I like the
location the buttons on the back I
thought it was much more natural than
the previous GT I still thought my
finger was hitting the camera lens quite
a bit
but not as much as the g2 overall just a
really enjoyable experience it was fast
it was elegant I just worked well I'm
excited to test it using us care so
anything's different than the
international variant will update the
review okay something stands out whether
better or worse or check that link get
link is going to be right down below and
we're getting a pretty beastly service
here as well so we should be able to run
it through everything this phone is
capable of and you guys want to see
though let us know leave the comments
down below
