unboxing for you of the HTC Hero for
Sprint service this is undoubtedly one
of the hottest phones of e holiday
shopping season and I'm looking forward
to taking a look at it last time we saw
the hero we saw its GSM cousin and a
little bit of a different shell with a
bigger chin and of course it wasn't have
release on any US carrier so it didn't
have any sort of u.s. 3d so that's very
difficult to take advantage of all the
features to fajn offer so I'm very
excited to see how all those features
sort of combine into one offering that
Sprint is putting out this is gonna run
you 179 dollars on a two-year contract
after a rebate let's go ahead and dig
into the package of course we'll use the
big ol knife to do this again we'll try
and shave off a finger to okay we got
the package open let's see what comes in
the box that's some some press materials
push that off to the side and here is
the box itself
all right we got charged battery first
but hopefully it'll be enough to
demonstrate Lisa turning on so you got a
picture of the device on the front next
to a very small woman or a very large
phone depending on how you want to look
at it it's got a very different design
than what we last saw some curious how
it's going to look I have not seen one
of these yet in person a typical sprint
box
information on the side the now network
with their branding and picture the
device and some features on the back
let's go ahead and take a look and this
is of course running again the Sense UI
HTC zone overlay on top of Android this
is not running Android 2.0 but it's not
initially that big of a deal since it's
got a completely new skin on top of it
although HTC has said they will upgrade
this a 2.0 let's go ahead and dig in and
see if we get in the box opens up a
typical sprint fashion from the front so
there is the phone itself push it off to
the side for just one moment let's see
what else we get in the box not too much
you get your wall charger clip that just
flips out and your USBC cable which also
connects to a wall charger it looks like
that uses a mini USB and you've got a
substantial getting started guide with
Sprint's phone recycling envelope if you
want to send back your old device but
that's not why you guys are here it's
not why I'm here either let's take a
look at the hero itself and we'll do a
real quick size comparison to some other
devices you guys may have seen and we'll
turn it on I've done some walk through
the Sense UI in the past but I'm gonna
do it again to show you how it works
on a 3G network and all the tweaks that
sort of sprint made to it there's been
several firmware upgrades since I last
saw it sends to I device so I'm very
curious again to how this is all going
to come together in a package so here it
is with the iPhone 3GS and here it is
with the blackberry storm2
2 slab devices it's er just get a sort
of size comparison for stack all three
for you so you can see the thickness of
it
very easily pocketable so initial field
of build quality seems to be very nice
and substantial the phone weighs enough
without feeling heavy and just enough to
not feel cheap it's got a very nice feel
to it got some of that soft touch rubber
in the back which I like a lot and a 5
megapixel sensor on the back you've got
a speaker grille and your mini USB we've
got on the left side your volume rockers
on the right not much on the top your
3.5 millimeter headset jack on the front
of the device you've got your typical
array of Android keys
you've got your Menu key you've got your
search key your HOME key your back key
there's your microphone and of course
your send an end key which also doubles
as a power key so I think this is
probably not going to much of a charge
in it let's turn it on at least see if
we can take a quick look and you also
have some LED indicators across the top
and there is your main speaker to get
the HTC branding you probably get the
little Android going guy that will pop
up and the Sprint splash screen
one that little Android going guy that
pops out
all right so here we are this is the
unlock screen for the Sense UI simply
take this and it slide it down I'll
probably take a second to recognize the
network system guessing this hasn't been
turned on in quite a bit and the battery
is definitely in need of a charge and
I've got a pretty strong EVDO Rev a so
pretty nice 3G signal here so it'll be
good for testing purposes and here we
are this is the Sense UI now unlike
typical Android instead of having just
three home screens we actually have five
you can sort of see that bar across the
bottom move you're also saying a lot of
these HTC widgets that are already in
place here so I'll go to a blank
homescreen and I'll show you real
quickly some of the widgets that you can
add looks like also you've got your
standard array of sprint features and
we'll go through all this in later
videos
we've got your it navigation and NASCAR
so we can tap to add enter the Android
widgets you've probably seen before but
again I'll show you those in a later
video but the ones you might not be
familiar with are the HTC widgets so go
ahead and open those up and see what you
get bookmarks calendar clock footprints
which I'll walk you through messages
music people photo album I'll let you
guys read the rest there quite a bit
here to choose from so Sense UI really
offers a lot right out of the box and
definitely a lot of customization
options so I want to run this through
the test run through the paces and put
it through a ton of tests and we'll see
how it stacks up and ok guys hope you
enjoyed and definitely stay tuned for a
ton of hero coverage coming up hope you
