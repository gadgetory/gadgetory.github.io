Hazleton from TechnoBuffalo I apologize
in advance it's a little loud but I'm
here checking out the lumia 950 one of
the first Windows 10 phones that was
just announced today in addition to the
lumia 950xl
it's a slightly smaller that's a 5.3
inch quad HD display as opposed to a 5.7
inch screen but you still get quad HD
under the hood a Snapdragon 808
processor 3 gigs of ram 32 gigs of
storage and if you pop off the back you
can actually add up to I believe an
additional 2 terabytes of storage of
course those cards aren't available yet
but eventually they will be so what you
have here is Windows 10 and obviously
very familiar interface here you can
start to search for apps so if you
wanted to search for Facebook it it
comes right up and then Cortana is
another central feature of Windows Phone
10 so who dude hello I guess that's what
they use it for the name but you would
bring up sports stores and stuff like
that whatever is in your notebook or
oops I just hit reminders but whatever
is in your notebook as your favorites so
here you could have you know specific
quiet hours or finance for stocks to
follow or sports and stuff like that so
she's always there but one of the cool
things and they try to the lights not
great in here but up top here is the
iris scanner for Windows hello and that
will basically allow you to look at the
screen and it will identify your face
and then unlock which is really cool so
on laptops that feature has already
existed and it also works with
fingerprint readers and so Microsoft
here has sort of ditched the fingerprint
reader method and relied instead on the
on the iris scanner so here on the back
you've got that 20 megapixel camera get
a tripple LED flash which is pretty neat
so they say you won't look like a ghost
in pictures you'll actually have some
color your face you got the single
speaker there the left hand side nothing
it's a polycarbonate body and if you
look behind me there's a various backs
they're kind of glued down that you can
swap out for different colors on the top
you've got the 3.5 millimeter headphone
jack on the right volume keys the power
button
off you can see it's already trying to
do windows hello there and the camera
key and now if we hold the camera key we
should be able to launch into the camera
we'll just test you real quick 20
megapixels so
it's like it's pretty quick snapping
photos then we can go up we're locked
out of the phone and you can see though
it's got this red light that glows
trying to look for the person that
wanted to see it but in any case we
don't have to really dive much more into
it this is a quick look at the Lumia 950
running Windows 10 I will launch for
about five hundred and forty nine
dollars at the entry level this is Todd
