tango in the past we haven't see any
release devices for it until lenoble
took the wraps off the fab to during a
klonopin tech world event in San
Francisco if you're not familiar with
project tango this is a combination of
camera software and magic to essentially
3d math to space around you it's
incredibly powerful especially if you're
trying to design a space the practical
use for device like fab to is really
kind of cool let's say you're moving
into a new house and you want to pick
out furniture you could take your fab to
put it in the room and actually put
couches you could put chairs and design
the space all on your phone and then
move the device around to actually walk
behind those digital things you placed
it's incredible to see and it's a brand
new kind of reality on your thumb that
having to put on to an HTC vive or an
oculus rift you did all right from your
phone and I use the term phone kind of
lightly because this is pretty much a
tablet I got big mitts listing is six
point four inches which is just huge for
a phone it is a quad HD display it's
pretty packed with tech it's got four
gigs of ram 64 gigs of expandable
storage not the highest in the processor
standpoint and Snapdragon 650 too but we
felt no lag at all with this device
there's not gonna be a phone for
everybody it's probably not gonna be
most people as primary device but if
you're an interior design or your
developer that's really wanted to make
the next augmented reality game it's a
really cool platform to have and have an
erection released phone you can look for
lenovo fab to pro at Best Buy and wait
for it lowes yes that home improvement
loads another store starting in
September for 499 bucks this is a phone
you definitely want to get to a store
and check out actually see what it can
do something brand-new and we don't see
that much brand new anymore in the tech
space so i give lenovo credit for
bringing out the first project tango
device</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
