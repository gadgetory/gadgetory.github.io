let's continue where we left off so the
internet tab is also very functional
under the browser icon you can find new
finger-friendly Quick Links lots where
you can add links to your favorite sites
loading times on the Opera Mobile have
been cut down by a little but browsing
speed has been given a significant boost
you can now scroll down the page with
good haste with barely no lag and the
hardware can now better keep up with all
the content that's being streamed in the
multi-touch feature can now be used for
zooming in it's pretty basic stuff if
you've ever seen an iPhone used soo
mning in works well and with good speed
and as you can see the massive hirez big
screen makes web browsing that much
better thanks to the 4.3 inch screen you
barely ever need to zoom in and even the
smallest of fonts are nice and readable
screen rotation on the web pages is also
very fast and the browser scales the
pages appropriately Opera Mobile may
still have some ways to go but the
browsing experience on the HT - thanks
to the big screen and speed is probably
the best I've experienced on the mobile
device the calendar tab is pretty much
the same as on previous iterations but
this time around you're not taking to
the windows mobile interface when you
fill out your calendar info you actually
stay in HTC's custom user interface
which is a nice touch
the stocks tab is still a slightly
depressing place to hang out the economy
is still in the dumps but the stocks
application itself is pretty good the
photos and videos tab is almost
unchanged from that full 3d but as you
can see everything works a lot faster
the screen rotation animation is pretty
slick and the pictures themselves look
excellent on the big high-res screen the
HT 2 only supports 65,000 colors but if
it looks this good not much more is
needed and the multi-touch also works
nicely when zooming in and out of photos
the HT 2 has a 5 megapixel camera which
takes pretty decent pictures it's not
the best camera I've seen but it takes
good pictures in high light situations
and the dual LED flash on the back helps
in low-light situations
it won't do any miracles in big spaces
but when you're taking pictures of
close-up objects the dual LED flash does
a good job I did get a pinkish tint on
some of the photos I took but I heard a
software update for this issue is on the
way the camera may not be able to
compete against dedicated cameras but
for a mobile device it's very sufficient
video quality is a bit mediocre but I
personally never use my phone to record
videos so that's not an issue for me the
music tab has gone through some minor
modifications but nothing drastic but
again it simply works much faster than
on earlier hardware the external speaker
on the device is pretty small it can
produce a high volume but quality isn't
that great compared to for example the
touch booth has forced more robust
speaker set the headset included with
the device plugs into the 3.5 millimeter
headphone jack and the headset is not
bad it has a nice dynamic range and it
produces a sufficient amount of volume
the weather tab has been given a
graphical update and the animations are
gorgeous you can add several occasions
or you can adjust the phone to find
weather info for your current location
on the bottom of the tab you can see the
weather forecast for several upcoming
days as well alrighty to the new stuff
it's great to see that HTC has noticed
the importance of social media and
networks the Twitter tab is a simple
Twitter application that looks good and
actually works very well tapping on a
tweet will bring up new tabs with basic
twittering or if you prefer tweeting
functions you could reply or send direct
messages and add favorites let's create
a quick tweet to see how it works the
meaning of this tweet will be
revealed to you and there it is fast and
easy tweeting off your phone the Twitter
app works as a great addition to the
interface included on the device are
also a Facebook app and a YouTube app
the footprints tab uses geo-tagging to
stamp your pictures to a time in place
using the built in GPS and it's actually
a pretty cool feature especially if you
suffer from short-term memory loss and
speaking of GPS the device comes with a
15 day trial of the copilot navigation
software I took to the road and tested
out how it works in previous videos I've
used TomTom navigation software which
has been an ok navigation app excluding
some minor bucks
the copilot software worked without a
hitch the GPS signal was constant and
strong I never lost a signal and the
software got me where I was going and if
you thought my voice was robotic listen
to this that's finished by the way
copilot has a very simplified user
interface that works great with a big
capacitive screen and I can definitely
recommend copilot as the navigation
software and the hd2 as a navigation
device ok before we get into the tests
and benchmarks I'll quickly run you
through the windows mobile 6.5 Start
menu where you can access the majority
of your programs the new windows mobile
interface is actually pretty sweet it
runs very smoothly in the icons are very
finger friendly and accessing programs
is very fast the device comes with
office mobile and some other very useful
applications new to windows mobile 6.5
is the marketplace that gives you fast
access to software and entertainment
some of the apps may be a bit overpriced
in my opinion but there's a lot of
interesting apps and content with
reasonable pricing as well windows
mobile 6.5 is definitely a step in the
right direction it's no longer an
eyesore and functionality is vastly
improved
alrighty time to put the hd2 through
some tests first up is multitasking I'm
gonna fire up a dozen programs in the
background and see how it affects
performance oK we've taken up most of
the 448 megabytes of memory and as you
can see the performance of the device is
still smooth there are some slight signs
of slowdown but I'm very impressed at
how the hd2 handles multiple programs
running in the background next up is
gaming and I'll be running a game called
extra as a gamer the gaming department
is something I feel has been a bit
lacking on the window
mobile device arena but in a way I'm
thankful because I'm not entirely sure
that the mobile gaming we see for
example on the iPhone is beneficial to
the gaming industry in the long run a
majority of the games on the iPhone are
a step backwards into substandard
novelty and if that's the quality the
new generation of gamers come to expect
as to quality they're gonna keep on
getting but I do realize the mobile
games aren't supposed to compete against
their ps3 and xbox360 counterparts
they're supposed to compete with boredom
anyways as you can see the hc2 is
running this game at is very stable
framerate and the capacitive touch
screen seems to work great there may not
be a lot of new games coming on the
windows mobile platform but you guys
know that with a few emulators you can
run your favorite LucasArts classics on
your windows mobile device last but not
least let's check out how the HT 2 can
handle a few common video codecs at
different bit rates I'll be using core
player 1.3 2 which can be purchased
online as the benchmark video i'll be
using captured game footage from the God
of War 3 which is extremely demanding
because of its fast pace so it's an
excellent video for benchmark I ran the
video at 5 different bit rates and two
different formats and the HT 2 fared
extremely well I ran the same video as a
comparison on the touch pro2 with older
hardware and as you can see the new
hardware makes all the difference the HC
2 is capable of handling bit rates up to
10 megabytes per second without skipping
a beat I am very impressed by video
playback performance and it's going to
be tough to go back to my old touch pro2
after seeing the HT 2 in action because
unfortunately they aren't letting me
keep this review copy in conclusion the
HC 2 brings much needed speed and
fluidity to the windows mobile
experience external features and build
quality are excellent only a slight -
for the awkwardly shaped camera lens the
Sense UI is not a revolution it's more
of an update and renaming of custom 3d
and because I considered the old
touchable 3d to be the best custom UI on
the Windows Mobile operating system the
Sense UI only strengthens that position
the ideology behind sense with its tight
integration with social media will be
appreciated by users across globe and
what better a flagship for the new
interface and HD 2
