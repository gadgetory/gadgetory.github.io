there more and more tablets at CES 2013
you know you love it don't lie hit the
comments section and tell me how much
you love it on YouTube how's it going
guys I'm Aaron Baker from TechnoBuffalo
let's take a look at toshiba excite 10
st which is a new tablet from toshiba
widescreen display here you can see it
really is a good-looking tablet that
something really like the design is just
really nice on this you've got your
camera on the back and just in terms of
specifications the android 4.1 jelly
bean out of the gate to get android is
equal now has a nice integration nvidia
tegra 3 cpu here on or at that slim
inline point 4 inches then 1.4 pounds
you've got a slim light tablet even fit
your bag I go in Android 4.1 you can see
nice and fast thanks to the project
butter on this device of course Google
now integration like I said as well we
can take a look here of course we can
say Google and it would automatically
pop up if I'm closer and it wasn't so
loud in here it would automatically pop
up and give us the ability to search
using our voice so you've got dual HD
cameras 3 megapixel back camera 1 point
2 megapixel front facing camera and like
I said a quad core processor so it
really it's a powerful spec sheet what's
interesting though is in the US and we
find that these devices sell pretty well
when they get either carrier
distribution or to an even greater
extent retail distributions I hope to
see this in best buys and in office
depots and office max's more and more as
time goes on it looks like HW some
different hard solitaire spades all
these cool card games for you cool cats
and then book plays backgammon I'm just
kidding those are all card games are for
