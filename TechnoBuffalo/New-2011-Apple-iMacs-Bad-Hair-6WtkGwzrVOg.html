technobuffalo here and I know what
you're saying what's up with the locks
it looks like something died on your
head and it's true I need a haircut very
badly but I figured instead of covered
up with a hat I'd be honest with the
audience let you know it's big and it's
ugly and it has nothing to do with
technology but I felt they need to share
so we are doing something kind of neat
that I'm trying on technobuffalo we are
doing a poll where you guys get to vote
on what you want the next video to be on
which is kind of neat so we had a few
choices today which is the third of May
the Xperia Play unboxing the playstation
phone the Xperia Arc unboxing Droid
Charge features and cameras and all that
business or an imac spring 2011 update
going over the new imac models that were
released today or other well the results
were pretty strong the Xperia Play had
an early lead and the imac spring 2011
definitely won this this is an idea that
you guys like where you get a say in the
videos that we do not on the daily basis
but maybe once or twice a week I'll
leave your feedback down below I thought
it's fun it gets me another chance
interactive you guys which I always
liked and sort of know what content you
would like to do so in light of that we
made a brand new apple imac 2011
infographic which is up on TechnoBuffalo
com actually our own John quach used his
ridiculously talented skill sets to make
this and this is where i'm going to show
you all of the new 2011 apple imax i get
a ton of updates about computers some
pcs some max it's difficult to keep up
with all the pc manufacturers that are
coming they have a much shorter product
release cycle and apple does and that's
one of the benefits that people go to
pcs to get those latest specs quicker
Apple generally updates there is a
little bit slower but we do now have an
update to the 2011 imax or rather 2d
2011 imax there now the 2011 so to those
love an imac spring update running the
new
Andy bridge intel processors also known
as the second generation of the ICP you
so that's core i5 i7 and a little guy
the i3 did you lie 2010 imac so the
previous generation was running the
first generation of these systems and
only saw a quad core option on the high
end 27 and it was definitely a screamer
the latest release sees all four
generation in 2011 imac sporting i 5
quad core processors in their most basic
configurations at the higher price 21.5
inch and 27 models being upgradable to
dev faster a7 models the i3 processor
has been eliminated so no I free for you
you guys want to fall along with me you
are welcome to do so so check out the
cool stuff this does so we're gonna go
over to performance boom talk about some
fun graphics I'm you might be seeing
this format pop up and a couple other
things so here the new i5 and i7
processors up to 1.7 times faster 8 16
gigs of ram the new iMacs come with 4
gigabytes of ram and that's to two
gigabytes of ddr3 MIT ram so it should
be pretty fast you can see all the
further stuck if you want to check out
this chart yourself on technobuffalo
graphics also got an update like that
fancy animation kind of love seeing that
it just Scrolls but it's really pretty
so the graphics the 21.5 inch imac it's
got the LED backlit display the TFT
screen resolution of 1920 x 1080 2.5
gigahertz quad-core processor AMD radeon
6750 and with 512 megabytes of ram the
21.5 like the base model it's super fast
now you can go to 2.7 gigahertz
quad-core moving my hand around but you
guys can't see it anyway to camera the
27-inch imac got an upgrade 2.7 Gertz
quad-core up to 3.1 gigahertz quad-core
on the i7 super fast you can go up to
wow the new processor the new video
cards AMD Radeon 69 70 m with up to 1
gig of ram so that's crazy graphics card
got
significant upgrade at 2011 spring I'm
Mac model to the 6000 series AMD radeon
HD dips so super fast storage the 200
21.5 inch imac is a 500 gigabyte hard
drive at 7200 RPM s you can go up to a
terabyte you can also do a solid-state
option out when 256 gigs 27-inch now
it's got a terabyte in there you can
figure it up to two terabytes you can
also do that to an 6 gigabytes all its
date uh we're now rocking to Thunderbolt
ports which is crazy so you can now hack
technically have three monitors your
main monitor and two other displays if
you really wanted to have a giant
display you get the faster input output
which soup might see it as I oh I / oh
that just dance for input/output the
copies and write speeds essentially
we've got some face time nu H FaceTime
HD camera take video at 720p same face
time better resolution what everybody
cares about the pricing 21.5 inch imac
1199 dollars or the 1499 dollars for a
little bit of upgraded model you can add
customization options the 27-inch is
1699 and goes up to the bigger model at
1999 you can get more expensive if you
start adding solid States and second
hard drives and all that business if you
guys like this the next one over there
is comments you can go ahead and leave
comments or you can share it with
friends up here or whatever you want if
you want to go back and check it out you
can go ahead and hit overview and do
that I want to know what you guys think
