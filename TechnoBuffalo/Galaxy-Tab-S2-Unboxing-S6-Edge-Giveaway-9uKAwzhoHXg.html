technobuffalo here's an unboxing of the
latest tablet from samsung this is the
diminutive lieth in Samsung Galaxy Tab
s2 we've got the 8 inch model here it's
also available in a 9.7 available in the
same three colors of white black or gold
and because I can read we have the black
version 32 gb Wi-Fi it's also an LTE
version the boxes look pretty similar to
what we seen with the note 5 me s6 edge+
some specs on the back some model number
and the rest of that things but you
don't need to worry about reading I'm
gonna take you through what this little
guy looks like I'm really excited to see
this guy i've been using a sony z for
tablet my dedicated tablet but this guy
supposedly gives it a run for its money
and as superior in a lot of ways so we
will give it a shot go ahead and use the
I'm really gonna chop off a finger one
day obligatory big-ass knife I'll go
ahead and slide the top off of the
galaxy tab s to the folks at the Samsung
sent the sky for us to take a look at
break that tape here is the tablet and
if you want to do a little bit of
reading it's the Tab s2 very thin really
light this size is probably going to be
like hey here's the nexus 8 that we're
all gonna be carry around their pockets
as a phone in a few years off to sign
for a real quick second we've got the
samsung charger looking for some sort of
turbocharging emblem on your don't see
that and we've got just a typical white
micro USB cord sim removal tool not sure
I've got one since we don't have a sim
so I'm guessing that's how you get to
the expandable storage we've got a 32
gig model that's also available in 64
pricing is going to start at 299 so our
model is the entry level so price 309
some booklets on getting started in the
rest that things that we're not going to
read nothing else in there so let's push
all that box off to the side I will put
it back nicely put it over here and take
a look at a tablet not gonna get my
usual satisfying whooshing noise because
it looks like it's living in a some
micro fiber type bag but take it out
it's part of the first time it won't
ever happen your prints on it there we
go this guy's looking very thin and
there's plastic on the back so I do get
my whooshing noise
my little moment of Zen excuse me while
I enjoy it oh so Russia and I know that
was such a charity thing to say the back
of this feels great it's plastic but
almost is like a I guess Tim it's
tactile stickiness feel to it hard to
describe what this even feels like but
it's unlike any other back I've ever
felt and it feels really nice definitely
not going to slip out of your hands they
go out and Powell this sucker on I will
walk you through the specs so the screen
that is booting up is 8 inches in 2048 x
1536 and if you're a samsung fan or to
follow the mobile industry you'd
probably guess the Super AMOLED display
three gigs of ram crammed into this
super tiny thin 5.6 millimeter frame and
as you can tell android lollipop here i
believe it's a very a five-point oh when
we get into the software i'll see if
it's 5.1 again available in 32 64 gig
configurations but you can a micro SD
card hundred twenty eight gigs so plenty
of storage if you want expansion slot
which is quickly becoming a dwindling
thing also hidden somewhere in here's a
four thousand million power battery part
of this guy is an octa-core processor on
samsung's done with their ex e knows
it's actually two quad cores a 1.9 and a
1.3 working harmoniously and beautiful
synergy to give you eight cores the back
it's got a camera SI megapixel sensor on
the front for doing your face x and v be
sending a selfie to someone you should
be sitting a selfie to it has a 2.1
megapixel sensor and again five point
six millimeters thin this thing feels
like the battery is not in it was only
ten to fifty six grams so that was a lot
of me yammering they go into this guy up
and walk you through the software in the
hardware so you got this guy all booted
up let me see what version of Android we
are
running on here go to about device so
five point 0 point two is what shipping
on here so let me walk you through the
device itself on the left hand side we
have what my teacher said I would amount
to absolutely nothing on the right hand
side got a volume rocker up and down and
a power in lock button on the bottom
we've got to downward facing speakers
3.5 millimeter headset jack and microUSB
charging the home button is actually
Samsung's fingerprint sensing home
button so you can use that for added
security you also have multitasking
button and a back button that are going
to be flanking it on the software side
this should be very familiar if you've
seen any of Samsung's newest devices
from the galaxy s6 on up it's a newest
version of TouchWiz and it's wheelis in
your face and other versions of TouchWiz
you may have used in the past the screen
yo it's absolutely gorgeous as you'd
expect from Samson I think they make the
best screens in industry they're super
Emma Willard technology is pretty badass
and then a resolution to 2048 x 1536 but
i will use it and test it just for a
quick sec before in the video about that
back again it doesn't feel like it looks
it looks like hard plastic I know that
but it does not feel like it so if you
had a chance to try on these in a store
pick one up and feel it because it's
very unique to this tablet so I'm really
excited to take a look through this guy
and see how it performs anything you
guys want to see us test be sure to let
us know until next time I'm John render
