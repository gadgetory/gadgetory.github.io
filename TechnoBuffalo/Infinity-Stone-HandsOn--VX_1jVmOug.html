been wearing this Michael day waiting
for it to come thank you very much it's
heavy it seems more appropriate we got
six movies I think in here I think it
was six and phase three so we've got the
Marvel phase two box set all set up here
I've been super excited for this is only
available on Amazon I forgot that it
went out yesterday said weird one like
frantically and I just wanted to see it
baby give this a try too
this is my second morning in a row
wearing a microphone all day I really
want to watch some Marvel movies we've
been waiting on the Phase two box set to
come which odd leaves and Amazon
exclusives though if you want it that's
where you got to go alright looks like
it it very well may not be it as
experienced yesterday we get a lot of
package here feel too heavy does it
apply but I guess blu-rays aren't so
heavy
alright give this a shot by my count
should be six movies total and then
probably a ton of bonus discs that's
right I'm gonna go ham on this box on
eat up is this is this it is and nothing
else okay
no baby food Christ this number two
averted I've got a subscription service
for baby food I never really know when
it's gonna show up all right Marvel face
to the cinematic universe getting out of
the bag seems to be harder than stupid
bag alright we got it
here we have Marvel's phase two we've
got the collector's edition limited
edition I've got the Morag orb right
there with Infinity stone or gem
depending on if you're a movie or comic
book here
it's Iron Man 3 throwing a dark world
Captain America Winter Soldier guardians
of the galaxy Avengers age of Ultron and
ant-man 13 disks in here could open this
up I've been prepared kept the knife on
my belt let's go ahead and open this
manna JAMA up and see what we're gonna
have inside I should let you if you want
to pick one of these up like 184 dollars
so it's not a cheap bundle but if you
are a marvel fan who wanted all these
movies it's a pretty good way to do it
so that is written the language I don't
understand but I do understand this part
and how to open it so let's see what's
inside perhaps it's something to do with
the sokovia accords ever they're calling
the superhero Registration Act all right
so we've got I think these things are
we've got these things stick like coast
at Marvel coasters so we're not gonna
make messes on our table Stark
Industries R&amp;amp;D department we've got some
post-its from mr. Anthony Stark we've
got Scott kultur Anthony specimen 247 oh

picture of Bucky before he became all
Winter Soldier II and lost his arm

on your car got a lot of stuff in here

is what's going to spark the Civil War

get it there is the more egg or breath
looka inside a little bit oh that's
where the gems gonna go which I imagine
