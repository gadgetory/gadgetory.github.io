to you by the LG twins wash two loads at
the same time talking it off a lot
lately about my Android device launchers
apps games but I want to talk a little
more about things because I have a
couple of games for you guys that aren't
just Android focused they're actually
available on mobile altogether so if
you're an iOS user they're not gonna be
left out in the cold the only exception
is one of these is an emulator and those
aren't available on iOS but with that
said let's get right on into it my first
title it's very near and dear to my
heart I have been playing the living
crap out of Magic Puzzle Quest Puzzle
Quest is one of my favorite games it's
essentially like bejeweled but with RPG
elements and I'm a Magic the Gathering
nerd so they released a game that hits
both of my funny bones and I've been
playing the crap out of it
it is a little grindy it is definitely
one of those games that they want you to
put a little bit of real money into but
they did a pretty good job of making
sure it's well balanced enough that you
feel like you're making good progress
and it is fun enough to play that you
don't really mind how grimy it is so if
you like puzzles if you like the jewel
you'd like RPGs stuff check out magic
puzzle quest just don't be fooled not
all of the Puzzle Quest games are worth
checking out I don't care for the
adventure time one and there are a
handful of it like the Marvel one is not
all that good one of my favorite games
that I started playing literally today
is dark eco I picked it up when it was
on sale over for Black Friday
it's a top-down game all you do it's a
black screen all you do is you play as a
pair of footsteps and as you walk the
sound bounces off the walls around you
it's all top-down you've got to figure
out how to make your way to the exit and
avoid all of the obstacles without being
able to see anything the only thing you
can do is move your character or stomp
on the ground so that you can see your
surroundings it's a lot of fun and it
really needs to be played with
headphones on and the volume turned up
so the next time you find yourself at
home you can't sleep it's dark to put on
your headphones pop in some dark echo
and play around for a little while one
of my favorite games to play and I've
mentioned this in what in one of my
videos before but if you find yourself
bored let's say you're with your spouse
significant other or whatever with a
friend waiting in line for food or for
tickets space team is a phenomenal
option and it immediately gets you
involved with the people around you
people see you and they're like what the
hell are you doing it's a game that uses
either Wi-Fi or local Bluetooth to pair
two phones together and you each have a
control
you're basically on a spaceship on a
space team and all you're doing is
shouting to one another what needs to
happen all you can do is see what's
broken on your screen but it's up to
your partner to help fix it for you and
you can play with up to four people it's
a lot of fun it's a lot of shouting the
next time you're at a party pop open
space team tell everybody else to
download it it's totally free and have
yourself a blast most recently this came
out literally today but it is an
anticipated title for me I have to be
honest I have not played it so it could
be awful because it literally just came
out today but one of my favorite shows
is Rick and Morty it's hysterical they
just put out a mobile game called Pocket
Morty's which is essentially a game like
pokemon or Pocket Monsters but with
Morty's you can get all kinds of
different parties to do all kinds of
different stuff and have little battles
with them and you train your water use
to get them all up to snuff that's the
kind of game that I'm into it's not for
you I totally understand but I've been
pretty stoked on it and finally I
mentioned in my last video that you can
grab Bluetooth controllers that work
well with Android well the best thing to
do with those controllers in my opinion
is grab yourself a Super NES emulator
you can get one for about three four or
five bucks like I said use google
opinion rewards to make that money on
the Play Store for you but go grab that
and then go grab roms for your favorite
old titles make sure you own the
cartridges though because otherwise
that's super not legal but emulators
totally are one of my favorite games of
all time illusion of Gaia you can go
download around install it on there you
have a retro Bluetooth controller and
now suddenly you've got all of your
favorite games of history to play right
on your phone right in your pocket no
matter where you are that's a couple of
the games that I've been playing
recently guys thank you guys so much for
watching
it's just been a fun day shooting videos
for you and I thought this might be a
really great way to end it especially
now that Ron is taking a little nap or
whiskey over here beside me on the couch
so thank you guys so much for watching
be kind of one another and I'll catch
you in the next video
the LG twins watch is one of those
things that you're watching tango
Buffalo and you're like wait a minute is
this a washing machine and yeah yeah I
mean yeah it's a washing machine but
it's actually a really really cool
washing machine
not just because it's got two separate
washing containers and that bottom
pedestal washer actually works with any
LG washer from 2009 forward but because
we live in the future get like our our
washing machines our network-enabled now
that our washing they speak to the dip
they speak to the Internet guys our
washing machines speak to the internet
well yeah I mean all those things asides
these are still just like dope washers
