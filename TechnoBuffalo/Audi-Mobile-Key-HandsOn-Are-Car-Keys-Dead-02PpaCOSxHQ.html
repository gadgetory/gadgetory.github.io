TechnoBuffalo I'm here with Audi
checking out their brand new audi mobile
key application it allows you to do
everything from your phone to manage
your car so you can unlock it choose who
else can unlock it may be a family
member your wife maybe take it away from
your kid if you decide they shouldn't be
driving and you can check your mileage
your gas tank all kinds of cool stuff
let's go through it right now ok so now
we're looking at the Audi mobile key
application you can see you've got a
picture of your car right there and then
this major list here the main list you
can check your inspection it says when
your next one is whether it's a mileage
or how many days tank capacity shows how
much of the gas is left inside of your
tank motor oil when you need a mole
change locking state that says whether
it's locked unlocked and who can access
it whether they've gone through if the
trunk is closed so always good to know
your mileage you can see how much how
many miles rather on your car and then
current position obviously we're here at
the Las Vegas Convention Center it shows
where it is if you want to you can go in
and manage keys for different cars so
you have say you own these two Audi's
but your friend has this one but you
have access to it so maybe you're at a
restaurant he says you're driving home
tonight he gives you access to the keys
so that through your phone you can
unlock the car let's take a quick break
and thank our friends from Lenovo the
Lenovo yoga 3 Pro is one of the lightest
and thinnest laptops on the market a
feature 7.2 hours of battery life and
Intel Core M processor are really
stunning 3200 by 1800 pixel 13.3 inch
display that's a touch screen - and it
has an amazing watch band hinge design
that we really really like check out the
Lenovo yoga 3 Pro but you go in and tap
it here's where you can manage it so I'm
the owner of this car let's say Johanna
but the vehicle drivers you can also
change so like I was saying if you
wanted
give access to your son or your wife or
something like that you can give them
access so they can use outtie mobile key
to unlock their car or take it away from
them so decide that maybe it's a friend
and you don't no longer need them to
have access and you take it away and
then up here too it's just available
pool vehicles where you can go through
and see what cars are available for
pooling around so really cool
application just a quick look here it's
the Audi mobile key and this is Todd
