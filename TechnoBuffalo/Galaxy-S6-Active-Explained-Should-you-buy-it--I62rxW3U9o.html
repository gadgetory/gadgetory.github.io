Sangan from TechnoBuffalo and in today's
video we're going to be taking a closer
look at the rugged galaxy s6 active
while it mostly rocks the same internals
as it's more attractive brother the
galaxy s6 there are some major Hardware
differences today we'll talk about the
difference between the two devices and
see why the active actually offers some
big advantages at first glance you'll
notice that the galaxy s6 active is more
rugged and not quite as luxurious
looking as its brother the galaxy s6 the
s6 is glass and metal body has been
replaced with an armored plastic
material with inserts of rubber that
makes it easier to hold there's also a
nice textured material on the back that
helps to achieve the same effect the
power button on the right-hand side of
the device is a bit longer than the one
on the galaxy s6 and there's also a new
active button on the left-hand side
above the volume buttons which you can
customize to launch any app of your
choice the headphone jack has also been
moved up to the top of the phone while
the USB port has remained on the bottom
moving up front the galaxy s6 is
fingerprint scanner has been replaced by
three dedicated Hardware buttons one for
multitasking a home button and a back
button it sucks that there's no
fingerprint scanner but given that this
phone is designed for the more outdoorsy
type hardware buttons make sense
one of the main differentiating factors
of the active line is its design and the
s6 active is the farthest thing from the
beauty of the galaxy s6 it essentially
looks like the galaxy s6 was plated in
armour ensuring it can withstand the
everyday perils of smartphone ownership
and then some the s6 activists taller
wider and thicker than the galaxy s6 and
it comes with an IP 68 certification
which means it's dust and water
resistant that means that you can drop
the s6 active onto a sandy beach or
submerge the s6 active in up to 1.5
meters of water for up to 30 minutes
without compromising the device which is
pretty awesome
while the differences in exterior are
quite noticeable the internals are
fairly similar both the galaxy s6 and s6
active have the same octa-core exynos
processor a 5.1 inch Super AMOLED qHD
display 16 megapixel camera with oh is 5
megapixel ultra wide-angle front facing
camera and 3 gigabytes of RAM however
there are two main differences between
the two devices one do regular galaxy s6
offers two more storage options 64 and
128 gigabytes of internal storage while
the galaxy s6
it only offers a 32 gigabyte variant to
the Galaxy s6 active has a larger 3500
milliamp battery while the standard
galaxy s6 offers a much smaller 2550
milliamp battery sure there are big
aesthetic differences but by and large
the phones perform about the same you
still get TouchWiz on top of android
5.0.2 out of the box while the camera
experience is exactly the same you'll
still be able to quickly launch the
camera by pressing on the home button
twice which is a very convenient feature
to have the pre-installed apps are
similar as well with the addition of
activity zone on the s6 active which
shows weather information elevation
levels a button to toggle on the flash
and more the active screen looks
identical as well it's vivid contrast
the in very detailed despite the change
in design swiping through the screen
isn't as smooth as it is on the galaxy
s6 and Samsung added a little lip around
the s6 active screen but nonetheless it
still looks amazing
the real bummer here is that the s6
active is an 18 T exclusive device so if
you're using t-mobile Sprint or Verizon
you're pretty much out of luck if you're
someone who finds themselves outdoors
more often than not the Galaxy s6 active
is a nice alternative to the beauty and
grace of the more premium galaxy s6 but
there's anything else you guys want to
see with the galaxy s6 active let us
know in the comments down below and if
you guys haven't already checked out our
unboxing of the device you can see that
over here
before we end this video I wanted to let
you guys know that we are selling a
limited edition TechnoBuffalo shirt it's

TechnoBuffalo logo in the back so it's
super awesome you guys could rock a
