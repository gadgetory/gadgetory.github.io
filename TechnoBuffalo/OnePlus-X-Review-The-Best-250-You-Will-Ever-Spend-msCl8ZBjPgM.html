it's the first one from oneplus since
the kind of ho-hum oneplus 2 so I was
pretty stoked to see if this was gonna
be something I was gonna be excited to
have in my pocket and yes we are
definitely gonna talk about that too and
a $50 price tag because it comes with a
lot of compromises but that's what I
love about the oneplus X it's not all
just the compromises well there are some
compromises of course no NFC means no
Android pay and no USBC means just no
USB see it's really not that big of a
deal they just couldn't fit the module
into this small of a form factor plus
there's no fingerprint scanner on the
back or on the front but most
importantly there's no band 12 or band
17 support and if you're a customer on
t-mobile or AT&amp;amp;T respectively that's
gonna really matter for future proofing
this device for you because if you're
already in a bad coverage area not
having access to those new chunks of
spectrum that's gonna improve your
coverage is probably gonna be a
deal-breaker it's not all compromises
with the oneplus X though like I said
there's a bunch of stuff here to love
first and foremost that ridiculous ammo
LED display when was the last time you
saw an AMOLED display on a $250 device
that should say enough for you right
there everything on this thing screams
premium everything from the curved edges
of the glass to the micro cuts on all
the pieces of metal that you see
everything down to that very very
oneplus slider for your profiles plus it
even supports microSD that's in the same
slot as the dual SIM tray which is a
really really clever way to implement it
it really it while it does make
compromises
it doesn't skimp on the stuff that's
really really important and that's what
makes me love this thing
so the performance of the oneplus X was
unbelievably normal it was pretty good
underneath the hood is a Snapdragon 801
and that was basically the flagship for
last year and it's also what is under
the hood of the original oneplus one and
you know what totally holds up
especially considering that there's
extra ram in here so with three gigs of
ram from day to day I hardly noticed any
stutters at all had a bit of a hard time
with you know bigger stuff games things
of that nature but that's not really
what this thing is for is it it's for
your day-to-day life and for that it
gets an A+
we can't around the 1 plus X is also
pretty serviceable at least for a $250
camera you really can't ask for a whole
lot more
in fact I'll even tell you this much in
the 8 days that I use the oneplus X for
my review I was also using the 6p and
the 6p has a much harder time opening
from a quick sleep into the camera I
missed far fewer shots on the oneplus X
then I get on the 6p despite the fact
that at the end of the day the results
looked better on the 6p in terms of
software kind of do it again I really
like oxygen it's probably my favorite
take on Android they do the right thing
they don't make things worse or do
things that have already been done they
just add things and make them better
for example the actual dark mode on the
oneplus X is amazing the entire settings
menu is actual true blacks which means
it saves on your battery too and the
battery wasn't bad to begin with I had
no problem with just a little bit of
care with my screen on time stretching
the device to 2 full days without a
charge but had been even more
conservative it easily could have made
it to 3 oh man I got to tell you the
oneplus X is a crazy good value at 250
bucks you're gonna be really
hard-pressed to find a better device
than this for your money even if it's
just for a burner phone or the next time
your aunt calls and needs a phone or
someone can't make a decision and you're
that tech guy who needs to help them out
this thing costs $250 they hate it no
big deal get a different one yes it's
got its share of issues and compromises
if you live in a really bad LTE coverage
area for 18 T or t-mobile then it's
probably gonna be a deal-breaker for you
that the two bands aren't supported but
for just about everyone else this is an
incredibly easy buy let me know what you
guys think in the comments is this
something you would actually buy also I
feel like I keep asking the same
questions of you at the end of videos so
you guys asked me a question in the
comments what's the number one thing you
want to know about the oneplus X and
I'll make sure to keep an eye on the
comments so that I can answer them for
you
anyway as always thank you guys so much
for watching be kind to one another and
I'll catch you in the next video
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
