a buffalo because we bought the gear s2
with our own money because we wanted you
guys to see it and I wanted to run on a
treadmill for a while
how's it going guys my first time here
with TechnoBuffalo and I figured what
better way to check out the brand new
Samsung gear s2 then to get a little bit
active here in the gym so in an effort
to stay active we're gonna be increasing
this every I believe every minute it's
also just gonna help us kind of keep the
video challenging so every minute this
speed is gonna get cranked up on me so
why don't we just go ahead and get
started so the s2 is obviously it's a
wearable you guys have seen me wearing
all kinds of stuff the major thing about
the s2 is that the way that you interact
with it is a little bit different than
you might be used to because it's not
running Android where it's running Tizen
which is Samsung's OS the way you
navigate through the OS is through this
awesome click ring around the side and
that's easily my favorite thing about
the device everything else about it is
perfectly fine runs as bad as fast as
you could expect it to the screen is
fine too but this is a really great way
to interact with a wearable and that's
really what I want to kind of start to
see come to other devices it would be
great to see Android wear try and adapt
something like this as an interaction
form for Android wear the gear s2 is
actually pretty fun to use using that
click wheel that's going to get you
access to the other little widgets that
are on the screen here in Tizen there's
all stuff that you're gonna be used to
from the S line of devices it's got s
help all that fun stuff you can even
track and see how much coffee and water
you've been drinking throughout the day
my major issue with the s2 is that
because it runs Tizen you're not gonna
be able to run all the great stuff that
you can run on Android with Android wear
I really miss having the ability to
respond to hangouts messages being able
to see things like my weather app that I
use on Android so the ring is great the
device itself is great but because it's
not running Android wear I just can't
really recommend it to anyone I feel a
little bad about it because it's a great
device it feels great on the wrist it's
just not got a lot in terms of
functionality which I really miss I know
John only uses wearables for
notifications but I like to be able to
interact with them well we made it all
the way to 7 on the treadmill so
hopefully we should be able to just go
ahead and tap right here let's see what
might hurt it's probably pretty high I
think it's a great device if you're
running Samsung in your pocket obviously
run Samsung on your wrist
otherwise it's probably I don't buy let
me know about what you guys think about
the s2 is this something you might
actually use not being able to respond
to notifications makes a really big
difference with me thank you guys so
much for watching that's always be kind
to one another and I'll catch you next
