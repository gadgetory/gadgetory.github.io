hanging from TechnoBuffalo and if you
remember a couple of months back we
upgraded her entire camera system to
Sony now we were originally using Canon
c100 which is still a great setup but it
was time for us to upgrade to 4k so we
bought the sony fs7 and the sony a7s
with the add sumo Shogun for 4k external
recording while video quality is very
important to us audio quality is also
key for making good videos we've been
looking and looking for the best
microphone solution and today we'll be
taking a look at Sennheiser's new AVX
wireless system which includes a
handheld microphone a receiver a body
pack transmitter and a lavalier
microphone now what's awesome about the
AV AK system is that it fully self
configures within seconds the receiver
is this tiny rotatable XLR connector
which sits in very tightly on RFS 7 and
it can either use its built-in lithium
rechargeable battery which Sennheiser
says less good five hours or use phantom
power through the XLR input from your
camera the body pack transmitter lasts
at least 10 hours according to
sennheiser and you can of course charge
both the transmitter and receiver via
microUSB now what's even more awesome
about the AV X system is that you can
also use juice packs to charge the
transmitter handheld mic and receiver
which is pretty nifty if you're out on
the field filming for the whole day the
AV X system also features an aes 256-bit
encryption which is great if you're
worried about people trying to listen in
on your conversation while you're
recording your video or audio what we
wanted to do for this video is to give
you guys an overview of the new mics and
also let you hear the quality and how
the new AV x wireless system performs
compared to our current setup we're
currently using an audio technica
lavalier mic that connects via XLR and
having to double up on cables and
connectors when I mic up is a huge
hassle so having a wireless mic pack as
small as this may be the solution for
that specific problem so let's go ahead
and test out the new wireless lav pack
and see how it performs in our studio
and compare it to our old audio
technical lab alright guys so we are
testing out the audio technica pro 70
which is our current setup as you can
see from this dangling XLR cable and I'm
just gonna read a few lines from the
website and hopefully you guys can take
a listen and tell us in the comments
down below which one you think is better
Apple's iOS 9 operating system with
rolled out to the public on Wednesday
technically has the capability to enable
Wi-Fi calling for AT&amp;amp;T customers with
iPhones all right guys so we are testing
out mic number two which is the new a VX
wireless lav system now what's awesome
about this since it's all Wireless I can
stand here and still talk to you guys or
I can be here talking you guys I can be
here as well talking to you or I can
move here anyways I'm gonna read the
same article from the website and let me
know in the comments down below if you
guys hear a difference Apple's iOS 9
operating system which rolled out to the
public on Wednesday technically has the
capabilities to enable Wi-Fi calling for
AT&amp;amp;T customers using iPhones and that's
about it this is the new Sennheiser AVX
wireless system this particular setup we
have retails for around $1,200 through B
and H but prices will vary depending on
where you shop and when you're watching
this video anyways let us know in the
comments down below what you think of
the new AV x mics I personally think the
new AV x system sounds fuller than our
previous setup or old audio technica lav
sounded tinny and we had to push our on
camera levels very high which introduces
more white noise the AV X system sounds
cleaner and it's wireless so it's more
convenient and easier to use anyways
thank you guys so much for watching and
if you guys enjoy this video make sure
to give it a thumbs up and we will see
you guys in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
