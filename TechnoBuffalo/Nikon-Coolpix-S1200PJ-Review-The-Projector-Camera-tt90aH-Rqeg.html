you may be asking yourself what I'm
doing in a dark garage with my iphone a
MacBook Pro and the new Nikon Coolpix S
1200 PJ find out the answer to that
question and more after the break made
by everyone's favorite Canuck John Q
welcome to my review of the Nikon
Coolpix s 1200 PJ this is nikon's third
projector cam if you can believe it the
first was the S 1000 PJ last year's was
the S 11,000 PJ and this is nikons new S
1200 PJ I will tell you it is the most
powerful projector cam in Nikon's fleet
but it has some awesome new features
that the previous models lacked let's
talk about price you can order the S
1200 PJ online for for $29.99 that is an
$80 boost from last year's S 1100 PJ but
I'm going to tell you why this camera
ships with this magical cable magical
jumble of cables that actually connects
to your iPhone and allows you to project
whatever's on your iPhone as far as
pictures and videos now before we delve
into the projector goodness of the S
1200 PJ let's talk about image quality
because the camera is useless without
the ability to take decent pictures
overall this camera has mediocre image
quality many of the pictures exhibited
purple fringing as well as vignette
around the corners of the pictures and
that's primarily due to the lens the S
1200 PJ has a 14 megapixel one over 2.3
inch sensor and that's a lot of
megapixels to be cramming on one tiny
sensor because of that low light took a
hit as well as last year in fact Nikon
did not even alter one bit of the
imaging engine inside the coolpix S 1200
compared to last year so it's identical
image quality that I experienced with
the 1100 last year on the 1200 same 5x
optical zoom the core
pens and a fairly limiting F 3.9
aperture base this camera captures 720p
video at 30 frames per second and I have
to be honest it rivaled certain
smartphones when it came to its quality
the one good thing about this camera was
its stereo audio pickup it has great
audio if you're going to use it
primarily for projectors sake it's fine
if you're going to post a Facebook the
pictures are fine you could still get
some good macro shots out of this camera
however you're not going to want to
throw them in a gallery
although Nikon didn't change anything as
far as the imaging engine of this camera
the projector has undergone some major
changes we have a boost from 14 lumens
to 20 lumens on this projector we also
have individual RGB lights LED lights as
opposed to one single white LED the
spread has also been boosted to 60
inches compared to last year's 47 inches
and the throw has been boosted to 10
feet compared to last year's 7 feet with
that said the Nikon Coolpix S 1200 pj is
definitely Nikon's best projector cam to
date in fact I'd venture to say that
it's a better projector than it is a
camera as well as iPhone this camera
supports iPad and iPod devices it comes
with this handy Belkin cable
configuration here it has a splitter one
end goes to the S 1200 pj plugs right
into this jack and this is an optional
charging end as well so you can charge
your phone while you're showing now you
can only show pictures from your gallery
after setting a slideshow here so you
have to start slideshow and then it
begins like so now let's move on to the
computer if you have a Mac or Windows PC
with relatively nice specs then this
camera will project whatever is on your
desktop on the big screen
what you gonna do when oka mania runs
while on you me love me
TechnoBuffalo the best website on the
planet and in the solar system the
intergalactic solar system and in order
to view all the videos and pictures that
you've taken with the S 1200 PJ all you
have to do is slide the new projector
latch down and it's coolpix time in
addition to the various improvements
Nikon made to the S 1200 PJ's projector
they also improve the design giving it
this nice latch that covers the
projector lens keeping it safe
also they simplified the focusing dial
here for the projector pretty awesome
setup isn't it now one of the good
things about the coolpix s 1200 PJ is
that it has a built in tilt stand on the
bottom to prop it up for a good viewing
angle so if you're her in say garage and
you have a bucket
we need to prop it up a little bit the
tilt stand is your man but one crucial
thing that Nikon did was ax the touch
screen LCD which was exceedingly
sluggish last year I'm really glad they
got rid of it because the firmware now
is so much quicker on this camera I was
able to rifle through a lot of the menu
selections let's also talk about
shooting features the Nikon Coolpix S
1200 PJ is very light on them this thing
does not allow you to adjust the shutter
or aperture only in select scene modes
and the camera kind of dictates the
values for that the S 1200 PJ like last
year's S 1100 PJ has autofocus it
doesn't have manual focus but the
autofocus worked fairly well it has a
bunch of different flash modes it has
some fun modes as well - a great
selective color mode over all the Nikon
Coolpix
S 1200 PJ is a blast of a camera it does
something that no other compact is
capable of doing $430 it's kind of hard
to justify but
you look at it as a pocket projector
that has ability the ability to take
pictures and videos it's a pretty
awesome device Nikon just needs to work
on the image quality of this camera and
then I think they've got an a.1
top-notch camera for even more on the
Nikon Coolpix as 1200 PJ go to my full
review on TechnoBuffalo comm for rules
of image samples and video samples I'm
Mike Roman for TechnoBuffalo and I will
see you guys in the next video
time to get back to Hulkamania I am a
real American
