brought to you by hostgator below
there's John Q here from technobuffalo
and welcome to what's the apps it's that
time of year again you know Halloween is
fast approaching AKA pumpkin day AKA
accompany your kids to visit the homes
of strangers while wearing epically
awesome costumes while asking them for
candies day and because of that i
thought i'd check out something a little
bit Halloweeny you know getting to the
spirit of things so for this episode of
what's the app's we're gonna be taking a
look at zombie jochy yes zombie gotcha
as in zombie Tamagotchi i don't know if
you guys remember but back in the day
Tamagotchis were like the coolest things
ever okay that imp ugh Tom got cheese is
basically you have this virtual pet
thing that you have to take care of you
feed it in oops it grows in poops again
and it dies you know if you don't feed
it it dies and if it poops too often and
you don't clean up the poop it dies it's
fantastic zombie gotcha for iOS is sort
of the same idea you've got this zombie
pet thing that you can pet feed or my
favorite punish don't know why that
option is my favorite as a kid that
punishment option wasn't available from
my Tamagotchi oh how the times up
changed each time you tap on one of the
options a different animation plays of
each all of them very clever and very
cute there isn't really much purpose to
the game I guess you're supposed to not
let your zombie die which it totally can
by the way but no worries he comes back
there's a meter at the back of the cage
with the letters E and F for what I
assume is empty in full basically it's a
happy meter at first I thought it was a
hunger meter but then I realized it went
down after i punished it so based on
that I guess is a happy meter and when
it's happy is at zero it dies after a
while the zombie will express itself
full screen I love these illustrations
especially the one where he's all hey
man screw yo oh no sensor I had the blur
is hand gesture right there all of the
expressions can be collected in this
gallery as opposed after a while you can
collect different costumes as well to
dress up your zombie pet so far I've
gotten rocker poke grandma poke and cat
squirrel thing poke you can also unlock
mini games as well as to how I have no
idea I just magically showed up for me
when I was punishing my zombie
apparently there's a bejeweled kind of
mini game that you can get all I have is
this rag doll toss game speaking of rag
doll toss game i'm having a relevant
transition to give a shout out to the

eating animal back to zombie gotcha for
those of you wanting a zombie pet in
your pocket or for those were you
wanting to re-experience them good old
Tamagotchi days zombie gotcha is pretty
neat I personally really dig the artwork
and the animations but you can't really
do too much with your pets so for that
I'm gonna give this app of three out of
five fun to play with no doubt but you
might get bored of it pretty fast and
before I forget if you check out their
website you can print and build your
very own real-life zombie gotcha I think
I might give it a try but I kind of suck
at crafts well I hope you guys enjoyed
my review of zombie gotcha and as always
