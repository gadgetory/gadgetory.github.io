boxing these four I like the first time
we've ever unbox anything like this I
believe that this is a million
subscriber play button we don't know for
sure but the return label was from the
company that Niven told us makes the
Oscar statue in the NBA so pretty pretty
sure to what this is we look awesome
yeah yeah we owe it to upload Britney oh
regardless of what's inside the box yeah
I think we should yeah so we're not sure
it could be something that's not what we
think it is but we're hoping hoping that
is indeed what's in here
Blaine subscribers we hit it about four
months ago or so I started yeah so a lot
of people a lot of hard work went into
getting us there a lot of people that
maybe aren't here anymore
helped us on people who refused to be on
camera Ralph Brandon and run back there
but a lot of hard work from a lot of
people that went to getting us a million
did movie yeah this is our first button
- we didn't get a hundred thousand one
probably couldn't see the email um or
maybe it wasn't a thing back then I
don't know but this is also super heavy
yeah this feels legit so let's see what
this is let's I mean I think it's
subscriber run yeah roads like oh I
forgot to tell you I totally ordered
something it is a big deal yeah any
subscribers though I think so
I think it's no akyuu care at all this
is like whatever is there food in there
Wow it is a big box true that gravity do
the work for us
do you want to now we got it let's do it
the hard way that's what you always do
everything yeah okay

it's like there are youtubers on the
cover of this I'm assuming that's the
bottom I got it up Sam
it's upside down yeah ah okay
this is a huge box this is a giant giant
box use my tree just look all right so
let's I don't just take off the lid Roy
got a little TechnoBuffalo logo on it we
see it was kind of letter yeah Dear John
for Lakers you're bigger than Vancouver
you're bigger than Venice you're even
bigger than Las Vegas 1 million
subscribers maybe you imagined from that
day for a long time maybe you never
thought you'd grow so big either way I'm
not much to match satisfaction of
finding out your creativity their idea
that your voice speaks to 1 million
people across the globe we know that's
being able to touch away that so many
people is reward enough we're incredibly
proud of all you've done so hope you'll
accept this golden play but it's gokhan
of our esteem with your track reverie
suspect you're gonna keep growing and we
can't wait to see you reach the next
milestone 10 million subscribers that's

daring keep dreaming big and keep
creating you're the inspiration

majority of those videos have got us
there we got branded in there who's
written up a lot of the articles they've
been doing periscope I'm Evan this is
our 1 million subscribers this is a lot
of a lot of hard work I will say this is
something that like I mean I picked the
name John for Lakers I had something
that I never thought whatever happened

like middle school yeah so it's to show
that like had no grand vision for what
was going to be happening and as you
