technobuffalo here what we are in boxing
is not a lady's handbag despite the
packaging it is the mizu MX which
according to its spec sheet may very
well be the best android smartphone
you've never heard of so let's go ahead
dig in and see if it's as good as a spec
sheet would have you believe alright so
we're now hooked up to Wi-Fi and there's
some interesting things going on with
these buttons down here if your tap with
that one doesn't do much but if you hold
it down it's going to go ahead and lock
the device and if i unlock it there's a
button up top which you can use to lock
or unlock as well here is what the lock
screen looks like you can go ahead and
get right to a few things if you take it
and sort of slide it up then you're
going to have your dialer then you get a
new series of buttons here that shows up
and if you hold it will take you back
home this guy have you hold three
buttons it's going to pull up your
recent applications and volume controls
and some shortcuts for some of your
connection things so let's take a look
at some of other applications that are
going to be on here then we'll take a
quick look at the device itself we've
got a Documents folder which really
gives you a option to view everything
that's in here a very structured format
to give you your download music all the
stuff that Android has downloaded that
you've downloaded for your android
market or you know may have downloaded
from other sources I've got music
calendar calculator email alarm clock
video gallery cameras with the camera
application looks like on your pretty
pretty standard Android fair here let's
go ahead and go back home so looking for
an app drawer around here but hopefully
we'll see one of those in just a moment
we've got maps that i assume is going to
be messages we continue to scroll along
we got nothing their only three home
screens looks like there's android
market recorder notes and something
called folder which it only opens up a
folder go and hit home let's see what
kind of widgets and mizu is going to
give us a little holding down the home
screen doesn't appear to want to launch
widgets so this is going to be an
operating system we're gonna have to
play around with a little bit to figure
it out pull this down and there's your
notification drawer does not come down
all the way
alright let's do a quick tour of the
device so you've got that four-inch
screen we talked about volume rocker up
and down on the left hand side I've got
hard plastic with a non-removable
battery in here that's 1600 milliamp
hours there's eight megapixel camera LED
flash speaker grill there we've got the
mizu MX and blazons across it it doesn't
feel low quality plastic it feels very
solid and secure there's your charging
at sea port and a microphone on the
right-hand side we've got nothing top in
the upper right hand corner power and
lock button or just one of the options
for power and lock microphone and a 3.5
millimeter headset jack continuing right
along the phone you've got to changing
buttons I can't even tell you what they
do yet and you've got one physical
button in the middle that takes you home
one if I hold Perth long press if
they'll do anything double tap it so
this will give you a fun operating
system to try and learn this is the mizu
MX stay tuned to technobuffalo for a ton
more coverage on it I am jon rettinger
and i'll see you in the next video bye
bye
you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
