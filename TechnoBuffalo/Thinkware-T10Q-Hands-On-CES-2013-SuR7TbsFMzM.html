one of CES has kicked off in Las Vegas
Nevada and I'm here to think where booth
it's something you may not have heard of
because think where's not available in
the United States they're not available
in the retail presence either anywhere
in the world what they're doing right
now is focusing on OAM solutions in
other countries things like in-car
tablets and car DVR GPS and more we're
gonna take a look at the t10 q let's
take a lot to get the t10 q here at
specs wise we're packin a 1.4 gigahertz
quad core Exynos processor it's 590
grams when it comes to weight and again
this configuration from what they tell
me can be modified to match whatever the
OEM needs so if you're an OEM you're
walking in for your own car technology
and you want let's say a different
configuration of Android or different
processor they're relatively flexible
when it comes to that you're packin a
10.1 inch display here as well with a
seven thousand milliamp hour batteries a
nice big battery and of course 1280 by
800 resolution on the screen you can see
some buttons back here in the back which
is what I was pointing at first looks
like a volume rocker and your power
button hidden back in the back as well
as a front facing camera now just
suppose this the t10 hash which is the
lower version of the tablet that's
showing off here at CES 2013 you can see
some automatic benefits things like a
quad-core processor make this thing
super fast and within that that's a
stock build of Android 4.1 you've got
things like out of the gate here some
games bus parking 3d and I don't know
how much this is installed by them how
much of this is what comes out of the
box but you can see a couple things like
glass cord media spider sketchbook hacks
and more plays video raging thunder I'd
have and a half of patience pre-install
to show off the quad-core processor and
Android 4.1 keep it locked on
TechnoBuffalo for continuing coverage of
tablets really the name of the game in
addition to connected electronics and
more at CES 2013 is not a huge mobile
show
we'll bring to you hit me on twitter at
aaron c baker the company's a
TechnoBuffalo and stay tuned for more
CES 2013 coverage
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
