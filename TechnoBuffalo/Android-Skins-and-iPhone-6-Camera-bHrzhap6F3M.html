to you by go daddy what's up everyone
John renders an TechnoBuffalo here and
welcome back to their episode of ask the
Buffalo I am a Buffalo of this to show
where you can ask me any question you've
got from the ever-expanding world of
Technology whether it's God do about
phone you should get wood tablets coming
out or ask me any personal questions or
our TechnoBuffalo works and runs we're
trying to sort of pull back the veil as
much as we can up this week we're to
talk a little bit about the best part of
my job the daily drivers that I use and
have used what are the best Android
skins or custom you eyes at this point
now are and some iPhone 6 camera
business disaster Buffalo started asking
some questions
first question comes from Twitter user
ad tech mob reviews asked at John four
Lakers hi John
hi what is the best part or aspect of
your job thanks hashtag has to be I
still cannot believe everyday that
phones and tablets get sent to me to
check out I mean more than I could even
review an in a week we have here that
still is flabbergasting to me I remember
trying to save up every cent I had
friend paychecks to try and buy the
newest phone use it for a couple months
and sell it on eBay or Craigslist about
whatever else came out it still seems
surreal to me that I get a chance to
play with all these electronics even
crazier is that people care about my
opinions on this stuff I just love
technology I sometimes I feel like I'm
gonna wake up from this dream that's
definitely the best part of my job next
question comes from the best Twitter
handle ever at any reader of TV asks hey
John as a phone reviewer do you always
switch 15 phones or you have one daily
driver we're not reviewing phones that
is and what is the longest you've had
one phone for and you pay for them
yourself or use it as a review that was
a lot of questions so I'm always
reviewing a lot of phones and I use each
phone that I'm reviewing as my daily
driver so I'm constantly switching
phones back and forth so I very rarely
get a chance to just sort of just use
one phone which is kind of a cool
problem to have but I will say the
phones that I've used longest I used an
iPhone 4 for probably about four and a
half to six months and then last year I
used the HTC One the m7 about the same
amount of time those are probably the
two that I've used a long as to quit
gently probably two of my favourite
phones over the past few years so the
one caveat here sometimes I got to carry
two phones if I'm using something and
doesn't necessarily use a SIM card I'm
using like an older Verizon phone or
sprint phone for example or anything it
really uses a legacy CDMA network I'll
carry two phones we use AT&amp;amp;T normally
for my main account
I've calls forwarded to that device so
sometimes I'll carry two phones but for
the most part it's usually just one and
90% of the phones we get from either the
carrier the manufacturer or the PR
agencies but sometimes we will go out
and buy phones that we want to test and
review most of the phones you know that
we get in we send back or we'll keep
them for a little bit of law if you
didn't for comparison's but eventually
every test or
we get in goes back to the PR companies
I just work you don't get to keep them
so when you guys say ask me for free
phone because you saw me do it we don't
have them anymore we just have them for
a couple weeks and times a few months
and they go back home hopefully it
helped answer question we stopped the
questions for just a real quick second
to thank the peeps at GoDaddy already

check them out next one comes from at
Tim's 9 7 8 9 at TechnoBuffalo which
Android OAM skin touch with scents etc
do you think is best or easiest to use
that's one it's super easy to me when I
did a comparison of the HTC One worse
the galaxy s5 I talked about that quite
a bit I am NOT a fan of modern UI or
touch whatever you want to call it I
think it's very busy it's too cartoonish
and they're way too many features they
sort of convoluted experience so having
said that there a few features that I
really like but if I had to pick one of
them I really like to HTC has done sense
I think I'll still prefer a naked
Android but I think HTC took the
approach of only adding features I
thought you'd really use whereas Samsung
took approach of really adding every
feature you might possibly use and
hopefully one or two you're gonna use
pretty regularly I think it's more
elegant on HTC's design
I think Samsung added a lot more
features usually kind of way those two
against each other if you like to
feature side about serve a more elegant
experience it's kind of up to you at
least for me I really prefer HTC is done
next question comes from Joe Cour CBJ at
John 4 Lakers hi John do you think the
iPhone 6 is going to have more
megapixels than the iPhone 5s yes yes
for sure it will i phone 5 that says 8
I'd expect the iPhone 6 to have 12 to 13
megapixels so a lot more megapixels 5
megapixels more 6 megapixels more many
many more megapixels so you could zoom
in and crop way more than you could have
before we'll see some sort of image
stabilization
improvement in the iPhone as well and
they obviously a bigger screen size and
iOS 8 but the camera is gonna be a
really big feature they try and bring
home Coffelt your question thank you
