to you by Full Sail University what's up
everyone welcome back to the episode of
retinas ransom your host John wrenches
to show ranked Raven get super red-faced
on something that's going on in the
world of technology and sometimes just a
little bit outside so the dust is
finally settled on III we can look back
the benefit of hindsight and finally say
what the hell was Microsoft thinking but
I don't think Microsoft is full to blame
for the flack that they're getting let's
go ahead and start ranting so now that
Sony and Microsoft have shown their
respective hands we know what the next
generation consoles is going to bring
and I will say that Sony whipped
Microsoft up and down the floor
highlighted by $100 less for the console
and the whole used games Fiasco Tony
released a commercial saying here's how
you trade use games and they handed a
game to somebody Microsoft though took a
way more convoluted approach first of
all charging $1 more for the console now
I get that that includes a Kinect you
which has a lot of cost to it but for
the person who's just looking to buy a
console and isn't really a hardcore game
or does have any Allegiance one way or
another hundred our difference is going
to make a huge huge huge difference in
what they are going to buy at least
that's my expectation and then Microsoft
got all kinds of high and mighty and
really starts act a little bit on the
Pampas side with the Xbox launch admit
that looks like a very nice console
what's the big deal it really got my
goat and got me thinking was how they
were handling used games the initial
thought was if you wanted to play use
games you have to pay full retail price
for them it backed off in that a little
bit you could trade games to a friend
they got to be a friend for certain
amount of time and all kinds of just
crazy rules that go along with the use
games I don't really do that much the
used games world but I get why people do
it and it's a huge huge huge market that
creates jobs you guys stores like Game
Stop just a nice thing to do with your
friends he just be called nudie whatever
it might be here buddy you should play
it our way to you know recoup some of
the costs of 6-yard games those things
are expensive Microsoft's been getting a
ton of flack for again how they're
handling use games when I thought about
it more it's our abdominal me that maybe
it's not Microsoft's fault necessarily
and maybe they're the ones are taking
the heat I think the blame
that lies with the developers of the
games I would wager a guess now before
you guys get all crazy and mad and call
me names
just think about what I'm saying first
from a business standpoint take the
passion in the emotion out of it you are
a game developer let's saying you just
spend months perhaps years making a game
and you're deciding whether or not you
want to release it exclusively on one
console or perhaps knew that before you
start developing it and looking at the
Xbox one and the ps4 if you make a game
for the Xbox one not only will you get
the revenue from the initial sale of the
game you'll also get revenue back now
from used game sales which is something
that Sony is not going offered I would
wager that developers are going to be
making more game to the Xbox one and
Xbox one is going to have more exclusive
titles for it than the ps4 this
generation of consoles because there's
more money to be made for developers and
perhaps Microsoft knew that and said ok
we're big enough we're mighty enough we
were so successful last generation will
take the heat for what the developers
want us to do in turn maybe the heat
will died down eventually we'll get
better games than Sony might now just my
expectation from a business standpoint I
kind of get it you look at the PC world
you buy a game and you get a code and if
you want to give that game to a friend
they gotta buy a new code I think it's
like they're trying to bring the sort of
PC gaming mentality for the consoles
that's been widely accepted in the PC
world but not accepted in the console
world now the only reason is a gamer out
and remotely tolerate this if I was an
Xbox one gamer would be for better games
perhaps would be the only thing and if
I'm not getting better games you're not
getting better lose the title is not
getting more exclusive titles there's
very little compelling the reason to
accept what Microsoft is doing now just
because they things been done one way
doesn't mean obviously gonna be done
that way the whole way I like yourself
is clearly trying to change the paradigm
but Sony did not play along I mean if
Sony you played along that should've
been the new way things are done but
since Sony said nope you want to play
use games you buy it once you own it you
can give to whoever you want Microsoft
now looks clearly like the big bad wolf
and the bad guy perhaps it might put
some pressure on to maybe change the
rules but I'll take your guys thoughts
weave them in the comments down below we
take a minute to thank our friends and
sponsors at Full Sail University you
know that the mobile app world is on
fire right now boaster University's
online mobile development bachelor's
degree program can teach you the skills
