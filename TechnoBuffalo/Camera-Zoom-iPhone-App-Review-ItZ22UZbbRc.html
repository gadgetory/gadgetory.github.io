and I want to do another app review this
one is camera zoom it's one that
actually I've received a lot of requests
to review it's featured in the top 25
most downloaded in the App Store in fact
it's number seven so let me go in here
and show you what it promises to do and
then I'll show you the application
so this says half of the year by the New
York Times camera zoom now works top I
payed iphone app featured up to four
times digital zoom essentially what it
is is a digital zoom for your iPhone you
can see that it's got the zoom bar you
can zoom in and out it's got some
settings I'm actually shocked that a
digital zoom wasn't included on the
iPhone 3GS but that's aside so you can
see what it's supposed to do and give
you some more specs on it so let me go
ahead and open it up here and show you
what it looks like so there's the icon
in the bottom right hand corner just
says camera so we'll open it up asks if
it wants to use my location oh look at
that
quit let's try it again yes nope still
quit so you can hit yes before it quits
that's what this does for me and that's
what this is going to do for anybody on
the 3.0 firmware I have never seen an
application such tragically failed
before to be in the top 25 to not
support the new firmware and do not do
anything this is like taking $0.99 and
swallowing it pulling it out taking that
99 cents and then throwing it away
you'll have much more fun with your
coins than you will downloading this app
I can't unrecognised but a company
that's touting this is app of the year
that somehow is number 7 most downloaded
alright number 7 in the top 25 is
unbelievable maybe that's showing that
Apple is not updating their algorithms
regularly because there's no way that
this is a top downloaded app it doesn't
even work I don't know how to program
and I can make an app that just quits on
me and all it is is an icon unbelievably
bad
whereas you guys that have been asking
to see this and to review it to download
it I can't because the company that made
it really kind of crap the bed so
showing you what company that is let's
pull up their name so you can know not
to download any other apps from them
this is made by 10d tech ke ng i te CH
and you can see that there is a reason
it's led the focus here there's a reason
that it's only two stars and I bet those
two stars are left over from the 2.0
firmware when it actually worked
awful application don't waste your money
go buy an ice-cream or pack of gum
everywhere else 99 cents will get you do
not spend it on this camera zoom
application this is an unjailbroken
application you know you can jailbreak
and get zooms but if you want to keep
your phone legitimate like I do really
this was a good optional it can be a
good option I am severely disappointed
so guys anyway hope you enjoy you've no
idea really happen didn't really have
anything to show you but for exclusive
content be sure to follow me on Twitter

you the next video bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
