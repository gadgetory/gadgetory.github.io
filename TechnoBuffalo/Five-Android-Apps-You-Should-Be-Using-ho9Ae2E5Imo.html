to you by the all-new LG twin wash meet
your new laundry sidekick Pei smooth
deep OOP DS mark burst enter here we're
taking a buffalo and I wanted to talk to
you guys really quickly about some of
the apps that I've been going a little
mamby-pamby about lately first and
foremost Robin Hood this is really
really cool Robin Hood is completely
free no broker stock trading I've never
been into stocks I just hit my mic Robin
Hood lets you buy stocks fo free you
essentially just pay into Robin Hood and
then the app lets you pick what you want
to buy and they take care of all the
rest and stuff for you obviously you got
it you got to put your social and there
you got to get screened and once you get
accepted you're good to go
but they give you all kinds of insights
they let you know what your dividends
are and they give you a lot of
information over time so that when you
go to make a purchase you're making that
purchase as well educated as humanly
possible so what I like to do save some
money and then when I have enough buy a
share of Tesla stock next up we've got
verse and verse is an interesting one if
you've got a Google cardboard go grab it
go grab the verse app it's totally free
stick your phone in there it's an
interesting take on what we're going
towards in terms of consuming content
and media it's virtual reality content
but versus been partnering with the
likes of the New York Times Magazine
Muse stuff like that to make content
that you can watch in 360s so do
yourself a favor go grab it totally free
and while you're at it go grab the
cardboard app if you have a cardboard
and don't have the cardboard app yet
there's a lot of fun stuff to do next
time you have friends over
get that thing fired up and you're gonna
have a blast I promise next up is clear
focus this is an app for the Pomodoro
method and this is a method that I love
to use for productivity essentially you
do whatever it is that you need to do
whatever work whatever tasks in one
Pomodoro which is 25 minutes and then
you take a five-minute break
so every 25 minutes you take a
five-minute break then you go back to
work for 25 minutes if you're ever
interrupted you have to start that 25
minutes over the goal is to give
yourself 25 minutes of uninterrupted
work and clear focus is just a really
nice material designed app to help you
out with your Pomodoro method
it's just a really nice Pomodoro timer
you've never looked into Pomodoro do
yourself a favor google it it's one of
my favorite productivity methods the
next step I want to talk about is an app
called series guide series guide is
essentially TV Guide but way cooler and
nicer and material and modern it hooks
into tracked TV which if you don't have
an account go and make one which also
works with Plex so if you use Plex for a
lot of your media which I do it'll keep
an eye on what's been watched what
hasn't sink that over to tracked and
then series guide will sync all of that
information down for you so you can see
which shows you were watching which ones
you've missed what's airing soon
synopses of new shows you might want to
watch and of course recommendations the
app is gorgeous and if you're someone
like me who doesn't have full on cable I
cut the cord about two years ago then
you're gonna really really appreciate
serious guide finally the only paid app
on this list is manual camera I know you
guys have heard me complain a lot about
the stock Android camera app it's way
too slow and it really doesn't give you
a whole lot of control over what you
need to do well manual camera only costs
three bucks and gives you an enormous
amount of control over your ISO your
exposure your focus anything you name it
lets you lock things in lock multiple
things in leave things set in auto you
have an enormous amount of control over
what photos you're taking and the
shutter speed is really fast my only
complain about it right now is that it
doesn't work when you do the shortcut to
get into the camera oh it worked right
there that's never happened before what
a happy surprise well I guess I take
that back go check out manual camera
three bucks you won't regret it and if
you're wondering about how I have enough
money to do things like buy apps even
though people spend eight dollars on a
sandwich for lunch and three dollars on
an app seems like too much well there's
a solution for that too go grab Google
opinion rewards if you're an Android
user and you haven't grabbed this app
yet you're making a big mistake
grab opinion rewards just sign up start
answering questions for the surveys and
before you know it you're going to have
like ten bucks to spend on the Play
Store so all those days of not wanting
to spend money on apps or games all in
the past I've made probably upwards of
seventy dollars answering questions and
realize I'm just telling Skynet more
about myself but hey I get the money for
it so I guess I'm a sellout that's a few
of my favorite apps that I've been using
these days I'm going to be doing another
video very soon of my favor
Gamze so if there are any games that you
guys have been playing like crazy please
make sure they're good ones but do let
me know in the comments you can smash
that like button and go all ham on the
subscribe button - god that was
exhausting thank you guys so much for
watching be kinda one another
and I'll catch you in the next video all
right check it out if you're a person
which I think you are and you wear
clothes which I hope you do then you're
probably doing laundry at some point and
you're like whether you own a machine or
not that's right a machine
well the LG twins is a new line of
products from LG and these things have
to yes
two separate areas for washing your
clothing it's got the normal front load
area and it's got a bottom load area in
a pedestal washer for all your delicates
anything that needs a particular amount
of attention technology intersecting
with other areas of our lives and under
industries really helps make things that
are normally really annoying just a
little bit easier and at the end of the
day so we want isn't it
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
