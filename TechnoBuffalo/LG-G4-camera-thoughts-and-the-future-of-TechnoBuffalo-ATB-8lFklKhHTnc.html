to you by domain.com what's up everybody
pulls back to episode of ask the Buffalo
I might not be the horn furry beasts but
I am a guy loves answer your questions
about technology the show you can ask
them anything from what phone you should
get did you wait for the next generation
device what tablet to buy sometimes
personal questions and anything in
between go ahead and jump right in the
first question comes from Seth wins who
asks at John for lakers I really want
the g4 but also really like with a note
series can go note 5 orgy for the
relatively close future the to you
friend oh it's very simple question how
soon do you want a new phone I
presumably we will see the next note
launched at IFA towards the end of the
year and that september-october time
frame when it should come out the g4
though is here and it's coming out very
soon we got to know what it is looks to
be a pretty solid phone so if you need a
phone right now go to the g4 I should
rather wait then wait for the note 5 but
bear in mind if you don't like the note
5 you might already be close to halfway
to g4s product like so I feel like you
like well bitch wait for the g5 and well
besh wait for the note 6 you sort of get
stuck in that loop so what advice I
always give if you like a phone that's
out now to came out within 3 months
we're looking to buy it just jump in
you're gonna get a great phone and you
will love it hope that helped and your
question a Christian next one comes from
Briggs alive who s at John for lakers
how's the nexus 9 serving you if you
guys don't know when we talk about a
couple months ago so maybe you missed it
I switched to Nexus 9 as my only tablet
switch from an ipad mini abusing for
years and i'm still using it as my daily
tablet i love it it's worked great I
didn't want to force 5.1 on like had to
get my Nexus 6 so I'm actually still
waiting for OTA 5.1 which is at this
point five point one point ones like
around the corner and I still don't have
my 5.1 which makes you very very sad but
that aside I'm loving the tablet battery
life is still not so great for
everything else about it super thumbs up
next one comes from Bossier besoin who
asks at John for lakers what are you up
to achieve in the tech world what is the
goal what will I see what I tuned in
fact or five years to TV that sir is a
great question i wish i had a crystal
ball all we've ever tried to do about
the techno buffalos be a boiler consumer
we're independent we can say whatever we
want and i hope that we can still do
that i don't necessarily have to be the
biggest site in the world we don't have
to be
largest most page viewed site I just
want to be the most honest site just
continue to be a voice for the consumer
I hope we continue to do that certainly
I hope our audience grows hopefully at
that point we're at three to four
million subscribers you know double our
page views we're at now would be really
nice hope they can still have the
opportunity to give more people a chance
live their dreams hire more help us grow
I hope that I'm still having fun doing
what I do because right now I come to
work every day of the huge smile on my
face and I hope in five years I can
still do that we stop real fast thank
our peeps at domain.com it's a place to
go when the next great idea hits you
like in the middle of the night it's
one-stop shopping for all your domain
name and web hosting email needs the
main kaam wants to hook you up with a
pretty sick aw for say twenty percent on
domain names and web hosting and use
coupon code technobuffalo it's all one
word in caps at domain coms check out
when you think domains think domain com
last but not least obvious reasons ass
at jump or liquors what do you think
about the g4 is camera we read an
article that showed a ton of pictures
from the g-force Karen when I see that
put a link to it down below LG's making
big claims that it is close to DSLR
quality and we wanted to serve test that
16 megapixel sensor does a really nice
job but on first blush testing with it
it is a very very impressive camera I
think the kings of this mobile camera
world at least right now is the iphone 6
plus and the galaxy s6 s6 edge and this
looks to be on par if not better but
haven't done my field testing on it yet
so and as i continue to do that i will
let you know but first impressions at
first look at the shots looks really
really good so if cameras reported to
you he's probably consider the g4 you
guys for watching hope you enjoyed we're
back every week with more questions
until then I am jon rettinger protect no
Buffalo I'll talk to you friend the next
video goodbye Oh
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
