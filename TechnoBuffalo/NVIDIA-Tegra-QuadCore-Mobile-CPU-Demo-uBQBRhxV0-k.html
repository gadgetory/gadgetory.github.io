racist block delivers a lot more
performance and fits into an all mobile
define first the most common asset one
for Bubba Hiers no order going to show
thank you nurse yet you mean first
market every the demo first I just
forced to show personal first the demo
right ok I think welcome announced that
they're going to sample in 2012 I like
to search for something now ok
are we wearing 2011
so it's the first quad-core it it's thus
have seeds to excellent performance
tegra two
is three or more times victims in and
it's able to do extreme high definition
video likes which has never been seen in
a mobile device or for that matter any
consumer product you see this video
playing here just as I say anything I
know who can go better this video your
legs which are not my lights Oh again
thank you this monitor here is a 30 inch
2560 by 1600 monitor notice that there's
a little bar at the bottom this is this
video content is what we call 1440p in
other words the video of content
original encoded data prior to encoding
was point 565 14
higher resolution that an attack video
it's four times the resolution number 7
20 that's what is today there are no
consumer devices that can play this
resolution this put your seams taken off
a red cap and then work red cap is
approximately 40 once again the scale
down to 14 red cap which of course
exceeds any content that people are used
to used to see now why are we showing
1440p there's a couple key points that
you should take away for that I do
believe that ultimately the world is
going to go to 1440p 2160p but that's
that's still a little
the way terms of broadcast or I'm
content however what it demonstrates is
the ability to achieve scream high
performance explain my resolution this
monitor certainly is something you would
like to drive premier from yourself if
you walked into the room and this
monitor was sitting there in a keyboard
the city or the order mouse you would
like your cell phone to just display on
there we'd be able to do photo editing
with mayo editing document providing
documents arousing level that kind of
stuff so the ability to call necessary
compute and privately graphics video
resolution like this is first in the
mobile space something pretty amazing
and we think this is one of the reasons
why we're missing a very aggressive ramp
up in the
computing horsepower that's going to be
delivered
my house is a cpu running shoe string
simultaneously in both space yeah so
this this actually is two displays right
now the same ease that video stream is
being depot at once and then its name
display plus display processes are
separately so this this monitor is
actually work being done to display on
the smaller work being done to display
destruction and greater than works that
display this because taking out 2560
1440 that is scaling it down to this
together actually to displace me
sometimes your question
I think there's no question that are our
ability to drive next generation within
your content experiments now this screen
is used
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
