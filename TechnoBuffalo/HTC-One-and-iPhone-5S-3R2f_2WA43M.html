to you by audible welcome back to the
episode of ask the Buffaloes to show you
could ask me John render any question
you've got from the wide world of
technology if you want to get one of
your questions featured on an upcoming
episode of asta Buffalo every tuesday on
TechnoBuffalo com put up an article
asking you for your questions you can
just leave them down below in the
comments otherwise you can send them to
us at twitter to me at john for lakers
or I technobuffalo and use hashtag ask
the be so we know what you are trying to
ask are we know what show to get it into
so of this week we got a ton of tech
awesomeness we're gonna discuss the HTC
one vs the upcoming Galaxy s4 what
generation iphones are the best to buy
where our cars come from from techno
Buffaloes driven and what the next nexus
is going to have try saying that three
times fast this is asked to Buffalo
let's go ahead and get started
ronaldo RDS asks hello John it was very
formal hello Ronaldo do you think the
HTC One be able to take on the galaxy s4
so a few caveats first we're not
entirely sure what the galaxy s4 is
gonna have bite any watches video will
be just a few short days away or perhaps
that we already know what the galaxy s4
will have but as of this filming it is
not yet available I will say though it
looks like the HTC one is gonna stack up
really nicely against the rumored specs
of the galaxy s4 I've actually been
using as my daily driver for a while
this guy the droid DNA and I'm really
happy that i gave HTC Sense another shot
I'm really enjoying it their email
clients pretty solid the skin this seems
to be a lot lighter than it used to be
and I'm really enjoying sense overall so
for me I'm looking forward a little more
to the HTC one vs the galaxy s4 but that
could change totally once we know the
specs of the galaxy s4 if Samsung puts a
ton of awesomeness in it but only time
will tell so hopefully that helped
answer your question user at ruf um z
asks hey John where do you get your
cards for TechnoBuffalo is driven we
actually get them the same way we get
the phones and tablets I'll reach out to
the PR firms and we'll say hey I've got
a car show do you maybe want to provide
a car it's pretty easy to do you can go
ahead and just find any press contact
and a press release usually they list
people down below I've just started
reaching out to them and as the show
started to grow people start to reach
out to us which was even better so the
same way I originally started getting
phones when I started doing my tech
review the same way I started getting
cars when I branched out to that so if
we had helped at your question user at
Riccardo on deck asks at John for lakers
do you advise buying the iphone s
versions over the others for someone
who's plenty to buy an iPhone every two
years usually I advise people to get the
non s version after getting phones every
two years the S version to generally
bring a little bit of improved specs and
maybe one or two new features but the
previous versions the non s usually
bring with them a brand new design and a
slew of new features anyway so we're
getting a new phone every two years
certainly would prefer having the new
design when it first comes out as
opposed to a design that's already a
year old but I'm the S comes out cuz yes
traditionally hasn't changed much in a
design standpoint that's a personal
preference i like to have something that
snoo it hasn't been out for that long so
I always advise getting the first
generation product and then wait a year
or two years rather before you get the
next generation so for that Holt answer
your question use your at start rent
asks at John for lakers what do you
think the next Nexus phone will be like
I think you'll be pretty awesome I think
is gonna be rocking the next version of
android key lime pie wearing rumors is
gonna be made finally by motorola google
bought motorola mobility a few years ago
they bought them mostly for their patent
library haven't seen much from the
hardware side come out of that
partnership at least unique things come
out of that partnership we're hearing
it's called the x-phone entirely in
specs have been all over the place
reamers from a 5-inch 1080p screen to a
5.3 in just nav screen to a 5.5 inch
1080p screen but i think the big deal is
going to be the software I think
Google's done a tremendous job of adding
new features in each iteration of
Android and this is going to be a big
change from four to five not a 4.1 2 4.2
kind of thing think we're gonna see a
ton of new features to Android I'm not
entirely sure what those are going to be
at I think anchor is pretty solid as is
but cucos already got certain new things
up their sleeves it might be just fine
tuning of what we already have which is
great so take out some of the bloat and
make a faster operating system I think
the big story is going to be all about
key lime pie so you guys think you
excited about the next next size next
Nexus Nexus is is I want to hear your
thoughts leave them in the comments down
