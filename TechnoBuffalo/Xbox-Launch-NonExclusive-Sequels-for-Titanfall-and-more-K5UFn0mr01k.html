to you by netflix the xbox one launches
titanfall and it's maybe not so
exclusive future the status of the last
guardian hands on with the new kinect
and some great mobile games this week
let's get out of controller hello and
welcome to controller the weekly
TechnoBuffalo show that covers all your
gaming news reviews demos and new
releases in an easy to digest capsule
form I'm your host Ashley skema it's
always a big week in gaming so let's
start out with the news hey the console
wars are now officially in full swing
with Microsoft's Xbox one launching to
much fanfare last Friday I'll just like
the ps4 launch there were some issues
plaguing some users including broken
online services on Friday some broken
disk drives and more but over all those
issues affected only a small percentage
of buyers and most folks spent their
time this weekend enjoying their shiny
new Xbox both consoles have sold over 1
million units in their first 24 hours on
retail shelves however it's important to
note that the ps4 sales were just for
the US and Canada well the Xbox one went
on sale in 13 countries but we can't
really draw any definitive conclusions
and some folks who want an Xbox can't
get one cuz they're sold out and the UK
and a lot of Europe will be getting
their hands at a ps4 this Friday
November 29th who will win the console
wars lots of gamers were super bummed to
hear that titanfall a highly anticipated
game we saw at e3 this year would never
see the light of day on any non
Microsoft platform there is a potential
light at the end of this dark dark
tunnel though as EA executive vice
president Blake Jorgensen says we may
see titanfall sequels land on multiple
platforms which is a reassuring
statement for anyone hoping to play a
little titanfall in the future on a
Playstation 4 or maybe even a steam
machine potentially we just have to hope
that the initial launch of titanfall is
a wild success and warrant some
excellent sequels if you do have a
Microsoft platform hanging around your
place fine followed by hitting xbox 360
xbox
on MPC on March 11 2014 now will you be
picking up titanfall or were you wait
for an inevitable sequel to hit your
non-microsoft we've been relatively
patient for famed game creator Fumito
you ADA's newest game The Last Guardian
but it's been six years since we first
heard about the project and we haven't
seen it in action or heard about it
getting canned so what's happening well
Uranus says he feels terribly sorry that
he's kept the audience waiting so long
for the game but that his team is still
hard at work completing the beleaguered
title well perhaps their work shifted
from PlayStation 3 2 PlayStation 4 or
maybe something more political is at
play but regardless of how you slice it
we are dying to check this game out you
ate as previous efforts with the
masterful beautiful game eco and one of
my favorite PlayStation 2 games ever
shadow of the colossus so I think this
will be a wait well worth it but let's
hope we don't end up with like a Duke
Nukem Forever situation because it's
like 14 let's play as a feature on our
gaming channel where a member of our
writing staff plays a game and talks
about it over the footage but this week
we did something a little bit different
and yours truly at our own jon rettinger
checked out the xbox one's new and
improved connect or was it because I had
some issues getting it to respond to my
commands the video is really fun to
shoot and we do think you'll enjoy it so
give or watch if you have a few minutes
to kill I gotta interrupt the show
