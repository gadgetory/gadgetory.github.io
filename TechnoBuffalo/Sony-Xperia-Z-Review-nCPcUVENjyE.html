TechnoBuffalo here at the full review
for you of Sony's latest flagship this
is the Xperia Z it was one of my
favorite phones of CES 2013 and ran away
with one of our best and show awards
let's see I would translate it from
concept to production see if it deserves
a spot in your pocket for the next few
years
alright so before we get to the full
review let me remind you what the Xperia
Z is Rock and there is a lot under the
hood here you are looking at a 5-inch
1080p display it means got a resolution
of
sates yourself real fast 1920 by 1080
giving it 8 441 PPI it's running Android
4.1 at launch but Sony is hopeful that
they will get 4.2 on it 1.5 gigahertz
Qualcomm Snapdragon quad-core 2 gigs a
ram 16 gigs of storage but you can up
that with a microSD card on the backs
got a 13 megapixel camera 2 megapixel on
front Bluetooth 4.0 802 11 B gene and
and a 2330 milliamp hour battery alright
so before we get into the floor view the
phone let's get this one out of the way
call quality if it's not gonna make good
phone calls it's not really gonna be
that useful for you call coat is
actually very good this is an OEM
unlocked version does not have
compatibility for AT&amp;amp;T LTE network Allah
we did test it on AT&amp;amp;T call qualities
were great speaker volume was pretty
loud no one had any issues with hearing
us and then our xx call drop test we did
not have any so thumbs up to Sony for
that so this phone is a kind of a mixed
bag for me and really high hopes after
seeing it yes I love the way the phone
felt I love the waterproofing ness of it
which I'll talk about at length and the
phone looked like it was exactly what
Sony needed to really make inroads in
the United States market so I've been
breaking reviews down previously into
what I like on when I don't like this
one though I'm just gonna talk about the
features of the phone and we're going to
go with the flow alright so let's start
big time here with the screen since I
promote you're gonna look at whenever
you're doing anything with this guy so
you'd expect it to have a beautiful
screen 1080p
learnt that many phones out there that
1080p yet looks good
but it's not as amazing as a 1080p
screen should look especially when you
compare it to the HTC One
the Droid DNA as we're gonna see
throughout the whole review this is a
huge case of form over function the
bones essentially waterproof to
reasonable amount I wouldn't take it
scuba diving but if you're out in the
rain you drop it in toilet I drop it in
a puddle you are going to be fine but
because of that the screen has to be
sealed encoded which kind of makes it
look like it's got a bad screen
protector on it you can tell there's a
good screen underneath just waiting to
get out and I really wish that we could
have seen that that beautiful screens
look like Sony is really known for
beautiful display technologies I just
don't feel like that's being shown here
with the Xperia Z one other issue that
I've got with the phone it's got a
beautiful 5 inch screen but a lot of it
taken up with these on-screen buttons
which is kind of annoying now it's nice
that the on screen buttons can change
contexture depending on what app you're
in but if we're using one of the more
common apps least for me the browser you
can really see a difference with how
much content is shown so if I bring in
the HTC one's actually has a smaller
screen this is a 4.7 inch screen versus
a 5 inch screen on the Xperia Z you can
see that I can see more content here on
the one I can see that third article
down below which I just can't do here on
the Z and you see that they're both at
the top of the page you can't scroll up
any higher it's all the cons that I
really want to see on the experience you
can't see because that real estate is
being taken up there's a huge bezel here
down below which looks like it'd be a
great place to put actual buttons so I
would have really liked to obscure
seeing that view angles here aren't that
great as well I think that's another
case because the coating on the screen
so we're looking at it from a slight
angle you have a really hard time seeing
it and almost impossible to see in
direct sunlight it's actually one of the
worst phones I've seen in direct
sunlight we're not seen I should say and
that again is more than likely due to
that screen coating on it that makes
this phone waterproof so something I do
like about the phone I really sort of
digged the design like a giant slab in
your hand that huge power button lives
right here on the right hand side at
first I found that a bit of an odd
design q but I found myself really
getting used to it I loved the fact that
it was big and pronounced I can actually
find it very easily having the volume
rocker up and down below it was
certainly something new but muscle
memory after a few days made it pretty
easy to keep up with all the ports on
this phone are covered because it is
waterproof which is nice if you're out
in the rain but can definitely make it
annoying if you want to plug in a
headset
you want to charge your phone and do
anything that would involve a peripheral
port on here definitely something to
keep in mind so a lot of people are
asking why would you want a waterproof
phone we found the obvious ones of
dropping the toilet or a puddle if you
take a phone out in the rain especially
a foam that's got a 3.5 millimeter
headset jack on the top if a water
droplet should get in there oftentimes
there is a moisture sensor and if you
take the phone in to get warranty
serviced it will be triggered to show
that there is water damage to the phone
so that's one thing at least to consider
the camera is another big story here and
the camera was really solid especially
in low light so knees got their Bravia
Engine 2 in here which just absolutely
helps tremendously with not only viewing
images taking images and processing
anything has to do with Stills and video
the camera quality was really good again
especially in low light if you want to
get a better sense the camera looks like
we did a full post comparing the HTC
one's an ultra pixel camera with a
variety of others including the Xperia
Z's you can see a full example what this
looks like this is definitely one of the
best a smartphone camera that I've
tested our performance is really quick
as you expect from a quad core even
though most software can't yet take
advantage of quad core it was a pretty
quick phone Quadron scores seven
thousand seven hundred and seventy-three
which is pretty solid scoring that's not
the go-to tests for all phone scores but
it's consistent I use it in all of my
phones and that's one of the highest
ones that I've seen things here are
pretty fast
everything expect to work works playing
games browse the Internet no matter what
you're doing everything here just works
quick and as you expect there's really
no lag at all especially during
scrolling which sometimes you can see on
Android devices so sony has gotten rid
of not only the Ericsson moniker but
their time scape and Mediascape UI that
we've seen today on top of Android I
really like what they've done here it's
very soft they have an overly skinned
things they have a lot of ways to let
Android be Android a few interesting
things though there go ahead and do a
little pinch action there you can see
the way you access to widgets apps
wallpapers or themes it's what you sort
of customize the way the phone looks a
little bit it doesn't do all that much
for you essentially it just changes
background and lock screen I would have
liked to have seen a screen it gives me
more information on the lock screen but
certainly a third-party app can take
care of that
if we go ahead and go back take a look
at some the widgets that are here and
Sony's got some really nice ones some
weather widgets which are really handy
and all the stock of Google
that you see but a lot of ways Sony
really didn't do that much here with
Android whenever they did do a couple
tweaks I was in the app tray here so you
can see what things look like you can
view them any way you choose own order
alphabetical most use or recently
installed for alphabetical makes it
easier to uh to find things I will go
ahead and go back home one other cool UI
quark that we've got here if you go in
hit the multitasking button you can put
little widgets on top of the screen so
if I select calculator drag that there
on go ahead and do my calculation right
on it when I'm done just get rid of it
it's very neat that Sony has done that
there are a few options here for things
you can choose from so what's the
verdict here on the Xperia Z this is a
phone that exists in a world with a lot
of other phones out there and it's got
to be a compelling reason to pick this
one up as of this filming it has not
been announced by us care meaning you've
got to shell out full retail price for
the phone I've got a very hard time
recommending it there's nothing wrong
with the phone nothing particularly
great or outstanding about it either in
a world of HTC ones and Galaxy phones
and droid DNA is this is gonna be a
really hard sell for me if I'm someone
that wants to take my phone snorkelling
this would be one reason considered if I
live in a rainy climate I can't save
water damage yeah it's gonna make a lot
of sense but there's nothing that this
phone really excels in that would make
me purchase this over any other
competitors on the market this phone
gets a 7.5 on the TechnoBuffalo scale
we're thinking is exactly where it
belongs it works well there's no faults
with it it's just not great the screen I
would have liked have been a bit better
if they release a non waterproof version
of this and I know they've got the
Xperia Z L doesn't have the same screen
size that we've got here I would
absolutely love in it perhaps my
opinions would change but we're looking
here at the Xperia Z I just don't think
I can justify it for the money so what
do you guys think do you agree disagree
with my opinion on the Xperia Z I would
love to hear your thoughts leave your
