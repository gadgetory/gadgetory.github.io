asked the Buffalo iyanya in a minute
where I'm going to answer all your
questions from the world of technology
but I wanted to take just a very quick
minute to announce something I am so
incredibly excited about and proud of is
techno Buffalo's partnership with
revision3 if you're not familiar with
revision3 they put out some of the best
content on the web from everything in
technology from how to make portable
xbox 360 consoles to the best app
reviews and everything in between they
are the premier resource their site that
I've been watching for years and the
fact that I now get a chance to be a
part of them is so super incredibly
awesome and they're just good people so
what is this going to mean for the
channel nothing really the contents not
going to change we're gonna have all the
regular stuff that we've had up there
our unboxings my bad jokes reviews
content from Noah content from John Q
content from everybody nothing's going
to change what you are gonna get though
is three pieces of new content per week
that's a weird way to make three three
pieces of new content out this three
pieces of new content per week oh you're
gonna get this kind asked the Buffalo
where you ask me questions and I pretend
I'm a buffalo I ever going to get app
reviews junk watch is going to be making
his big comeback on TechnoBuffalo doing
his app reviews and apps showdowns know
Kravitz is going to be running it
through all the rumors that have come
out recently in the world of technology
and its really all the difference is you
guys are going to notice you might also
see some fancy new graphic show up in
those three videos it should be a lot of
fun other than that nothing is going to
change this is just a really exciting
milestone for me and for the site and
hopefully for the folks revision3 none
of this and I skies I say this over and
over again finally save it because I
mean it none of this would be possible
without your support thank you guys for
this opportunity thank you for making us
popular enough to
revision3 notice and thank you for
sticking with us as we grow and as we
grew grew and grow and as this new
opportunity unfolds I'm just super
excited about it and I can't wait to
share with you so let's go ahead and ask
the Buffalo what up everyone jon
rettinger from TechnoBuffalo here it's
time for another edition of ask the
Buffalo where we can get our nerd on and
you can ask me anything you want from
the world of technology whether it's
cellphones laptops computers or anything
in between you can ask your questions
one of two ways you can either send it
to us on twitter at TechnoBuffalo using
the hashtag ask the be otherwise on the
website will be posting posts up once a
week where you can ask your question
write down in the comments which looks
like i'm pointing to my pants that's
actually where the comments would go
alright so without further ado let's go
ahead and get geeky first question comes
from user clogged with AK John what do
you think the next-gen iphone 4s or five
will have and should have well claw if I
knew the answer that I would be a
bajillion error and that's bajillion air
with a be but unfortunately i'm not so
i'm going to give my answer based on
normal product evolution and what I
think we're going to expect and based on
what the rumor mills been churning out 8
megapixel camera on the back chances are
they'll be Sony manufactured 1.3
megapixel camera on the front increased
screen size up to 4 inches inches with
probably a similar resolution will have
the a5 processor in there a lot of fives
in this answer so that'll be the dual
core processor that's currently powering
the ipad 2 certainly will see iOS 5 make
its official debut probably alongside
some new hardware I'm guessing which is
going to give you new notifications and
a ton of other options we're going to
see a ram increase in the usual stuff we
see from phone to phone what I don't
think we're going to see you it gives me
a sad
sad face like this it makes me a sad
panda as I don't think we're going to
have any LTE support which thinks 4G is
sort of becoming the new standard
verizon already has a relatively robust
4G network AT&amp;amp;T is starting to roll out
their 4g service I don't think we're
even gonna have support for hspa+
although I hope my download speeds also
hope that I am wrong all right so
hopefully that helped answer your
question I maybe we'll see it launched
in white 2 which would be a super rare
and the unicorn of phones iphone 5 in
white so the next question comes to us
courtesy of a mess you Patel I'm
probably massacring your name I
apologize what is your primary phone
right now that you own as you bought it
with your own money not a review unit my
primary phone that I own that I bought
with my own mullah is the iphone 4 which
has been converted to read it's not a
case it's an iphone 4 and that's what I
generally use when I'm not testing a new
device if I was going to buy a new phone
right now if I could pick any phone on
any carrier it would definitely be a
toss-up between the iphone 4 I think I
got the bucks actually behind me right
here the Samsung Infuse for AT&amp;amp;T or the
new sensation for tmobile all really
really awesome phones so those would be
what I would choose but the one that I
bought that I keep in my pocket
sometimes sometimes in the back pocket
sometimes the front pocket tell me what
kind of pocket mood I'm in is the iphone
4 that was a lot of time same pocket a
very weird came to my voice the next
question comes from Jarrow looks since
NGP has been revealed in the PS Vita is
having the same price point as Nintendo
3ds for its Wi-Fi version which part of
a gaming device would you personally x
and y that is a no brainer for me if you
heard me talk about the three dias or
someone of my reviews on the 3ds or if
you've used a three yes you might know
that i am not the biggest fan maybe I'm
not the target demographic but the 3d
the stereoscopic 3d that's in there
glasses-free hurts my eyes if you ever
started a computer monitor for four or
five hours of the time and your eyes
just feel fatigued that's what my eyes
felt like when I use the 3ds for 10
minutes so I am super excited about the
formerly known NGP now the PS Vita PSP
vita I'd really don't matter what they
called it at that price point and with
those dual core specs and 0 le D screen
touch screens and actually physical
media they could have called it I think
so in the comments and they could have
called it the PSP popcorn I still would
have bought it it is a great deal I
think Sony hit it out of the park with
the PSP vita elbow still probably call
it the NGP at least for a while that
would be the one that I would go with in
a heartbeat so hopefully that was a
long-winded answer to your question the
next question comes from Alan Dean did
nanny uh what do you think the
blackberry torch 2 will be released to
the public when is early summer we were
one of the first sites actually brought
you a long in-depth video demonstration
of the blackberry torch to we actually
had it in our hand I say are like the
Royal are but I had it in my hand for a
little while and it definitely seemed
fully baked and ready to go this packet
a pretty powerful 1.2 gigs process or
beautiful screen from what I'm hearing
what I'm guessing we're looking at a end
of July early August time frame for the
blackberry torch to so for all you
blackberry fans that we can get torched
torch to torched again I'm sticking with
torched again alright so the next
question comes from this one I can
pronounce Josh Jos age Josh do you think
the legend of zelda skyward sword blend
up being like twilight princess how it
came out a gamecube and the we will it
come out on the wii and the
we you that's a great question Josh if
you don't remember twilight princess was
the Nintendo's flagship Zelda title
launched on the we read the transition
when the wii was coming out and
Nintendo's previous generation console
the Gamecube was still out they released
it on both so that I think we'll see it
on the wii and the wii u answers
probably it's been in development for
years we saw a preview of it actually
last year's e3 in 2010 and now it's
still not released in 2011 they're
saying holidays of this year so chances
are we will see dual versions of it come
out probably with fancy levels and HD
graphics for the Wii U but I think we'll
see a dual console release whenever the
wii u comes out next year next question
comes from twitter and 31 null to do you
think apple copied i'm guessing you
meant copied android in a notification
system and the answer is yeah clearly
apple went to the jailbreak community
clearly they looked at android they saw
what worked and they said let's try and
make it a little bit better and that's
what they did so yeah there's a drawer
that comes down the top just like
android most definitely and if you say
that it's not influenced by android you
are delirious clearly they took cues
from it whether that's bad or good i
don't know when companies compete the
consumers always win so there's maybe
less innovation but definitely it's nice
if you're an iPhone user to be able to
have what I think is one of the best
features of Android that was
notification system next question comes
from pet ragi hey John is iOS 5 1 beta 1
stable enough to use my daily phone your
thought to be much appreciated so I've
got iOS 5 beta 1 i've used previous
versions of beta software so i used i OS
for beta and iOS 3 beta this is
definitely the most stable first beta
build that I've used I've been able to
use it every day as a daily phone with
very few crashes there have been some
bugs and tweaks I have talked about at
length on technobuffalo check it out if
you want the full recap with the one
exception of the camera crashing on me
it's actually been really good so the
answer is probably yes
but if you are developer and you do
decide to use it on your phone be
prepared because things are going to
work a little bit buggy but you should
be able to use it as your daily driver
next question comes from world of tech
UK have you tried OS 5 and I message can
you compete with blackberry messenger uh
I have I message on my phone
unfortunately I am alone as far as my
friends go and I haven't tried I a
message yet with anybody else so I can't
say if it's going to compete a
blackberry messenger though is
tremendous I've used it I've got it on a
vibe you can I'm blackberry so I have it
ahhh it's really good an apple was
clearly squaring off against blackberry
and BBM particular so I can't really
answer that question yet hopefully those
more people get access to the beta and
as it comes out to release I'll be able
to shed some more light on and our last
question comes from brand love Star Wars
I love Star Wars 2 so that's why I could
be John love Star Wars what does it take
to work at technobuffalo ask the bee ah
it takes a good application it takes
talent and it takes somebody likes to
have fun so we're always looking to hire
a techno Buffalo so if you see a post up
on the site that we're looking for
writers go ahead and apply and spend a
lot of time on your application so guys
