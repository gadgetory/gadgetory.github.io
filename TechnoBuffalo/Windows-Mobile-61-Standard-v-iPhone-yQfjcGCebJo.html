up the Pantex matrix pro from AT&amp;amp;T
Wireless yesterday I'll be using it ever
since and I realized I was getting a lot
of questions about preparing it to the
iPhone so I want to give you guys a real
quick demonstration of how windows
mobile 6.1 standard so that's the non
touch screen version compares with the
iPhone on some of the key features and
key things that you guys do on a daily
basis so I'm gonna compare unlocking
changing ringtones going from ring to
vibrate how to send a text message how
to view a web page adding a new contact
and adding a new calendar item some of
just the most important things that you
do on an everyday basis so this is just
going to be an example of windows mobile
6.1 standard and I'm going to use the
pantech matrix obviously different
windows mobile devices your experience
may vary just a little bit so the first
thing both devices are locked to go
ahead and unlock them to unlock the
pantech matrix in the windows 6.1
windows mobile 6.1 go ahead and hit a
button you get an unlock message right
there I will hit unlock now tells you to
push the star key
so I'll slide this open and I'll push
the star key and now the device is
unlocked to unlock the iPhone push this
button the top of the device slide that
over and now the phone is unlocked so
let's say you are going into a meeting
you're going into class and you want to
change your phone from ring to vibrate
so you don't disrupt remember is around
you I'll show you guys how to do that
quick and easily on both devices so on
the pantech what you'll do is you'll
take advantage of these sliding panels
you'll scroll down where it says profile
select it and select vibrator
now it says vibrate right there this
little icon at the top showing you that
the phone is on vibrate on the iPhone to
switch from ring to vibrate take those
switch on the side give it a flip little
icon right there letting you know you're
on vibrate and you are good to go
so texting is a very big deal is
important to me I'm sure it's important
to you
Hanako the text using the devices so
will you take advantage again of these
sliding panels will go to the top glue
to text messages will hit the compose
button and now we can go ahead and start
typing - and start typing the message so
it takes a few steps but not something
terribly difficult on the iPhone to send
a text we go ahead hit text drive I got
some messages and that's really it hit
the compose but at the top and you are
good to go I'm back out of both of these
ok the next thing and one thing that's
most important to me on a mobile device
is the web browsing so how do you visit
a web page so I'm going to chain you
guys that right now go ahead and open up
the Start menu we'll go to Internet
Explorer and let's go ahead and open up
let's say you want to open up
pocketnow.com so hit the menu button
address bar and now you can have to hit
delete to go back and you can start
typing your address and there you go
nothing too bad there on the iPhone you
go hit Safari hit the bar at the top
soft keyboard automatically comes up and
you can start typing your address nice
and easily there as well so let's back
out at both of these screens okay and
let's say you want to add a new contact
you just made a new friend just picked
up a girl in a bar or whatever it might
be and you want to add her phone number
so let me show you guys how to do that
here again we'll use the sliding panels
so you want to go ahead and add a new
contact go to the sliding panel it's
right there at the top you have a
contacts button down below hit the soft
key hit new and now you can add a new
contact nice and easily to add a new
contact on the iPhone
you can either go through the phone menu
or hit contacts pulls up your whole list
of contacts here you let the plus button
and now you can add my first name last
name and whatever you choose all right
let's say you want to go ahead and
change ringtones you're sick of what you
have as your standard you want to hear
something new to change ringtones on
windows mobile 6.1 once again you use
those panels slide over to ringtones
select it pulls up your sounds manager
and you can pick whatever tune you like
find the one you want and just hit done
on the iPhone to change the ringtones
you have to go to settings you have to
go to sounds and then from here you can
select your ringtones and you can scroll
through and take a pick so let's say you
want to add a new calendar item so on
Windows Mobile take to the calendar
scrolling panels new appointment go
ahead and select it subject start date
and you can put it all right there on
the iPhone you go and hit calendar and
again take advantage that plus button
and you can go through and start typing
nice and easily right there so guys this
is a real quick example of how different
features and different basic functions
work on the operating systems windows
mobile 6.1 standard so again that's non
touchscreen and Apple's iPhone hope you
