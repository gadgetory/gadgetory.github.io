to you by Linda calm what's up everyone
welcome back to the episode of rumor
roundup i'm lashauwn ranchers to show
her I take every single tech rumor from
the week and I serve a plate to you of
the top three or four so you know what
could be coming one might be coming when
as a potential to possibly definitely
could come in the near to perhaps
distant future of this week HTC One the
Amazon set-top box and Amazon music
service could be coming sooner than you
think those rumor roundup but to start
just rounding things up at this point
the all new HTC One might be the most
leaked phone since the iphone 5 we
pretty much know as much about it as any
actually release device out there the
final piece of HTC's puzzle was what
those crazy dual cameras before well
looks like that riddle has finally been
solved thanks to a leak ad from
Australian carrier Telestra and from the
good folks at gsmarena who uncovered it
so it looks like the rumors were true
when it comes to those rear camera setup
which HTC is apparently calling duo
camera I guess makes sense the leak add
notes you'll be able to edit your photos
after you've taken the shot choosing
where to focus what to highlight letting
you add some sort of weird 3d effect the
camera also works really well in low
light though we already know that since
it's really one of the primary strength
of the ultrapixel camera on the original
HTC One so think about it for a minute
you take a quick picture someone's
running or moving young sure what you
want to focus take your picture your
family I want to take focus on grandma
you want to focus on your mom you just
tap to focus afterwards we saw this sort
of light field technology in the lytro
camera and now it's made it to a phone
it's a really really big deal I think
something we're going to see a lot of
new phones moving forward so old design
wise looks pretty similar to the
outgoing HTC One this technology is
really really cool so further specs the
leak describes a 5-inch full-hd scratch
resistant display that to replace the
original HTC one's 4.7 inch screen also
confirmed or sent a front-facing boom
sound stereo speakers with Jon Asamoah
original I imagine some even better on
this one a pretty sexy all-metal body
we all know and love and finally we get
details online said six to the parent
let you turn the phone on or off by
tapping the screen similar to the really
awesome and really useful LG's knock
code and also no more silly buttons you
now have actually on-screen buttons and
you've got three of them that will work
so the Amazon set-top box it looks like
this one's coming it's just a matter of
where and when so you'd expect amazon
set-top box to only feature amazon
content heavily pushing amazon prime but
it looks like bees OS and company are
sort of warming up and cozying up to the
competition according to multiple
sources speaking to our friends at
gigaom amazon is reportedly beginning to
assemble support from services at plans
to include on its crazy long-rumored
set-top box the new information
indicates that the company has already
spoken two of the usual suspects hulu
and netflix about building apps for
their as of now still rumored but almost
confirmed device now let's just stick
with amazon for another minute for me i
do a song and dance when our new Prime
every year it's the best money i spend
and it's already an incredible value but
it looks like we're going to get even
more for a cash even if you gotta pay
just a little bit more amazon's off to
room burn music streaming service will
apparently limits how much a subscriber
listens to a given song according to
sources speaking to the pre reliable
Wall Street Journal the online retailer
is hoping to offer an on-demand service
as a perk for prime subscribers although
limiting playback stand sound like that
much of a perk let's see why solicit
your same song over and over again
amazon or record companies reportedly
been unable to come to any agreements
during negotiations though I report last
month clean amazon was trying to secure
a substantial discounts over what other
competitive services pay so the idea
here is you listen to a song i think you
buy it through amazon's own mp3 sale
lose that's what everybody's claimed to
Wall Street Journal and makes certainly
business sense sirs will presumably work
by giving users a limited number of
streams and when their allotment runs
out and Glenn wolf gently encourage you
to buy a particular song or album but
just probably cram it down your throat
with ads so apples motive for
introducing iTunes radio is kind of
similar although Apple already dominates
digital music sales the addition of
music streaming to prime would likely
cause annual costs to go up boo
which already been rumored to balloon
from 119 bucks from the $79 it's at
right now so what I think would you be
willing to pay more to get music service
not that good music guy but I think
prime even if you've got nothing else I
would still happily pay hundred twenty
bucks for prime for next-day shipping
and all the Amazon streaming services it
is the best deal going in tech so Fred
20 bucks you also get the opportunity to
stream some songs seems like a pretty
good deal to make we take a minute to
