from TechnoBuffalo here is an unboxing
for you that I'm really excited about
this is the just updated 13-inch MacBook
Pros this is the models that were just
given the newest Intel Core i5 and core
i7 chips as well as Intel's light peak
technology which Apple has dubbed
Thunderbolt we'll talk a bit more about
that as we go along so without further
ado let's go ahead and open up
so the box is very familiar to previous
generations MacBook Pros in fact it
looks almost identical to previous
generation MacBook Pros say for some
port differences so we've got a picture
of the device right on the front and
again this is the 13.3 inch model got
some Apple logos on the side got some
differences right here letting you know
that it's a core i5 chip which is
actually now the entry-level
this is the entry-level computer which
is going to constitute just shy of $1200
the thunderbolt high-speed IO and that
stands for input/output and again there
is a picture of the device we've got
some specs on top let me just run you
through very quickly here this is a 2.3
dual core Intel Core i5 model you can
also get the core i7 with three
megabytes of shared level two cache got
four gigabytes of ddr3 RAM this
particular one has a 320 gigabyte hard
drive that spins at 5400 rpm so it's not
solid-state again 3.3 inch diagonal
display all the sizes are always
measured diagonal with the resolution of
1280 by 800 Apple has now ditched Nvidia
and gone back to Intel this has the
integrated 3000 processor with 384
megabytes of ddr3 sdram shared with main
memory and you now have a built-in
FaceTime HD camera certainly if there's
a FaceTime camera built-in but now it's
all HD and Nancy is going to give you
about three times the resolution so
enough of me yammering about it let's go
ahead and use the unnecessary and
obligatory big ol knife to cut the tape
and we'll have this kicking around for a
few weeks here so I'm really excited to
put it through its paces and see if it
lives up to the hype alright go ahead
and push that on the side open it up and
we've got the very familiar Apple
packaging a little bit of cushion on top
here is the macbook pro then pull that
off feels almost identical to the
previous generation models push it off
to the side for just a minute and we'll
keep digging in and see what we're gonna
have in the box got your MagSafe power
adapter got an extension cord right here
for it
this part actually pops right off and
you can slide this in and you can extend
it just a little bit
interestingly enough though the
extension part of the MagSafe adapter
there's only one it's got the third
grounding prong right there the standard
one you just plug into the wall does not
be something to keep in mind we've got
all of your backup and restore this the
everything Mac and everything else stuff
in here as well as a clean cloth I
assume it's all probably pretty standard
fare everything Mac everything else and
a Quintin cloth I don't however see any
Apple stickers in here which is
unfortunate
nope no stickers all right so enough of
that let's go ahead and push the box off
to the side and let's take a look at the
computer because there are a lot of
subtle differences here I with this guy
it's go ahead and pull off the classic
this is always kind of fun
break that seal there we go and here is
the 13.3 MacBook Pro let's go ahead and
first run through the ports this is
where a lot of the differences are all
right so of course we're going to have
the MagSafe port we're gonna have a
Gigabit Ethernet port just your standard
pretty much Ethernet now followed by
that you're going to have a firewire 800
which used to be Lisa Quan Apple
products the highest speed input/output
that they had which is capable of 800
megabits per second and remember that
it's called firewire 800 800 megabits
per second so keep that in mind
looking over next to it now that's the
new port in sealable symbol there that
is Thunderbolt and thunderbolt is
essentially Intel's implementation of
like peak technology and that's going to
give you transfer rates of up to 10
gigabytes per second so that is
incredibly fast thing we're gonna have
to worry about right now though our
devices that are going to support it
which is kind of the problem it's a
device does a lot of stuff but if
there's nothing that supports it's going
to be a problem so the thunderbolt port
also does a few other things in addition
to the high speed input/output it's also
going to function as your native mini
displayport you can also use it for DVI
output using mini DisplayPort to DVI VGA
out dual link DVI and actually
I'm HDMI audio and video output using a
third-party mini DisplayPort to HDMI
adapter so you do sort of have HDMI
though Apple didn't actually put it in
two USB 2.0 port and speaking of those
speeds
it's going to give me 480 megabits per
second when you do your transfer rates
you've got an SD card slot headphone in
your battery indicator little Deeley on
the other side you've got your super
drive which is for making DVDs and all
that business on the back the battery is
now completely sealed in and it's going
to give you about 64 watt hours which is
going to translate to about seven hours
of battery life allegedly which is kind
of nice open it up it's gonna look
exactly like every other Mac laptop
you've probably seen at all the coffee
shops macbook pro it's got the full
glass enclosure there it's got the black
mat and the FaceTime camera which looks
exactly the same you can see me there as
FaceTime HD so let's talk a bit more
about what we've got going on here the
resolution of this 13.3 inch model we're
going to be 1280 by 800
that's the native resolution it could
support a little bit lower as we go you
can spec this eight to have all kinds of
cool stuff you can give it as an SSD if
you want again this is the entry model
which comes with 320 gigabyte hard drive
you've got the solid glass trackpad here
no more buttons to just push down we've
seen this on previous generation Mac
laptops let's go ahead and close this
thing up
this has been an unboxing of the new
13.3 inch MacBook Pros I'm real excited
to give this guy a thorough test see how
it handles video see how it handles
audio let's see on handles video editing
and the rest of things that's weeks like
to see so I think in particular you guys
want to see covered on this new MacBook
Pro let me know again we'll have it for
a few weeks and of course would give you
a full review I'm John Rhett enger' from
TechnoBuffalo and I'll see you in the
next video bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
