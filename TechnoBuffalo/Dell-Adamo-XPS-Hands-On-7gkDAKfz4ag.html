XPS this is a newest addition to the
abdominal line it's actually the
finished notebook on the market for
gigabytes of ram 128 gigabyte
solid-state drive 2 megapixel webcam
that's what you want that's all you want
to see here you want to see the slim 3.2
pound package it's got a really nice
hi-res screen fit on the glossy side
it's got a very unique form factor seen
almost sits up speakers are
downward-facing you've got a brand new
keyboard here with a different font it's
actually metal caps either just quite
interesting they feel very nice have a
lot of feel to it look at it from the
side you'll see it's really thin as you
type there isn't much flex in the
keyboard it's actually a bit ergonomic
24 for your typing the really cool thing
about this is the unique form factor you
go ahead and close it you get a computer
that is just extremely blisteringly thin
if you hold it up next to the old
faithful something like an iPhone you
can really get a sense of how thin this
thing actually is you've got a
DisplayPort one USB port on the side on
the other side of the device got you are
power and another USB port and audio in
and out we've got some vents and there
are those downward facing speakers we
talked about another sort of cool
feature about the adamo XPS is the
capacitive latch you look at it there's
really no way to open it the keyboard
sort of sticks right in there it doesn't
appear to be a way to get it out this
little latch right here is actually
capacity you take your finger you swipe
it over see the color change to blue and
then you can actually open it right up
with of course a multi-touch trackpad
with your two standard buttons and
running a 64-bit windows 7 home premium
