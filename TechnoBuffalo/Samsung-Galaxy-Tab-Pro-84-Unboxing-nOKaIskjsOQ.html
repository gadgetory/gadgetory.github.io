TechnoBuffalo here it's an unboxing for
you of the samsung galaxy tabpro if
you're like me and like your tablet's a
little bit on the smaller side this
might be just the tablet doctor ordered
let's go ahead and dig in the box to the
samsung galaxy tabpro looks like
Samsung's all current generation boxes
through that wood trim we saw debut on
the galaxy s4 we've got the Wi-Fi 16
gigabyte version here it also be a a
cellular version available as well
sent to us courtesy of our friends at
Samsung's PR department go ahead and
slide out of the box and there is the
Galaxy Tab pro telling us all the specs
but of course we'll run through all that
so you didn't even have to read if you
don't want to that's the beauty of video
I'll push it off to the side for just
quick sec and see what else we're going
to have living inside of this box
nothing overly exciting we've got
getting started a booklet wall work and
a USB 3.0 cork push all that off to the
side let's take a look at the reason we
are here the Galaxy Tab pro go ahead and
peel off all the stuff and run through
the specs if I can get that whooshing
noise that I love so much oh yeah
that's a good way you don't always hear
that every day slide that off we do a
little power on so you got something fun
to look at and I'll run you through all
the specs that we've got here on the
galaxy tabpro those perfect timing the
SMT 320 model here looking at an 8.4
inch screen the resolution of 1620 by
2560 giving it a 359 PPI case you're
wondering it's wqxga and and Android 4.4
at launcher which is kinda nice to see
being powered by a 2.3 gigahertz
Qualcomm Snapdragon 800 so quad core two
bigs Ram on here available in 16 or 32
gig configurations but don't worry too
much about that
you got a microSD card slot there up to
64 gigs if you want got eight megapixel
camera living there on the back an 80
megapixel one on the front 802 11 ABG
and an AC and a pretty nice size forty
eight hundred million power battery but
no NFC here as well the buttons as
opposed to what we saw
the Galaxy Note pro they are capacitor
buttons but the same button it's got a
multitasking button here it gives you
the option to close all or open your
task manager you can swipe up to close a
physical clicky home button and your
back button on the left hand side that's
where your micro SD card slot is going
to live on the right hand side is where
your IR port is volume up and down and a
power button it's just like a big phone
which probably gonna be the same size
like the galaxy note like five I'd wager
a 3.5 millimeter headset jack right
there on top this does have sort of faux
leather feel that we saw on the Galaxy
Note and it feels almost exactly the
same as we saw on at the Galaxy Note
hero I don't believe the back is it all
removable so you're gonna be out of luck
for that on the bottom dual speakers and
there is a clicker charge and sync cable
as a microUSB not USB 3.0 like I
initially thought when I did the cable
unboxings so taking a look at the UI
here it's a little bit redone
you've got static on the bottom left and
right Google searches I'd really like is
always there and the apps are kind of
hidden down on the bottom right so you
have to worry about taking up a space
here on your icons go in dig in you can
see everything that you've got here
YouTube's pre-installed Flipboard
Netflix email contacts I'll get a
Samsung stuff you'd expect a big
difference here between if you're
wondering with differencing the galaxy
tab and the new Galaxy Note line of
tablet says no stylus here on this guy
is really the big one the Galaxy Note
pro has three gigs of RAM this one has
two probably nothing really going to
notice that is you know the big
difference in case you were wondering
let's go ahead and jump into settings
and see what we are working with Android
4.4 again at launch could Celia broke it
up two connections device controls and
in general lots of stuff here if you're
going to about device we've got Android
4.4.2 or right out of the box and go
ahead and you can see Samsung's new sort
of magazine UI and as you do that you
still have the app drawer that stays
static in the bottom right which I do
like as well if you go ahead and pull
down it can see Samsung's new sort of
circular more flat looking at icons they
can see what they all are there and
there's a ton of short cuts including
volume and brightness which probably
probably the most used in course you can
jump right into
settings you can see more right there
and you can do whatever you would like
to do right from the drop-down menu
they look some of the widgets you're
gonna have here a lot of them are
typical Samsung we've seen before and
some are very googly but all of them are
here
