from TechnoBuffalo here and yesterday or
this morning depending on which time
zone you live in Sony took the wraps off
their new PSP PSP too called n GP which
stands for next generation portable
presumably it just can be called the PSP
2 let's go ahead and run through all the
facts and talk about them and analyze
what you guys can expect to the next
generation portable console
all right so first I'm going to run
through all the facts and tell you what
its gonna do and then let's talk about
it cuz there's a lot of things to
actually discuss with it so it's got a
very similar design to the current
generation PSP and not the bastard child
PSP go this is the actual PSP the two
thousand three thousand five thousand
nine thousand the one that's long and
oval it looks very very very similar
it does have front and rear facing
cameras and I should say that specs were
a little light this guy's not getting
released until holidays 2011 so Sony was
just sort of nebulously talking about it
it's got a screen resolution on a 5-inch
o le d-- capacitive touchscreen display
of 960 by 540 4 which puts that at about
four times the resolution of the current
PSP so super high resolution things will
look crisp OLEDs screens are awesome
blacks you're gonna look really black
colors you're going to look bright and
vibrant and pop out right at you
now them 3d but they look quite good and
a new touchscreen interface we'll talk
about in just a minute
on the back of it it's got two rear
touch panels for extra navigation and
extra buttoning so you actually be able
to do some navigation with games on the
back it depends how the developers use
that we'll talk about that in a minute
as well 3G and Wi-Fi capable also I'm
gonna pop in a SIM card I don't expect
this to be released on a carrier
although who knows what carrier might
subsidize 3G they showed it with a SIM
card but presumably there could be maybe
an LTE version or a CDMA version that
might not use a SIM card so that's kind
of interesting
maybe carriers are going to get in to
the gaming business maybe they'll be
some sort of billing system where you
can just bill your carrier directly if
you want to download some games I'm
speaking of games those games are not
going to be played on um DS anymore all
of your um DS are now obsolete
so the hundreds and $100 that Sony had
you buy for the proprietary format no
longer works I need to buy a new
proprietary format it's going to be
flash card media looks pretty much like
an SD card a little bit strangely
designed
basically it is an SD card so what are
you gonna do with all your old UMD disks
well me you can stack them and use them
as coasters for tiny little coffee cups
if you want to play those games you're
going after you download them again and
somebody hasn't said it there's gonna be
any system to offer free downloads of
those games but I would probably guess
forget to pay for some of those games
again so not awesome it's not going to
be backwards compatible with your old
titles so that's also got a six axis
controllers in a gyroscope meaning you
can move it and they'll change
perspectives this is not me driving cars
that need holding a PSP and moving
around so they'll have all those touch
controls and be able to utilize motion
for controls of the games again in the
hands of the developers it's going to
have a new UI called live area which is
gonna take event a touch screen
essentially it's a super invasive social
networking Ike if you want it to we can
pull down features to tell you where you
are at every single minute what you're
playing what your scores are essentially
let everybody know what you're doing
it'll do everything to tell all your
friends sort of letting them know you're
in the shower and if you tell it to do
that it might actually do that as well
so I'm gonna keep that in mind as far as
all that sort of pervasive stuff goes
not necessary the biggest fan but it is
nice to see a capacitive touchscreen
utilized on the new PSP presumably
you'll be able to use that as well for
some browsing action five-minute screen
is really nice this may serve sort of as
a tablet functionality as well you know
five inches is really sort of a not too
big not too small I'm not really gonna
throw it in your pocket but you don't
need a duffel bag to carry it around
sighs I might be able to get some of
your tablet action on there as well
against when you launching in the
holidays 2011 no pricing were released
nor any hardware specs up 'its or
further hardware specs but sony is
claimed and this is a big claim that
somebody gets powerful as a ps3 mm-hmm
that sounds a little fishy but who knows
that claims gonna have a revolutionary
new mobile processor Sony can come
through on that you know it's gonna be
absolutely tremendous it may perhaps you
know redefine gaming I'm really
positioned Sony again as the mobile
graphics leader
comes to gaming and the Nintendo 3ds is
more of the I guess niche casual gaming
market certainly the Wii is achieved
vast market penetration but there really
is that same segmentation of the market
that we saw with the wean the ps3 with
casual gamers and hardcore gamers we're
gonna see that as well at the 3ds and
the PSP - or NGP or ever PSP go to
whatever they decide to call it I are
gonna sort of see that same schism which
is kind of interesting
one of the cool ways that you can use
the PSP to those back touch panels and
gets gonna be a lot of fun actually when
you use the device if you ever use a PSP
your fingers sort of sit there if I hang
the trigger so that's another dimension
of control obviously in first-person
shooters it would be great we to sort of
move around
you also can be able to do that via two
new analog sticks so you can actually
have full control over the guys as well
which are kind of nice for navigation so
here's the interesting thing about the
PSP 2 or NGP it's not launching for
about another 10 11 months presumably
around that timeframe so you have to
sort of wonder what the markets gonna
look like in 11 months this thing
launched today it'd be an absolutely
killer and a beast and a bear but
looking at 11 months from now the 3ds
has already been out for eight nine
months if she presumably loved you but
looking for these games are going to
want to pick up a 3ds to get sort of
what's at least right now the most
up-to-date mobile gaming also what's
going to happen to the current PSP line
you assume sales of that are gonna go
straight on down and as you're going to
be a customer backlash because of the
lack of um DS that sounds bad but uh you
know you're gonna be upset that you
spent so much money on back paddle in a
games that you can no longer use you
know I guess that sort of part of the
generational evolution of consoles and I
guess mobile would be considered a
console but it's definitely discouraging
to these many many diehard PSP fans out
there so I'm really curious what you
guys have to say are you excited about
the PSP - are you not excited
eleven months is a long time from now
we'll have presumably the iPhone 5 in
hand
in six of probably circulating at that
point we'll probably have the Nexus
Google MJ you know might be out you know
there's gonna be a lot of mobile
technology out and a lot of platforms
that are really capable with mobile
gaming you know we may be very well in
the heat of Tegra 3 you know it was
really fast dual-core processors that
might be able to put the PSP to get a
little bit of competition as far as
gaming prowess goes so it's gonna be
very interesting to see how the
marketing ball telemark involves over
the course of the year personally I'm
excited about the PSP 2 or MGP I can't
wait get my hands on it and see if it
really does define mobile gaming but I'm
also very curious to see how the market
evolves over that period of time so I'm
