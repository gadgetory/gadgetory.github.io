technobuffalo earth an unboxing this guy
the latest windows phone from nokia it
is the Lumia 925 not to be confused with
its 95 better brother the Lumia 1020
essentially replacement for the Lumia
920 it's got a new slim down shape new
metal sides they've taken away wireless
charging let's go ahead take a look see
how it performs here is the box for the
Lumia 925 looking very nondescript but
stylish in its orange and white duds
this guy comes in a black go ahead and
open it up this guy was sent to us
courtesy of the folks at nokia PR so it
might be some extras in here including
this Lumia little baggie they can also
clean the screen with and here is doing
a very slow striptease the Nokia Lumia
925 essentially it's the 920 slim down
with the metal sides and the wireless
charging removed which we'll talk about
that in just a moment it's like they
also included for us $25 credit to the
Windows Phone store for apps and games
included in the box learn about stuff
we've got some Nokia information how
visual voicemail works from 18 about the
phone we've got a sim removal tool a
wall warts and a charging cable not much
else but here is the reason that you
guys are all here only powered on and we
can talk about it so you're looking at a
4.5 inch screen the resolution of 1280
by 768 if you do math quickly in your
head you would know that is a 332 PPI
it's an AMOLED wxga running Windows
Phone 8 thing powered by 1.5 gigahertz
dual-core snapdragon chip it's got a
giga ramps this one's got 16 gigs of
internal storage but you get seven gigs
of SkyDrive cloud storage so you can
store your things on the cloud the back
camera which now my nokia standard
sounds paltry is an 8.7 megapixel camera
and the front is 1.2 megapixels 802 11
ABG and n two thousand million power
battery and bluetooth 3.1 hundred
thirty-nine grams or four
29 announces go ahead and do a quick
tour will peel off all this unnecessary
plasticky stuff we can take a look at
this gorgeous phone and we'll uncover
that lens get me really lends all right
so the phone has metal on the sides and
it feels really good my estimation is
the best feeling nokia phone out there
the metal edging really makes it feel
premium it's got a nice weight to it as
well so typical windows 8 it looks the
same as pretty much every other Windows
8 Phone you have some sort of Nokia
specific things on here procam for
example there are some panoramic options
and a lot of things you can download
from the Windows Store that are
dedicated just to nokia so you've got
smart cam pro cam and things like that
so there are all the app that this guy
is going to ship what the rest of it is
pretty standard Windows Phone I've got a
back button for and also multitasking
your home button and your bing search
button on the right-hand side we got
volume up and down your power and lock
button and a dedicated camera button
which I am always kind of excited to
have on the back not much but you have
three local extra ports let me show you
what that is for so I mentioned this guy
does not have Chi wireless charging like
the Lumia 920 does so they sent us a
wireless cover for it that will enable
the Qi charging looks like ours is all
done up for the man of steel so then
pull this out essentially it's a new
backplate pop this guy on it's going to
enable wireless charging which I really
like wireless charging I would have
appreciated if it's okay with it in the
box but some people want to see people
don't so at least now you've got the
option you snap that case on and you
kind of lose that awesome feeling of the
metal but it's not too bad there's a
decent scene though between the back of
the between the case and the phone but
you do get a Superman logo and doesn't
affect the camera and you can dredge
wirelessly so probably a pretty decent
trade off so let me bring in it's sort
of Windows Phone cousins here is the 920
that essentially places from a TTL I'll
pull this back playoffs because you can
do a come fare size comparison photo
don't look like just really gripped on
their tight there we go so we've got 920
on the left 925 on the right they look
pretty much identical until you stack
them on the side you can really see the
difference
between those two and to bring in the
big daddy of the Lumia line this is the
1020 with its crazy 41-megapixel lens
and of course you can see the difference
there on the back as well and just for
fun putting in a samsung galaxy s4 so
you can see the size comparison there
and again this is a 4.5 inch screen you
can see lucy has my background and see
what those guys look like side by side
is the kiss and do some inner phone
makeout session anyway guys let me know
what else you want to see about this
phone we take a look at it first for
tmobile so nothing really new here is
change but is available for AT&amp;amp;T right
