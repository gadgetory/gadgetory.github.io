by shutterstock.com welcome back to
another episode of ask the buffalos a
very special episode we are filming at
CES 2013 this episode though we are
answering one question and one question
only what's it like for technobuffalo to
cover a big show like CES ID so what's
it like to cover a big show like CES and
Baker so first of all you're never gonna
get any sleep throughout the week so be
prepared for that because I mean from
morning to evening it's you know six in
the morning till eleven or twelve at
night when it comes to events when it
comes to you know various meetings
you're just walking the floor I mean
really it's it's a long day and it's a
long couple of days as you're here for
traitor like CES or ctia so what about
you what do you think so a lot of the
tradeshow stuff does actually happen on
the trade show for a lot of booths here
and stuff there are vents and press
events that go on these before people
ask why we had a winner of our contest
come out two days before the show that's
that all the press events are going on I
think Roy Choi actually said they
shouldn't call them press conf you can't
ask questions and we're like press
lecture 1 also you know with Vegas it's
like they're all in different hotels too
so it's not just the lvcc the convention
center it's you know in the pawns and in
the venetian and in excalibur and in
luxor so you're constantly going up and
down the strip so half the time is
trying to find a good cab or not i
should say there aren't bad caps in
vegas i guess they're all good do
interview guys like before getting fewer
against the cab like you sometimes I'm
like how's it going you know what do you
think of this cab is it good is it that
tell me about your right I'm just saying
you know I you never know what happens
like this is Vegas some of the cab
drivers i've been i've been covering
this for four years there's some weird
cab drivers and think so no offense city
cab drivers out there that are watching
there's something called the CES play
going around where there's all kinds of
flu outbreak trying not to get it so
that's we've taken our vitamins we can
sanitize we've done quite a few thing we
try to get at least a little bit more
sleeping by a little bit more i mean you
know four to five hours as opposed to to
discreetly and we actually lost our
editor-in-chief sean on he came down
with the flu 102 fever had to go to the
hospital so it's a real thing we're
trying to just stay healthy
unfortunately i poisoned his drinks so
he's gonna get sick when we get back but
most of us are gonna be perfectly fine
so to cover the show it's a lot of
walking around it's a lot
going to interview is going to press the
actual time we get this wander and walk
around is really very minimal you know
maybe one or two hours each day if we're
lucky but what I will say is it's good
because we've got a team here this year
and so I mean a ton of different people
can cover a bunch of different things I
mean me for example I had never seen the
show for for more than two hours up
until this year so being able to kind of
go around and see cool stuff it's films
and phones for the site your stuff like
that with people who do we have a team
of nine here actually including our
contest winner David Taylor siren what's
it like for you now a technobuffalo when
you film a video what's your what's your
process and how does that video go from
you filming to live so what's nice again
back to the team aspect of everybody
being here we've got John Q doing some
great video editing work we've got a
great team riding up post so I can go
out and focus on you know doing video
content and bring it back and say hey
can you edit this can you go we're gonna
written piece and therefore we can get
more videos for you so that's super
exciting you know and I think same way
for you as well I'm just nice to have a
team I'm an assembly line if you will
just different people doing great things
for the Sun get awesome videos we get a
workout you know I mean it's like the
best of all the worlds here we got good
pretty good we call it said and done
come back from CES diesel dial so why
don't we show you guys just a real quick
look at what it was like inside a
technobuffalo office so welcome to room
15 also known as TechnoBuffalo
headquarters let's go ahead see what
goes on behind the scenes some folks are
still out in about Missouri the guys are
still kicking around in the office this
is where many pounds of french fries and
chicken fingers and all kinds of stuff
where consumers also where all the
writing and all the editing happened
almost every piece of content that you
saw that wasn't done at a press lecture
was done back here so let's take a look
at some of the guys and ask me a few
questions let's start here with the man
who's responsible for all the video all
the awesome work that makes both of us
