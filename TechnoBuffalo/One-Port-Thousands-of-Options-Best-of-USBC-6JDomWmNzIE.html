got for Christmas or the one you might
buy next year after it's going to have a
USB C type C port in it and if you're
lucky it's also going to be Thunderbolt
3 and there's a ton of Awesome USB C
tech coming out and that got announced
the show so let me show you some of the
highlights the first is an updated to
their Thunderbolt 2 dock which I
actually own from the folks at El Gato
this one is not only USB C but
Thunderbolt 3 can be available to end of
January for a not cheap $299 but it does
a ton of awesome things and it's it's a
dock it's got a ton of ports so if
you're running a computer that maybe
only has one port or maybe only 2 or 4
it's going to expand it incredibly and
it makes bring your computer to work
really simple drop your computer and
plug in one cable and you've got all the
i/o that you need if you picked up a new
MacBook Pro but maybe you're missing mac
safe Griffin is waving their hand saying
thing look at us with our break safe
high powers this is a hundred watt
breakaway cable for the MacBook Pro and
it works exactly like you'd expect you
plug it in unfortunately doesn't sit
flush to the computer it still sticks
out but if on something that's gonna
break away you're worried about tripping
over your cable and don't want your
brand new shiny computer to go with it
for $39.99 it's pretty good option
so tachi might not be a name that you
recognize but if you've bought any USB
see accessories you probably have one of
them I think I've got two sitting in my
drawer pretty simple and great for
travel plug in get ports you can do 4k
HDMI it's got pass-through charging
Ethernet USB type a ports and SD and
micro SD card slot so keep one of these
suckers in your bag in our office we
have four different henge docks and the
fact now they're updating it to support
USB C and thunderbolt 3 for the macbook
pro is huge the best one and the coolest
one I think it's a horizontal dock and
it does a lot of stuff it's automated
docking it's got software you click a
button it'll undock and it'll unlock
from its Kensington lock and you're good
to go that's the good news
the bad is it's gonna cost 499 dollars
but that it's gonna get you 13 expansion
ports and it's gonna look really cool
but 500 bucks is a lot of clams
money I don't like clams are called
money but it's not cheap but looking for
a doc that's gonna do everything for
your new computer this is a really good
way to go and last but definitely not
least how about cameras Panasonic kind
of surprised a lot of folks and took the
wraps off the gh five with you probably
can guess it at this point USB type-c
interface two really good solutions a
lot of new computers are losing SD card
slots it's got USB 3.1 transfer speeds
the camera itself is also pretty awesome
aside from the USB type-c twenty point
three megapixel digital live ma sensor
4k video with no crop internal four by
two by two 10 bit 4k video a two twenty
four thirty p5 access center
stabilization and dual dual so-so two SD
card slots so that is pretty much any
camera you're gonna need for all of your
camera needing things there's a lot more
printable USB type-c and thunderbolt
through accessories are some of the best
and sort of showcases future what the
technology can bring and it looks like
we might finally have one port to rule
them all</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
