to you by audible what's up everyone
welcome back there episode of a rumor
roundup this is close to a year and
round up we got CES literally right
around the corner so I thought it'd be
fun to make my predictions for the top
trends we are going to see at CES 2014
it started the CES has changed a lot
over the years used to be where all the
companies would announce their crazy new
products and then those crazy new
products started to get announced on
their own events people didn't want to
sort of get lost in the way of CES news
and even out to product on Monday and
it's all the rage and somebody else does
anything on Tuesday and everybody's
forgotten about what happened the day
before but I think we're going to see a
lot of new trends this year at CES I
think the first thing we're going to see
our wearables whether or not it's a
watch or some sort of glasses or a smart
bracelet even smart wigs we've seen
patents form looking at you sony I think
wearables are gonna be a huge trend this
year at the show next and we saw a 4k
last year but they were just gigantic
flagship sets that costs like thirty
forty thousand dollars I think this is
the year that 4k becomes affordable in
the three thousand to four thousand
dollar range for most smart televisions
so looking at you know Sony sharp
samsung the big manufacturers out there
I think we're going to see a lot of 4k
and 4k maybe not just on televisions but
maybe even 4k on a smaller screen 4k
tablets hour perhaps 2k tablets and
phones might make an appearance at the
show next continuing the windows a trend
convergent a blog flames are the tablets
that bend and fold and have laptop docks
really Windows 8 is ushering a crazy new
era of device thing that's going to
continue will see new yoga models and
tablets that have all kinds of crazy
ways to hide their keyboard or take the
tablet side off I think it should be a
pretty cool thing to see next automotive
really have taken a bigger part of CES
we're going to see a lot from the
automotive world how technology can
integrate into the cards whether or not
I thought onymous driving for example
see a lot of luxury vehicles Audi's had
a really big presence there as well the
new ford fusion was announced there i
believe two years ago
so a lot of car technology is going to
be there I think major auto
manufacturers trying to look at CES is a
great platform to launch new cars next
home automation becoming a really big
thing like we're gonna see a huge push
behind that to really maintain your
whole home from your smartphone or
tablet or really from any website you
know I'm visioning a world where you
walk down to your kitchen lights turn on
coffee maker starts going TV clicks on
or maybe got a tablet in the wall that
starts showing you your newspaper
whatever it might be that's kind of why
I'm envisioning near the future Enox
futures coming very very very soon of
course we'll see a ton of phones that'll
get a noun sound like we're gonna see a
real big jump to octo-core quite yet
again we might see some screens and I
think there might be some little tiny
news about battery improvements which
I'm hoping will make their way into new
phones of course Gorilla Glass usually
announces their new screens as well take
