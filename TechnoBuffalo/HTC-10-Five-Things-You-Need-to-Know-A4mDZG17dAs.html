flagged your phone from HTC but in the
past month they've been training
sharpening their skills to bring us the
latest the HTC 10 we're still testing
the device for our full review but I
thought I'd share with you guys five
things to know about the upcoming HTC 10
so let's start with number five the
camera the HTC is severely up - their
camera game to compete with some of the
best in the mobile business the ultra
pixel 2 camera now packs a 12 megapixel
sensor with an F 1.8 aperture it's gonna
translate to a hundred and thirty five
percent more light than the outgoing one
m9 also fun competitive fact they got
the same DxO mark score of 88 at the
galaxy s7 got which makes it tied for
the best camera on the market they also
now have a front facing five megapixel
camera with optical image stabilization
so you got oh is on the front OS on the
back not to mention there's no laser
autofocus on the rear number four they
really tried to reduce blow wear which I
for one appreciate they worked
hand-in-hand with Google to keep it
close to stock eliminating duplicate
apps for example Google Photos now
supports Raw so no need for Zephyr HTC
gallery but HTC did keep the apps they
think are better than Google's but you
can decide whether or not you agree
number three HTC is always in a queue or
job with their audio but now boom sound
high five speakers are here you got a
tweeter up top based on the bottom the
tweeter faces you in the bass shoots
downward HTC is cleaning will have and I
quote unprecedented audio clarity on a
smart phone
you'll get richer mono but it's not
stereo sound just bear that in mind
HTC also says its headphones or high
quality in the software will upscale
audio to 24-bit which is more bits than
usual again
number two free style layout it's kind
of a cool approach from HTC you can
choose the background that apply
stickers that are going to be there just
as icon something that's kind of cool
for kids out of something that's going
to be a long-term home screen option but
it's neat to have something different
and number one brand new accessories the
HTC ICU case is really cool we've got
one in the office we've been testing and
it works very well
it's like dot view but we more
high-resolution it's basically a super
fine pass through screen your three
messages pick up calls launch a camera
with two swipes down single finger it
also now alleviates you need to open up
the case and you don't need
and one thing I hate its opening up
cases but I don't don't need to and also
war there's a lot to like about the HTC
10 as we prepare for our full review let
us know what you want us to cover please
give the video a thumbs up we always
appreciate it
till next time I am generating from
technical Buffalo I'll see you guys the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
