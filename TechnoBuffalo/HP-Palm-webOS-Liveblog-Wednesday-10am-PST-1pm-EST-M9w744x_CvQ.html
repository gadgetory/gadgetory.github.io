in just a minute going to take off this
jacket put on my official TechnoBuffalo
professional blogging sweatshirt and I'm
going to San Francisco meet John over at
fort mason for the big HP event you know
I don't even know if we're going to see
this word on a gadget anymore palm well
we do know is we're going to see new
stuff from them the new version of webos
running on I'm pretty sure we're going
to see both smartphone and tablet form
factors possibly hopefully more than one
of each also a bunch of talk about some
educational stuff which would be really
cool I think that's a place where HP
could really make some inroads actually
with webos education traditionally you
know when an apple stronghold then we do
it a lot with education lately and I
used to work in schools you might not
know this i used to be a teacher on a
school IT guy and windows is tough to
administer in a school environment
anyway you didn't want to hear about
that what you want to hear is what's
going on the event I'm saying there may
be some educational stuff but you know
smartphones tablets whatever it is
Johnny are going to be there we're going
to be live-blogging it starting we're
going to you know probably start up
around quarter of 10 this is pacific

hands on impressions with whatever it is
