Apple unveiled the exact same looking
Apple watch series too we had too much
coverage on it here because I didn't
think it was that exciting I've been
switching for the past three months
between an iPhone 7 plus and the pixel
and when I use the iPhone I've got an
Apple watch cheers to that I'm just kind
of wanted to try so figured I'd share my
opinions on it and we didn't do an
unboxing went into review I kind of
ignored it because I thought that was
kind of blob but having actually used
one have my opinions changed I'm asking
to myself or annoying the answer and you
couldn't tell my general answer is still
the same feeling I had on the original
Apple watch shrug shrug emoji is kind of
what it is I went in with its big
expectations ticking okay you watch more
powerful I'm gonna use third-party apps
they're gonna load crazy fast on here
brighter screen it's got some
waterproofing in it I can go swimming I
can bathe my son I'm jazzed for the new
iPhone I put on my wrist I use it
exactly the same way I use the last gen
me to use of notifications tell the time
and to try and close my rings
so I remind me to get up and get up and
walk that's the extent that I personally
use the wearable an apple sold like 5
million of these things last quarter so
I might be in the minority people are
obviously buying these things in droves
because they're using them for something
I think a hard time they're seeing what
they're really useful for I'm saying
that fully aware of the the irony I
think it's probably the right word I'm
using one while I'm saying I don't see
much for purpose to it but do you guys
see much of a use for your wearables I
do like the waterproofing that is
definitely come in handy I'll screw
forget the gutter on and suck my hand at
the bath water fills up and it's cool
how the water ejects at first I thought
my watch was a little judging reminded
me to stand up and tell me to breathe
but then I started to appreciate it
started calling me fat and then I got a
little mad at it but at least for the
most part I've liked those kind of
applications that it can do I don't use
any third-party apps in fact when I try
use third-party apps despite them being
loaded directly on the watch they launch
extremely
slow so by the time I could just do this
find the app I want and then open it up
I could just take out my phone and
that's really true for a lot of things
here I do use it though when big pause
of use for me is if I want to play music
in the car and I'm using Apple music
using my phone and I say hey Siri I'm
Tala desk activated probably ton of
phones there's always work on the iPhone
but hold it up to my wrist and saying
that same command they won't do it twice
is much more responsive this bigger
phones better on it but I really don't
answer many calls on my watch I don't
unlock my computer with it for me it's
not worth reading 70 bucks thinking
about getting an Apple watch I still
recommend going for the first gen the
series of 1 I guess you get that for a
way bigger discount and get almost
exactly the same experience save for for
waterproofing and some little brightness
issues on the screen so that was my
Apple watch I guess to review thoughts
ramblings it's still mad I think save
your money
save them for put it away for school buy
buy a stocks take take hit your lady
friend your gentleman friend out for a
nice dinner that'll probably give you
much more rewarding experience than
you're going to get dropping through the
70 bucks minimum on an Apple watch
expensive
that's like Apple tax times for so let
me read you guys think one of your
thoughts on it before and though I do
want to give a shout out to the comment
of the day and this one might be one of
my favorite comments ever from Christian
P I commented on the what I've been
waiting for for cool things coming this
month a little excited that video I was
geeking out about some tech and I always
made a comment that people think I'm
high on something and I said I'm not I'm
just high on life and Christian said
jenna is the last person anyone with
respect to be smoking something I mean
it's look at the guy he's a walking
advertisement for dad sweaters at first
I was like hey man
f off and then I looked down I was like
all right Christian P I feel you
so his LinkedIn channel will be down
below if you guys want to be featured in
upcoming comments today it's pretty
obvious bro bro you comment I just watch
sausage party last night
that was my my douche impression thank
