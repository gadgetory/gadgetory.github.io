folks from revision3 are near

Buffalo question live from VidCon we're
gonna bring in some special guests to
help us answer it first question comes
from user Josh who asks what is the best
game you've played on the iOS platform
let's breaking special guest number one
it's in a common here ask question you
might recognize the guy we've got mark
watson we've missed her soldierknowsbest
what's the best game you played on iOS
up on the best game i'll say i play it
was part of a spider man total mayhem
came bought up came out about a year and
a half ago so the game is awesome i love
it and they want to check out you did a
review on it right yeah i did i do so go
check that out soldierknowsbest calm
click on the youtube link I get some
more assets do like my awful lavalier
and Mike that reason we're doing this a
rig on the go kind of thing oh yeah
alright so special guest number two
who's gonna help us enter the question
we have mr. tymoss patellas iphone help
i'd have to say angry birds i'm like
stuck on that game if i play any game my
phone that's angry birds any particular
version of angry birds angry birds rio
lately on the flight here i was playing
area
I kind of skipped over seasons I didn't
play that one but first Angry Birds I
sit there and played that thing until I
finished I about finished it up Angry
Birds rear on the flight over here like
the whole time played it chocolate end
up for me i'm gonna show my my inner
nerd words with friends I can't stop
playing Scrabble most importantly I
can't stop cheating at words with
friends oh no I mean Danny my friends
who are watching this I've never cheated
alright so our next question with our
special guest comes from user Nikita
Corman oov who asks I know a lot of
you've been asking this question is
there point in purchasing lion lines
were getting a lot of flack recently or
should we stay with snow leopard toilets
are with you this time I love line so
far it's just made it like so much
easier to like switch from desktops do
like multitasking more it just works
perfectly i definitely say for 30 books
like an easy upgrade so thumbs up for
lying even though some of the speeds
have been a little bit slower cebu yeah
is that like Micah care I was like I
just got it and I was like super fast
computer I'm ready to do this and then
boot it up and it's like super low to
the log in slow to the login screen
that's what I didn't like but other than
that like except for the flash issues
I've been having some issues of flash
it's updated line but other than that I
love it have you got any crashes no
actually I haven't run into any I just
it's worked fun other than the flash
bugs is that crash on me twice in a week
which it never happened to Snow Leopard
what so mark what do you think I think
line is good I think I mean it's not
something if you just need to upgrade
because you're missing out on a whole
bunch like some necessary things but for
thirty bucks is gonna be a upgrade I
think everybody gonna do 30 yeah 30
bucks kind of makes a no-brainer we're
looking at like leopard the killer
feature for me was time machine like I
lost so much stuff like be able to have
that there's not that killer feature in
leopard room like so you can get your
icons look like iOS awesome it wasn't
anything that like made it like a
must-have before 30 bucks you know if
you have 30 bucks to pretty decent value
proposition actually now that I think
about it I did have chrome crashed on me
which is like the first time really ever
Google did it on purpose I mean scratch
on me before but it's like I've never
really noticed chrome like I can't
remember how I did it but I've never
noticed it crash like that and like lose
everything that's what i did cuz you not
normally like you able to recover
everything I couldn't recover anything
and I had a bunch of tabs open so that
I don't knowingly I don't know I'm not
wake up from sleep yeah sucks i'm not
gonna blame that / reset any other any
other problems other than that no you
know you can read the comment for now
saying you won't have that on windows 7
oh yeah yeah you see I'm scrolling right
down down below alright my face door
we're walking down the halls of VidCon
our next question comes from Danielle
Briana's who asked should I wait for the
Wii U or should I get a ps3 CS we don't
know an official date for the wii u it's
probably not coming until next year at
least they said it's not coming up 2012
at that point to ps3 we're going to be
probably pretty close to a ps4 I think
you're better off if gaming is your
thing you can jump on the wii u i think
your best bet though is going to be to
wait for the ps4 you may have to wait an
extra year to get some extra life out of
your we buy a couple new controllers i
think your best bet to wait for the ps4

our next question comes from rick be who
asked john are you seriously going to
get a blackberry bold 9900 when it's
announced and released how do you think
it will stack up against the industry
yes i am definitely going to get a
blackberry bold 9900 or the 9930 on the
cdma side so if your sprint or verizon
essentially it's the blackberry form
factor most people have been waiting for
the bold form factor with an awesome
touchscreen and finally a modern
processor so we got one point two
gigahertz processor in there you've got
blackberry OS 7 which is going to be
great you're going to have all the
liquid graphics ftv expected and all the
goodness from blackberry like the email
is really going to be outstanding so I'm
looking forward to not only that but you
get a full keyboard and i am using
phones with full keyboards right now i'm
rockin HTC status and that's what I'm
going to use so I'm going go ahead and
do a little ballad to the keyboard I'm
gonna go ahead and sing it up here
singing a love song prop it up keyboard
you know i love you i would cheat on you
sometimes i go virtual but there's
nothing like touching your sweet sweet
buttons that I enjoy more so keyboard
the songs for you keyboard keyboard you
never make me bored can't play the piano
but that won't stop me from trying I
don't mean thing I'm sorry I cannot sing
