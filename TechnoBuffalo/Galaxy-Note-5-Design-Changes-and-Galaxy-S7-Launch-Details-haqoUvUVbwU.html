to you by harry's and what's going on
guys a mark in Sangin from TechnoBuffalo
and on today's episode of rumor roundup
we'll be talking about the galaxy note5
the future of Apple's iPhone and the
Galaxy s7 this is rumor anup so let's go
ahead and get started the galaxy note5
is likely just a few months away and
thanks to a steady stream of leaks
samsung's upcoming phablet isn't much of
a mystery anymore according to a chinese
site CQ the galaxy note5 will take a
similar strategy as the galaxy s6 that
means a sleek design would wireless
charging but no expandable storage and a
non-removable battery the device will
apparently also support us bc as its
standard charging port other room
respects for the galaxy note5 includes a
new ex you know 7422 processor a 5.9
8-inch 2k display a huge 4100 milliamp
battery and an upgraded s-pen the new
report also notes that Samsung likely
won't release an edge variant for the
note but that's not much of a surprise
either instead the company's likely to
announce a super-sized galaxy s6 edge+
with beefed up specs and 5.5 inch
displays sometime this summer it's
possible the two devices could debut at
the same time maybe the September at IFA
earlier this week we saw one sketchy
rumor claimed that Apple was working on
an iphone without a physical home button
and that the company was already
developing a new technology that could
replace the physical home button with a
virtual sensor built into the display
now a second report from Apple Insider
has surfaced to back up those claims
citing a source from who has proven
reliable in the past the Apple focused
blog notes that Apple really is working
on a buttonless iPhone however the
device probably won't arrive at least
until 2017 and that's also how long you
have to wait until the next fast in a
furious movie the report also notes that
Apple might be able to ditch its home
button even sooner if it wasn't for
touch ID the company's fingerprint
reader needs to find a new home and for
now it's unclear where it will go but
according to earlier rumors Apple is
developing some sort of chip that would
make it possible to embed a biometric
sensor right inside the touchscreen but
Apple Insider wasn't able to confirm
that detail now with Apple can figure
out a solution we might see a home
button free iPhone in just a few short
years I'm hopeful by the time the iphone
7s comes out
we'll finally see it come true so the
blast rumor of the day goes to Samsung
yet again the galaxy s6 isn't even a
year old yet but it could be out data
before the years up the Galaxy s7 won't
launch until early next year at least
that's what we all assume based on
Samsung's recent history however it
turns out the company may have plans to
release a new phone even sooner
according to a new rumor out of China
the report claims that the Galaxy s7
wall arrived two or three months early
suggesting it can launch near the end of
this year Samsung is apparently speeding
up its entire product cycle in an effort
to better compete with Apple we're not
really sold on this explanation just yet
but if the galaxy note5 were to release
a month before its usual September
timeframe that could kick off samsung
strategy for its flagship lineup
regardless it's way too soon to know
anything about the galaxy s7 with any
certainty but if there is any major news
we'll be sure to keep you guys in a loop
over at TechnoBuffalo calm so before we
end this video I want to thank our
friends over at Harry's shaving can be
quite expensive nowadays but fortunately
our friends over at Harry's can hook you
