unboxing for you of the live speaker
portable speaker system for your ipod
ipod touch iphone and ipod classic all
those different models this will run you
$85 i'll put a link up in the sidebar
it's actually gotten very good reviews
i'm excited to use it take a look at the
box got a picture of device on top live
speaker on the side some info on the
back of it how you can arrange it and
some more info on the other side here
compatible with like i said iphone
iphone 3g ipod touch ipod classic or
ipod touch 3g it says on there that's
actually very funny so you can see that
ipod touch 3g perhaps they mean second
generation ipod touch and it says grab
your tunes create a cinematic experience
keep in touch loud and clear let's go
ahead and crack these suck is open under
the plastic alright and wow very crunchy
plastic right there it looks like now
this is open up here you just slide down
there's a little seal right there
actually go ahead and cut break that
this comes up on top opens right up
there's some nice kind of cushion here
got some more pictures of device on the
top zoom out just a little bit take off
the cushion instruction manual for the
live speaker and take a look at that
later like here is the device itself
especially very compact put that off to
the side see what else comes in here
pull up that tray we've got a power
source
let's let's see if that's the standard
USB yep just a standard USB wall charger
it's always nice to have these handy
looks like it's got a little indicator
like right there comes with a nice
little carrying case felt there is a USB
cable to mini USB so must have a mini
USB port on the device itself for
charging which is very nice they use the
standard and let's take a look at you
live speaker itself really is actually
quite small put that down right there
let's do a quick size comparison so you
guys can see how big it is since meant
for the ipod on the iphone do a
comparison here with the iphone can see
size-wise it's actually very small
relatively compact supposedly packs a
very loud punch for these tiny speakers
so i'm looking forward to using it let's
go ahead and put the iphone in and see
what it sounds like alright so just slid
the iphone in that little bracket here
you actually you can hold it in two
different modes do it like this like a
show on the pictures or you can turn off
to the side it's got a little stand in
the back so you can prop it up and
listen and this I assume plugs right
into the top so actually is quite handy
just goes right into the 3.5 millimeter
jack anyway I will use it and let you
guys know what I think of is a
worthwhile investment certainly looks to
be very compact nice alternative for for
parties or something if you just need
some tunes bumpin anyway this is jon
rettinger with an unboxing for you of
the live speaker stick around for the
full review and for exclusive content be
