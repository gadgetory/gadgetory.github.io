to you by shutterstock.com welcome back
to another episode of rumor roundup the
show we take all the tech rumors from
the week and we round them up into one
tasty tech morsel for you of this week
we're going to talk about apple
reportedly testing new TV designs Google
now might be coming to Chrome the
blackberry 10 series handset gets teased
on video and there's a chance just a
chance that Apple maps might suck a
little bit less this is rumor roundup
let's go and get started alright so
let's start with the tech rumor that
just won't die in it comes to Apple when
there's smoke there's usually fire the
last Apple rumor that persisted for
years is the ipad mini and we all know
how that one turned out so now we've got
the Apple TV not the little black box
that sits next your television an actual
apple television set Apple is reportedly
already working with Asian suppliers and
a bit to test out several of its TV
designs The Wall Street Journal gotta
respect them reported on Wednesday Apple
CEO Tim Cook recently said the TV
interview that TV is an intense area of
interest for Apple it's like my team
quick impression but didn't delve much
deeper into whether or not the company
was actually building a set obviously
one source hold the news outlet the TV
is still in an early stage of testing
and isn't even a formal project yet even
though Apple has been building
prototypes for years we think it's about
to happen eventually at some point the
late Steve Jobs biography by Walter
Isaacson suggested that he discovered a
way to change the living room which
immediately suggested an apple was
indeed ready to build its own television
set analyst and pundits and everybody
suggested the device will feature Siri
integration and I'll break the current
mold is focused on set-top boxes and
jiggly jiggly remotes The Wall Street
Journal said Apple is working with sharp
for the display technology and hone high
for manufacturing Hoenn high currently
builds Apple's iPhone an iPad product so
it does make sense are we going to see
an Apple TV no doubt they've got the set
all ready to go but what good is a TV
set if doesn't have the content to go on
it so i think that's we've been holding
up Apple the crazy thing about Apple TV
though isn't just getting licensing
deals in the US they want to sell it
over
certainly every other country you have
to negotiate new licensing deals for new
content with new cable providers or new
content producers that's gonna be a very
very tricky thing to think of others a
crazy rumor to that Apple was gonna make
some weird 3d technology but put that
one to rest and I think we'll see an
apple TV yes I say 2013 we will see an
apple TV but at this point everybody's
just guessing alright so let's go from
apple to apples very bestest friend in
the world google google now is allegedly
coming to chrome i love google now i
think it's one of the best voice
assistants going debuted with jelly bean
and come out on jellybean part two I
know a google now is probably going to
migrate to chrome newly discovered code
suggest implementation on desktop seems
like a pretty natural step for the
excellent service it makes it more
accessible to those who are currently
using the system imagine just talking to
your computer computer what's the
weather and then it tells you the
weather you can make a computer tell you
jokes to dakotas recently discovered in
the chromium project code site and hence
that skeleton for google now
notifications are being worked on for
the popular browsers auditions to just
talking and getting all kinds of stuff
back to a google search of course Google
now that you've access to all those cool
cards telling you how long it takes you
get home I your sports team just did and
all kinds of other cool stuff so for
weather traffic reports birthday lurdes
etc your browser is going to keep you
up-to-date with everything that's going
on personally I would love to see
automatic traffic reporting every
evening before driving home even though
I live like literally three miles away
but everybody doesn't live that far away
it's going to be a super awesome thing
to have the search giant and the
statement to cnet hinted act
experimenting with new features in
chrome but said it doesn't have anything
to announce quite yet so building blocks
are in place but they're not building on
them quite yet the great addition and
like Google now on the mobile handsets
you to choose to use it or not use it
it's nice to have more option any time
you give the consumer choice we all win
what do you think Google now on a
browser excited not excited but what do
you think I like to hear from you
alright so we've gone from the big boys
talked about Apple talked about Google
what about the former king of the hill
rim and Blackberry we've been hearing
blackberry 10 for years now it's finally
almost hear the end of January we should
be finally seeing the first blackberry
handset speed off the wait till then
310 l-series handset got a video tour
out of where else Vietnam it seems to be
where all of the leaks come from we saw
the iphone 5 get leaked out of Vietnam
and a lot of new device that are out the
past few years have gotten leaks out of
Vietnam and I gotta say it looks pretty
good I'm pretty excited about blackberry
10 I'm willing to put aside any opinions
i had about rim and the previous
operating system and give them a fresh
start based on the QNX platform it looks
to be really robust multitasking is
pretty awesome and it's kind of the
spiritual successor ton of my favorite
operating systems webos so I'm excited I
hope that RINs got enough juice in the
tank help developers flock to it hope we
get a really nice a third or fourth
option I want to come see mobile
platforms let me take a mint thank our
friends and sponsors at shutterstock.com
so shutterstock comms need place to go
we're looking for stock photos vectors
illustrations and video clips even sign
up for large image packs and monthly
subscriptions are just grab a single
image for a blog or mock-up they even
offer enhanced license access in case
you want to print an image or get it
screened out of t-shirt like my face on
a t-shirt if you guys run a blog you're
gonna youtube channel you're constantly
from the need for stock images or stock
videos shutterstock calm is a great way
to go shutterstock comics it's pretty
easy to curate your own galleries to
make searching easier and you can
download any image any size alpha one
price not conduct on down yet for the
high res stuff so head on over to
shutters calm or install their ipad app

your offer code techno 12 get thirty
percent off any package again I'll perko
techno 12 two percent off eat your
images we get credit everybody's happy
thanks so do you live in Australia and
your government told you not to use
Apple maps if you tried to use Apple
maps find the Brooklyn Bridge just get
anywhere I know certainly Apple maps is
improving day by day by day but it's not
up to the standards and Apple usually
puts further products it looks like
though that might be changing their
allegedly a thirty percent chance apples
going to buy tomtom hon slob which is
kind of an awesome maybe I'm expected to
be like Han Solo but it's a slob that's
funny name analysts with the rabobank
said he believes there's going to be a
thirty percent chance Apple place a bid
on tomtom and thinks to buy could be a
really good
dia because tom tom has ability to make
changes much faster than Apple does
according to Hans Tom Tom needs a cash
from apple an apple needs the know-how
of tomtom slob said in a note obtained
Bob Bloomberg it does make sense sort of
on the outside we think about Apple
invested so much time so much money they
bought a mapping company already to make
a google maps sort of what it is right
now other part doesn't make financial
sense for Apple to do that but tom tom
is well respected abduct great mapping
technology their gps is arguably second
to none would be nice to have that built
into apple maps from get the best of
both worlds so that build versus bison
are you better off building it yourself
or buying it outwardly i think that
we're going to see Apple sort of build
with themselves third percent rumor I
wouldn't put much stock in it there's a
30-percent rumor that we Ralph's gonna
show up wearing a dress tomorrow at work
you heard it thirty percent rumor that
would put much stock in anything like
that so thank you guys for watching
