has been taking chances trying new
things modular phones dual screens and
effort to build up to a culminated as
the latest flagship from LG the g6 is a
brand-new design language for the Korean
company and if past history is anything
when a company goes into design language
they've taken features away not true at
the g6 all the things that we love about
smart phones are still here 3.5
millimeter headset jack is here
expandable storage is here great optics
great build quality all are here they
didn't take anything away to offer the
new design and the new design is
absolutely beautiful it seems like a
cross between what we have from HTC that
we've had from Samsung in the past so to
really design centric companies and I
think LG nailed this and it feels really
nice and hand unfortunately you can't
hold the device in your hand just yet
but as someone who's held a lot of
phones it's got a very premium feel to
it one trend I'm happy LG didn't follow
was the thinner thinner fitter with a
sacrifice for battery life they've been
doing what we've been asking for all
along make the phone a little bit
thicker putting a bigger battery and get
rid of the camera humps all those things
are here it's anchored by a 30 300
million power battery and out of the 15
20 minute presentation we had with LG so
it's a good quarter of it talking about
that battery letting us know that
there's room for heat dissipation
letting us know they over tested the
battery essentially letting the world
know this battery is safe the screen I
think is one of the biggest stories with
LG they said they wanted to be one of
the first to market with an 18 by 9
aspect ratio on their device and that's
sort of a weird thing to say it's two to
one and it looks really tall but it
surprisingly fits in the hand nicely due
to almost edge to edge design with no
bezels on the left or the right you can
think of it almost like having two
square screen another real estate up
above the best way I can illustrate this
is in the camera you open it up you've
got a typical viewfinder with a lot of
controls if you want to go down that
route but also you've got your gallery
on left-hand side not just a little
circle where you can go your gallery you
can see more information on the screen
that's something that LG is really
pushing and of course when you're
watching videos you can expand to take
up the full screen and for watching
anything that's Dolby vision or HDR 10
it's going to look gorgeous because this
phone supports both of those we got a
little daredevil action while watching
this versus an iPhone you can really see
the difference on the screen so LG did
seal the battery in they did it for a
good reason they've added ip68 here and
we tested it in the shower simulator so
if you take your phone in the shower
you're good if you drop to the toilet
you're good it worked really well
LG also mentioned that you could charge
the phone wirelessly since it is Chi and
PMA enabled even when the phone is wet
in all honesty I didn't ever think to
wirelessly charge my phone while it was
wet but it works on the LG g6 the
cameras on the back sit flush which
feels feels good to say and they're both
13 megapixel sensors on the front you've
got a really wide angle 100 degree 5
megapixel camera the memories can be
available is 32 gigs but expandable four
gigs of ram on board that brings us to
one of the potential drawbacks of the g6
the Snapdragon 820 1 chip which is
certainly very powerful chip in its own
right but it's not the Snapdragon 835
that we're gonna see a lot of phones
come out with this year also on board is
Qualcomm's fast charge 3.0 so the screen
is 5.7 inches with an 18 by 9 aspect
ratio which I can't figure out why I
don't just call it two to one but it's
qhd+ the resolution of 2880 by 1440 LG
was really proud of the relationship
with Google this phone is running
Android 7.0 with Google assistant
built-in so if you've been holding out
for a film that could rock Google's
latest AI you are going to be set LG G Y
is also here they simplified a lot of
things out of it that's actually pretty
elegant it was easy to use and learn but
of course we don't like it got the
option just throw in a launcher on I
didn't get a chance to test things like
the speakers but we get the phone back
in the office oh I'll be sure to let you
know how that performs and if you guys
want to see some camera samples I did
get a chance to snap a few in fact our
gallery of the g6 narvik elan ii of
buffalo comm was shot with a g6 one
check those out will link to them down
below so if you're in the market for a
new phone you haven't considered LG in
the past now's a really good time to do
so they've learned a lot with the v10
the beech pointing to g5 and the
culmination is a really powerful great
looking great feeling g6 an LG listened
to the customers they gave people what
they wanted they gave us little thicker
device with a
battery life it's not going to have any
overheating issues feels great in the
hand no camera humps the phone looks and
feels premium is it a buy for you leave
in the comments down below and let us
know what you think what's your favorite
feature of the LG G six what is it
missing that you wish it had let us know
we'll start replying to comments and
have a discussion about the latest from
LG get the video a thumbs up we
certainly appreciate it until next time
