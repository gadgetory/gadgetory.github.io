to you by the National Highway Traffic
Safety Administration what's up everyone
John render from TechnoBuffalo here and
welcome back my friend to another
episode of ask the Buffaloes to show you
can ask me any question you've gotten
from the technology and sometimes
outside but this week it's all about
tech we're going to talk about the
upcoming HTC One m9 what I want to see
from CES and what could be coming very
soon and a lot of other tech questions
in between this is s the Buffalo so I
get started first question comes from
Twitter ads person singing s at John for
lakers what you want to see during CES
2015 what I want to see these big Park
announcement start coming back but I
doubt we're going to see that like the
old days I like to see trends in the
industry that are actually going to be
relatively useful we've seen trends like
curved TV is that I still have yet to
see utility behind I'm hoping we're
gonna say things like battery technology
is going to be showcased wireless
charging technology is going to be
showcased next generation of home
connectivity will be showcase things
like that they're going to sort of
dictate sort of help us live our tech
lives of the next five to ten years what
I'd love to see come out of it next one
comes from at nick's Cal underscore GE
underscore at john for lakers the new
HTC I'm aspects being leaked is a 1080p
screen resolution surprise you or just
for better battery life so let me just
recap here the French blog nowhere else
revealed they're claiming are the specs
for the upcoming HTC One m9 codenamed
kima or hi MA so the specs according to
them and again just rumors this point
5-inch 1080p screen snapdragon 810 three
gigs ram and lolli pop right out of the
box most surprising though is that they
could come early next month so different
some guess the question is 1080p which
is qhd i know i'm in the minority here
but I've yet to see a qhd screen that
looks better than a good 1080p screen a
lot of people disagree with me on that
so it's not surprising but certainly are
two schools of thought and again I know
I'm in the minority on
if you're looking at sort of the next
generation specs phone I think
anything's got a Snapdragon 810 can be
sort of qualified at this point as
next-gen you want next-gen specs from
top to bottom and that includes qhd
whether or not I person it's a utility
behind it consumers are going to want
that in a device and I can understand
that if I was buying a phone that's
gonna last me another you know 12 18 24
months I would probably want that qhd
screen in there so I think it's going to
hamper it we are creating rooms oh there
might be a prime burge that will
presumably have all that kind of stuff
crammed into it we don't know HTC's
going to do it the camera of ultrapixels
are gonna stick around if they're going
to go just for a 12 14 16 megapixel
shooter built right in so we don't know
a lot of things about this device coming
should have next generation of sense
built-in of course we're just sitting on
top of now Android lollipop so we should
see some more information though
hopefully the next couple weeks in
couple months stop the questions real
fast just to give an important notice
I'm not talking about bones or tablets
here and talking about your safety with
New Year's coming up do not drink and
drive that's doesn't selling something
that you should even need to say it
should be just as innate and you like
breathing and going to the bathroom
because I know you do but if you've had
anything to drink do not go in a car and
also friend said something to drink
don't go to car with him or her it is
not worth it call a cab call an uber
call a lift call your parents call your
friends call her grandma somebody will
come pick you up that has not been
drinking it is a stupid thing to do you
see thousands and thousands of lives
every year just foolishly lost from that
especially again with new years coming
up just be safe next question comes from
my friend David DeFranco who asks at
John for lakers what are your top three
goals for TechnoBuffalo 2015 David first
thank you for asking happy New Year to
you hope you and your family had a nice
holiday so I posted a video last week
about the state of TechnoBuffalo few
haven't seen that video check it out put
a link down below I served you a very
candid look about how our business was
run where revenue comes from we did
right and more importantly I think what
we did wrong in 2014 like to see a few
things happen for technobuffalo first
and see our growth continued from the
video side we see a subscriber growth
around 500 per day my goal is to get
back to 700 subscriber growth poor debt
per day this brings a new people
youtubing second largest search engine
in the world
people that come to YouTube the more
people I go technobuffalo com so that is
sort of goal number one we've increased
our traffic on TechnoBuffalo com by
about a hundred fifty percent each year
since we existed that number gets harder
and harder to hit as the numbers get
larger and larger sets they like us to
see one hundred percent growth in 2015
versus 2014 I also like to see us branch
out our covers a little bit more we've
done some sort of entertainment coverage
as far as how that overlaps the tech
world primarily in the comic book realm
I like the serve I know it's kind of
strange is how comic books and tech
overlap sure the geek culture I would
say it's like the seizure of some more
coverage grow from that standpoint I
like to be able to hire more people so
be able to sort of have the revenue to
do that over the next 12 months are sort
of my goal thank you for asking next one
comes from at the dattara 214 at java
for lakers do you think there's a market
for high-end Chromebooks like the pixel
the very simple answer to that question
is no there is a very finite amount of
consumers I think are looking to
purchase a Chromebook upwards of twelve
hundred dollars I do not think that's
going to be a mass-market appeal you can
buy many tablets that can do very
similar things for much less I think
we're Chromebooks are going to find
their niche where they are funding the
niche is in the lower cost market may be
a two to four hundred dollar possibly
six hundred dollar at a max realm where
you can get access or the great service
that Chromebooks can offer they're
having to pay a lot of money a lot of
people trying to use them now as laptop
replacements so I can see why the
thought then getting more expensive
might be there but they're still missing
poor features of mainstay OS like
Windows or like OS 10 then I think about
people would need to justify spending
that money so nice screen aside that
pixel definitely add a gorgeous screen I
do not see that getting any sort of
mainstream penetration anytime soon you
guys for watching hope you enjoy it we
take a hiatus from acid buffalo for next
week we're going to be at CES covering
all kinds of technologies of course
