anything but what it's going to mean is
I'm going to pick a random email that I
got not having seen it before just pick
it at random from mailbox try to answer
for you guys depending on what it is so
let's pick the first one all right the
first one is from user crackers e-tech
boy 1993 the question title question for
you is hey okay I have a 12 megapixel
camera right now and I make videos from
that my videos have crap quality and in
your videos you have crazy quality what
do you use and my webcam is the same
crap quality when the webcam just came
out thanks first thing I tell you is you
should return the webcam second thing is
I'm not using anything fancy I'm using
the built-in isight on my macbook pro
just happens to look that good or I
haven't galactic disk in just has really
good quality on the webcam happens to
look great on YouTube videos so that's

is a macbook pro and he says hey John my
name is blank I'm the student heading to
my first year university and really
excited about getting a macbook pro but
I'm sure which one is best for me almost
like i'll be using the macbook pro for
word processing internet browsing
nothing too high tech many concern is
the 2.5 gigahertz the extra 50 gigabyte
hard drive and a 512 megabyte nvidia
geforce is it worth dictor 500 over the
2.4 while i notice a difference since
your time i hear from you soon p guys
keep the videos rolling um dude save the
money you will not notice difference
between 2.4 2.5 at all when i bought my
computer i totally overbought save the
cash for going to college save it for
beer money I think the 2.4 2.5 is a
negligible you know different senility
talk about though your video card too
but again unless you're doing some heavy
3d rendering I don't think it
really going to gonna be an issue for
you let's take a few more to go to the

choice between the black or the white I

finger print T as you can see I just
