technobuffalo here the Super Bowl was on
Sunday and as biggest spectacle as the
game was the advertising is becoming its
own thing the commercials get analized
scrutinized as much as the players on
the field so I want to talk about the
commercials talk a little bit about the
game and see what they're not you would
have greenlit the tech commercials that
aired let's go to get started so each
30-second spot of the Super Bowl costs
four million bucks that ain't cheap and
you figure if you're a tech company and
you want to make a big splash 34 million
dollars is a ton of cash is it worth a
while it's yet to be seen one day I
never understood though with these giant
huge commercials obviously they're great
for brand recognition people that might
not know your brand are gonna see it
millions and millions and millions of
people are watching the Super Bowl but
if you actually want to move product I
always thought it's better to go to the
people i can actually influence that can
actually show you what a product looks
like you can actually see how to buy it
sort of the big debate between old media
and new media new media sort of being
online an old media being print
television and radio the Super Bowl is
really one of the last bastions of old
media but ok let's say you're working
for a company and you want to figure out
which commercials gonna be best for your
brand let's run through demo let's start
with amy poehler's best buy commercial
hi may answer any questions what's the
hexa difference between all the
commercial hecky not like Amy Poehler I
love Parks and Rec I loved run Saturday
Night Live think you actually did a
really good job it's been no secret that
best buy has been hurting they've really
been trying to sort of get their brand
back up if rumors they might be going
back to be private I think this actually
did a really nice job or mining people
at hey you can buy stuff not on Amazon
you can also go to our store and not
just check them out but you can purchase
products there you should do that Oh Go
Daddy also made a huge splash as I do
every year and with godaddy you know
what sells they brought in bar rafaeli
to make out with the service
stereotypical nerd and I think everybody
sort of had that awkward moment they're
like was that casting session like so
for your
we got to make out a supermodel life
stuff so things got a little bit
squirrelly with the samsung ad what are
you doing here samsung wants me to be in
their new like samsung's next bit they
knit announced a new product but they
brought in Seth Rogen and Paul Rudd the
sort of just riff it for a while and
they went for about a minute and a half
so you're thinking you know 12 million
ish bucks for it they weren't showing a
new product it wasn't the galaxy s4 or
the Galaxy Note 3 which is for the brand
as a whole I don't know if Samsung
really needed any more brand recognition
because they got selling phones left and
right but they definitely did do it and
it certainly got a lot of buzz and
there's an extended version online it
goes on for five minutes got Bob
Odenkirk in it if you guys watch
breaking bad you know exactly who I'm
talking about he's pretty famous from a
while ago but it was a really
interesting commercial I don't think
it's a really effective though did great
and now let's talk about blackberry
don't call him rim if you are barely
staying alive releasing a new product
those to save your company your
commercial better be freaking incredible
and the blackberry commercial totally
fizzed out now instead of spending 30
seconds showing you something cool the
funk do focusing on a new feature
showing you what it looked like showing
you a brand new UI they spent 30 seconds
showing you what the phone can't do
there's no promise for the commercial
what the phone can't do yeah I mean for
my money what is that the phone can't be
Android or iOS but they didn't want to
go that way they just showed stuff the
phone can't do a silly it made no sense
and educate consumers I don't think it
made anybody more excited for blackberry
especially spending that kind of crazy
scrilla you figured they'd be more
careful what they're doing so I'm
thinking being as part of new media if I
wanted to put a commercial out I think
I'd be much better going to someone who
could go online obviously I'm a little
bit biased not only with the online
world can you see who's buying stuff you
can track clicks and all that kind of
thing but it's much easier and much less
expensive to go on the superbowl maybe
five to ten percent of the people are
demographic certainly you're helping
with recognition for your name brand but
you have no idea how effective it is if
they're buying based on what you said
I didn't you can track trends later on
and see if spikes go up and your charts
change over all things aren't really
that quantifiable so that was pretty
interesting so the folks at Adobe were
like hey I kind of greeth use they got
adobe marketing cloud I put together
kind of a cool commercial the animals
talk and sort of typical almost Super
Bowl ask uh commercial hey are you
shooting a spot for the big game yeah
yeah yeah totally you yep can you
believe they spend millions of dollars
on these things for what 30 seconds all
right oh yeah yeah hey can you believe
how much money they're spending we could
just go online you could go to youtube
you go to facebook and go to Twitter and
you can almost let as many people know
about your product it can with the Super
Bowl but spend so much less cash why
don't you guys think do you think it's
still great to have these giant super
bowl commercials that are spectacle or
if you're a company are you better off
just going online and if you want to
answer the question you can also enter
for a chance to win one of five two
under dollar gift cards cuz who doesn't
like free stuff links it to be down
below to go with those gift cards also
links gonna be down below to check out
the full animals talking video cute
there's a horse linked both those are
going to be down below have you ever
bought a product based on an ad what was
the ad about that you liked enough to
actually buy the product honestly what
comes to mind for me in movies when I
see a trailer for a movie it's pretty
much an ad Alton time that determines
Vinod I go and see it or not I don't buy
that when your products I don't think
based on the ads but I'm sure if I went
through it to my history I probably do
so you guys buy stuff based on
commercials you see you think they're
effective if you buy stuff based on what
you see online look dear what you guys
think i am jon rettinger and i will see
you next video
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
