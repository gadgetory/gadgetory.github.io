technobuffalo here apple's iphone
conference just ended we got a ton to
talk about there were some surprises
some things we already knew but a lot of
apple goodness so if you miss the
keynote let me tell you everything that
happened so it got started and
predictable fashion with Tim Cook coming
on stage talking about the itunes
festival which I don't even know what a
thing but it's already in its seventh
year it's 39 to music that takes place
in London awesome they talked about
Apple Retail it's growing the new design
for their Stanford store is gonna be
huge then they talked a little bit more
about iOS 7 it's hard to believe it's
been three whole months since it was
unveiled at WWDC talked about all the
features are already knew like parallax
command center and search series new and
improved it can be male so I guess we
knew that but kind of neat new ringtones
were added so now you can get your disc
go on to the party they pretty much has
went through everything about iOS 7
nothing really new quite yet but they
did give us a release date it'll be free
beginning September 18th yay and
speaking of free let's talk about I work
which sometimes I do so all five iwork
apps will be free on iOS for any new
iPad iPhone or 5th generation ipod touch
we don't know if you own a current
generation if you download if it'll be
free will have that information very
soon the heck free products and then we
got on to the main stars of the show the
iphone and Tim Cook came back on stage
and said the iphone 5 was the most loved
iphone 5 ever then they killed it that's
they did their most love child man I'd
to be their second most loved child and
then Phil Schiller came back on stage to
talk about two new iPhone designs who
knew first up predictably is the iphone
5 scene that is the official name they
even poked a little bit of fun at the
leak saying and I quote a few you may
have seen some of these shots on the web
and that's cool but you know they didn't
think it was cool there are like stupid
leaking factories from China sending
these cases out anyway it's going to be
available in green yellow blue pink and
white the design has no seams part lines
or joints then they talked about cases
for the iphone 5 which actually looked
pretty neat they were designed around
the camera and flash while still
allowing the devices color to shine
through the back looks like a connect
for board so you can still see the
device color and sort of contrast with
other new cases which are made of
hard-coated polycarbonate also plastic
inside the iphone 5c they built it with
an all new construction method that uses
reinforced steel structure so spec time
what does the 5c have it's got a 4-inch
Retina Display integrated touch with
full srgb widescreen video powered by
the iphone 5s I'm guess now the 5 c's a6
processor 8-megapixel isight camera with
hybrid IR filter in five-element lens
there is a new FaceTime HD camera that
even takes better shots and low light
it's got a 1.9 micron pixel size LTE 802
11 ABG nn no AC but what about price
blue white pink yellow and green 16 gigs
going to be 99 bucks and 32 gigs is
going to be a hundred ninety-nine bucks
with a two-year deal in those hot new
cases they are going to be 29 bucks and
flows do they care about the environment
the iphone is arsenic-free mercury free
and according to apple android free then
they showed a video and Johnny I've and
his cool Johnny I've accent said and I
quote the all iPhone 5 is beautifully
unapologetically plastic which I don't
know if that matters kind of funny do
they have like phones that are plastic
that apologize next up the iphone 5s
which is kind of cool they claim that is
the most forward-thinking iPhone ever
which kind of sucks for the iphone 5c
that got it out the same day colors it's
got new color is going to be available
in gold silver and Space Gray but where
things get different or what's under the
hood as usually the case with the S
variants being powered by an a7 64-bit
chip the first of any kind 64-bit is
crazy it's got over 1 billion
transistors which is twice as many as
the a6 I OS 7 also been updated to
support 64-bit as well so boo dissolve
the 64-bit pneus mean it means
essentially at CPU and graphics are now
twice as fast to get all technical on
you it runs opengl es 3.0 and then it
was demo time with a new iphone now
you're going to get epic games out there
and
mustard took the stage and announced
infinity blade three of the completion
of the trilogy until the next trilogy I
guess but it does look predictably
awesome the graphics are absolutely
gorgeous it'll be available alongside
the new iphone 5s and then phil schiller
came back on stage we said the a7 has a
surprise it brought its buddy with it
the new m7 which is essentially a motion
coprocessor so it measures motion data
continuously accelerometer gyroscope and
compass support all does all that kind
of stuff sign time your phone moves this
thing is working what it's going to do
those enable a totally new generation of
health and fitness app like the just
announced now a nike+ move yay this all
new processing power what's get a new
battery life it's pretty close to the
same you're going to get 10 hours of 3g
talktime 250 hours of standby time 10
hours of LTE browsing and 40 hours of
music playback which was a lot of music
playback and the next they move to the
camera and it used to be and i quote
that if you take better pictures you
just had to be a better photographer the
new camera has a five element apple
design lens with f 2.2 aperture it's got
fifteen percent larger active sensor
areas so essentially think of it as
ultrapixels but Apple dup figure pixels
make for a better picture Phil says and
HTC says yeah dude we know iOS 7 is
designed to take advantage the new
camera it automatically sets white
balance exposure level and creates a
dynamic local tone map there's a new
flash which we knew about it's going to
be called true tone which supposedly
solves a problem of clashing color
temperatures there over 1000 unique
variations and it'll make skin tone look
more natural which four guys perils need
super awesome also we've got digital
stabilization in their burst mode you
just hold down the shutter button and
get 10 frames per second I'm thanks to
the a7 the phone analyzes all those
burst shots and prevents and presents
rather which one it thinks is the best
we also have slew 120 frames per second
it's capturing HD 720p video at 120
frames you can go in and select which
parts of the video you want normal
speaking in which parts you want slow-mo
which you can do is I'm pretty cool
editing I think with that alright next
what about device protection before you
how to put in a password well apple says
that's so passe what are they calling
this crazy
fingerprint scanner it's called touch ID
which is just a police for they're gonna
scan what's on your hand the sensor is a
hundred and seventy micron spin which I
don't know if in a micron is but I'm
guessing it's super thin it's got a 500
PPI resolution it scans sub-epidermal
skin layers and a 360-degree readability
and Quinton that way I can see you
through the lens and your epidermis is
showing and it's built right into the
home button so essentially around it is
a stainless steel detection ring so I
can detect that your fingers actually on
the button so you don't have to press it
so it's not an LED just stainless steel
ring it goes way beyond unlocking your
phone though which I thought was one of
the coolest things it apple announced
this is built in you can make itunes
purchases by using your fingerprints
authenticate so no more have an enter
password to buy stuff it'll know it's
you based on your favorite printer
something nobody chopped up finger your
hand you're going to be pretty good the
sensor essentially takes a picture of
your fingerprint and analyzes it so all
this hottest what about pricing pricing
stays the same 16 gig 100 99 bucks 32
gigs 299 smackeroo than 60 for the big
debt is going to set you back three
hundred ninety nine dollars also there
are cases but not as cool as a 5c cases
but if you interested they're going to
run you 39 bucks each the iphone 4s is
going to stay in the lineup in 8
gigabyte flavors for free the 5c you'd
be available for pre-order on September
13th and the 5s and 5c will be available
in stores on sep tember 20th it's going
to launch first at least in US Australia
Canada China for the first time France
Germany and a few other countries all
around the world including Japan
Singapore and the UK rest of the world
dota comes sometime in December so a lot
of awesome news a lot of cool things
that were included with a set up roster
fingerprint scanning big emissions for
me it would have loved the larger screen
size but we didn't know that was going
to happen and still no NFC but maybe
that's the big feature for the iphone 6
never too early to start iphone 6 rumors
so what do you guys think I'd love to
hear from you you love the new colors is
it space grey that you want is a gold
that you want I love to hear your
thoughts on it so I see these a person's
compared to tell it to actually look
