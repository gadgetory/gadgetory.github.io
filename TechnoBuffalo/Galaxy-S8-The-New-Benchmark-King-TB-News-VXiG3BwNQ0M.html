Chipotle just to get more more layers to
end up with like a head size burrito
following up some of the latest rumors
that we heard about two weeks ago that
it was going to go to his biggest six
inches wraparound OLED screen and the
physical home but was going to go away
and perhaps there would be a home button
fingerprint scanner built into the
screen which sounds awesome now we know
a little bit more if you think about the
galaxy s eight is going to be because
Samsung's got to bring the Thunder but
not not rush the Thunder this time to
make up for what happened with the note
so we're hearing that it will be S Pen
compatible let's not gonna have the S
Pen tucked inside of it like we've had
with the previous note lines whether or
not the signals the end of the note in
Santa Fe kinda wants to cut their losses
or without you can be in addition to we
don't know yet powering this thing got a
little bit more details so we know the
US variant and other regions are going
to have a Snapdragon 835 which is a
beast but Samsung usually ships their
phones in Asian markets to other regions
with their own home built a casinos
processor and this next-gen is going to
be a beast Samsung got two iterations of
the 88 95 chip there's an M and a V the
higher end is the M and it's going to
have quad core 2.5 gigahertz and a quad
core 1.7 occurred Samsung usually tapes
to quad core chips put them together and
that makes their octa-core well the visa
have quad-core 2.2 gigahertz XE knows m2
and a quad-core 1.7 gigahertz cortex a53
cores octa core chips and two separate
quad cores are incredibly powerful so
things like gaming video processing star
lends me to believe that the camera is
gonna have some crazy tricks up its
sleeve we're also hearing six gigs of
ram will be crammed into the galaxy s 8
which allegedly Oh will come in
different sizes 5.1 and all the way up
to 6 inches is what we're hearing
perhaps even a third version as well
slide it in between so lots of stuff
happening with the s8 if you're holding
out though for an s8 edge you're gonna
be in luck and kinda disappointed so all
phones you grab the edge display so no
more flat s8 they're all going to have a
curve and they're all going to be OLED
so they should be pretty sweet Samsung's
displays are actually awesome should see
these hit some
time around March or April I'm hoping
Samsung takes their time certainly
they're gonna have a few months head
start though on Apple when the iphone 7s
for that but I've ever decide to call it
hits in September so another edition of
TV news i jus wants to share with you
guys some galaxy s 8 news we've been
hearing we get a lot of questions about
this online so the best way is just to
