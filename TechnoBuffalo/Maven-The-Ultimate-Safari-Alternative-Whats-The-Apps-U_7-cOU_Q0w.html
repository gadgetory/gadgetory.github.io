TechnoBuffalo and welcome to the very
first episode of what's the app's a new
app review segment here in TechnoBuffalo
which has a rather fancy name don't you
agree yeah and today we're going to be
taking a look at a safari replacement
for iOS called maven since the beginning
of iOS Apple introduced to the world a
revolutionary little application that
help fortify the bridge between the
desktop experience and the mobile
experience this absurd alone and it
stood the test of time and made trivial
features like pinch to zoom and flick to
scroll something as users have not only
grown to love but have grown to expect
for modern-day devices the app I'm
talking about of course would be Safari
over the years companies and developers
have created and released browser
alternatives such as opera mobile for
iOS although they had nifty features
they've always kind of felt like a
complementary application rather than a
standalone Safari replacement sort of
like a Robin to a Batman this is of
course unless you really like Robin then
you know good onya now the year is 2011
technology has evolved in today there
are many many different Safari
alternatives allowing the user to choose
how they want to experience their mobile
internet one of them is an application
oddly named maven to be honest at first
I was a little hesitant to download
maven mainly because it wasn't free but
still the design of the icon wasn't up
to the standards of its vibrant
competitors but I decided to give it a
shot in men I am so glad I did one of
the reasons why i started browser
hunting was because i wanted to increase
the default font size of safari now
personally I think it's a little bit
small text size and my eyes okay minus a
clases bar but still I think it's a
little small it would be great if Apple
provided an option to increase Afari
text size you know it's just like their
email application to great features of
maven would be the ability to be web
pages in full screen and to control font
sizes granted these features plus many
others such as social sharing and
visible tabs are present in other Safari
alternatives there are some features
unique to this humble browser one of
them would be the jog dial that can be
swiped out from the side there's a jog
dial for brightness and another one for
social sharing and custom book
marks the brightness one is handy for
extended viewing periods but I haven't
really found a need for the social
sharing one another nifty feature would
be reader or readability which
simplifies a text on screen giving you a
more newspaper or magazine experience
it's definitely awesome but it seems to
only work well in singular article pages
the final feature probably the best
thing about maven would be as red
joystick thingy called a trackpad at
first glance it looks like a
ridiculously super tacky feature arm
innocent of the track pads from the
older IBM laptops but the second I used
it the thought that immediately went
through my mind was oh my goodness every
browser no no no every application
should have this thing it eliminates the
need to constantly swipe and scroll all
you have to do is hold and move the
movement it's very smooth and is similar
to the control experience you might get
from games like minigore the only
downside is that it gets a little clunky
when you do want to swipe and scroll
because you might accidentally move it
which happens to me more often than not
I think only after experiencing the app
can you really understand the design of
the icon the red track pad and the jog
dials both unique maven features are
visible on the icon still I think they
could have done a better job but that's
just me something else I should point
out would be that the UI graphics aren't
as slick as a ones found on other
browsers like mercury or even Safari I
don't know maybe it's that brushed metal
look that kind of went away with the
older Mac OS versions a possible
downside to all Safari alternatives
would be that lack of the add to
homescreen feature I love this feature
and I would love to see it for maven but
i understand if it can't be done because
of developing limitations overall for
just 99 cents for both iPhone and iPad
support you really have nothing to lose
I give maven a 4.5 out of 5 if it
weren't for that red trackpad being a
little clunky I would have given it a
solid five so if you're looking for a
safari alternative seriously check out
maven thank you very much for checking
out the very first episode of what see
apps this with John Q from tech
a buffalo thank you very much for
watching I'll see you guys next time
take care</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
