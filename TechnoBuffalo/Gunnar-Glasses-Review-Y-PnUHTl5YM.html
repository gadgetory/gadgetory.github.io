TechnoBuffalo here the review for you of
the gunner performance optic glasses and
before you say what's up at the yellow
sunglasses let me explain what these do
and what they're supposed to do and
it'll give you my full review on them
these are supposed to reduce eye strain
and glare from computer monitors in
television we spend a lot of time in
front of a computer or a lot of times
even potentially playing video games
your eyes will probably get a little bit
sore I know might actually start to hurt
they can occasionally water and these
glasses are up you're supposed to reduce
the glare and I try and associated with
that and they do it sort of in a unique
way they magnify what you see first of
all so it takes some getting used to but
they also use a sort of yellow hue to
pull the glare off of the monitor that
you're using if you're using a Mac for
example odds are it's not a glossy
display and the glossy display while
looking very pretty can be a strain on
the eyes in the long term especially
depending where your light sources if
you got it coming up from up ahead kind
of a glare that should be right back in
your eyes that really can take a toll so
these are supposed to fix it now first
time you put these things on as you can
see you have them on right now takes a
while to get used to things look much
larger because the magnification and
they also look really yellow so it's
nothing that you're gonna look at your
computer monitor right away and say wow
my eyes feel more relaxed it's much more
subtle than that something you're gonna
notice over time so I did an experiment
I stayed in front of a computer for an
hour and a half which is it's pretty
typical amount of time I was browsing I
was doing some writing usually my
typical computer usage and I did not
have the glasses on and I kind of tried
to make note of how my eyes felt I
closed them and so you liked the feel
and you sort of pain or discomfort at
all and I didn't notice some eye
soreness because I'm in front of a
computer for so long you know I do have
eyes on it so I'm excited to try these
so now put the gutters on and it took a
good 5 to 10 minutes before I could
actually read and stop noticing that I
had them on and I did that same
hour-and-a-half test and afterwards my
eyes definitely felt noticeably less
stressed and that was quite interesting
I was not necessarily optimistic about
the results these glasses but I can have
to say they actually
work the model that I have right now is
called the edge and they'll run you
about a hundred and twenty bucks so
they're not cheap they're certainly not
cheap at all I'm not going to be an
impulse purchase if you're a kind of
person who does have a fatigue and ice
cream it's gonna be a worthwhile
investment if you haven't experienced
the iock strain or v fatigue nothing
that you probably are going to go need
to run out and buy that being said they
do look a little bit silly I don't if
you're in a busy office and from a
computer all day
it may not want to be busting these
things out sitting there at your desk
because the guy in the cube next to you
might bump is head over and make a
little bit of fun but if you can deal
with sort of the yellow hue and the odd
look they really do work as advertised
and I'm actually more impressed than
anyone that they do and actually you
notice that the biggest difference when
you take them off and you start to use a
computer again those take a while for
your eyes to readjust and going like
this - got my monitor over here it will
take a while for your eyes to readjust
and you can actually appreciate the
yellow hue and sort of what it does for
you also these take advantage of an Olaf
Obachan lens the same sort of screen
that's on the iPhone meaning the oils
won't show up they're very very
lightweight actually you hardly know
that they're there they're much lighter
weight that say then most standard
eyeglasses so there isn't any weight on
your head all the lenses are a little
bit on the thick side if you can see
they don't add any stiphu can't wait
they do come in their store and it's
kind of neat box guys are a soft touch
of rubber feel open it up and you've got
a bag it can also be used as a cleaning
cloth and a really nice place to store
them so am I going to keep using the
gunnar glasses well the answer is yes I
probably will tube using the gunner
glasses when I'm at a computer monitor
for a long period of time
I'm just here checking email or writing
a quick lowest-rated filming eyes for
editing a short video probably won't for
a month but if I'm gonna be here for an
extended period of time I think I
definitely will use them to reduce eye
strain my eyes actually tend to hurt
pretty bad my left eye tends to get very
sore quickly from using a glossy screen
so I think that having a pair of these
laying around will definitely be helpful
so as I mentioned in conclusion are
these for you
you're a heavy user and you do
experience amaya strain definitely
they're gonna be worth the price if
you're a light user you're not really in
front of a TV or computer to monitor
that much and your eyes don't hurt
theirs are gonna be no need to rush out
and buy these you can pick them up if
you dress it from Gunners comp
