Hazleton from TechnoBuffalo I'm here
checking out the Xperia z5 premium I was
just announced today defund Berlin
unfortunately we're sort of tied to the
law here you can see don't have a unit
we can actually get our hands on but
you're looking at the world's first 4k
display so it's 5.5 inches and that will
give you eight hundred and six pixels
per inch which is pretty incredible
that's the highlight here otherwise it's
very similar to what we saw with the
experience to you five you've got the
Snapdragon 810 processor three gigs of
ram 32 gigs of storage on board that you
can expand up top you've got the
fingerprint reader on the power button
by the way that expandable storage goes
up to 200 gigabytes with a microSD card
ip65 an IP 68 resistance so you can
actually get it would sort of I got
super they're just I'm going to try to
move around the device it's very hard to
see it's dark here but you've got the
3.5 millimeter headphone jack up top on
the bottom here and I try to sneak in
can't really see much microUSB charging
on the bottom sticker on the actual
proverbial right here it's a no us bc
and then you've got the camera button up
top the volume controls and that after
mentioned power button that i talked
about so anyway the highlight here is
the big display pretty awesome-looking
and you can see it'll come in different
colors we've got a gold one down there
we just go black so in a case quick look
here at the Xperia z5 premium this is
