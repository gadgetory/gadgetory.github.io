TechnoBuffalo here's an unboxing of the
new king on BlackBerry's block this is Z
30 and my math is correct it is 20
better than the previous flagship the
z10 go ahead open it up take a first
look so here is the Z 30 box looking
very similar to the unlocked z10 that we
saw before it I want to thank our
friends at Negri electronics for hooking
us up with this guy be sure to check
them out for all of your unlocked phone
tablet needs and they're even selling
cameras and lenses now so go ahead and
peel off the plastic sort of nondescript
Big Z 32 the BlackBerry emboss on the
side slide that up and then there is the
new big black brand does look like a
very big phone it's a 5-inch screen
they 1280 by 720 resolution to 295 PPI
it feels significant it's got a similar
back to what we saw on the q10 with that
sort of textured sort of faux carbon
fiber look push up the side for just a
quick second see what else we're going
to have in the box we're going to have I
think this phone was regional to Hong
Kong so I'm guessing this is going to be
in mostly Mandarin but we've got power
we've got a pretty nice looking
headphones actually curved headphones
with the different size earbuds and then
we've got your charging station cable
nothing else no sort of pouch or
anything in there here's the phone the
phone feels really nice the bottom here
looks like metal may actually be metal I
just feel real quick comparison here is
the z10 see what the size difference
here are as well so a 4.2 inch phone - a
5 inch phone that really looks quite
nice of course being powered by bb10
speaking of being powered I will turn
this guy on and I'll run through the
rest of the specs it's a Super AMOLED
screen as well it's being powered by a
pretty nice dual-core 1.7 gigahertz
Qualcomm Snapdragon chip with quad-core
Adreno 320 GPU the 710 was a 1.5
gigahertz
chip TVs RAM 16 gigs of internal storage
but that is expandable with microSD
which you can't hot-swap so you can pop
in one way or using it the back we've
got a rear facing camera it's 8
megapixel that does 1080p video on the
front we've got a 2 megapixel
fixed-focus camera that can shoot 720p
video all our so the good stuff you'd
expect her here NFC and DLNA a
relatively nice size I guess 20800 a
milliamp power battery it's suppose is
going to give you 18 hours of talk time
or up to 16 days of standby time 802 11
a B G and n way is 170 grams looks like
the phone might dead so I'll let turn on
at least so let's do a quick a tour and
walk around
we've got HDMI out and your charging and
sticking port I would wager this is a
door that comes down somehow
I'll take a look at that in just a
second on the other side you've got your
volume up and down and your mute button
looks like connectors potential docks
and letting us know that this does come
off the battery though that I mentioned
is not removable so while you can remove
the back looks like a little bit of
difficulty the phone itself does not
feature a removable battery let me could
try and get a coin and prop this out so
it did take a lot of prying but I did
eventually get that back off and we've
got a non removable battery but I was
right those two spots which I thought
were a flap do not come up but that's
where your expansion card slot and your
SIM card slot are going to live and give
you a little bit of specs here 5-inch
brameld screen and the rest of the stuff
that we talked about so let's snap this
back on it seems very weird trend that's
going on out I have removable backs but
not removable battery so here is bb10 in
all of its bb10 action so a few things
you can see here first there's the
camera and it works like bb10 has since
we first saw it on the z10 you can swipe
up to close an app and I'll sort of stay
in that grade you can now see four apps
at a time got blackberry peak anywhere
you are you can sort of slide on over
I'd see what you've got your mailbox
we've got software updates here if you
swipe on over you can see the rest of
your apps in an icon layout so giving me
a tutorial looks like as I go through so
here the stock apps that come with the
phone this is unlock unit so there
aren't any carrier
bloatware on here at all blackberry hub
a unified inbox your text messages
bbm which we now have on multiple
platforms but the bbm on an actual
black/gray device lets you do screen
share which is a pretty cool thing we'll
jump into settings real fast you can see
everything here we'll go to about
there's a software update for this one
but it's shipping with ten point two
point zero point two ten go ahead and go
back as well
swipe up and again if you want to close
an app you can just tap it any more
information on an app when you're in it
you could pull on down we're on the home
screen now you get sort of access to
your quick settings and that is about it
I've got unified surge if you want to
search for an inbox and of course you've
got that awesome predictive type T
border I really like as you type words I
sort of start to show up but you can
swipe them up there just works really
really well and probably my favorite
features of any of the BlackBerry phones
so this has been a really quick first
look at the BlackBerry z30 nothing here
has really changed since previous
versions of b10 it's just on a bigger
screen now so you can see more apps on a
screen the four icons you can see her
apps you have opened are just bigger
other than that it's pretty much the
same a little faster processor a little
different build but the same 720 screen
the same operating system so if you
liked what blackberry ten offered but
wished you had a bigger screen from four
point two to five this might be a very
good device to look to pick up again
thank you to our friends at Negril a
