Sangin from TechnoBuffalo and today
we're gonna show you how you can run
Cortana inside of Mac OS 10 hey Cortana
what's the weather like in Irvine yeah
there you go so the first thing we need
to do is make sure we have a Mac running
OS 10 lion or later and also have about
2 gigabytes of RAM installed now we can
recommend having 4 gigabytes of memory
and also have about 15 to 20 gigabytes
of this space for parallels in Windows
10 second we need to download the latest
version of parallels desktop which is
currently at version 11 now we'll leave
that download link in the description
below there's a 14-day free trial if you
want to test it out or you can simply
buy the app for $80 or upgrade from
version 9 or 10 for $50 next we need to
download the Windows 10 ISO file
directly from Microsoft and we'll leave
that link in the description as well
it's a four gigabyte file and it should
take a couple of minutes to download
after downloading the Windows 10 ISO
file open up the parallels app and
choose install Windows or another OS
from a DVD or image file hit continue
and choose the image file then drag and
drop the Windows 10 ISO file from your
downloads folder to the parallels app
and hit continue if you don't have a
product key uncheck this version
requires a product key and hit continue
keep clicking continue until the Windows
10 setup starts and this process is
gonna take a while because it's
essentially installing an actual OS on
top of your current OS so give it some
time once you're all set up parallels
will automatically enable coherence mode
which essentially allows you to run
Windows applications on your Mac as if
they were native Mac apps this mode will
allow us to use Cortana even if we're
using native Mac apps which is what we
want now the set of Cortana click on the
Windows 10 parallels icon in your dock
and this will bring up the familiar
Start menu from Windows 10 you can set
up Cortana by clicking on the search bar
and agreeing to Microsoft's Terms &amp;amp;
Conditions and that's about it
once Cortana is all set up you can start
using her natively inside of Mac OS 10
she'll be able to feed you information
like the weather how old a certain
celebrity is maybe even recommend good
restaurants nearby
with parallels you can access and use
Windows 10 without the need to reboot
unlike boot camp you can also share
files between Mac and Windows which is
super convenient anyway is this about
I hope you guys enjoyed this quick
little tutorial on how to install and
use Cortana on a Mac if you haven't seen
our other Windows 7 coverage make sure
to check them out over here anyways
