that I used to do was a viewer mail bag
and it's kind of been shelled for the
past few months like to go ahead and
bring it back it's a time where I go
through my mail answer some of your
questions and hopefully what i read
represents a lot of people's questions
so let's go ahead and get started and
usually I click these just add at random
so you guys get a nice sampling of the
questions that are coming in first one
is by user Dakota 200 and the question
is how you get partnership that's a
question that I'm answered a few times
before but I'll give you guys a brief
synopsis of it so now we're going to get
a youtube partnership which means a
section that you own your own content
and you're eligible for revenue share
from your videos the best way to do it
is to build a subscriber base certainly
don't want to apply with just a couple
of subscribers I generally advise people
to wait until they apply until they get
around 2,000 subscribers your results
are going to vary there are some
partners that have less and certainly
many that have more I think 2000 is a
really nice number it's hard to get
there but if you stick with it and you
apply you know odds are if you have two
thousand subscribers you really aren't
going to get the partner better looking
for make sure all your videos how unique
contents don't use any copyrighted
material first off very important
YouTube really frowns on that so that
means music if you're showing a movie
that you're watching you're showing
yourself playing a video game anything
make sure it's not copy written you
don't go ahead and apply there really
aren't any set guidelines or boundaries
at YouTube puts out but those degenerate
rules that I follow and make sure you're
making videos pretty regularly let's go
ahead and pick up in the next question
here all right this one is called video
uploading as by user KW stringy king hey
John I was wondering how long it usually
takes you to upload a movie in HD and
how long to do it directly to YouTube I
have problems uploading lately please
release apply ASAP so when you guys
watch my videos we first get uploaded
you'll notice that the view and HD
button in the bottom right hand corner
is generally not there this is really
depends on YouTube servers to get a
video to show
in HD it's not going to show up right
away no matter what it can take as
little as two hours really as long as 6
12 hours to get your video to show up in
HD but if you export it according to the
ways that i showed you in the previous
video using imovie 08 or iMovie 09 the
watch in HD button eventually will show
up it just takes time it's not going to
do with your internet speed or how it's
getting uploaded just youtube server
sick a lot of processes so no worries
guys that actually is a question that I
get quite a bit let's go ahead and pick
one from another pager alright this one
is by Matz Matz ain't no kid question is
titled ipod touch hi I'll just wondering
if you don't have Wi-Fi can you text the
internet through the ipod connector
cable can you send me a reply back
Thanks I think what he's asking is if
you take the connection cable from your
iPod Touch to plug into USB if you can
use your computer's internet connection
to get I internet on your ipod touch and
the answer that is an astounding know
the only way to internet on your ipod
touch is through Wi-Fi that's a very
nice and simple question alright this
one is by fame fame films f.a.m.e i was
wondering what type of program you use
to edit your films john i was wondering
what type of program you use edit your
film was because i tried using
photobucket on my video was a genius but
couldn't upload it to youtube so instead
i made it on windows movie maker which
is ok but like all the cool special
effects please help well it sounds like
your first problems that you're using
Windows sanic your videos Windows has a
lot of really good video editing program
some made by adobe but personally I use
iMovie 09 i was using imovie await and i
would be HD before that but i do all my
editing in Apple's I will be sweet it
really just makes uploading to YouTube
editing your videos really nice and easy
so unfortunately I movie is not
available on a PC so you're going to be
stuck with windows movie maker if you
don't want to buy an additional software
so let's go ahead and pick one more in
should I get a case for my aluminum
macbook hey John this is from user
between i purchased a math back
yesterday and i'm wondering how will
your case the aluminum kingston is
holding up do you think i really need to
go out and purchase the case back hard
case or sleeve for it i'm looking at my
dell laptop ipad for five years and it's
got no noticeable scratches of course i
would think the laptop outside to places
where can get scratched usually inside
on the couch or a desk when I take it
out of my padded laptop bag just laptop
bag just wondering what your opinions
would be on the subject I carry my 13
inch aluminum macbook in an in case
sleeve everywhere I go you're dilip all
we didn't get that scratch because
plastic the aluminum is definitely prone
to scratching i highly recommend picking
up just a neoprene sleeve throw it in
carry it with you and really you'll be
all set it's a nice thing you can you're
outside you can put the macbook on top
of its to the bottom of it won't get
dirty and just a really nice thing to
have and they're relatively inexpensive
you can find them for apple store or
online anywhere from 20 to 30 bucks
really just a nice inexpensive way to
protect your investment so let's go
ahead and just pick one last one from a
third page here alright this is by user
x cycle word x and it's called macworld
hey John I just bought my first mac and
i say got putting back office on it but
when I for example put my Mac worthwhile
external hard drives and pull it on
windows open the map file on the windows
pc but okay well this is PS sorry i'm
not good at english i apologize so i
think what he's asking is if you use
word for mac can you open that file
using word for pc and the answer is an
astounding yes absolutely one hundred
percent can i do work cross-platform all
the time with pcs and macs without any
difficulty at all Word PowerPoint Excel
will all work from mac to pc and vice
versa without any difficulty formatting
will be the same it saves in the same
file extensions so not a worry
at all and I guys hope you enjoyed
bringing back the viewer mail that I'm
going to try and do this a little more
regularly where I can answer your
questions unfortunately I get just too
many emails to go through and answer
each one individually but I do read them
all so these are some of the ones that I
thought would be much relevant to you
