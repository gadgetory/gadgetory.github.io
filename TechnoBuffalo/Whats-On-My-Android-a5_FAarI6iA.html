technobuffalo here and we're back with
another episode of what's on mine and
now we've got my daily driver the galaxy
note here so let me show you what kind
of applications that I've got what I use
on a daily basis is my actual phone I
haven't done anything crazy to it this
is what's going to go right from this
video directly into my pocket let's go
ahead and get started alright so first I
want to say this is not a rooted device
this isn't running any custom roms it's
not running cyanogen or any sort of
alpha build this is exactly how the
galaxy note came this is the
international version doubt bring system
still gingerbread with TouchWiz sitting
on top of it alright so let me go ahead
and show you she got the lock screen so
forgot a custom lock screen on here as
well that's Lucy I do have an Ice Cream
Sandwich Locker on here which lets me
choose different applications that i
want to open so if I slide it to the
right that will unlock if I slide it up
it'll call my wife if I slide it to the
left it'll launch my mail application
which is k-9 mail talk about that a
little bit and if I slide down it'll go
right to text messages so that's what I
use here and this is all touch with
stuff the big sort of time widget
followed by the giant weather widget
have this refreshing about every three
hours but if you want a refresher
manually there's the little arrows donor
so I'll go ahead and do that I've got a
starred folder here for folks that I
call most often got a quick dial for my
wife camera gallery settings plume is my
Twitter application of choice for
Android just kind of dig it it works
well it's pretty simple and on the giant
screen of the note it's awesome just to
have all these tweets show up facebook I
do use a facebook application on the
phone whereas on the tablet if you saw
my iPad what's on my iPad video I use
the browser for that and whatsapp I do a
lot of chatting on so continuing down at
or hear phone that's obviously phone k-9
mail is my preferred mail client I have
a lot of different accounts so using the
native gmail application on Android I
don't like like it very much the end of
a unified inbox which is quite a pain to
jump between inboxes k-9 mail has been
great for setting flags that kind of
stuff I don't want to open it up because
you know all kinds of personal mail
stuff in there so if you want to try a
secondary mail app with
give k-9 mail a shot though we'll slide
to the right google search speed tests
you guys know I'm a speed test maniac I
love to speed test everything so I've
got some reminders on here with my
today's calendar active applications
case I want to manage what's running go
ahead and tap that and I can go ahead
and close whatever I need to get closed
now but generally I never even come
close to being filled s planner which is
my calendar YouTube ESPN which honestly
I don't use on that much generally I'll
just go to ESPN com you know I've got
this application in case I want to check
out the scores and all my stuff for my
favorite teams will slide on over not
much here just simple a connection stuff
screen timeout tips and settings nothing
on the next screen I'm a minimalist here
when it comes to my experience recent
Laker scores I'm going to check that
very quickly and now we're on the last
screen which coincidentally is also on
the left when I'm on my home screen so
one is home so 7 goes so laptop got
Twitter on here let's see what we got
going on in applications a lot of this
stuff is pretty stock much like the ipad
i do them and download what i think i'm
going to use or what i want to test out
and i'll delete it when i'm done so
clock s planner music camera Maps gmail
gallery a google search market social
hub that's all samsung stuff readers hub
don't really use that settings my files
videos all share which sort of does a
weird way of letting you share it test
actually tether we've got keys air talk
latitude don't even know keys areas
actually I've never even tried then see
what that is on camera which enables a
Wi-Fi to pc phone communication so
that's what I thought all share was so
what's all share shows how much I you
stuff oh so for slinging content to DLNA
enabled devices so similar to the
airplane S Memo which is what you use
for drying on here you can see wait use
the pen for I've gotten through all that
a lot in my overviews and reviews of the
note so I'm not going to go into too
much detail on that photo editor video
maker mini diary it's all sort of
standard stuff that comes on here voice
recorder voice Chuck voice search
downloads calculator Samsung Apps news
and notes you can see I don't that much
downloaded Polaris Office
now all right stuff getting software up
downloading crayon physics s choice and
was on kindle I will say though there's
some decent stuff here in the samsung
apps kindle this is one place where the
note is awesome for reading books if
you're at the gym or something or on a
train or just like to read on your phone
I having your screen this big is really
really nice speed tests again because I
speed test a lot Facebook you saw
Fandango and flick sir for checking
movie times analytics widget generally
I've got a widget on the home screen
that shows me Google Analytics kind of
stuff for the site Netflix whatsapp
battery widget and beautiful widgets I
some beautiful widget centrally gives
you HTC Sense asked looking clocks and
weather swiftkey tablet X that was one
of the keyboards that I was using for
the galaxy note i'll show you the
keyboard a minute but i've stopped using
it adobe reader plume flash player
sirius XM plus into my satellite radio
ADW notifier that gives you essentially
notifications for k-9 mail you can see
that in the upper left hand corner there
in the taskbar widgetlocker is what i
used on that lock screen youtube ESPN
google music google currents angry birds
card standard movie watch quadrant for
when I bookmark or benchmark in test
this and 22 was well docs in NES
emulator ice cream sandwich sandwich
I've really used skype this kind of
makes it look like an iPhone I'll just
curious to see what it looked like so
and just watches you know stuff looks
super silly so go ahead go back home and
the dolphin browser as a secondary
browser if something's not compatible
that battery widget judge me the battery
percentage right there which is kind of
nice I like to keep my taskbar clean as
possible I'm gonna go ahead and show you
the keyboard that I music I really
didn't like the keyboard that came
standard on the international version of
the galaxy note so I download an Ice
Cream Sandwich influenced keyboard and
it really makes typing much easier for
me typing on the galaxy note is great
because the keys are so giant so that's
what I use this has been what's on my
android device in this particular case
the galaxy note which is a very unique
Android device you can have so much on
the same screen got five rows across
here of icons which is kind of rare but
I absolutely look alright so i'm jon
rettinger from technobuffalo and i'll
see you
guys in the next video
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
