enger' here and I want to give you a
demonstration of the iRobot Roomba
in action and this is all being recorded
with the iPhone 3GS and will be directly
uploaded to YouTube from the iPhone
let's go ahead and get started take a
look at the iRobot right here this is a
dock that automatically comes back to
when it's done vacuuming and that's what
charges up as well you can see there's a
pretty decent size power brick right
there so we can go ahead and push start
and you'll see the Roomba go and do its
vacuuming thing get a nice little tune
and it lets you know that it's going to
start vacuuming now my TV stand is right
here so if it goes and hits it it'll
automatically adjust itself so it hit it
it'll spin around and they'll go ahead
and just keep vacuuming and I should say
it actually does a very very good job so
once it comes out from under my coffee
table I will give you guys an example of
what a good job it does do
so here is just a piece of cat hair that
I haven't had on the carpet
I'm gonna go ahead and put it in front
of the room but actually right now you
can see the light with glowing that's
because it found a dirty area that
decided to go and clean and it really
does a fantastic job you go through and
you clean it after it's done vacuuming
and things are you're surprised what
comes off your carpet let me show you a
kind of running around here
got a little weight benching goes
underneath it and it really does go
through and do it do it thin quite
nicely and it takes about 25 minutes per
room they estimate and when the when
it's done vacuuming it will come right
back to its charger and charge for the
day you can see it kind of rolling along
and it gets stuck in some places but it
always finds its way out which is very
handy
so my guys hope you enjoyed a quick
demonstration of the irobot roomba in
action it really is very really is very
cool to have a robot vacuum in your
floor here and surprisingly it does a
very good job as good a job as the old
vacuum that I used to have you can see
it's kind of getting all in those
corners there it's got brushes that
protrude out to make sure that it gets
all those spots let's just watch it just
for one more second and then I will say
those you that met Mercedes in the
unboxing video she is none too happy
about the Roomba hi guys so for
exclusive contents be sure to follow me
on Twitter twitter.com slash John for
Lakers and I will see you guys in the
next video bye-bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
