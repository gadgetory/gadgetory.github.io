TechnoBuffalo here from CES 2012 with
the HTC Titan 2 and I'll give you a
guess if you can figure out which one is
a Titan 2 and which one is a Titan 1
let's go ahead and compare these two
super phones
thanks to Ford for powering our CES
coverage so for those of you that guess
the phone on the left you are correct
this is the HTC Titan 2 and this is its
older brother I guess the HTC Titan 1
which is my daily driver so I'm quite
excited to see what the Titan 2 has to
offer
let's go ahead and turn both these
phones on we'll do a real quick
comparison of both of them so looking at
them from the front they're gonna look
very very similar you've got that same
4.7 inch screen 480 by 800 resolution
that we saw on the first generation
versus the second generation the facade
again very similar you've got those
three Windows Phone buttons the back
button the windows button and the search
button
we really can see a difference is when
you flip them on the back sides here
we've got the HTC Titan 2 with the soft
touch rubber feel to it HTC Titan 1 was
all metal a bit more of an industrial
feel a little more subtle differences as
well LED flash on the 2 is on the right
and where it's on the left on the Titan
1 and the speaker sides are reversed but
it starts to see a difference of these
cameras obviously much bigger sensor
here we're looking at a 16 megapixel
sensor on the HTC Titan 2 versus the 8
megapixel shooter on the HTC Titan 1 so
big differences here as far as the
cameras so talking about the design a
little bit more you can certainly see
the difference the metal feels really
nice on the HTC Titan 1 I did like it it
was able to get scratched quite a bit
I'm a bit more partial to the soft touch
feel looking forward to trying to HD
Titan to what you can't see and what's
running through the air though is 4G LTE
we're only rockin HSPA+ on the Titan 1
but we've got full 4G LTE support here
on the Titan to the screen so are
essentially identical speeds almost
identical as well this is running a
qualcomm since HTC Titan 2 is running a
Qualcomm Snapdragon 1.5 gigahertz single
core chip this is also a 1.5
right single courtship also built by
Samsung so very similar here that the
difference is that you're gonna get as a
4G LTE connectivity and that 16
megapixel shooter so I'll go ahead and
shoot a couple pictures and show you
guys differences between the quality of
the Titan 2 and a Titan 1 it could
decide whether or not it's worth an
upgrade I'm a big fan of Windows Phone 7
I've gone on record saying I really
enjoy the Metro UI I like the live tiles
I think it's got a fun fresh feel to it
so again looking forward to seeing what
the Titan 2 can bring and if it can live
up to the pretty nice standards of the
Titan 1 or whether or not it's going to
fall a little bit flat so I am John
Rhett endure from TechnoBuffalo sure to
check us out for the rest of our CES
2012 coverage this has been a real quick
first look in comparison at the Titan 2
versus the HTC Titan 1 in the next video
