from TechnoBuffalo here over the years
I've been reviewing smartphones I've
seen quite a few and I haven't been that
many that have something new and unique
that I have yet to experience
well the Samsung Galaxy Beam has just
that it's got a pico projector built in
here it's a 15 lumen job that can
project up to a 50 inch screen how does
that translate on a phone as it make it
super thick and hard to use is the
screen that it projects on not going to
be the best let's go and take a look at
the Galaxy Beam see how it works
all right so here is the galaxy beam
light up and share there's a picture of
the phone with the aforementioned beam
part of the galaxy it's got a pico
projector built-in we'll talk about that
guy in a few minutes
got some branding on the side and some
specs on the back of course we're gonna
run through all of this stuff thank you
to our friends at Negri electronics for
hooking us up with this bad boy they're
the place we go to to get all of our
unlocked accessories and phones and
tablets I'll be sure to check them out
links going to be down below all right
let's go ahead and use my ceremonial
unboxing scissors I think it's time for
the obligatory big old knife take a
comeback though go ahead and cut the
plastic here push it off the backside I
have not seen this phone in person I
have not touched this phone in person
I've not even whispered the name of this
phone so I'm actually very curious to
see how the speaker projector works so
we'll pull off the top of the box it's
quite a long box and here is the Galaxy
Beam in a bit of a little shell they're
gonna pull it off and Galaxy Beam push
up this side for just a quick second see
what else we're going to have in the box
and we'll run through some specs Quick
Start Guide we've got some sort of
additional types of charging extra
battery in there I've got a sinking
cable of course the standard USB two
micro I've got two batteries in here
obviously one is the extra and they are
of size two thousand milliamp hours got
a wall charger little ear gels and we've
got a microphone and headset
well obviously the built-in microphone
in there go ahead set look microphone
rather so push all that off to the side
let's go ahead and run through the specs
here of the Galaxy Beam so it is running
a bit of an antiquated Android 2.3.6
Gingerbread it does have TouchWiz 4.0 on
it though dimension standpoint 4.8
inches by 2.5 inches by a not thin 0.49
inches but I suppose we can forgive that
it's got a pico projector built-in and
with battery it's gonna weigh 5.1 ounces
the screen is a 4-inch WVGA
fair with the resolution of 480 by 800
Scott dimensions to 2000 million power
battery it's gonna be good for about
nine hours to talk time it's got a
cortex 89 so close you that's keep track
of processors
that's a dual-core one gigahertz
processor 768 megabytes of RAM 8 gig
internal storage with microSD expansion
it's got a 5 megapixel autofocus camera
will do off the classic living right
there with flash and it can shoot 720p
video on the front we've got a 1.3
megapixel camera there as well bluetooth
3.0 HSPA+ no LTE here on the pker
projector is 15 lumens and that can put
up to a 50 inch screen but enough of me
talking about it let's go ahead and pop
in the battery and see what this thing
looks like we'll come right back in a
moment alright so here we've got the
Galaxy Beam let's go ahead and see what
software version it's running I know
that we said it was running Gingerbread
but I want to see it for myself
and we are running Android 2.3.6 so the
screen here is pretty much what you'd
expect from a WVGA resolution screen it
looks nice
TouchWiz works fine the cortex a9
processor is very capable I'll be a
little bit the last generation processor
but this phone isn't really about the
specs it's about some other tricks that
it's got let's continue the to work
volume rocker up and down some cards
gonna go on the side on the right hand
side you've got the projector button
which we'll play with in a little bit
power lock button and your micro SD card
slot I do really like though that
Samsung has got the micro SD card slot
and the SIM card slot on the side so you
have to remove the battery to do that
quite nice so you've got one big button
right down there in the middle and
flanked to in the left and the right are
capacitive menu and back buttons and
there's your Chardin sync port as well
as a noise cancelling microphone 3.5
millimeter headset jack is also going to
live there on the back we've got the
five megapixel camera that we mentioned
and then there is that 15 lumens pico
projector which we'll show you in just a
moment pretty cool actually other rest
of this phone is pretty much what we've
seen from previous Samsung device
nothing that exciting here we can get a
chance to see what they are we'll go
ahead and take a look at some of the
widgets see if anything maybe new they
hit in here and it looks to all be
relatively standard Samsung stuff not to
say bad at all Samsung's got some very
nice widgets all right so let me go
ahead and show you the projector so
that's really where all the action
happens here so to activate the
projector you go in and ahead and hold
down this button on the side
projector kicks on you've got some
options here you can adjust the focus
you can either use this slider or the
volume you can rotate it port your
landscape and quick pad while it's
actually right on the screen so this is
what the options look like and if you
hit OK there actually get a few other
options go in to projector ambience mode
torch light and make it into a giant
flashlight and do all kinds of other
sort of cool stuff with it let me go
ahead and show you what the projector
actually looks like since that the big
deal with the Galaxy Beam and probably
one of the main things you might be
thinking of when you want to pick one of
these guys up alright so we held down
the projector button and now we see a
projector option this is what I just
showed you a minute ago
you can adjust focus rotate quick Pat
we'll go ahead and hit OK and this is
gonna pretty much show you exactly
what's on your screen so if you at home
go ahead and navigate just through your
phone as you would anywhere else if we
go back to the projector go ahead and
select that we'll go ahead and go back
to focus and rotation go ahead and
rotate this guy and let's see how it
looks like when it's playing a video I
will jump into YouTube here the good
applications YouTube we already
TechnoBuffalo video here I already
queued up we'll go ahead play on it
but everything and actually it looks
pretty decent the quality certainly it's
not you know movie theater type quality
but it actually took down the volume
there looks pretty nice if you pull it
back farther the screen gets bigger you
can go up to actually 50 inch screen as
I move closer obviously it gets smaller
and you can just focus as you go you can
just put it on the desk and to play so
if you're recording a home movie video
your kids or someone's recital you just
want to show something up on a wall it's
actually a pretty cool little thing to
show here but playing video isn't the
only thing that this guy does I'm going
to show you some other features so go
ahead and pause this video pause go
ahead and go home turn the rotation back
to regular it looks like it already did
done and you can actually draw right on
the screen as well so go ahead go to
projector options I will go and take a
look at focus and rotation hit okay and
we've got some other cool stuff here so
we go to quick pad you can actually draw
it on the screen of something that you
want to let people know so you can go to
either get a pointer you actually use
almost like a mouse cursor around there
you could see that hopefully you can see
that moving you can also go to pen we
can actually write right on here hi
smiley face because you want to draw
notes so you can pick the color of
course well raise all that stuff but
just a neat sort of tweaks that this has
here so if you don't might miss him
there just to meet tweaks at the sink
tire and stuff you might not necessarily
expect from a phone playing with a pico
projector is kind of neat especially one
this size it's relatively thin phone
compare it to sizes of phones maybe from
about a year and a half ago but this
guy's rocking a 15 lumen projector so
pretty cool overall I know my guys what
do you guys think of the Samsung Galaxy
Beam love to hear your thoughts
something you might consider not
consider and why I'm John Redinger from
TechnoBuffalo and I will beam you in the
next video buh-bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
