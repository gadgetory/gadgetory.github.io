tour of Xbox Live integration good
alright so here we go we go down here to
the game tab which is where all your
xbox live games will live even if your
games Amarth xbox live enabled if you
purchase they'll still show up in the
games up and the idea is that in the
game Sam is everything to do with gaming
so xbox live other third-party games
that aren't necessarily xbox live
enabled will show up here in your
collection view let's see here that they
have kind of try now button so they're
not currently downloaded on the phone
but one of the cool things to about the
games on x1 DOS Phone 7 is that all have
a try before you buy policy so before
you spend your money give a chance to
give it a quick roll and decide if you
want to pay for it or not every apps
going to have it correct yep and so you
toggle over here to the right and this
is where we'll be able to program
content much like you find on the
dashboard and on your Xbox console so
new games promotions you know go check
out Major Nelson view inside Xbox Live
video I kind of stuff will show up here
on the spotlight flip over again and
this is gonna be where your avatar your
gamer score and your latest achievement
are going to be displayed and as you can
see here that's my hat though it's not
currently my avatar but someone's avatar
but it's the same avatar you'll find on
the console the same one that's on the
web you make changes to your avatar here
on the phone those changes are reflected
back on your
consult so super tight integration with
xbox live which is totally cool and you
also be able to see your achievements
and then your total gamer score as well
what's really cool we put back over to
there to our collection really quick the
games that Xbox I have enabled on this
phone will have their own unique pool of
the gamer score points so 200 points so
let's say you have this phone your
friend has you know some other phone
with that Xbox Live you know how to now
have access to a whole bunch more points
than your friend does simply because you
have a Windows Phone 7 which is super
cool so back table back over here this
is actually we're gonna see requests
that are sent to you from your friends
so like game requests and also your
friends status one thing I'll mention is
that there'll be an additional free Xbox
Live extras application that you
download just once and it will enhance
the kind of the features of this hub and
so once you download that application
your avatar actually gets a little bit
bigger it's 3d you can you can interact
with your avatar if you poke if you kind
of jumps around you shake your phone it
falls down but it also enables a richer
experience with your friends so you can
see all your friends playing it you know
halo right now are they playing call of
duty
they'll also build a do messaging
through the Xbox Live service from
Windows Phone to the Xbox console and
vice versa so your friend can see see
that you're on your phone playing
send you a note through the Xbox Live
service say hey when you get home let's
fire up the new halo and you can message
it back and save see at 7 o'clock and
that's really cool too for the folks
that are used to messaging their friends
to Xbox Live that's gonna be dead easy
so that's a quick tour of the Xbox Live
up and/or the Xbox Live features of the
phone on the games have been Windows
Phone 7
thank you very much every gesture no
worries
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
