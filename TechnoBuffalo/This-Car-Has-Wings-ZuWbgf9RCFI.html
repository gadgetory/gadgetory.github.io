are the thing that makes it the most
identifiable and it's also the thing
that's given the car the most issues
it's had early quality control problems
but they do a lot of really cool stuff
when they work properly and I've had no
issues with mine at all but I wanted to
show you what the Falcon wing doors are
how they work and why they're useful so
open them up you can open it up in 3
different ways you can use the key fob
you can touch the door or you can use
the 17 inch touchscreen inside I'm gonna
go and touch the door and they will open
up and articulate open with two separate
hinges and that's really the first way
that these things are unique they've got
two different hinges as opposed to like
DeLorean doors or lambo doors they need
a lot of space to kind of open up these
go up and they can go out to get around
cars
so for me my use case in a garage I can
open up really tight spaces I can get in
I can get my kid in without having to
back to my car out first
I get acceptable about the springs the
actuators are in here I've gone through
looked at the CAD drawing that Tesla
actually gives the fire department in
case is ever an accident so I can get
the car open but the short version is to
separate hinges to get this thing open
of course to help it close as well so
hinge here and then very clearly a hinge
there as well there's also a ton of
sensors on this car as well that prevent
it from banging into things and bashing
into things so first I'll show some of
the pinch sensors that are here please
run all the way along pop the car
anywhere where it touches the base of
car there pinch Epps's or almost like
little buttons so in case a finger or a
hand gets stuck there it'll go ahead and
open back up there's also a combination
of ultrasonic and capacitive sensors as
well it's a ton of tech crammed into
this I can close the doors really in the
same way it's also a little handle here
to close it but I'm gonna use the button
and I'll kind of stop at midway through
and show you some of the stuff so we'll
go ahead and stop it here so actually
underneath the aluminum you have
ultrasonic sensors similarly ultrasonic
sensors have got in the back of the car
these kind of button sensors here but
Elon Musk thought they looked ugly on
the side of a car so one of the reasons
the Model X initially delayed was
engineers had design
entirely new sensor system that could
actually go through the aluminum on the
car and they did and it works which is
surprising so those run through the base
here and then there are touch capacitive
sensors here these doors opening it up
you can kind of tap it and door will
stop immediately similar to capacitive
on your phone for examples or similar
type of technology so all the sensors
work and kind of do a dance like the
sure the doors will open and close
around a person so I can show you real
briefly how they work to it and closed
door so go ahead and close and if
there's a car or person standing next to
it you can see that on the touch screen
so when you try to open the car out for
the door up you'll know it'll survive to
articulate up and around you so it's
kind of cool to seen if I open the door
up here again and has it opens if I
touch the capacitive sensors it'll stop
immediately there wasn't any sort of
pressure of force it was just simple tap
on any of this black strip here down
below the door will stop and if you want
to sort of continue it you go ahead and
sort of push the door again and I'll go
ahead and keep opening so that's really
helpful you say especially for me as a
parent I can really get right up to the
car and kind of get my kids in and out
you notice if he's also opened up really
high so it's not the only sensors on the
doors actually are sensors on the top of
the car as well to detect if you're in a
parking garage there's sort of an
overhang or a big concrete something
that the door can bash into so the doors
are one of the reasons I was most
excited to get the cover and also a
reason I was super nervous to get the
car and the big reason why I sights the
lease I had no idea that's gonna hold up
it's doing a lot of stuff and there's a
lot of things that potentially break or
go wrong with these doors so we'll see
how they perform but for me I've
actually found them to be really useful
and surprisingly helpful again
especially with kids getting a dog in
and out my wife has back problems so
when she is trying to get kids in and
out just have to lean forward if you're
trying to load groceries or get
something out of the car just makes life
really simple I'd also provide super
easy access to the third row so Falcon
wing doors we'll see how they hold up
they certainly
look interesting I think you're just
kind of polarizing you like to where
they look you're like what the hell is
that thing I'm enjoying it
only on the car for a week so we'll see
if that holds up you guys doing other
questions though about the Model X the
biggest question we had was the doors
and how they worked and if I've had any
problems with them
ELISA questions down below and let me
know questions you have will do more
Tesla videos sort of answering those
three have notifications turned on as
well so you get notified when those
videos come up and since you're a nice
person to the video a thumbs up it
certainly helps us so next time John
rende Yorkin technical suppose I worry
about whether or not the doors are gonna
fall off my car I could leave sit back
and relax some animal planning go and
catch about my favorite episodes a
project grizzly or ocean warrior just
other cute animals take Animal Planet
