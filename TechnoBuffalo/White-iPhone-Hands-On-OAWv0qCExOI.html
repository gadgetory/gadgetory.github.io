technobuffalo here in light of Apple
essentially canceling the white iphone
that'd be fun to take a look once again
what a white iphone actually looks like
and address some of the concerns and the
rumors that we've been hearing about
this device let's go ahead and get
started when Apple first announced the
iphone for the white iphone was certain
part of their launch plans however
months and months and months have passed
and they finally come out and
essentially said we're not going to see
it for quite some time if we do ever see
it at all these things are very very
very rare to actually see out in the
wild I have actually seen one white
iphone and there have been reports of
white iphone circling around apples
Cupertino campus so this was done
actually aftermarket from the folks at
the I rescue but it's not interesting to
would address some of the concerns that
we've seen about the white iphone and
that have been reported a few weeks ago
I was in New York attending some press
events and while I was there there were
widely quite iphone out in the wild or
published on crunch gear that are
published on macrumors in boy genius
report they were actually my white
iphone and i was approached by someone
asking why Apple had release white
iphone and i mentioned at my particular
model there were some differences in the
coloring between the white frame and the
home button and that was run with and
sort of became a unofficial statement so
that's where that came from case you
were wondering there have been certain
official reports of perhaps from Apple
that the white iphone has been delayed
because of screen bleeding through let
me show you guys sort of what that looks
like here on the white color so saying
that there may be some light shining
through on the top and bottom I'm going
to go ahead and unlock the device i'm
going to take sort of just a neoprene
case here and cover the top to see if
there really is any light bleeding then
I can tell you that's sort of in the
dead dark nothing comes through on the
top and also sort of in the dead dark
here nothing comes through on the bottom
I will see I do have an invisible shield
here on the white iphone case you see
sort of any lines or sense of it at the
top there overall you know I would have
liked to seen the white iphone launch
think it looks absolutely gorgeous it
looks different certainly you don't see
many of them if any out there it was
worthy the phone I was looking most
forward to gang particular model for all
intensive purposes I really is an actual
white iphone if you look at the back
you've got all sort of the requisite
branding an FCC identification there you
can see the top from the sides and the
sides oh I should taking this to an
apple store and brought it up to the
Genius Bar and there was sort of no no
issue with it whatsoever it's really
been sort of a lot of fun to actually
have a white iphone I want to know what
you guys think about this would you care
if was released will you uh would you
bought one we waiting for a white iphone
on your hopes is sort of been dashed
chances are we'll see a cma iphone and
iphone 5 before this guy ever sees a
wide release sort of curious what you
guys have to say I unfortunately don't
have another iphone 4 black model to
compare and contrast for you but here is
yet another look at what a white iphone
would have looked like you guys leave
your comments down below I thought it'd
be fun to sort of redress this i'm jon
rettinger from TechnoBuffalo i'll see
you the next video bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
