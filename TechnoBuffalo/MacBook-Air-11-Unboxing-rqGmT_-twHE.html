feliz ano nuevo what's up everybody
happy new year I I meant that all
sincerity I don't speak Spanish very
well but you know what I'm trying to
find a new new catchphrase here for my
new gig with technobuffalo and the
meantime I figure I'm just going to say
hello to people and you know a bunch of
different languages so we'll start out a
little happy new year spanish-style I
hope it in manga language too much but
the sentiment was sincere anyway enough
of that I just got my technobuffalo new
employee welcome package it uh
apparently used to say caution be
careful but that got x doubt so whatever
is in here I hope it's not broken let's
find out
alright so in the box in my new employee
welcome kit part 1 because I hear
there's a part two coming I think part
two will be is exciting is this if
perhaps not consisting of things that
plug into the wall anyway in the box
we've got microsoft office for mac 2011
home version we have got the macbook air
superdrive this is a what do we have
here costs only nine dollars that's what
I know it's a DVD CD reader writer
burner USB 2 0 and then you know the
reason we all came out for the show the
macbook air my new corporate laptop I'm
going to be putting this thing through
its paces at CES because I'll tell you
what blogging a show a trade show is a
lot of fun but it's a lot of work it's
really tiring you're on your feet all
day you're running around from event to
event especially at CES you're running
literally all over this convention
center that's the size of like I don't
know 10 or 20 or five million football
fields then there's a lot of events
off-site at hotels and nightclubs and
all this stuff and yeah i know i said
nightclubs and you're like all its bunch
of geeks dancing with our laptops no we
don't dance we just blog on stuff that's
our jobs so having the smallest lightest
easiest to carry equipment possible
actually really makes a big difference
so i'm very psyched to have this in time
for CES and very curious to see how it's
going to hold up ah because as you guys
know I do a lot of it you remember you
don't know I don't know you know who I
am if you know what I used to do before
the shower or not but I make a lot of
videos I hope you watch them or you know
at least comment on them cuz bad press
is better than no press at all right no
for real I hope you watch hope you enjoy
them but you know I make a lot of videos
so we'll have to see how this thing
holds up you know lower lower powered
processor then the macbook pro I've been
using but faster flash drive performance
you know the SSD Drive internal flash
memory and then I've got that el gato
chip which is my secret weapon in
producing videos on the go so in the box
you get the computer which I
showed you you got the power adapter
here the Apple modular power adapter so
you can you know use it just like this
plug the brick ran to the wall or you've
got the extension cord and one thing I
always found interesting about these is
that the extension cord is grounded with
the three prong but the break is not if
you just use the adapter on the brick
yeah I don't know maybe somebody out
there who understands electricity better
than I do i do can explain if there's a
different performance or safety wise i
don't think there is but who knows your
little designing California pamphlet
hello there you go with the computer
itself this is the 11 inch model it's
got a 1.6 gigahertz Intel processor it's
got all this this film on it no some
people out there like the sound of the
film being removed that is that nice set
doing it for you all right here's the
computer self man it is really really
small and thin and lightweight this
wedge shape you know I personally have
always had sort of a love-hate affair
with pretty much all the technology
companies but I work with not the people
that people generally are great but the
companies themselves you know it's like
I love the products and then I always
find things to nitpick about and with
Apple you know it's like a lot of their
products I think are so cool and so
elegant and beautifully designed they
also you know their their computers in
particular i just i like using the
software using OS 10 and the OS 10
software especially for multimedia
production end up playing people who use
you know pc software for that same stuff
too so it's just it's just a matter of
taste and there are apple computers in
my elementary school is probably where i
got started but we know whatever you
want to say about them you know I is a
computer like this the best buy on the
market you know is it like if you're
looking for just the most value for your
money probably not for everybody you
know the 11 inch screen probably isn't
for everybody you know paying extra to
get something smaller
lighter weight but a little bit
underpowered isn't you know certainly
for everybody but I'm all geeked out man
to have this thing and take it with me
to Vegas because it is to to to to do
can I get out of here please help help
help me I guess I have to listen to the
intro do to turn the volume off due to
do bienvenido do to to do to to to come
on man all right welcome to X I'm going
to get my macbook pro 13-inch just to
show you but oh no I'm sorry I don't
finish the specs where the rest of the
specs on this thing put this on the
table it'd be funny if in my first
unboxing video in video for
TechnoBuffalo with my brand-new
TechnoBuffalo laptop it fell off the
table and broke that'd be funny wouldn't
be that funny I'm not going to do it
here we go so one point so 11.6 inch
alright so here we go 11.6 inch 1.6
gigahertz processor 4 gigs of ram 128
gigabyte flash storage is an intel core
2 duo processor with three bags of level
shared level 2 cache it has the nvidia
geforce 320m graphics processor 256 megs
of ddr3 RAM you've got the 11.6 inch
1366 x 768 screen so even though it's a
you know a smaller screen than the
13-inch you know it's got plenty of
pixels you've got the isight camera you
only got one USB port you know that's
what Apple does right they do these
things reports and things like that to
drive people crazy drive me crazy
frankly but you know ah it's part of the
deal I I suppose so all right so here's
my here's my 13-inch macbook pro on the
right and the 11.6 inch air on the left
and you know you can see you know
size-wise you know a noticeable
difference relatively speaking they're
both you know small computers 1280 by
800
on the the pro and again the air with
more pixels 13 whatever it is x 768 so
I'm you know you've actually I should be
able to do I'm squinting but i already
wore glasses you can see those nice
stylish glasses so it's not like I've my
sight to worry about it's already gone
but I should be able to do my work in
there as a matter of if you know the
internal flash storage can sort of make
up it's faster than the hard drive and
this thing and can that make up for the
slower processor on board and then
combined with that el gato chip I used
exporting videos it's really my main
concern performance-wise importing
editing and exporting videos for what I
do is the biggest thing minimal photo
processing and I don't do a lot of heavy
photoshop so we'll see by the time you
watch this you don't have to wait
because right now boom we'll get on to
the review</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
