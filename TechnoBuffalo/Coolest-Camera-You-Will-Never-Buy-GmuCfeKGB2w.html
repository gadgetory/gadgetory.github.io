TechnoBuffalo now most of you are
probably not old enough to remember
having filmed on super 8 I certainly
missed the boat sadly McCoy Dax gives me
a second shot with a new super 8 camera
and you guys too actually it's supposed
to be the ideal mix of what is analog
and what is great about super 8 and new
digital technology in 2016 let's go
ahead and take a look so let's clear a
couple things up it is not a digital and
analog camera meaning it doesn't shoot
video digitally while shooting with film
this was a common misconception CES this
year the truth is it just shoots 8
millimeter film the digital aspects are
the audio input which is a 3.5
millimeter jack which records audio
directly onto an SD card this takes away
the problem of not having audio which
was an issue that a lot of super 8
cameras have had in the past they've
also fitted a flip-out LCD screen in
place of what would traditionally be an
optical viewfinder or rangefinder with
that being said kodak did reinvent the
process of shooting on film
traditionally it's been a very
time-consuming laborious process you
shoot on film and then you have to go
get the film process to yourself and
then you got to find a way to digitize
it kodak is simplifying all of this
they're sort of creating a round-trip
package where you buy the film from them
because they're one of the only film
manufacturers left ship it off to them
they process the film they will digitize
it in a 4k skin for you send you back
the processed film and the digital video
clip now a lot of the details are kind
of hazy because what we looked at was a
non-working prototype there's been some
fluctuations on where this is going to
be priced but the general idea is that
there's going to be a first round of
2000 made this main price somewhere
between 500 to $1,000 and then the
second round which is gonna be price
potentially lower again these are just
speculations we don't know for sure at
this price point I think the super 8
camera is very accessible for a lot of
people that being said I don't think a
lot of people are really going to be
interested in it I think it really is
for a niche market at the moment people
who are gonna love this or people who
just love shooting on film who get the
magic of the photochemical process this
is not going to be for your average
digital filmmaker videographer simply
because you're limited to about 15
minutes per cartridge of 8 millimeter
film
meaning that you have to conserve what
you shoot you have to be much more
precise about going and covering what
you want to cover for some people this
is really going to be a blessing in
disguise pushing their creativity for
others it's really just going to be a
hassle functionality aside the highlight
of this camera for me is the design it
was designed by yves behar who also
designed stuff for jawbone and a ton of
other awesome companies and the camera
is absolutely gorgeous the prototype we
saw was a little boxy er than the
rounded design we saw online but in all
honesty both look great get a top handle
and of course you get the classic pistol
grip as well so that's it for the Kodak
super a granite is just a prototype but
I already want one let me know you guys
think in the comments below is this for
you is it still too much work with super
8 or is it the perfect balance of analog
and digital let me know what you think
in the comments below leave us a thumbs
up and go ahead hit that subscribe
button see you guys the next video I
repeated myself</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
