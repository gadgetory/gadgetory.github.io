to you by Linda calm welcome back to
their pursuit of asta Buffalo I'm your
host Jon renders to show you could ask
me any question you've got from the wide
world of technology don't know what
might be coming from google don't know
what to make of all these apple iphone
5s rumors don't know what happened to
the inside John's mind channel all these
and more questions you will have answers
to in just a few short minutes this is
asked to Buffalo let's go ahead and get
asking the first question comes from
Larkhill who asked hey John what things
are you most excited about for Google
i/o so Google i/o has become really fun
over the past few years we've seen huge
product announcements we seen big ones
like the Nexus 7 and some duds like the
Nexus Q this year though I think we're
gonna see a ton of awesome stuff come
from google what I'm most excited about
though is the next iteration of Android
no more point updates we are going to
see a fresh android 5.0 presumably going
to be dubbed key lime pie I really
respect what Google does every year you
can rest assure there's going to be a
new update to Android I don't always
like all the new features but you'd like
they're always constantly trying to
innovate find new ways to make up and
kiss them better bringing cool new
features so I'm really excited to see
what those next features are going to be
and the rumor mills been relatively
quiet on what key lime pie is going to
have so that's why I'm the most excited
about it there aren't too many times we
get to go into a conference nowadays we
don't know what's going to be announced
and I'm hoping that it stays a twix I
would still love some of that wonder to
be dispensed on me at Google i/o and I
of course be there bring you all the
latest expect an update to the nexus 7
maybe the nexus 7 to maybe Nexus 7
squared maybe the next is 8 who knows
fingers crossed for something to the
Google glass so I'm super excited to try
that out so if we had hoped aunt your
question as our next question comes from
the very awesomely last named Jeremy
cougar Hayes who says hey John do you
think phones are beginning to max out
spec wise since we're already seeing
1080p screens high megapixel cameras and
quad core process you think we have hit
a plateau until something completely new
comes around
so that's the cool thing about
competition say what you will about
Apple or Android or whatever Android
manufacturer Samsung HTC competition is
great competition is perfect for you and
me because it makes companies compete
and put out better products megapixels
are getting higher processors are
getting higher I think we're really on
the cusp of the next set of innovations
we're hearing rumors that the next
iPhone might have fingerprint scanning
you've already seen that sort of on
Android with the old atrix a brad
something like that is going to become
the new commonplace thing I think it's
very cool to be at the time when new
things are coming and not saying okay a
new phones coming in love a little
better camera have a little more ram a
little faster processor and here you go
it's pretty much same as last year's I
do think the next generation of phones
are coming very quickly and perhaps that
will begin with Google's i/o or the next
iPhone so fully that helped answer your
question the next question comes from
Ryan bulli who asks when will inside
John's mind come back I've got an answer
for you so inside John's mine is another
channel that I started where I talked
about stuff I did not do with technology
things I was going on in my life well
it's gonna be coming back very soon cuz
I have a big announcement to make not
right now I'm making it soon and I will
be talking about all that stuff that
goes with it over on the inside John's
mind channel the next question comes
from mg executors who asks AT&amp;amp;T is
accepting HTC One pre-order starting
April fourth should I go for the
pre-order the reason why I'm asking that
I have yet to see reviews of the samsung
galaxy s4 the reason gevinson refuse
Owens not Oh yet not even been out yet
under embargo nobody's got one to review
so I've had a chance to spend enough
time in the galaxy s4 to really tell you
I spent with it you know there's a few
minutes at the announcement it's a great
phone it was quick the screen was
beautiful I was I definitely an
evolution over the galaxy s3 so I can't
put those two head-to-head for you just
yet once i get them both in my hand
certain i'll be able to help you but it
will say right now I love the HTC One as
I mentioned in my review it's a first
phone since the iphone 4 that I would
happily sign my name on a two-year
contract for if you're really anxious to
me want to get a new phone now I can
unequivocally recommend the HTC One now
the one caveat to that is if you have to
have expandable storage then certainly
the HTC one's knocking off of that or if
you like to carry extra batteries and
want a removable back you know then HTC
one's not gonna offer that the
expandable storage arguments that I
totally get a lot of people rely on
expandable storage the battery stuff
that one doesn't really read
make that much with me i always carry
external battery charger with me when i
travel anyway so i'm very easy just to
you know plug that in and let it charge
instead of carrying an extra battery
that I have to find another way to
charge so hopefully doped answer
