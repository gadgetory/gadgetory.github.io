enger' here with an unboxing for you of
the iPhone 3GS that was just released
today June 19
let's go ahead and open it up this is a
pre-order from the Apple stores how it
shipped in just a thin cardboard box so
we'll cut the tape here and let's see
what we have inside and be sure to stick
around to the channel I'll be doing ton
of comparison videos of the iPhone with
the Palm Pre and speed tests and the
like so let's go ahead and open this up
as you can see I got the white model 16
gigabyte white I've got a 16 gig 3G that
never even came close to filling up so I
thought 16 would still cover me pretty
nicely let's zoom in here just a bit and
the box should look very familiar to you
it looks relatively close to what we saw
for the 3G except now it's got the
compass icon and the voice memos iPhone
3GS on the side on the back just some
information what it includes more iPhone
3GS and the Apple logo on the top so
without much ado let's go ahead and dig
in
well cut the plastic and I really like
it Apple let people pre-order these so I
don't have to break the lines at the
Apple stores and you can activate these
things at home and actually open it
yourself without having a Apple employee
do it for you
then pull off the plastic and the box
slides open much like the past iPhones
have and there's the phone right on top
there is no phone right there just hard
plastic and I got the white version so I
could tell the difference between the my
3G and the 3GS I'm going to give the 3G
to my father here's a present so pull
that out put that off to the side for
one moment and we'll keep digging in and
see what we get in the box pull up the
tab
you've got a hard plastic tray that
holds the phone designed by Apple in
California see this has the fingertips
so there's
the sim removal tool it's on the top of
the phone there's a little hole and see
it right there you put that sim removal
tool and it pulls out the SIM tray
finger tips gives you some tips and
tricks on the iPhone iPhone 3GS
some Apple stickers no cleaning cloth
though I came with the 3G so let's keep
checking through the box you've got the
USB adapter to power for the wall with
the green sticker let you know it's a
new one not sort of the crappy ones they
initially released with the 3G that
these little prongs are pulling out of
the wall so that was nice to know that
actually getting one that's not going to
kill you your pretty standard iPod
iPhone USB cable and your pretty
standard fare earphones with the volume
up and down and the ability to change
songs and a built-in inline microphone
but the accessories are not why you guys
are watching this video so let's go
ahead and get right to the iPhone 3GS
button pull off all the plastic on it
there is quite a bit pull the plastic
off the front too the only time I'm ever
going to see that screen look that clean
up that many smudges on it
although the 3GS does come with an anti
grease supposedly screen so let's do a
real quick walkthrough of it and we'll
do some size comparisons so you've got
your speaker on the top same as the
older iPhone you've got your home button
on the left side of the device
you've got your ringer to silent switch
you've got your volume up and down
nothing else on the right side you've
got nothing on the top you've got your
recess 3.5 millimeter headset jack your
power and lock button and on the bottom
you've got your microphone speakers and
the charging port and that's really just
about it 16 gig white I really do like
what I think it looks nice and there is
the much-talked-about
3 megapixel camera which is capable of
30 frames per second video let's compare
to the iPhone 3G and just cool it looks
like you can even tell a difference and
right next to each other really kind of
hard to tell a difference this screen
looks a little bit darker off than the
3G but until I flip them over it's quite
difficult to tell size-wise they look to
be absolutely identical let's flip them
over and the reason I got white so when
these two are next to each other you
could tell the difference to be just
exactly the same let's compare the 3GS
with some other devices that you guys
may know you can get a size comparison
here is the Palm Pre certainly smaller
but much thicker and that's due to the
Prius slide off keyboard and another
phone that you guys may know here is the
blackberry storm for Verizon and the
storm is much fatter actually than the
iPhone you can see that right there so I
just wanted to give you an unboxing of
the iPhone 3GS I hope you enjoy like I
said stick around on the channel we're
going to do a ton of feature videos on
the 3GS speed comparison showing all the
applications comparing you with the 3G
comparing it with the pre really just a
lot of exciting iPhone stuff so be sure
to check out the channel and for
exclusive content following on Twitter
twitter.com slash John for Lakers to ask
me questions we got some contests
occasionally go on over there and I'll
announce live streams so I'll put a link
to that in the sidebar hope you guys
enjoyed and I'll see you the next video
