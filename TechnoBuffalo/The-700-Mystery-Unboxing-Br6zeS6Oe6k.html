dramatic role avoids kind of every kid I
always wanted to be like a super agent
so kind of kind of got to do that like a
little bit with the briefcase it looks
like it belongs like a Bond movie so
Intel sent this to us it's further
extreme rig challenge they also sent me
a page of instructions I've never been
that good at instruction so we're gonna
do live and see what we got in here
so there's a three-edged of code which I
need to unlock the case I'm gonna assume
it's in the envelope marked extreme rig
challenge dreamer challenge all about it
people are competing they get a chance
to show off at PAX March in March 12 at
the unlock code is 777 so let's go ahead
and open this sucker up and see what we
got here all right I've got the sucker
opened up yes I have my all-access pass
to PAX East so I can go and check out to
the extreme rig challenge I've got it
PAX East shirt so I can sleep in it I've
got zero Halliburton for the case
rejections and a lot of instructions for
the case that's probably not that
important here here's exciting stuff
here's the Intel Core i7 unlocked and we
did one of these in the past and when we
did it the past we touch the pins so I'm
not going to touch the pins on this guy
but you can see the me ecstatic there it
is in all its glory and fastness the i7
7700 K looks like a beast its seventh
gen Cabul 8 KB copy Ruby Lake processor
I've got a clock speed of 4.2 gigahertz
with 4 5 gigahertz turbo boost 8
megabytes cache you can overclock that
thing if you care about the benchmark
should probably do that 28% faster
speeds in the last gen and it's about
250 bucks when I looked it up online
the SSD is the 600 P series we've got
one that's one terabyte crazy fast it's
three
times faster than SATA SSD it's got
built-in 3d NAND technology crazy fast
read speeds at 1,800 megabytes per
second and about 560 ish on the right
side and this is the small end point Q
form backer and also when I looked it up
online looks like it's about 350 as well
it's a whole idea behind this is people
are competing to build the ultimate
gaming rig and they're gonna be crowning
the winners PAX East there are 12 system
builders that are competing you guys you
guys can vote if you'd like to the
public's gonna decide which seven teams
get to go to pack these to unveil their
rigs in March I can also get involved in
the contest by casting a vote we'll pull
up information down below in case you
want to cast your vote but you just use
a hashtag rig challenge sweepstakes you
can vote up to one time per day through
March 11th so if you want to build your
own computer you've always want to build
your computer even my are people that
have always built their own computer you
should vote and get involvement contests
pretty cool go to rig challenge in
Telkom and get boating because it's a
cool thing to do and you can show me how
to build the best computer I'm gonna do
it it's gonna be awesome
thank you guys for watching let me know
down below what other components think I
should use if you have any suggestions I
appreciate it cases sure Drive
notifications are done so you know when
new videos are coming your video a
