Hazleton from TechnoBuffalo I'm here in
New York City checking out the brand new
surface pro 4 it was just announced
today you're looking at a Windows 10
device obviously it's got a brand new
keyboard has a much larger 12.3 inch
display you're looking at a 27 36 x 18
24 pixel resolution that gets you about
267 pixels per inch and it's a 3.2
aspect ratio under the hood you're
looking at Intel m3 for the low-end
processor and that starts at eight
ninety-nine and of course you can move
up to six generation Intel Core i5 or i7
processors the pen on the side there
it's a new magnetic attachment instead
of the weird sort of clip-on sticker
that we had last time on the right side
here you've got the micro USB port and
DisplayPort and the charging port and
then up top you've got the volume
control buttons on the power button and
then of course there's the pen you can
just pop it on and off like that so it's
attached easily with a magnet and then
now we have the completely redone
keyboard if you look here it's spaced a
bit differently than before zoom in a
little bit so it's a lot easier touch
yard you can see the back like just
activated to get nice back like it does
have a little flex to it i've noticed
while using it and also the trackpad has
been enlarged so it should give you a
lot more room than it did before it on
some models where i was just touching
there you'll be able to to jump on with
a fingerprint so usually just use your
fingerprint to log in or otherwise you
have windows hello right up top and a
full set of Windows 10 right here so all
the applications you need to expect that
we saw the surface pro 3 and everything
like that and the screen looks really
nice really sharp and obviously you can
use the pen pop it off at any time hit
the top button we've got one note you
can draw on the display you can detach
it easily just like before it's attached
with magnets on the bottom there and
just moving around again you can see
it's nice and thin it's thinner than
before at the 3.5 millimeter head
headphone jack right there looks like a
great tablet we can't wait to try it out
and play with it a bit more should be
shipping soon you can pre-order already
