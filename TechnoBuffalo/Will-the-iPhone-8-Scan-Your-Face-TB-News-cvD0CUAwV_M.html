iPhone 8 in this episode of TV news
we've heard the old rumors for a while
now
perhaps a 5.7 a 5.8 oled screen wrapping
all the way around the fingerprint
sensor being built right into the screen
new camera sensors different sizes
something we haven't heard yet just
surfaced from Cowen and company analysts
who's claiming that we are going to have
facial recognition built into the phone
to save you the time Andra did do it
first in fact I think actually Microsoft
did it first with Windows Phone we don't
know if it's gonna be some sort of
retinal scanning or facial recognition
but somehow the iPhone 8 if you want to
believe Kalyn and company is going to
have facial and/or gesture recognition
so here's the full quote so Timothy our
Curie the analyst said and I quote
features appear to include some form of
facial gesture recognition supported by
new laser sensor and infrared sensor
mounted near the front-facing camera as
expected and should also finally include
wireless charge a finally I've been
saying wireless charging like every year
on the iPhone for the past like five so
eventually I'm gonna be right and I'm
gonna brag on that year that I knew it
was coming I just had foresight like six
years ago so what did I mean is is gonna
happen who knows looks like the iPhone
is really starting to take shape
although we're still about eight and a
half months from the September 2017
launch you're still ok with your iPhone
7 or 7 plus so again the rumours look
like we're gonna have three different
phones perhaps if this facial
recognition is gonna reserve for that
top line phone that's gonna have that
OLED display with a glass back allegedly
as well as if your fan the iPhone 4
design you're going to be happy
hopefully iPhone eight you don't have to
have directions on how to hold it
properly to get signal reception so
bushel recognition is kind of cool it
can be used for security perhaps in
place of or to supplement some sort of
touch ID for app but such ID sensor is
going to go away maybe they couldn't get
it to work in the screen I could also
just be used to unlock your phone and a
kind of cool and novel way also smile
recognition take pictures LG's got it
tickle smile snaps so iPhone eight rumor
shaping up September launch coming soon
you excited about this do you care if
you're already bolted to Android are you
waiting to get that hot new phone
supposedly we'll also have better
waterproofing Oh a up to ip68 so hey
that's good
so next time I'm generating architecting
a Buffalo pointing a lot you guys do is
yell at me I just just take you late too
much so this is for you see you guys see
you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
