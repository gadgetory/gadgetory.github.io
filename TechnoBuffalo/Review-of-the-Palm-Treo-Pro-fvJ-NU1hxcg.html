lakers calm a review for you of the palm
treo pro so let me go over the specs on
device or at least some of the ones you
care about it's running windows mobile
6.1 it's got Wi-Fi it's got bluetooth
it's got GPS it's got all everything
you'd expect a high-end windows mobile
business phone to have and really puts
it in a very thin thin package you can
view pdf's you can edit Word Excel
PowerPoint documents it's got 3g and
edge for global support 3g just for 18
key bands in a USA and I mean it's just
so thin in tiny so let me go ahead and
give you a quick size comparison move
the camera down here's the palm treo pro
to compare it to another device of a
similar form factor here's the
blackberry bold significantly thinner
thinner on that side let's compare it to
sort of some more phones in the mix
we've got the blackberry storm stack
them on top of each other actually it's
almost exactly the same size as a
blackberry storm there's a thickness
comparison for you and let's add
everybody's favorite or at least my
favorite phone the iPhone to the mix so
size-wise compared to the iphone it's
much thinner size-wise appears to be a
little bit thicker but not by much and
for another windows mobile comparison
here's the AT&amp;amp;T fuze with a slide-out
QWERTY keyboard a little bit wider and
significantly thinner due to the lack of
slide out keyboard so I've been a trio
user in the past I had a treo 600 I have
a treo 650 even more recently I had a
treo 750 for AT&amp;amp;T so I've tried the palm
operating system amount of tried windows
mobile and while the palm operating
system for its time was amazing fat
solid and robust
it's aged significantly and palm has
moved away a little bit from their core
operating system to accommodating
windows mobile I'm admittedly not the
biggest windows mobile aficionado or fan
out there and I was expecting really big
things from palm you know and a
four-factor this nice this small miss
pocketable actually hoping they were
going to WoW me with little tweaks in
here there to make Windows Mobile much
more usable and they really didn't
you're left with standard Windows Mobile
that you find on any other device even
the HTC fuze for example put the htc's
touchflo 3d on it for some 3d navigation
and to make Windows Mobile just easier
to use palm really did not so that was
definitely disappointing you're left
with just a standard windows mobile
interface which is really showing its
age significantly in my opinion positive
the device though I mean the size and
design of it really is the most
beautiful device Pop has ever done I
really give them credit for it they
crammed a line to a teeny tiny little
package and it's gorgeous too it really
is a nice device everything down from
the box which you saw me unbox to the
phone itself I'm a really doing a
fantastic job as of yet a carrier has
not picked this up so it's only
available unlocked from palm themselves
with which I believe is one hundred five
hundred and forty nine dollars but
they're rumors that there may be a cdma
variant coming to sprint so if your
sprint customer and you're looking at
this envy you may want to hold off and
it could be coming your way soon so guys
you know in conclusion can I recommend
this device if your windows mobile
business user and you're looking for
something thin and profitable it's a
great alternative it is very expensive
cuz it's unsubsidized as I mentioned
before at 549 bucks so it's really not a
bargain I think there are better deals
out there for phones reception wise it
was fine add a little bit of white noise
on my end and people talking T so they
could hear an echo but nothing too bad
that was only in one or two instances
and I use the phone for a quite a while
it doesn't ship with opera mobile 9.5 or
anything like that you're stuck with
pocket internet explorer so if you do
get this download a third-party browser
please pocket and an explorer is aging
so badly
I mean its aging like I want so that's
just alone I mean just looks bad so I
can't recommend a device to everybody on
a one-to-five scale I give it a solid
maybe two and a half and that's really
just because of design design is
fantastic so my overall taken opinion on
the palm treo pro hope it was helpful
and if you're looking to get the phone
you know shoot any questions you might
have my way put them down below and I
will check them out this device has to
go back to Palm cells be the last video
i will make actually having it
unfortunately but i hope this was
helpful and yes the last point I want to
make is in regards to the keyboard here
I get a lot of questions about that it
is a very small kind of Chiclets and
centro stile keys but i just typing on
actually very very quickly I don't have
the biggest thumbs in the world but you
know the relatively decent and I got
used to it I think you will too so
typing was not an issue you know on the
phone so guys jon rettinger with john
