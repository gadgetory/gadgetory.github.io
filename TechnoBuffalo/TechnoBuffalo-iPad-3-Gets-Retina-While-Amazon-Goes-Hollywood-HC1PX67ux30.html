ipad with a Retina display amazon gone
hollywood / tablets twitter and facebook
at war again but this time over photos
and an exclusive look at the next
generation blackberry on video so many
rumors so little time but that's why
you've got us it's techno Buffalo's
rumor roundup hey what's going on
everybody I'm Noah Kravitz
editor-at-large for TechnoBuffalo and
I've got your rumor roundup for the week
ending Friday jun 17 2011 lots to talk
about so let's get right to it first off
you can get more on all these stories
over at our website technobuffalo com
you can also follow us on Twitter on
Facebook all that stuff you know the
deal let's get to the news is there a
new flagship Android phone coming and if
so is it going to arrive in time to
bring ice cream sandwiches your
thanksgiving dining table it looks like
that might be the case some ruhr surface
this week about a phone being referred
to as the nexus 4g which would be the
next in google's line of nexus devices
that are stock android phones meant to
show off the capabilities of the latest
version of the google android operating
system now in this case that would be
android 4.0 often referred to or refer
to internally to as ice cream sandwich
ice cream sandwich has been talked about
and previewed a little bit back at
google's i/o developer conference a
month or so ago but there are no device
is currently running Ice Cream Sandwich
nor any official indication of when it
will arrive and on what phones other
than sometime this fall well a
Thanksgiving launch of a new Nexus phone
would certainly fit the bill and it
looks like this phone is going to pack a
full 720p HD display no information was
given on what size the screen might be
other than that its massive in a world
where we've already got a 4.5 inch
display on the Samsung Infuse I don't
even want to know what massive my
mean but apparently it's going to be
full 720 720 p which would be 1280 by
720 pixels much more than the current
high end android phones the pack of 960
x 540 qhd display also rumored for the
phone is full 1080p video capture an
advanced still camera sensor that's
limited to only 5 megapixels but as
superior low-light performance which as
our own Mike Pearlman pointed out in his
awesome article the megapixel conspiracy
is much more important than pure
megapixel count when it comes to catcher
at capturing good photos especially on
devices like camera phones where you
can't fit in a giant camera sensor with
with mechanical tools like optical zoom
so whatever the specs are a
next-generation camera sensor you've got
that HD display you've got HD video
capture and apparently this thing is
going to be powered by a dual-core
processor likely either a TI OMAP or a
qualcomm snapdragon running it either
1.2 or 1.5 gigahertz now one thing about
that name Nexus 4G would point to a true
4G experience there's already a nexus
phone called the nexus s 4g which is
sprint's version of the nexus s so that
name might have to be changed to avoid
consumer confusion but our early reports
rumors are pointing to a possible Google
AT&amp;amp;T partnership with the Nexus 4G being
the first smartphone to run on AT&amp;amp;T LTE
network which is what they're trying to
move towards right now they've got hspa+
devices that they're calling for g but
really that that's my sarcastic quotes
because i don't think AT&amp;amp;T s 4g is
really 4g at this point they're a array
18t is moving towards LTE like what
Verizon has right now in the US and this
might neither be their first device it
would also be the first Nexus device to
launch on AT&amp;amp;T so stay tuned I'm sure we
going to hear much much more about
whatever this phone is whenever it's
coming but I like the idea of ice cream
sandwiches to go with my pumpkin pie at
Thanksgiving dinner speaking of massive
displays with massive resolution some
rumors of information coming out of the
iOS 5 beta build that point to a
possible full-on retina display and a
forthcoming iPad now if you're a
hardcore nerd
just like to follow the hardcore nerd
news you may already know that these
beta versions of software particularly
now in the mobile space are often
treasure troves of all kinds of
interesting information that our
rumormonger nerds like me like to put
together and try to make stories out of
so a story came out this week that in
the Twitter framework twitter is deeply
integrated in Apple's new iOS 5
operating system and apparently in the
Twitter framework section of the iOS 5
beta that's now available to developers
or folks who signed up as developers and
apples program there's some information
pointing to a display resolution that
we've never seen before in a build of
iOS that display resolution is 1536 by
2048 which is double not double the
actual resolution but double the
dimensions of the current ipad and ipad
2 dimensions 1536 by 2048 would be an
insane number of pixels but would give
an iPad device something with that nine
inch display a full-on retina display
ready this way is the term that Apple
made up when they launched the iphone 4
and wanted to explain that the pixel
density on the iphone 4 screen is so
dense there's so many pixels per inch
that it's literally more than the human
eye then the human retina can actually
process and deal with and so what you
get is just a maxed-out display in terms
of pixels per inch something that the
human eye thinks is the same as print or
that's you know what Apple wants you to
believe anyway and you know you can
spend us facts and information facts are
useful and emergencies to quote David
Byrne but anyway what we've got is
evidence perhaps pointing towards a
Retina Display coming on an ipad size
device an ipad 3 and i'll tell you what
technobuffalo editor-in-chief Sean and I
have a little side bet going on whether
or not there's going to be a new iPad
this year I say there will be a new iPad
or an iPad like device from Apple this
year and I'm saying is going to come at
their September event that used to be
all about the new iPads shawn says I'm
crazy so the loser of that bed has to do
something kind of fun and embarrassing
to be put up on our on our video channel
so stay tuned for that little
I bet if you care about such things that
will be decided to later on but evidence
perhaps of an ipad 3 or a new device
from apple with a Retina display stay
tuned speaking of Twitter as you may
know leading up to the iOS 5
announcement Twitter rolled out their
own in-house photo-sharing service photo
hosting service so now instead of using
twitpic or yfrog or what have you
twitter is encouraging folks and by
default when you upload a photo to
Twitter it goes to their own brand new
service or will be it's being rolled out
now to users their own service that they
built they've built in conjunction with
photobucket so this led to the
announcement of deep Twitter and Twitter
integration including photos and all
kinds of other things in iOS 5 not
necessarily as a response to that but
the timing is interesting some
information leaked earlier this week
about a supposed new photo sharing photo
management app for iphone that Facebook
is building this is important because
photo sharing photo hosting has become
huge especially in the past six to 12
months instagram has taken off like a
rocket like we said Twitter's decided to
go in-house so that they can control and
they can build the database of photos
and whatever we're going to do with it
the integration they needed to launch
the iOS 5 stuff and you might not know
this but Facebook has an insanely huge
database of photos uploaded by their
users one statistic I read said that
facebook users are currently uploading
six billion not six million but six
billion photos every month to Facebook
that's on top of some 80 billion photos
already hosted on facebook I mean that's
crazy but if you think about anything
about the number of facebook users out
there and the number of idiotic photos
of your night out on the town that you
posted i think i'm talking about myself
last week and you know it adds up pretty
quickly the six billion photos a month a
lot of those coming from iphone users
because there are a lot of iphone users
a lot iphone users who use facebook and
apparently facebook's working on they've
been working for a while on this brand
new native iphone app to deal with it
all from the screen grabs and the data
that i saw it actually looks pretty cool
you go over to TechnoBuffalo comm check
out our coverage on it it links out to
some further coverage from some other
sites around the web
but screen grabs and information it
looks like you can do it all you can
upload you can tag people's faces you
can caption the photos you can like and
tag other people's photos I think you
might be able to deal with our videos as
well as photos but then you can group
the photos arrange them according to the
time of the events the location of the
events the people who were tagged in the
events all kinds of stuff you can set
your privacy settings who you share the
photos of the thing you know all that
kind of stuff from an app that looks
very native iOS 5 is interesting some of
the comments on the story we ran about
the supposed photo app didn't even deal
with the photo app and they said you
know you think Facebook would fix all
the bugs in their normal facebook app
for iphone before they worried about
building a photo apps so you know you
can win out with your own experience
using the facebook app on that one but
it looks like we may be seeing a brand
new comprehensive photo sharing photo
management tool for iphone users from
facebook in the near future speaking of
videos and I wasn't really speaking of
videos but you know everything's
converging so much photos and videos and
tablets and phones and and using Twitter
and Facebook and all them that is easy
for me to make up transitions and segues
from one story to the next yeah it's
good enough i mentioned video when i
start about the facebook app and
speaking of video there it is more
rumors about the Amazon tablet that we
all a TechnoBuffalo definitely believe
is coming a believe is coming sometime
this year and I even think it's going to
be running Android on Intel we've seen
Android on Intel demoed but this may be
one of the first if not the first real
big product to run android on an intel
chipset for mobile we'll see I don't
know anyway android tablet only almost
certainly coming sometime this year
whether it's branded is a color kindle
or something separate that has a kindle
app whatever it is we're almost sure to
see it and some reports this week that
the project is codenamed hollywood
inside of amazon and one of the reasons
maybe that amazon is going to sweeten
the deal for people who buy the device
or maybe for the early adopters who buy
it first and offer free movie streaming
service with the purchase of the device
Amazon's got you know they've got all
kinds of stuff they've got their their
video on demand service they've got now
a certain subset of that available for
free if you're an Amazon Prime
subscriber of course they've got their
own appstore for android they've got
their cloud music player with the music
locker and everything and it looks like
they're prepping a device a piece of
hardware to bring this all together
under the amazon flag we've been talking
about this internally like I said Tecna
Buffalo for a while some articles on the
site you can go back and read I wrote
one about how I think Amazon is actually
poised to battle Apple head-to-head
better than anybody else in the space
because if they can get a piece of
hardware going they've already got the
rest of the ecosystem when it comes to
selling content they sell music they
sell movies they sell books and then
they sell something that nobody else
including Apple can offer which is
lawnmowers and barbecues and diapers and
all kinds of stuff so I mean if they
bundle in you know a prime membership
and some free movies and some deals of
the day and all that kind of stuff they
kind of hinted at this with the the
Kindle that you can buy for was it 25
bucks cheaper if you deal with some
Amazon ads kind of hinting at that I
think they may go kind of full-on on a
tablet with bundling and all kinds of
extras that only amazon is really
situated to offer that might I don't
know might redefine the idea of what it
takes to compete with the ipad which
whether you think it's the best or than
or not it's the leading tablet out there
in the market right now so very
interested to see but but new fuel for
the fire for the rumor fire this week
about Amazon and a tablet and some sort
of free streaming music service movie
service rather being part of the deal
want to mention real quick before I get
to the last bit of rumor news this week
since I was talking about Amazon the
Kindle my gadget of the week my favorite
gadget this week is actually the barnes
&amp;amp; noble nook the new nook they just
released the smaller screen touchscreen
lower price point everything the PR
folks were nice enough to send me one of
these to test out and review i did a
first impressions article on techna
buffalo you can check it out but i've
been reading a lot this week i've been
reading the this new book the oral
history of ESPN which i'm not the best
book in the world but really interesting
if your sports not like i am or just
new broadcast me and stuff but that
aside this device is awesome and it's
awesome I think for two reasons or three
reasons really won the new display
eating pearl is great and the folks at
Barnes &amp;amp; Noble did a lot of work under
the hood to reduce the amount of
flashing that happens when you flip
pages and move through screens you can
see that flash one of the things that is
most frustrating to people who use e-ink
devices but but Barnes &amp;amp; Noble really
did a lot of work to minimize the
flashing and it's great it makes for a
smoother reading experience to the touch
screen combined with the buttons make it
really intuitive and easy to flip pages
and also get around the menu system and
then three this thing is so small and
lightweight and inexpensive that it's
really for me this is the first period
where I've used or I don't care that it
actually doesn't have you know web
browser and a music player and that kind
of stuff I just want to read with it
because it's small enough to carry with
one hand to throw in your bag to not
worry about it and then you know you've
got the whole thing with it you can shop
right on it via Wi-Fi everything it's a
great device I think barnes and noble
did a bang-up job on this and so far the
battery life's been awesome so there you
go quick aside now to get back to the
news last but certainly not least our
own jon rettinger got his hands on the
next generation of blackberries the
blackberry torch to running the latest
build of blackberry OS this thing is not
on the market yet but John was able to
get one had it for a little while did
either bunch of photos and impressions
of it but there's a video tour hands on
video tour of the blackberry torch to on
techna Buffalo definitely check it out
if you're interested in the future of
Lac very very interesting if you recall
the torch not their first touch screen
device that was the storm the ill-fated
not so well-received storm at least by
most people I know one mobile tech
blogger who really liked it but at me
not so much but the torch was
interesting because it combined a touch
screen in a vertical slider the screen
slit up and revealed a full blackberry
keyboard underneath so you kind of had
the best of blackberry with the software
and then the hard keyboard but then also
the best of the new generation of
smartphones with a full touchscreen the
torch to takes that that whole formula
refines it a little more power under the
hood little more refined experience new
build of the BlackBerry OS and very
interesting to see what blackberry does
the rest of the year especially now
since I don't want to keep invoking
Apple but I messenger may be a big deal
poised directly to take on BlackBerry's
blackberry messenger of witches you know
according to some people kind of black
BlackBerry's last foothold in the
enterprise is what BBM can do that
nobody else can do so interesting to see
what blackberry does I to stay pace with
the iphones and the androids of the
world that are really just light in the
mobile market on fire the torch to
definitely one of the first steps
towards that next chapter in blackberry
history so check it out on TechnoBuffalo
com exclusive hands-on video tour of the
torch to with our own jon rettinger all
