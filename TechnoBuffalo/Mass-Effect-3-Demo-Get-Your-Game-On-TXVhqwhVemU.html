senior editor at technobuffalo calm and
I'm here to give you a look at the mass
effect 3 single player' demo
alright so there's quite a bit of
cutscene before this I'm going to try
and skip all of that I'm playing this on
the xbox 360 so you'll often see some
kinect integration going on but before
we get there the reason why I'm cutting
all the or skipping all the cutscenes i
should say is i'm not really looking to
ruin the story for you guys so you're
going to see some cut scene moments pop
up and I'm just pressing X and getting
through them as quickly as I can you can
download the demo right now on the
playstation 3 xbox 360 and pc i believe
with the pc version you have to do some
stuff with origin so if you're not in
origin you may need easily order to get
the demo so sorry for that though I
didn't do it looks good let's go come on
let's keep moving lieutenant commander
you read me so right now i'm following
anderson he's obviously a serious staple
for mass effect and I picked male
Shepherd you can do some customization
stuff at the start of this but you can't
load in your Shepherds they're gonna see
me fight some husks don't make fun of my
shooting
yeesh have to take these things out the
old-fashioned way
so to catch you up if you're wondering
what is going on the Reapers are
invading earth right now the husks are
pretty much their lowest form of
infantry I suppose that's the Reaper
ships that are raining all sorts of red
laser down on the surface commander
shepard at the start of this demo is
being court-martialed for his actions
throughout the course of aspect one and
two won't get into the gory details boom
I'm going to use some of the kinect
features here I could press a but I'll
say open instead and it opened its crazy
actually the kinect features work really
well you'll see it when the combat picks
up and I'm actually fighting alongside
Anderson I'm going to be skipping a big
cut scene here so that's why the video
seems a little bit jumpy so Shepherd and
Anderson right now are on their way to
the Normandy Normandy is obviously
Shepherd ship or his crews currently
stationed you know it
like I said there's a lot of cutscene so
I'm about to head into a bigger battle
here the demo is not too difficult when
it comes to actually fighting Reapers or
any other enemies there is a second
section that involves a lot more action
than this here this is kind of like an
introduction to the game and its
mechanics if you've never played mass
effect before this will take you through
the controls so that was my radial entry
I'm actually not going to use the radial
at all throughout comment i'm going to
use all connect to control Anderson and
I think his one move throughout this
whole thing is concussive shot so it's
pretty easy the way the Kinect
functionality works is you can say see
like when you're normally running if
you're unfamiliar with mass effect you
have two partners with you and that's
kind of your squad so when you're with
two people you control them each if they
have the same ability by saying their
name so you would say liara and then
you'd say your name or you'd say you
know garrus and then you'd say his
ability when I'm solo or when I'm with
two people that have the same or excuse
me two people that have two different
abilities you can just say the name of
the ability you two all right
some more advanced form of reaper the
cannibals they actually use weaponry so
I'm still so low right now you don't see
Anderson's icon there beware my health
and shield basically they're telling me
that I need to go activate a radio and
that's where I understand and I are
going to go right now now you see
Anderson you see the logo there for
concussive shot and I'm just holding the
radial down to show you that's the voice
come in you'd say Anderson concussive
shot or just concussive shot I don't
think we've seen flying Reapers before
in this game it's kind of why I tracked
him with my camera
alright so when I'm targeting someone
you'll see the concussive shot thing
kind of disappear and then cool warm up
there I just said it Anderson used it in
the guy next to us dropped you'll see it
a few more times it's actually pretty
useful if you've played mass effect one
or two then you know that combat
typically flows a little bit slowly
because you're constantly opening up the
rail and using powers I'm not saying
that that's necessarily a bad way to
play it certainly how we played the
first two games and didn't really bother
us it actually gave us time to
strategize in combat and women just more
than just you know run and gun which
isn't really the style to mass effect
here with the Kinect voice integration I
can just keep using it I don't really
have to slow down battle in order to
open up that radial you'll see it here
after I use the radio that's not okay
alright moving off of the pistol picking
up the rifle works for ammo types as
well so you'll see me say incendiary
ammo here I mean how to pronounce that I
just said it so this is Sheppard cool
with this gun and all of a sudden you
have in city area logo
she's obviously very good on my biotic
like films and watch as Anderson's
concussive shop cools off which it's
doing now I'll use it again target I say
it he drops pretty neat if you're
familiar with opening up the radio you
know what it's like to not have voice
controls we won't get to the second
portion of the demo in this video but is
a lot more action heavy so if you guys
do want to check it out i do suggest
playing all the way through to that you
have to play this first more to get to
them and then there is also a
multiplayer arm which we don't even
touch
right as i run out of ammo the normandy
flies in Seth Green totally did that
alright so as this cinematic runs just
want to say this is our first gameplay
video on technobuffalo calm if you guys
like it let us know you can get into the
area of doing more of these I know
you've probably seen the mass spec turi
demo or at least I've heard of it will
do more advanced games if you guys want
to get into that just let us know if you
liked what you saw here give us the
thumbs up or a comment and tell us and I
will push towards doing it more often
let this wind down thank you guys for
watching
I'm not going you saw those men back
there is a million more like them and
they need a leader we're in this fight
together Anderson it's a fight we can't
win not without help we need every
species and all their ships to even have
a chance at defeating the Reapers talk
to the council convince them to help us
what if they won't listen then make them
listen now go that's an order I don't
take orders from you anymore remember
consider yourself reinstated commander
you know what you have to do I'll be
back for you it'll bring every fleet I
can
good luck you to ship</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
