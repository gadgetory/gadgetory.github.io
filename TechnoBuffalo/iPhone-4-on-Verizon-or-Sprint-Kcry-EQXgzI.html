technova flew here with Steve Jobs
walked offstage up this year's worldwide
developers conference keynote you could
hear a collective groan from the Verizon
Sprint customers out there who are
hoping and hoping that the one more
thing was going to be the iphone of
multiple carriers that is finally going
to be set free from the confines of AT&amp;amp;T
however those hopes were dashed and I
want to talk with those little bits I
get email after email every day asking
what about the rumors of the iphone on
verizon what about groomers the iphone
even on sprint so a bit of a background
the united states currently uses two
wireless technologies one called cdma
which verizon sprint use and one which
is a bit more global called gsm which
AT&amp;amp;T and t-mobile use now the iphone
currently is obviously a gsm technology
and there have been rumors obviously
about the iphone being tested on verizon
and with apple generally where there's
smoke there's fire and those rumors have
been 7th quite a bit however i don't
think that we're going to see an iphone
on verizon until the fourth generation
wireless technology comes into play and
not the 4g that spurts is using spray is
using a century of cdma-based fourth
generation technology however AT&amp;amp;T and
Verizon the same fourth generation
technologies something called LTE or
light you may hear called which is gsm
base they both can be using the same
technology for fourth generation phone
which only makes sense that that would
probably be the right time for a cross
carrier phone Apple wouldn't have to go
through and do all the rd of desk on
your device it could be the same device
being used on both carriers however
there's a problem about supporting
legacy things so whether or not you're
gonna be able to do voice over LTE
whether or not they're gonna have to
have a cdma review in any way for data
we just don't know but I would expect
that we're finally going to see an
iphone on verizon with the next
generation I think the iphone 4 is going
to be the last carry exclusive phone
that we see so i don't know if that
helps you guys wondering if you've been
waiting but i would not expect your
verizon iphone any time in 2010 but
certainly I
expect one probably into 2011 possibly
even one on sprint's as well so I don't
mean to dash your hopes but I wanted to
talk about and dress it a little bit
there's been a lot of concerns about 18
Keys network and I think app will almost
address them with the iphone 4 with
those new antennas around the side which
closely are multiple multiple times
stronger on the current tenants that we
have right now so hopefully that will
reduce the dropped call issues so what
do you guys think are you disappointed
do not care about an iphone on verizon
irie finally just going to dump verizon
or sprint and go over to 18 teen for an
iphone 4 anyway really curious to hear
what you guys have to say anyway i'm
john read your from TechnoBuffalo and i
will see you in the next video bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
