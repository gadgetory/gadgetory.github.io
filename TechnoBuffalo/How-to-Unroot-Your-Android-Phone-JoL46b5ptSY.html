TechnoBuffalo and today I'm gonna show
you all how to unroot and put stock
firmware back on your android phone and
just a disclaimer this is technically
your routing video so make sure you
follow the instructions perfectly you
are at your own risk when you do this so
make sure you know that the developers
of the files that we're using and me
myself and TechnoBuffalo are not
responsible for what happens to your
device make sure you know what you're
doing before you continue if you guys
have any issues make sure you check for
robo 13 in the comments that's me that's
my main channels to come check out my
main channel as well for technology
videos but I'll be responding the
comments down there if you have any
issues or you can tweet me it's at DT
Rover 13 and you can find me on Twitter
so many questions you guys have if you
have any problems you run into and I
will try to help you out ok now this
specific tutorial is just for samsung
phones but you can do this with LG
Motorola HTC those kind of phones as
well you just have to download different
files so for LG there's LG PC suite for
Samsung you can also use samsung kies
motorola has this kind of support page
where you can download their specific
files for that and the HTC phones you
use this thing called rom upgrade
utility I just search for your phone and
then stock firmware basically and you
should find the files that you need to
continue with this specific tutorial
this one uses Odin which is good for
Samsung phones but the rest of the kind
of phones won't be able to use Odin to
do this but this is more of a open type
video where I show you guys how to just
unroot and go back to stock on all
phones so just search your phone and
then stock firmware like recovery or
restore or something like that and you
should find other correct files ok so
once you get all your files downloaded I
have the links in the post on technicals
website so make sure you check the first
link in the description down below may
take a few minutes just to get updated
on there so just stay tuned for that
down in the description so you click on
Odin for plus custom route file and once
it download that you also want to get
your stock firmware this one again is
for the i-95 0 5 samsung galaxy s4 so
make sure you have that model if you
were downloading this file so any other
phones again you want to get your
specific files for your device Odin this
this method will work for the Galaxy
Note 2 or the Samsung Galaxy s3 any
basically any Samsung Galaxy phone will
work with this method so if you have one
of those phones you can can you can use
this specific version of Odin and that
kind of stuff but you have a different
phone just grab your correct files so
once you get those files downloaded you
want to put them in a folder I have them
right here see if autoroute and then my
custom stock recovery file right here so
I'm going to extract both of these to a
folder just like this and I have a
WinRAR installed if you guys don't have
that just go search for that online it's
WI n AR AR
and let's see unzip packages and that
kind of stuff so once this finishes I'm
going to do the CF Auto root file right
here and then click extract and ever now
we got two folders right here this one
is the stock firmware as you guys can
see right here it ends in dot MD 5 and
then over here is the CF Auto root and
I'm sure you guys have seen this before
if you have ever rooted a samsung phone
this is odin and then this is the
routing file that we need so this is a
little bit weird we're going to put it
back on stock and then we're actually
going to reroute it to get rid of the
flash counter on the samsung phones most
phones you know if to do this with but
certain phones you do on this phone you
specifically you do actually have to do
this so back to the phone we're going to
plug this into a USB make sure you have
USB debugging on so go into settings go
all the way down go back to more scroll
down to about device if you don't have
developer mode on right there you want
to go to about device scroll down to the
build number and just tap that a bunch
of times and that will actually enable
developer mode right there developer
options click on that scroll down to USB
debugging and check that and make sure
that is turned on ok after you enable
USB debugging it should make a noise on
your computer and it should recognize
your device if it doesn't make sure you
use a different USB cable or a different
USB port because sometimes USB is a
little bit weird with phones and that
kind of stuff so just make sure it
recognizes your
phone go into my computer just to make
sure you can see your phone right there
and if it's if it can see it then you're
good to go now we're going to put our
phone into download mode and we've done
this before as well oh and this is just
in case you guys are on a custom ROM
right now I'm back on stock but I am
rooted right there I have supersu bye
click on this you can see that I am
rooted I can use it this is just to show
you how to get back on stock if you're
using the Google Play edition realm we
were doing a few weeks ago or a
different rom you can still follow this
tutorial to get back onto stock so we're
going to put this into download mode to
do this you're going to actually restart
the phone click on restart and then once
you hit OK you want to hold down on the
volume button and the home button as it
restarts and as it does that it's going
to boot into a download mode right here
just make sure foots back up and then
once you see this screen coming up
you're just going to hit up on the
volume button to put it into download
mode right there and then you're going
to go to your computer and open up odin
so we're going to go into the sea if
autoroute file right here right click on
open and click on run as administrator'
and once this pops up you want to make
sure you have a yellow box right here if
you do that means your phone is
recognized by your computer and you're
good to go we're going to click on PDA
right here and then go find the stock
firmware which is right here in this
folder click on that and just make sure
is the dot md5 file right there and
click open
now it's going to load it in right there
and all you have to do is hit start now
this process takes about five minutes or
so depending on your computer and that
kind of stuff so you can click start and
just let it do its thing if you get a
green pass up here in the top left box
right here that means it worked fine on
your phone you should see a little blue
bar going across it will take a little
while so just let it sit and let it do
its thing and then once it finishes
it'll actually reboot and then will
continue from there ok and as you can
see there it just finished and there's
the green pass that we got on the screen
and right here it will be rebooting into
the stock firmware ok as you can see
here we are back on the stock firmware
there is no root there's no supersu
anything like that but we do want to
actually reroute it to get rid of the
flash counter like I said before so
we're going to put this back in the
download mode
click on restart and click ok now hold
the volume down button and the home
button and let this boot into download
mode and now once you see the little
download mode assembly just want to hit
up on the volume button right there and
you'll see downloading right there and
now you go back to your computer and
restart Odin I'm going to click on Odin
exe run as administrator and now we will
actually want to go find that CF
autoroute file so we click on PDA again
make sure you have the yellow box once
again click on PDA I'm going to go find
the CF autoroute right there in this
file and click open and now hit start
and this will be really quick because
this is just rooting it really really
quick actually getting rid of the root
is a lot simpler than doing it through
Odin and I'll show you how to do that
once we get the flash count or reset so
now this will reboot as you can see here
and we will have supersu and root
permissions to install triangle away
which is the app which will actually let
you reset the flash counter and let you
you know send it back into warranty and
that kind of stuff so once this finishes
we will be right back alright now that
we're back into the stock firmware we're
going to click home button slide to
unlock over make sure you see supersu
right there and click on it just to make
sure it is fully installed if you can go
over to the settings and it doesn't say
anything doesn't give you any pop-ups
that means you are good to go now right
down here if you scroll all the way down
and supersu full unroot is right there
that's how you completely get rid of the
root we're not doing that just yet so
don't click on that we need to actually
go download triangle away now the best
way to do this is to search on the XDA
forums I'll have the link in the
description or in the technical Buffalo
post so make sure you check that out I
do want to actually go on to it on your
phone though but now before we do that
we want to go into settings go over to
more I think and then go to security
scroll down and click on unknown sources
so that you can install apps from other
sources than the Google Play Store now
once you get that I need to turn on
Wi-Fi and we will be right back alright
now the easiest way to find it is just
type in triangle away space XDA
and it's going to be the very first link
in Google just click on that this is the
actual developers link we are not trying
to
steal the APRA anything like that there
is a paid version in the Google Play
Store but he actually offers a free
version through this website it doesn't
have all the features as the paid
version but this will do exactly what we
needed to do and it's free so once you
get to his website just want to scroll
all the way down to the bottom and go
find this little area right here it's a
little bit hard to see but it says
triangle away version 3.0 1.8 PK this is
his file so make sure you go check out
his specific link because this is the
creator of this apk and he is giving it
away for free so go here scroll down so
you can see that it is downloaded click
on this and then you want to hit install
and once you hit install it will
actually install a triangle way for you
now this does not work for every phone
this does work for most phones and most
ones don't actually need to do this it's
mainly Samsung phones I believe but I
could be wrong on that just make sure
you can see if your flash counter is
being logged and make sure you have it
back to 0 or 1 so just search online for
if your phone has a flash counter and
see a triangle way will work for you so
then you click open and once this opens
it'll say it needs root permissions so
just click grant and I'll say detecting
your device and all this stuff and now
this will pop up make sure that is your
device number right there the GT I nine
five zero five is this device and they
will probably say something different
for your phone so just make sure that is
your model number or else this will mess
up your phone so just make sure that's
the correct number click continue and
then click OK and then one more time I'm
going to click no thanks and now you'll
see here if you scroll down my counter
is one because I did actually flash it
with the stock firmware so this does
actually update the counter if you do
flash it with stock so just make sure
you know that I'm right down there you
see reset flash counter so I'm going to
click on that and then once that
finishes it's going to do a bunch of
stuff and just follow the instructions
on the screen and you'll be able to do
this no problem so I'm gonna click on
reset flash counter and it'll say danger
blah blah blah this could break your
device just click continue and then
click continue one more time actually
right here you want to make sure that
you read this it does say it will boot
into download mode and then once you see
the big green android screen press and
hold the power button for 10 seconds and
then it will reboot into its version
of the triangle ways I'm going to click
on continue' and this will actually
reboot the phone it's a download mode
and then we'll go from there so once
this finishes we will hold in the power
button for 10 seconds to reboot the
phone one more time so let's get this
into download mode we don't actually
have to do anything it'll do it itself
just let it do its thing let it put it
into its own version of download mode so
there we go we are in download mode and
now we just have to hold in the power
button for 10 seconds and let it reboot
so holding in right now this will turn
the phone off and then once it turns off
you can actually I believe we can just
let go and it should restart the phone
itself so there we go I'm just going to
let go and since you're plugged in I
think it should just restart the phone
there we go you hear the little haptic
feedback for it and now this should boot
into its little triangle away screen
right here there we go and you can you
can read the description right here to
actually follow the instructions this is
my flash counter is one I'm on a custom
binary and all you have to do is hit
volume up to reset the counter and the
status of your phone so just click
volume up right here let it finish its
thing that says done and now all you
have to do is hit volume up to reboot or
volume down to go back into download
mode I'm gonna go back into download
mode really quick just to show you guys
that I am on a custom or on the stock
firmware and that it is back to stock
the stock numbers for the flash counter
so once this boots back in the download
mode you can see the very top up there
is really hard to tell but you'll be
able to see it for yourself it says
official for the status and there is no
flash counter on it as well so now I'm
going to reboot back into stock OS and
then unroot the phone and then we will
be completely back on stock exactly as
you got it right out of the store if it
boots back into the stock recovery all
you have to do is click reboot phone
it's just a thing the triangle awaited
it's no problem at all and then once
this reboots
we will be able to see the home screen
and then we're going to unroot the phone
through supersu
actually before we unmute it we're
actually going to uninstall triangle way
so we're going to slide to unlock go to
apps go over to settings
I think it's under more go to
application manager and then click on
triangle away and just click uninstall
say ok let that finish and that triangle
away is gone but we are still rooted so
we're going to go over to supersu right
there click on that go to settings
scroll all the way down and click on
full unroot let's click on that and then
click continue now this will completely
unrested
back to flash counter 0 you are back to
the exact same way you got it right out
of the store so make sure you check out
