from TechnoBuffalo here it's gonna
boxing that I'm really excited about
this is the HTC Desire HD a potential
new king to the Android throne let's go
ahead and dig in and see if it lives up
to the hype
alright so the box here is very typical
for HTC especially their unlocked
devices you got the name of the device
right across the top and if the HD in
the name didn't give it away they drew a
picture of an HD camera because of
course this does record video in 720p
you've got a little guy giving you a
thumbs up there HTC quietly brilliant
nothing really on the sides let's go
ahead and look at some of the specs here
and then we will rip into the box so it
does have a 1 gigahertz Snapdragon
processor it's got 1.5 gigs of internal
storage 768 megabytes of RAM from a size
and weight standpoint you can see it
right there it does have a 4.3 inch
touch screen I think of this guy is kind
of like a gsm evo 4G - the 4G
capabilities at the Evo has it does of
course have all the internal antennas
you'd expect although it does not
unfortunately have North American 3G so
if you're on AT&amp;amp;T or even t-mobile this
will not work on your 3G network which
is quite disappointing so let's stop
Bluetooth 2.1
Wi-Fi b/g/n 3.5 millimeter headset jack
serve all the stuff that you'd expect a
megapixel camera with autofocus and
flash and of course 720p video and a
micro SD expansion but enough about me
talking about the device let's go ahead
and dig in and see what this guy does
and what it can do
so we'll bust out Senor stabby on this
and dig into the plastic hopefully
there'll be no blood in this unboxing
which is really never a guarantee with
this ridiculous knife alright plastic
has been cut I have not seen one of
these in person so I'm actually very
excited that we're
just released so desire hd looks like
there is yet another seagull to be
broken right there so go ahead and cut
that there we go now we should be able
slide this guy right out desire hd and
it looks pretty much like it does on the
box go ahead and pull that thing out if
we can sometimes more difficult being
expectant I have to push it from the
bottom there we go so here is the desire
hd push off to the side for just a
minute let's see what else we are going
to get in and the Box probably pretty
typical HDC accessories so some smart
accessories quick guide and contact us
alright we've got it HTC's kind of soft
plastic we've got a a USB charger there
port with an adapter for whatever region
you are going to be in in this case here
is believe one of the European or UK
adapters micro USB charging cable right
here and we've got a stereo headphone
with microphone right here pretty
standard fare for smartphones nowadays
nothing terribly exciting in there
alright so let's push that off now let's
take a look at the phone itself so this
is really what most people want to see
so we've got sort of your typical
capacitive array of buttons down below
and this is skinned by the way with HTC
Sense so we've got your home button your
back button and your search button on
the back there is 8 megapixel camera
with the dual LED flash battery is
inside let's go ahead and bring in
probably its closest counterpart since
this is not a US release phone so we
haven't seen this on any US carriers but
it looks very very very eerily similar
to the Evo 4G pretty much in every way
so screen size buttons obviously look a
little bit different here but
functionality-wise is identical go ahead
and stack them identical thickness if
you look at the back
the back is a little bit different here
you don't have the kickstand found on
the Evo and a little bit more of a
meadow industrial feel wow that feels a
bit more high-quality which is pretty
typical the unlock devices you pay a
premium for these generally you get some
premium material sort of built in this
has been an unboxing and a first look at
the HTC Desire HD stay tuned for a full
overview of the device I'm John revenue
from TechnoBuffalo
and I'll see you in the next video
