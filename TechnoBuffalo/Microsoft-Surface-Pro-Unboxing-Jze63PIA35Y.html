TechnoBuffalo here that unboxing of what
is arguably the Big Daddy of Windows 8
tablets this is the windows 8 surface
pro this does not have the RT version we
saw just a few months ago this is
running a full-fledged version of
Windows 8 we got the 64 gigabyte model
here ready to be in box let's take it
out see how it performs alright so here
is the box for the surface pro looking
nearly identical to the RT version
except this guy's got those three
letters that make it much more capable
nothing else really exciting here it's
going to tell you what it includes but
of course we're gonna run through all of
that business all rights go ahead and
peel off the sticker and open er up
so the pricing of this guy is going to
be either $8.99 or $9.99 for 64 or 128
gigs and that is straight-up SSD we got
one more little tab to pull boom and
there is the surface pro the bundles do
not include the type or touch cover
those guys have to be bought extra we've
got ours from the arty burn so I'll take
a look at that in just a moment here is
the tablet itself let's go ahead and
pull it up it definitely feels thicker
then the arty version weighs just about
two pounds let's go ahead and get this
guy off fingerprinting and peel off the
plastic and very satisfying noise
alright so here is the surface pro all
out of the box and set up and already
laden with fingerprints so as I
mentioned it's gonna cost me they're
$8.99 or $9.99 depending which version
you get 64 or 128 though allegedly after
the OS takes about 30 gigs to install
all the surface applications alright so
the screen here we are looking at is ten
point six inches with a resolution of
1920 by 1080 in weighs just about two
pounds 42 kilowatt hour battery being
powered as I mentioned by Intel Core i5
with Intel's kind of capable HD 4000
graphics not going to play games on
their highest settings but it definitely
will do the job
four gigs of RAM - one megapixel sensors
one on the front and a twinsies on the
back that can shoot 720p video Wi-Fi
only right now 802 11 BGN Bluetooth 4.0
though is included with that port living
right there on the left hand side right
next to volume up and down and 3.5
millimeter headset jack on the other
side we've got DisplayPort got your
magnetic charging port which is also
where the Wacom pen is going to dock
there is your micro SD card slot this
whole thing is made of Microsoft's vapor
Matic material and feels really
incredible the build quite aptly amazing
they saw the original surface as we've
had this guy out of the box so you guys
couldn't see it while we set it up for
about five minutes are you feeling a
little bit of warmth in this area so I'm
guessing that's where the processor is
if you notice around the rim of the
surface pro you've got a little bit of
an air vent here using a full Intel Core
i5 trip and not the Tegra 3 found in the
RT I definitely need some air cooling it
and going on and there is the power and
lock button on the front if you've got a
capacitive Microsoft Home button that
also lives there before I get into the
operating system and all that kind of
goodness let me bring in the just
mentioned surface RT here they look like
identical brothers but it's a little bit
of difference if we look at them on top
of each other I can see the pro version
here has that venting Ram that I talked
about it talked about whereas the RT
does not the tell-tale sign that you are
using a surface tablet is that's pretty
awesome kickstand that just pops right
out the bundles does not include a type
cover or touch cover we've got one hand
deep from our surface RT unboxing and
this sort of snaps in very
satisfactorily with a loud clickety
Clank noise alright let me go ahead and
turn this guy on for you you've got this
guy all booted up and right off the back
defe tell a difference here in the
screen the 1080 screen looks very
different than the RT version
interestingly though the RT version did
count the full version of Microsoft
Office this guy just comes with a
I love Microsoft Office 365 which is a
little bit interesting
we've got 10-point multi-touch here as
opposed to the five that we had on the
RT go ahead and see what else we've got
the big difference here addition to that
screen of course the power is desktop
we've got a full-blown desktop here it's
not just sort of the pared down version
that we saw with previous versions of
the surface meaning the RT will go ahead
and go back to the modern UI here and
things here look pretty consistent what
we've seen with Windows 8
of course we'll put it through its paces
test it how we'll throw some games via
Steam on here and see how it performs
and anything else that you guys want to
see with our pretty comprehensive
surface pro review we'd love to hear
your thoughts on it right now though it
seems relatively impressive it certainly
seems iffy although time will definitely
tell how it performs right now things
are working and working as Microsoft
claims whether not this device has a
place as your PC or in your pantheon of
electronics that has yet to be seen this
is definitely a laptop replacement it
also has a tablet form factor so we're
going to use it as such and see how it
compares just for note here here is the
pen that we mentioned takes advantage of
Wacom technology it's got a bit of a
resistive tip and a resistive backing
you can use for an eraser and they'll
dock right at the charging station here
on the side but very easy for it to fall
off I'll show you what that looks like
there it is goes ahead and sticks right
there and if you are throwing this in a
bag or something though it's going to
get knocked off I would assume
relatively easily but it does work and
you also get a bit of a cursor when you
drag it over the screen you can see you
use it for selecting will test it though
and see all the other things that this
pen can do or can't do depending on what
the case might be anyway for now I am
John renter from techno buff let me show
