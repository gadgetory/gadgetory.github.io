TechnoBuffalo here's an unboxing of the
latest MacBook from Apple it's the
resurgence of the MacBook line this time
has lost a lot of weight and got a
Retina display I here's a box it's gonna
come and looks almost identical to an
iPad box I'm gonna be available in two
configurations either a $12.99 or a 15-9
gigabyte configuration or run through
the specs on both of those we're gonna
go ahead and use Senor stabby and cut
this plastic open I am unboxing the
$15.99 version both are gonna come with
8 gigabytes of RAM built-in both being
powered by Intel's Core M processor but
at different clock speeds it's gonna
depend whether you get a 1.1 or a 1.2
gigahertz today I which option you get
although you can bill to order both of
those up to 1.3 differences also can be
in storage either 256 or 512 SSD now
this one has 512 available in three
colors same colors you can get your
iPhone in either silver space grey or
gold I pick Space Gray used to love the
black plastic MacBooks back in the day
so hoping this is about the closest
thing I can get to that now we'll go
ahead and slide this up real fast
there it is looking very svelte and dark
go ahead and get this thing off
oh so satisfying boom incredibly fade
we'll talk about that in a real quick
second push all that off to the side
what we're gonna have in the box single
cable you're probably saying to yourself
so it doesn't look like a typical
optical cable and to you friend I will
say you are correct this is a USBC cable
which aside from the three point five
millimeter headset jack is the only port
that Apple is going to include and see
it's the same male end on both its
pretty long cable to push all that off
to the side we've got inside of here
presumably some Apple stickers MacBook
no fuse our Apple stickers like the
colors the sticker look like they match
the color of the MacBook you got all
that stuff off to the side here we've
got the charger which now just has that
USB C port on it if you think you can do
with USB C you can actually now charge
your laptop using an external charger so
if you something to charge your phone
battery
external battery pack you cannot charge
a computer with that does a lot of other
stuff we didn't video actually
explaining what USB see is I'll put that
in the link down below in case you want
to check it out it's got a 12 inch
Retina display that's 20 34 by 1440 did
they 226 PPI power in this guy
graphically is the Intel HD graphics
5300 go and open this sucker up there's
a lot of other differences here you'll
see almost immediately that off this
almost edge-to-edge keyboard the Apple
said they had to design a brand new
keyboard mechanism for this using a
butterfly mechanism essentially what
that's gonna translate to no real jiggle
at all in the keys but also not much
Thoreau I can definitely feel it as you
type but it's not a huge sort of
up-and-down motion again with other
Apple keyboards other keyboards in
general so each key down with its own
LEDs they're all are LED backlit a big
story here is this gigantic track by
using something new called force touch
doesn't click the keyboard doesn't
actually click use as a taptic engine
underneath sort of simulate a click and
there bill determined different you know
hard press or soft press and do
different things built into the
operating system so rounding out what
else we have here you've got a 480p
FaceTime camera you heard me correctly
480p FaceTime camera that's a real quick
tour of the laptop that looks pretty
nice you're in space Corey actually on
the left hand side that is your only
port you're going to have so love it or
hate it you're gonna have to live with a
single port although Apple is certainly
happy to sell you some adapters and
accessories to make more use out of that
if you want to plug in HDMI or VGA
whatever else it might be
so left-hand side as I mentioned USB see
coming around there's really not much
else here stay for some microphones and
your headphone for Apple hasn't quite
yet figured out how to get rid of that
presumably I guess that's probably the
next thing to go batteries are sort of
stacked on here to get more power so you
get batteries on batteries on batteries
try and get yourself some better battery
life of course we will test all this
mixed or here's how fit and light is
coming in at just a hair over 2 pounds
and its thinnest it's 0.35 centimeters
at its thickest it's 1.31 centimeters so
the MacBook I think creates kind of a
weird situation in Apple's lineup the
MacBook is all about thin and light
which used to be what the air was all
about so not sure what's gonna happen
apples
line up before comparison here we've got
a 11 inch MacBook Air which you know up
until today felt very thin and very
light you see a difference here between
those two and of course when you open
them up you can see difference on what
the bezels look like and non Retina
screen in the MacBook Air we've tested
the core and processor before we played
some like gaming on if I'm really
curious how it's gonna perform with some
lighter gaming some heavier gaming and
of course we will do a ton of testing
here this is also a complete fanless
design Apple was able to completely
shrink the motherboard to almost
relatively nothing also to make room for
more batteries so it should get a little
bit hot but not gonna sort of scorch
your business when you got this thing on
your lap anything you want to see
particular about the new MacBook let us
know make sure we cover it in our tests
give you a thumbs up we always
appreciate of course the big subscribe
button for latest TechnoBuffalo videos
until then I'm John Wright enger' I'll
see you guys next video bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
