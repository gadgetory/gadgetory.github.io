TechnoBuffalo here and welcome to
episode of ask the Buffalo show where I
sit on this couch relax and answer your
tech questions go ahead and jump right
in first one comes from at its jealous
who asked at John for lakers thoughts on
the new Xperia z5 premium with 4k screen
I just really want to see what a 4k
screen looks like I never saw that winch
of difference in a to k screen but I
appreciate the extra realistic you got
the extra pixels imagine the 4k screens
that you have to scale things because
things are going to be tiny you can see
like four pages worth of stuff I really
just want to see what its gonna look
like but i did get so many credit for
just like just doing like a big-time
flex I mean like what we can do porque
just drop the mic Kanye style and just
ramble something weird and walk off
stage so I want to reserve judgment but
I really do see the phone and see what
the z5 premium has to offer I've been
using the z4 tablet at home and i'm
really enjoying Sony's build style so I
trying to get my hands on really the
whole z5 family next one at saba 2s at
john for lakers planning to visit London
maybe Apple Store meet up mark 2 2011 I
went to London didn't meet up I think of
the Covent Garden apple store we had
like 25 people or so show up had a lot
of fun I would like to go back to London
it's a little tougher for me to travel
now with the baby another one on the way
in January but I would really like to do
it I love going to London I love getting
a chance to meet people so if you live
in the area and if you would come let me
know down below and maybe we'll try and
schedule something at SWA man to ask

original nes i love that thing is
probably reason i really love mario
maker so much we've been playing it an
early release press copy here i love
being out of play the original mario
levels be able to make mario three
levels i took great memories with that
console I really just love those old
school mario game has always had a soft
spot for those sort of 2d scrollers and
now I've got an infinite number of 2d
scroller so I kind of love it and I'm
really excited about it listen chances

chances are you got hair on your face
and I don't like to shave that you can
tell it's not my jam it's pain to go buy
razors I get expensive the folks at
Harry's have your cover their starter
kit just 15 bucks and includes all the
things you're going to need like a razor
three blades and your choice of the
hairy shaved cream or foam and gel I'm a
gel man feels a little more high tech
and it's added bonus you can get five
dollars off your first purchase I just
use our code techno super easy after use

worth of shaving for just ten bucks
