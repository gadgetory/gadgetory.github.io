TechnoBuffalo here with the big brother
of Sony's latest flagship the Xperia z2
this is the Xperia z2 tablet pack salt
on a feature Sony is really incredible
design it's a pretty nice 10-inch tablet
form factor it's go ahead unbox it and
take a first look here is the box for
the Xperia z2 I know that because it
says it right on the box if everybody
yells at me I'm pronouncing it wrong I
will say it for your benefit the Xperia
z2 done by the folks at so anyone to
know they are sponsors of the FIFA World
Cup in Brazil which the logo to me looks
like a kind of a guy with the comb-over
haircut doing a facepalm but that's just
me let's pull was out of the box to send
to us by the folks at Sony PR and looks
like we are not the first ones take a
look at this phone it's like it's been
manhandled or at least this tablet
rather let's go ahead and slide it out
of plastic looks like other folks have
used this this is really thin on first
impressions feels incredibly nice but
push it off to the side of a quick
second see what you'll get in the box
assuming yours will look a little more
organized and what we've got right here
they've got some material startup guides
and other miscellaneous paper sundries
you've got a charging cable which looks
to be microUSB and a wall work so it
doesn't matter how messy that is in the
box there's not much else in there here
is the tablet and I am shocked at how
light this thing feels it almost feels
like they forgot to put a battery in it
let's go ahead and whip off this plastic
ready boom you know that was a
satisfying whooshing noise it's gonna
find the power button turn it on and
I'll walk you through all the specs on
this guy weird to have a power button on
the left hand side so you are looking at
what I think is gonna be a very nice
10.1 inch TFT display with a 1920 by
1200 pixel resolution it's based on
Android 4.4 KitKat powering it is a 2.3
gigahertz Qualcomm quad-core processor
that's the audrina 330 there's also kind
of a waterproof and dustproof it's ip55
and ip57 ever life might get in the way
to keep it pretty safe I've got a cam
around the back 8.1 megapixel shooter
right there console of course your 1080
that's not the only 1080 thing on here
those are the front-facing two point two
megapixel camera should also mention
though that back one has a 16 megapixel
zoom which is pretty impressive thing
weighs 439 grams or 15.4 nine ounces so
it's really really light
I'm very rarely am i impressed with how
a tablet feels this thing I mean it
feels like it weighs absolutely nothing
so these build quality has just gotten
better and better and this looks be a
culmination of its really as you know
wider bezels but I don't mind that on
the side if you're holding it this is a
one of the best feeling Android tablets
really any tablet that I've held so hats
off to Sony I've given them some crap in
the past for their water protective
screens I thought they look washed out
but first impressions you look really
good here let's take a quick look at
what sony has done so first notice
they're all the apps there's how they're
showing you that pops it on the side you
go ahead and scroll through you can see
it we've done with the icons they're
kind of a bit unique there as well so
you can see you've got XP really gone
here you've got some games I've got some
other sort of miscellaneous Sony stuff
the Settings icon for example is
different I think they're telling me if
I pull in from the side I get access to
my settings which does look like I can
do this just showing different things
about my apps rather and not setting so
we'll go ahead and slide that out I'll
go ahead and go home we pull this down
right here
that's your notification tray is going
to live taking out about the left third
or two thirds of the device go ahead and
do a little pinch to zoom action here's
this is where I really think Sony did a
nice job they're big it's clear you know
exactly what it is it reminds me of
Garmin navigation system Serbs big it's
very clear what's going on here widgets
it's very clear that that is widgets if
you go back something I think that I
could give a tablet to my dad or someone
that's maybe not as tech savvy they
would understand very quickly apps
wallpapers themes it's really clear and
succinct and sometimes I feel like
Android gets complicated for just being
complicated sense doesn't really add
anything to the experience this one I
think they did a really really nice job
with it let's go ahead and jump into
settings see we're working with you so
you can see what settings look like they
skinned it a little bit with the white
background we'll go and go to about
tablet so running Android 4.4.2 kitkat
and I know it's KitKat because when I do
that I get this and I keep putting
that tells me that is KitKat and looks
like a delicious tasty KitKat status
here as well not you under your
multitasking that's also here
and they did some interesting things so
you also got some widgets that are going
to live down here that sort of pop up on
the screen so calculators always when I
like to show and I'll sort of live on
top but it's sort of like multitasking
you can have it there you can move it
move move it anywhere you want
type in your thing do your math and go
ahead and hand hit X I've got access to
Sony's proprietary movie store on here
but of course access to Google Play to
get all your movies and such that you
want video unlimited but overall looks
like a really nice tablet meketa to put
it through its paces and see how it
performs you guys wanna see anything
particular about this tablet let me know
if you get a chance to go to Sony store
or know someone's got it go pick this
thing up it is incredibly light I mean I
think feels like it weighs absolutely
nothing I'm excited to try and put it
through its paces other guys until next
