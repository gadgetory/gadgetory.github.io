go further how's it going guys I'm Aaron
Baker from TechnoBuffalo and I've got
another Windows Phone device here with
me the Samsung achieve odyssey is coming
to verizon and it's packing some pretty
killer specifications as well it's got
to meet specs like a 1.5 gigahertz
dual-core Snapdragon s4 CPU it's got a
4-inch WVGA display with 480 x 800
pixels and it's packing Windows Phone 8
so it's it a little bit more of a
condensed lighter form factor which
makes it great for carrying around it's
a great kind of mid-range to low
high-end offering on verizon wireless
you've got a lot of different features
4G LTE capabilities and it's finally
bringing some windows phone devices to
the verizon portfolio but let's take a
look and see what comes out of the box
you can see obviously it's running
Windows Phone 8 here and we've got the
t.o live tiles which with Windows Phone
8 you get a lot of different
customization choices here such as
settings will roll in and take a look at
the theme and you can see the background
we can change it from dark to light and
then from accent color you can change it
all around there are a lot of different
accent colors this time around things
like yellow and crimson and this bright
bright orange advertiser's give me a
verizon red which you can access by
going right there another great feature
of the verizon Windows Phone devices
datasets which like I said is exclusive
to those so lumia 822 and the TV Odyssey
are going to have this right now in the
8x actually I'm verizon as well see what
your applications are using the most
data and from there kind of figure out
your best use cases and how to use your
device other included applications out
of the box includes and Verizon
pre-installed things like my verizon
mobile NFL now now which is actually a
samsung application you can come in here
and see kind of a weather application /
kinda brings all your information into
one weather news things like that
another thing i like about this device
like i said very thin very light you've
got a power button on the right side
camera shortcut button and then a volume
rocker and a micro SD card slot on the
left with your camera on the back which
is 5 megapixels with 720p HD video
recording this is the Samsung achieve
odyssey i'm aaron baker from
