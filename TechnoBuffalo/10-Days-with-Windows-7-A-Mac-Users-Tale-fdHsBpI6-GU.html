you that follow my channel you know that
I'm exclusively am at guy it's just my
operating system of choice I've got an
imac for my primary computing and a
macbook for my mobile computing well for
the past 10 days i've been using Windows
7 exclusively and clandestinely on my
macbook and I want to give you my
impressions of a mac guy gone back to
Windows even for a short period of time
so much like the microsoft store was
heavily influenced by the apple store it
appears that windows seven was also
influenced by mac OS 10 so I've given a
very thorough overview of what windows 7
how to install it on a macbook LP is
done a great job and give me
demonstrations of windows seven this is
going to be me just talking about it
i'll put a link in the sidebar to all
the windows 7 related videos so you can
see how to install it or how to how it
works and just overall nuances but i
will say that I've been very impressed
with windows 7 up that it to be stable
reliable and surprisingly a very good
looking operating system I think the new
task bar across the bottom that sort of
has a doc like feel to it is very useful
one thing that I really do like about it
is similar to I guess what you would
call max expose like feature if you take
your amounts me drag it over one guy
cons across the bottom so you've got
Firefox open in two or three windows
there put your finger on the Firefox for
the mouse and the Firefox icon you get
all the windows for a line up there and
makes it nice and easy to sort of see
what you have open and a very elegant
refined manner which is something I'm
not used to saying for windows the doc
worked very well as far as pinning and
unpinning items to it I guess she called
the task manager or a taskbar as the
windows folks are calling it overall the
operation some has just been really
useful if found to be very stable when
some of the features that I really like
about it are the arrow features so the
arrow shake for example if you've got a
lot of windows open all you do is take
your mouse hold on to one of them shake
it back and forth and I'll sort of
minimize all the rest of the windows
except for the one that you were shaking
sort of clean up your desktop when the
other arrow features i found very useful
the feature called here oh snap
so if you take a window and you drag it
off to the right-hand side it'll
actually snap in place take up about
half of your monitor space you can take
another window pull it to the other side
of the monitor and I'll snap in place as
well the great way to have two windows
sort of showing is one was once without
having to manually resize it you can
also use a feature to take a window drag
it up to the top and windows 7 will make
it fullscreen the arrow glass is quite
nice as well something that sort of adds
a nice level of elegance the operating
system some of the figures that i'm
mentioning like the sort of expose light
feature in the taskbar things you're
only going to find on windows 7 home
premium and higher nothing you're going
to find on a netbook or Windows 7
starter edition just as a little bit of
mourning but the rest of the arrow
features you will find on the starter
edition except for the glass so overall
have actually been really happy with
windows 7 and I could see myself even
using windows 7 on a daily basis really
not going place my imac for my computing
and video editing but on the go maybe
one of those sort of lightweight ultra
low voltage processing 11 inch laptops
could be a great way to sort of have a
little more power than a netbook but not
as much as a full computer when you're
on the go I found windows 7 really just
be a very useful operating system its
first time that I've had been considered
using windows on a daily basis since
well since I switched to Mac about three
years ago so that was you know in the XP
days right before Vista was launched I
used vista as well I found it to be
clunky awkward unreliable and very crash
prone I tried quite hard to crash
windows 7 and really to no avail I'm
hoping programs like close things I went
through a full-on do those features are
trying to get a blue screen and get into
crash and I couldn't it works very well
and as much as I went into it not liking
windows and figuring that I was wasn't
gonna enjoy the experience I cannot have
been actually really enjoying it so I
think that's a testament to Microsoft
their design team and what they did with
windows so one asked you guys have you
tried windows seven what do you think of
it do you think it's an improvement over
Vista think it's
proven over OS 10 if your Mac user will
make you even consider using Windows 7
yeah there's been a lot of a lot of
trash shop use because you like math
doesn't mean you have to hate PC because
you like a PC does mean you have to hate
mac you know there can be a little bit
of overlap there some great periods to
know what you guys think leave a text or
video response for exclusive content
