to you by crashplan welcome back to
another episode of ask the Buffalo this
to show you could ask me jon rettinger
any question you've got from the wide
world of technology can't make sense of
all these mobile operating systems
phones coming out too quickly and don't
know which one's best for you not sure
what I do on the weekends this is the
place you can ask this ass to Buffalo
let's go and get started our first
question comes from Ron says hey John a
lot of people want to know about new
multiple Nexus devices is Samsung going
to make a Galaxy Nexus tours another
company like HTC or Sony alright so I
don't know the answer for certain but
this is just a rumor that I've heard so
if you come closer promise you no one's
listening I'll tell you rumor has it
that Motorola will be making the next
Nexus device ever since google acquired
motorola mobility we've all expected
that to finally happen we are those
still hearing rumors have been coming
around since before the nexus for they
will be seeing multiple Nexus devices
and perhaps that rumor meant that we're
going to see different sized devices so
I think we're going to see multiple neck
side by different manufacturers I'm
trying to think probably not I think
we're probably going to have one nexus
phone per generation I think Motorola's
going to be able to make that next one
so that helps answer your question so
our next question comes from k apple 21
i get this question almost every week
John do you think that apple will make
you read a display ipad mini yes
absolutely the mech retina display ipad
mini the question is always what
generation if i were a betting man i'm
known to play a game of poker every now
and then i would say the next generation
ipad mini the ipad mini 2 will have
retina display I'd expect to see that
sometime in the middle part of next year
I wouldn't expect much difference
upgraded processor probably look exactly
the same but feature that gorgeous pixel
rich retina spy we've come to love on
the current generation full-size iPads
and the current generation iphone
hopefully that helps answer question
next question comes from Gabriel John
we're in the world of carmen sandiego
Gabriel I don't know the last I heard
you changed your money to rupees good
luck I'm sure Brandon bestir asks my
upgrade is soon to can't decide between
the neck
for in the note to either I get the
latest version of Android or the biggest
screen on smartphones today John which
would you pick and which one's going to
be the most user-friendly so that is a
great question I personally would go for
the galaxy note 2 it for a few reasons
first I love that giant screen size and
second android phones can be routed and
you could put on a custom rom on an
android phone now it's certainly easiest
on a next device upgrade to the current
version of Android cuz google provides
it to you over the air you don't have to
worry about routing if you want to get a
little bit comfortable with the routing
phones though the galaxy note 2 put on a
custom rom i recommend the cyanogenmod
if you're not comfortable doing that it
could be a bit confusing and daunting
and scary for some folks I would still
go with the galaxy note 2 it's fast
enough it's running almost latest
version of Android and that giant screen
for me really really does it personally
the lack of LTE for me is a big deal
breaker on the Nexus 4 if that's not an
issue for you then you might want to
consider the nexus for its early to get
over the air upgrades nice and easily I
don't have to worry about it but for me
bigger screen faster data speeds it's
all I want in the galaxy note 2
hopefully that helped a trick question
